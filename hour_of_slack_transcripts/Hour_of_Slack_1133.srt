1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,520
If any wives are listening, will you please cover your ears tightly now so you can't hear me?

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,160
This is for husbands only.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,040
Hey, let me drink, will you? I need a drink.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:23,340
At the moment, his body needs its accustomed alcohol more than his bruises need medical treatment.

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,980
Yeah, yeah. Why?

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,300
Why?

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,420
Perhaps we'd have more m-

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,720
Shut up.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,360
Not yet.

10
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,000
Shut up.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,100
When?

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,180
I don't know.

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,020
Creep. You creep.

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,660
Well, that's all.

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,320
Yeah, I don't know.

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,920
We de-le-le-le-le-le-le-le-le-le-le-le-le-le-le-le-le-the start of our regularly scheduled program

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,100
In order to bring you a special report from...

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,080
Here is NBC News correspondent...

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,640
Good evening.

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,860
President Mishkin is about to address the nation.

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,320
His subject is mandate, and the White House has done nothing.

22
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,840
Mishkin is speaking from his house in...

23
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,460
He went there after flying from...

24
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,140
to welcome and decorate...

25
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,540
at the crisis aboard...

26
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,880
to postpone tonight's speech from last Thursday.

27
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,160
Now here is the president.

28
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,620
President Mishkin is speaking from his house in...

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,520
I'm ready now.

30
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,600
Everything's set?

31
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,080
Good.

32
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,660
Now, I'm going to inject 10 cc's of something else.

33
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,700
Here.

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:04,940
There.

35
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,180
Now cut away the dioramata.

36
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,300
Entirely?

37
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,580
Leave the brain exposed?

38
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,180
Yes, yes, I'll fix that.

39
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,860
That's an ugly name for what you're asking me to do.

40
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,620
I know.

41
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,780
But there's a better name for it, Ed.

42
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,700
The Self-Genius Power of...

43
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,880
You know what you're doing, don't you?

44
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,620
Yes, I do.

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,220
But you have a moral obligation to this sort of thing.

46
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:28,880
What?

47
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,000
What's that?

48
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:30,980
The monkey.

49
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,060
This is no monkey.

50
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,680
I've tried every way I can think of to get a human being to demonstrate on.

51
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,440
He's tried insane asylums, penitentiaries, everywhere.

52
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,860
No one will listen to me.

53
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,560
Well, in a way, you can't blame him.

54
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,040
Why?

55
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,320
Well, blessed with my so-called moral concept.

56
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,440
Perfect.

57
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,740
Let's begin.

58
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,200
On the second day, Bob appeared.

59
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,160
Yeah?

60
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,320
What about him?

61
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,480
His face was caked with the sweat and dust of travel.

62
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,060
Hi there.

63
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,760
Hmm?

64
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,580
Hmm.

65
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,900
I see.

66
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,100
Ah.

67
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,720
Here.

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,940
Is that so?

69
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,080
No.

70
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,420
Well?

71
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,560
Well?

72
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,580
Why did you tell me this story?

73
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,680
Because your name's not Bob.

74
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,900
Bob will come as sure as you're born.

75
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,960
Thanks to the launcher.

76
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,460
Launcher!

77
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,860
The story you have just heard...

78
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,460
is a copyrighted feature of the Lone Ranger Incorporated.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,660
The Lone Ranger Incorporated.

80
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,400
Things bother me, and I vent. I write it down.

81
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,080
What's your latest obsession?

82
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,700
Just the fact that people seem to be getting dumber and dumber.

83
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,360
You know, I mean, we have all this amazing technology, and yet...

84
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,280
computers have turned into basically four-figure wank machines.

85
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,340
The Internet was supposed to set us free, democratize us, but...

86
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,920
but all it's really given us is Howard Dean's aborted candidacy and...

87
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,200
24-hour day access to kiddie porn.

88
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,420
You know, people...

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,440
they don't...

90
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,220
they don't write anymore.

91
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,720
They blog.

92
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,360
Instead of talking, they text.

93
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,780
No punctuation, no grammar.

94
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,640
LOL this and LMFAO that.

95
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,620
You know, it just seems to me that it's just a bunch of stupid people

96
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,300
pseudo-communicating with a bunch of other stupid people

97
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,420
in a proto-language that resembles more what cavemen used to speak

98
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,220
than the King's English.

99
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,580
Many of our beloved friends are what you call...

100
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,580
conspiracy theorists.

101
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,320
Or conspiracy nuts.

102
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,500
Or a bunch of fucking fruitcakes.

103
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:40,760
But...

104
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,580
uh...

105
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,420
and many of the conspiracies that they...

106
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,960
talk about are quite real.

107
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,100
And have affected our lives.

108
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:47,740
The J...

109
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,740
the assassination of John Kennedy.

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,920
The crashed UFOs.

111
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,120
Pathetic.

112
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,520
Those are the kind of aliens that crash their goddamn saucers.

113
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,080
That's not the ones we're talking about.

114
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,720
The George Bush conspiracy.

115
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,760
The fashion conspiracy.

116
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,960
That's actually one of the bigger ones.

117
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:07,700
It...

118
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,040
But nothing is as huge and monstrous as the conspiracy.

119
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,040
And the

120
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,860
The...

121
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,680
The...

122
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,360
The...

123
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,840
The...

124
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,720
The...

125
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,420
The mighty conspiracy ass.

126
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,660
And, uh...

127
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,100
You know, most of us do have to go back to work on Monday.

128
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,040
But the important...

129
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,940
The thing that you can learn from the word of Bob

130
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:47,480
is how to kiss ass without ever letting the lips actually touch that butt cheek

131
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,000
of...

132
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,820
of the man.

133
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,860
If you know what I mean.

134
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,320
So friends, uh...

135
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,520
So we're trying to re...

136
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,100
lead a return to decadence, sure.

137
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,620
But not trendiness.

138
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,560
It's all been done.

139
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,200
Friends, this is not a joke.

140
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,080
It is a religion.

141
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,560
It's a living, breathing, fucking, and farting religion for today.

142
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,940
Not for some 2,000 year old guy who hasn't answered his telephone messages in years.

143
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,800
Actually, that sort of almost describes me.

144
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,200
But, uh...

145
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,040
We...

146
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,900
We don't have anything against Jesus.

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,920
In fact, uh...

148
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,860
Jesus is just alright with me.

149
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,720
It's...

150
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,920
His fan club.

151
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:47,800
weaknesses raised by nameless people

152
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,420
only the

153
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,760
it's

154
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,460
neighbors

155
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,080
only the

156
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,580
theirs

157
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,500
Hurt you, hurt you, Hob.

158
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,280
I sure am.

159
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,800
You've got it.

160
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,480
You're the pole, then.

161
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,100
Yes, that big, huge...

162
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,660
How big are you?

163
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,840
There's over five million square miles of me.

164
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,600
That's bigger than...

165
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:11,960
You're right.

166
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,100
Thick in some places.

167
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,820
17,000 feet high.

168
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,580
Didn't know that.

169
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,620
That's right, pole.

170
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,340
Oh, my...

171
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:17,960
That's right, Bob.

172
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,660
Wonderful, Bob.

173
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,060
Right?

174
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,760
Yes, pole.

175
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,020
Never rises on you, right?

176
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,360
Correct.

177
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,120
It's dark.

178
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,800
Trip, trip, tilt it at 23 and a half degrees, pole.

179
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,420
Pole, right?

180
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,520
Bob, Bob, Bob.

181
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,200
Not fit for human life?

182
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,200
Yes, yes, Bob.

183
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,320
I see, I see, Bob.

184
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:30,820
I see.

185
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,120
Really?

186
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,860
My ice, ice, Bob, Bob.

187
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,080
Act, act, er, er, er, er.

188
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,140
Four inches, four inches.

189
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,840
Why so little, Bob?

190
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,440
And I'm Bob.

191
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,480
And I'm very dry.

192
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,580
Less than seven inches.

193
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,840
Thick, thick, thick, thick, thick.

194
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,660
Heavy, heavy, heavy.

195
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:40,940
Thick.

196
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,620
Huge, huge.

197
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,660
Nobody, but Bob, really knows for sure.

198
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,020
Pole.

199
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:44,760
Okay.

200
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,100
I-7-11 says so.

201
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,580
Whoosh.

202
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,060
Pole.

203
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,860
Oh, okay.

204
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,980
Tell the boys and girls.

205
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,440
Okay.

206
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,500
That's my Bob, Bob.

207
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,900
Nice talking with you today, Bob.

208
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,360
Nice talking with you today, Bob.

209
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,700
Nice talking with you today.

210
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,160
Okay.

211
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,960
Good job.

212
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,660
Listen, man.

213
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,180
I mean, why can't I be cool?

214
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,960
Bob's from Texas, but he's really not.

215
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,780
Pardon me?

216
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,740
Bob, no, Bob is not from Texas.

217
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,300
No, no, no, Bob, Bob is not really from anywhere.

218
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,480
No, Bob, Bob, uh, is, he's from...

219
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Bob is everywhere.

220
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,100
Bob even kills his own show of need be.

221
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,900
Bob turns off the radio.

222
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,120
As you should have done by now, too.

223
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,520
I mean, what the hell are you up at this hour for?

224
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,260
What can you expect now?

225
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,280
What?

226
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,240
Oh, yeah.

227
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,400
They're trying to steal our show.

228
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,560
Yeah, they are.

229
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,640
Yeah.

230
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,700
You know, push a button, I'll do a thing, and then anything I want happens on the air.

231
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,340
Yeah, it's really a good, good way to do it.

232
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,280
And it's been that way for...

233
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,980
For, uh, a quarter century, and you were there at the beginning.

234
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,180
Yeah, you know, I think I was.

235
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,360
And my cat was there, too.

236
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,420
Yeah.

237
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,040
Back when I had a cat.

238
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,640
So, uh, what are we going to do tonight here?

239
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:20,360
We're going to celebrate the, uh, the 25th year of show, which happened on June, in June, I think on June 23rd or 5th.

240
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,920
Oh, man.

241
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,680
Well, can I press the cough button then?

242
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,440
Oh, no, no, no, man.

243
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,880
This is going to be a simple show.

244
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,180
This is a simple show, yeah.

245
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,640
He did it anyway and made him cough.

246
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,440
Oh, God.

247
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,720
But now we're at the new KPFA.

248
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,540
Oh, the Hunt.

249
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,380
It's much warmer than the other one.

250
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,140
We're at the other KPFA, at the old KPFA.

251
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,280
We're in just a little apartment with cold water and no shower.

252
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,180
And there was a shower there.

253
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,740
There should have been.

254
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,960
There should have been somebody's old, real bathroom in the middle of it.

255
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,780
That was a great...

256
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,080
I like that.

257
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,240
I think during emergencies, they'd go down and either use the shower and eat his ice cream

258
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,520
or go down to Mobius Rex's house and sit on his rotting Persian rug.

259
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,960
And wash themselves with a dirty towel.

260
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,000
Yo, Adrian.

261
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:02,820
Whoa.

262
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,140
So you remember how to do this?

263
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,040
Praise Bob.

264
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,180
Bob is fired.

265
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,600
Bob is fired.

266
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,400
Bob's fired.

267
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,520
He's been listening to us.

268
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,160
Bob does not have body light.

269
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,400
That's the good part.

270
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
The bad part is you now have his job.

271
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,920
It's the Church of Bob.

272
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,420
Bob's speaking to me.

273
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,120
Welcome to the Church of Doug.

274
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,180
Everyone's nice.

275
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:21,460
Bob showers everywhere.

276
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,460
Even subgeniuses have treated him with a smile.

277
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,420
Hey, Paul, that's the wrong name.

278
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,660
It's the Church of Doug now.

279
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,380
Yeah.

280
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,720
I get to do what I want.

281
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,540
It's on the Unmistakable Evidence Show.

282
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:35,160
The first thing I decree in my land is no Ivan Stang and no Philodromin ever again.

283
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,540
No Michael Pappi.

284
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:36,880
Ew.

285
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:37,800
Most of all.

286
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,060
His collar's just blathering on.

287
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,060
Oh, here's a relative newcomer to the show.

288
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,480
He's been on the show some of that 25 years.

289
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:47,800
Yeah.

290
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,800
Okay, we're tuning up for the show.

291
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,140
Okay, let's tune all the instruments.

292
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,880
Let's get ready for the real show to begin.

293
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,860
Every particle blasts.

294
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,240
Bob is fired.

295
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,620
Bob is fired?

296
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,980
Well, that's probably a good thing.

297
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,740
Bob is earth, wind, fire, and water.

298
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,000
I only have one light.

299
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,440
And miscellaneous organic compounds.

300
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,340
I'm gonna live as a Bob.

301
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,620
Bob cannot be delivered or eviscerated for your sins.

302
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,220
No, but he can have a bad ground to come a lot.

303
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,200
I'm kicking somebody's canteen.

304
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,900
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

305
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,320
I'm gonna reach under my bed here.

306
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,800
And that's no weird metaphor.

307
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,860
There actually is a metaphor.

308
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:26,860


309
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:26,860


310
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:26,860


311
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:26,860


312
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,060
I'm gonna cross-vent to a brain out of Ivan's stained heart.

313
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:30,960
Hi, honey.

314
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,480
I'm a blow-up doll.

315
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,620
And I've got a phylogenetic blow-up doll.

316
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,520
Hey, it's Holmes.

317
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,360
Hi, honey.

318
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:35,900
I'm Holmes.

319
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,800
Yeah, but you suck at blow-up phylogenetic dolls.

320
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,240
Fantastic, Holmes.

321
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,500
How the deuce do you deuce such fantastic blow-up dolls?

322
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,720
How the deuce are you?

323
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,000
Well, I, uh...

324
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,620
It's filled with air.

325
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,140
It's not real.

326
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,340
Well, it's, uh, large.

327
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,220
I'm inflatable.

328
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,800
It's a balloon, but it will suffice.

329
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,220
You used to listen to talk.

330
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,540
Poor Bob has commanded me to speak through...

331
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,180
Oh, go ahead.

332
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:53,740
You're mistaken.

333
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,780
Commander Bob speaks only through me.

334
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,760
Bob speaks through me.

335
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:56,980
No, no.

336
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,040
Bob only speaks through...

337
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,100
No, me.

338
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,640
No, me.

339
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,760
Speak through me.

340
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,240
Me.

341
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,440
All right.

342
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,320
We're not going to have a Bobfest at this early hour.

343
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,960
Bob has commanded me to...

344
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,020
Uh, well, well.

345
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,840
Pipe down, Bobbies.

346
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,820
No, no.

347
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,220
Bobbies are huge.

348
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,920
Look, Friday nights are 12 a.m.

349
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,600
And then also, uh...

350
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,640
My favorite time of day is always Friday nights at 12 a.m.

351
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,340
Like now.

352
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,040
Bob.

353
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,420
Oh, yeah.

354
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,380
It's so now.

355
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,240
It's happening.

356
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,380
It's so real.

357
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,060
It's cool.

358
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,280
Bob, Bob.

359
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,540
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

360
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,920
Ha ha ha.

361
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,600
Whoop!

362
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,160
Good guy.

363
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,060
Whoop!

364
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,500
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

365
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,540
And, of course, we don't want to not mention the Mongoloid show Saturday night if you want

366
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,220
to see most of us here.

367
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,640
Some of you.

368
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,060
We'll be there.

369
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,640
Some of you will be there.

370
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:40,660
Some of you will be there.

371
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,300
You'll see us live, live, live, live...

372
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,200
And we'll be wearing clothes.

373
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,540
...and wriggling on the wall...

374
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:45,680
Unlike tonight.

375
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,380
...unable to get away from the agony of your viewing of us.

376
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,680
We're doing the show totally naked.

377
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,160
That is what you'll see at the show.

378
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,840
It's...

379
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,760
Totally naked.

380
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,700
...in Call the Divider.

381
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,160
but it's actually a mongoloid concert.

382
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,320
So come and hear hours and hours

383
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,960
of rip-roaring mongoloid rock and roll

384
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,700
interspersed with feeble sallies

385
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,420
by feeble sally, myself,

386
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,880
and Reverend Dr. Ivan Stang

387
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,460
with various and sundry laundered guests

388
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,460
succeeding all expectations.

389
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,540
But not who.

390
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,240
But not you.

391
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,460
Not you, gee.

392
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,660
Gee.

393
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,100
Not ye.

394
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,080
You know, I'm really nervous

395
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,420
because I'm expecting all these special guests here

396
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,620
and I made all these pizzas.

397
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,560
Yeah, I know.

398
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,580
I don't understand.

399
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,880
This is a most stressful situation

400
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,540
because our special guests have not yet darkened our towels.

401
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,680
And we don't know what might have happened to them

402
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,300
en route to the event.

403
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,080
Anything.

404
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,440
Dark towels.

405
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,760
It might have been, you know.

406
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,220
Tonight's episode.

407
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,500
Tonight's episode.

408
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,680
Like, uh...

409
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,980
Of dark towels.

410
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,580
That movie, The Mist, you know.

411
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,660
They might have been gobbled up by a 40-foot praying mantis.

412
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,180
You'd never know.

413
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,660
Oh, wow.

414
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,700
Or dark towels.

415
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,500
This is where the sex goddess is.

416
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,600
I don't remember that scene.

417
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,880
The first known picture of sex goddesses.

418
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,940
The sex goddesses.

419
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,940
Yeah, that's a great classic picture, all right,

420
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,600
from the motion picture,

421
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,420
The Five Thousand Fingers of Dr. T.

422
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,220
Yes, very much.

423
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,620
Friends,

424
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,080
the sex goddesses are already here.

425
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,880
Dark towel, a subsidiary of poo water towel.

426
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,180
The sex goddesses are here,

427
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,820
and they are we and I.

428
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,420
We.

429
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,400
We, I.

430
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,440
Why?

431
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,260
And what that was, was puzzling evidence.

432
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,740
That was not the real show, no.

433
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,200
That was, uh, the, uh...

434
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,880
replacement show waiting for this show.

435
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,040
The puzzling evidence show with

436
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,640
Duggling Wevidence, the host,

437
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,460
Dropped or How,

438
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,400
Bagary Gabrogfran,

439
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,780
Bishclops Joey,

440
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,080
and that, uh, Mongoloidapalooza show they were referring to

441
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,480
isn't going to happen because it already did.

442
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,440
And so did the Baltimore subgenius devival

443
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,820
and the Amsterdam dam,

444
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,720
and we even just got back from

445
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,760
Stang Ranch, Texas,

446
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,600
where we did nothing.

447
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,460
We had a happy new year.

448
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,840
And a merry, very merry excesslessness, must this.

449
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,100
And, uh, Dave, the lonesome cowboy,

450
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,520
should be calling in soon.

451
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,440
But in the meantime, Princess Wee and I

452
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
have a song to share with you.

453
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:53,800
It's,

454
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,280
one of her favorites, uh, one of her favorite bands.

455
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,360
Actually, before we get into that,

456
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,940
I should plug a video by the Amino Acids

457
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,280
that you can check out.

458
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,620
Yes, the Amino Acids actually been working on a,

459
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,080
a sort of a feature film,

460
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,920
but, uh, that band is going to release it

461
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,160
in a series of shorts.

462
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,260
And part one, short pant, is out.

463
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,900
It's called The Beginning of the End.

464
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,160
And if you're on the, uh, intrawebs,

465
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,220
you can see it at something called

466
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,260
FatalPictures.com,

467
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,280
as in femme fatale.

468
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,060
It's spelled F-A-T-A-L-E Pictures.com.

469
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,880
I'll give that address again.

470
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,240
Because it is a suitably infabulous beginning

471
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,700
to what shall surely be declared

472
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,680
the full metal opus of our generation,

473
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,920
nay, our very home planet, I tell you.

474
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,660
For which rod-wielding manjack among you

475
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,140
can deny that with this,

476
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,840
seemingly Earth-produced short video,

477
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,680
we see revealed, as if from beneath a bloody blanket,

478
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,820
the very few char of brain-butchered mere humanity?

479
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,660
Answer yes!

480
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,440
Shall they not indeed fall like pins?

481
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,600
Row upon row of them until, as Gort told in prophecy,

482
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,060
they all end up on their heads?

483
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,760
Which is it, my friend?

484
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,600
Which shall it be?

485
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,020
And what of the bozo contingent?

486
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,060
Shall our path lead to slackness,

487
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,440
decimation, or slack enhancement?

488
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,020
We must needs choose our futures carefully,

489
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,740
and let this motion picture be a lesson to you,

490
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,520
which you can see at fatalepictures.com.

491
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:48,360
That's www.fatalepictures.com.

492
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,460
As if it said fatali, pictures, dot com.

493
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,040
The amino acids first movie,

494
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,360
and it really is a wonderful thing.

495
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,840
Oh, those aminos.

496
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,620
And so let's go to this,

497
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,740
what is this band, the MPE band, dot com?

498
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,420
Well, MPE band stands for Maggie Pearson EJ,

499
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,220
and they originate from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

500
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,520
and this is an originally Lambert, Hendrix, and Ross song.

501
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,140
Well, let's just play it.

502
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,920
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

503
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,360
Ba-dum, ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-dum.

504
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,120
Ba-dum, ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-dum.

505
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,800
Ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-dum.

506
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,680
Mindless told me

507
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:33,920
What?

508
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,340
That I was right out of my head,

509
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,480
the way he described it.

510
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:36,620
Huh?

511
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,820
He said I'd be better dead than live.

512
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,020
I didn't listen to his jive.

513
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,300
I knew all along

514
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,880
That he was all wrong.

515
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,060
And I knew that he thought

516
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,680
What?

517
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,320
I was crazy, but I'm not.

518
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:47,920
Oh no.

519
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,640
Oh no.

520
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,420
Oh no.

521
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:49,560
Oh no.

522
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,360
Mindless told me

523
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:50,620
What?

524
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,080
That I was right out of my head.

525
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,020
He said I need treatment.

526
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,500
Drugs?

527
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,360
But I'm not that easy.

528
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,540
Let he say.

529
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,560
I was a type that was most inclined.

530
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,680
Went out of his sight to be out of my mind.

531
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,100
And he thought I was nuts.

532
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,160
Makes no more ifs or ands or buts.

533
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,000
But she's really nuts, they say.

534
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,120
They say as a child I appeared a little bit wild

535
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,300
With all my crazy ideas.

536
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,120
But I knew what was happening.

537
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,480
I knew I was a genius.

538
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,120
What's so strange when you know that you're a wizard at three?

539
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,360
I knew that this was meant to be.

540
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:21,360


541
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,320
But I heard little children were supposedly dying.

542
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,140
That's what got into the vodka one night.

543
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,920
My parents got frantic, didn't know what to do.

544
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,120
But I saw some crazy scenes before I came to now.

545
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,540
Do you think I was crazy?

546
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,040
I may have been only three but I was swinging.

547
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,040
They all looked like angry young men.

548
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,000
They all looked like Anderson and Oswald Einstein.

549
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,020
So I should have a story if they just couldn't understand the idiomatic logic that went on

550
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,660
in my head.

551
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,340
I knew that I was crazy.

552
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:51,340


553
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:51,340


554
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:51,340


555
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:51,340


556
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:51,340


557
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:51,340


558
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:51,340


559
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,580
I had a brain that wasn't sane.

560
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,120
Oh, they used to laugh at me when I refused to ride in all the double-decker buses because

561
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,740
there was no driver on the top.

562
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:58,960
What?

563
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,160
No driver on the top?

564
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,920
This chick's twisted.

565
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,580
My analyst told me that I always threw it out of my head.

566
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,580
But I said to your doctor, I think that it's you instead because I got a thing that's unique

567
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,200
and new.

568
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,580
To prove it I'll have the last laugh on your cause instead of one head.

569
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,800
I've got two.

570
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,140
And you know two heads sound better than one.

571
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,320
Oh, I'm sorry.

572
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,300
And dear friends, that is our motto.

573
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,960
But at least for Princess We Are Doe and myself,

574
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,060
two heads are definitely better than one.

575
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,260
Because between the two of our heads, we've got maybe one brain cell.

576
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,340
She's got one half, and I have the matching half.

577
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,180
And it's fun that way, as long as we're together.

578
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,920
Apart, we're cripples, I guess.

579
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,160
All we can do is our jobs.

580
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,920
It's funny how we can do our jobs with only half a brain cell.

581
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,220
Most of the people around us only have half a brain.

582
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:14,660
But we stretch that half a brain cell as far as it'll go.

583
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,220
That's the way. That's the sub-demus way.

584
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,140
And we have some good news.

585
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,080
Despite this sort of dour music,

586
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,880
this is the soundtrack of Kenneth Anger's movie Lucifer Rising,

587
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,000
which I like to run in the background,

588
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,620
because it runs for 40 minutes straight without a break.

589
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,920
But Reverend Stang, I wasn't finished.

590
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,420
I had to tell everyone about the MPEband.com.

591
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,120
Oh, that's right.

592
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,800
And also that that's from their new live covers CD,

593
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,400
but they have many original CDs.

594
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,100
This is the first CD of theirs that's all covers.

595
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,600
That's Maggie Pierce and EJ is the name of the band.

596
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:01,480
They play out in Cleveland and hereabouts quite frequently.

597
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,920
They're one of those bands that's great,

598
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,920
has produced, self-produced a whole bunch of albums.

599
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,280
They play all the time and have a huge following,

600
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,480
but they don't have a record.

601
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,000
They never got in good with the conspiracy,

602
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,380
you might say.

603
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,780
Which may be good.

604
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,160
That may like with us,

605
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,860
that may mean that they'll have a productive multi-decade career.

606
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,980
And although,

607
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,280
you know,

608
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,380
sometimes I envy Britney Spears.

609
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,660
Why couldn't we have been thrust into stardom over this Bob thing?

610
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,400
So that by the time we were 26,

611
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,380
we could be burned out public meltdowns.

612
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,480
Uh, yes.

613
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,000
Probably because we couldn't keep a straight face.

614
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,000
Probably.

615
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,300
Um,

616
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,840
friends,

617
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:53,580
you can,

618
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,040
uh,

619
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,660
we have some good news about,

620
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:55,940
uh,

621
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,460
Reverend Magdalene's child custody case.

622
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,700
You may remember the bizarre situation in which a New York family court judge

623
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,540
took the child away from a family,

624
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,580
the Bevilacquas,

625
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,860
because they were subgeniuses.

626
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,860
That was the main reason.

627
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,280
Now,

628
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:13,520
of course,

629
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,700
that became laughable news on the internet.

630
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,220
And,

631
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,700
uh,

632
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,320
we're able to donate a little bit more to their,

633
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,320
uh,

634
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,040
case,

635
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:35,980
which recently turned out just fine because the dad who had the biological dad who had been given custody of this child because he was a Christian and not a subgenius.

636
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,160
Well,

637
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,720
that dad,

638
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,220
he kind of got busted driving the wrong way down a one way street,

639
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,640
drunk,

640
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,940
evading the cops,

641
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,380
hitting a wall and falling on the ground.

642
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


643
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


644
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


645
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


646
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


647
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


648
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


649
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


650
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


651
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


652
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


653
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


654
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


655
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


656
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


657
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


658
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


659
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


660
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


661
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


662
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


663
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,380


664
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,400
He was fleeing with a passenger on a school day.

665
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:52,920
Luckily,

666
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,200
the passenger was not the little boy whose custody is disputed.

667
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,320
Anyway,

668
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,980
the evil dad,

669
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,260
despite his religion is in jail for a year and Reverend Magdalene and,

670
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:05,740
uh,

671
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,320
her husband,

672
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,920
Jesus have the little boy combo back.

673
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,940
She also gave birth to a new little creature,

674
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,700
a little boy,

675
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,960
uh,

676
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,000
in December,

677
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,700
around the,

678
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,560
about the time that Jesus's son should be born,

679
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,520
who has been dubbed because,

680
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,100
well,

681
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,980
she broke her coccyx delivering this mighty child,

682
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,760
this mighty Uber squirt.

683
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,140
And thus the child is dubbed Reverend bone cracker.

684
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,400
And here we're here on hour of slack number 1133.

685
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,640
We welcome Reverend bone cracker into this world,

686
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,320
harsh though it may be.

687
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:47,980
Uh,

688
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:58,680
no doubt little Reverend bone cracker raised by subgeniuses will help make the world a brighter place for us by cracky.

689
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,060
Yeah.

690
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,200
And so,

691
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,580
well,

692
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,100
Dave still hasn't called up.

693
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,400
I'm not surprised.

694
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,300
He's,

695
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,360
he's a cowboy,

696
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,020
you know,

697
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,320
and luckily I've prepared some wonderful collages on the,

698
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:15,840
uh,

699
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,460
theme of the conspiracy.

700
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,120
Yes.

701
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,660
The conspiracy of the normal people,

702
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,180
uh,

703
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,860
which we will use into,

704
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,840
I'm going to let,

705
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,180
uh,

706
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,860
let some insanity build up.

707
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,660
The collages that follow are by Fernanda Nanda,

708
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:33,940
Lima,

709
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,900
and separately other ones by Reverend Norell Pref.

710
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,880
I think the first three are Lima.

711
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,160
And then after that,

712
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,340
it's some preffian and then,

713
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,640
and then some preaching.

714
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,620
From the Baltimore revival and Papa Joe Mama singing the sparse bangles banner.

715
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,320
And,

716
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:51,580
uh,

717
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,960
we'll be destroying intelligence right and left and Dr.

718
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,600
Howell preaching at the Atlanta,

719
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,140
uh,

720
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,700
the vival.

721
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,800
And so we proceed.

722
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,980
My bad part of me every night for such a long time.

723
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,240
My bad.

724
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:10,580
My bad.

725
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,760
Be fine.

726
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,420
Be strong.

727
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,520
My back.

728
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,840
He's gonna save my drink.

729
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,560
Station.

730
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,300
Hey,

731
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:20,640
Hey,

732
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,240
my bad.

733
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,520
You've been you got.

734
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,660
Suppose you were walking down the street one day,

735
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:29,880
gang,

736
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,620
and you heard this,

737
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:32,700
bet.

738
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,720
You've done to the guy who whistle and say,

739
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,600
I don't work.

740
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,580
You can have a chief.

741
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,080
Too bad.

742
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,640
For me.

743
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,500
And when strangers come around,

744
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,240
we think you're funny because these people think that the factory girl,

745
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,400
the more beautiful it is.

746
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,440
she is. That's right. Not only

747
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,220
pros, that different girls have

748
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,600
different ideas of what's best.

749
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:53,740
Hey!

750
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,140
Weed is not getting

751
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,160
work done. Weed is not getting

752
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,220
work done. Wasted, wasted.

753
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,980
Weed not been able. Wasted valuable

754
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,300
time. Weed wasted. Wasted

755
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,060
not been able. Weed wasted valuable

756
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,620
time. Endless time.

757
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,200
Time. On a constant stream.

758
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,200
Endless fail. Weed has failed.

759
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,220
Weed has failed. Failed to pull

760
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,220
our troops out of Iraq.

761
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,380
Done. Failed

762
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,220
the American people. Failed to pull

763
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,160
our troops out of Iraq. Cannot get that

764
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,240
job done. Weed failed to pull

765
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,160
our troops out of Iraq. Cannot get that

766
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,120
job done. And that's the worst

767
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,620
record in 20 years.

768
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,240
My record. An endless

769
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,500
an endless pose.

770
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,280
Weed a chip, chip, chip, chip.

771
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,680
And we don't. Cannot get

772
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,460
that job done.

773
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,780
We'll go left to right just the way we've introduced people.

774
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,620
Senator Clinton, what is something you don't know the answer to?

775
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,440
Well, everything.

776
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,240
If you can name one specific thing, one specific thing.

777
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,100
That's Senator Mike Revell.

778
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,740
Senator Obama.

779
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,200
I think we're going to have to have a serious

780
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,060
conversation about.

781
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,540
But Senator Don.

782
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
Senator Biden.

783
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:03,780
Policy.

784
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,240
Senator Clinton, you said there were a host of things

785
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,340
that you don't know the answers to.

786
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,120
Well. Senator Edwards.

787
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,300
I think we have an enormous struggle.

788
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,460
To try to restore the power in the country and the democracy

789
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,720
back to the big corporate interests and take it away from the American people.

790
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,640
Congressman Kucinich.

791
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,240
I wrestle with the president and the vice president based on lies.

792
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,180
Serious wrestling.

793
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:24,940
Is that okay?

794
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:32,020
We're not left wingers, nor are we right wingers.

795
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,540
Now, we may vote left wing or right wing or whatever, something like that.

796
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,940
Actually, as they get more extreme, they kind of start to meet at the other end.

797
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,580
Oddly enough, we're sort of in between.

798
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,320
We pick in the pockets of both of them, like in that famous old thing.

799
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,140
The thing is, and we love money.

800
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,500
Money, man, money's right down.

801
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,340
It's right up there with froth and almost as good as slack.

802
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:03,460
You can get slack without money, but money really helps.

803
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,740
But Bob is no communist.

804
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,480
He's a salesman.

805
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,440
It's there.

806
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,760
We don't want everybody to be equally poor.

807
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,580
We want everybody to be equally.

808
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,720
Rich, but without working.

809
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,780
Or without working on that bullshit.

810
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:25,900
And so our political party is called patriotic, psychotic and narco materialism.

811
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,500
We're psychotically patriotic for anything.

812
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:36,560
You know, I'm up for any program, but we're anarchists and yet we're materialists.

813
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:43,320
People used to ask Nemslo, who the hell do you think you are?

814
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,440
And Nemslo said, I don't have to think.

815
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,100
I'm Nemslo, king of all anarchists.

816
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,540
That's a true subgenius talking, friends.

817
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:10,460
Oh, say can you see during X days long fight.

818
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,760
The face of the world.

819
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:13,760


820
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:13,760


821
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:13,760


822
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:13,760


823
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:13,760


824
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,060
The face of all dogs.

825
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,240
If you stare at the sunlight.

826
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:26,000
Bright eyes and broad grin.

827
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,700
Train mark pipe at his chin.

828
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,180
Give subgenie slack.

829
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,780
As we fight off the normals.

830
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,300
And the Reagan.

831
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,680
Scram.

832
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,820
Look there.

833
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,900
Melted skin, bone and hair.

834
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:57,280
When fired from high saucers floating in air.

835
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:06,420
Oh, say does dog's pipe blow from smoke this direction.

836
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:13,320
So that we live free as birds.

837
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:13,760
Oh, say does dog's pipe blow from smoke this direction.

838
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,320
Oh, say does dog's pipe blow from smoke this direction.

839
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:15,320


840
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,500
Not like pig.

841
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,200
Human.

842
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,560
Terrors.

843
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,240
Oh, yes.

844
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,960
Yes, Dave.

845
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,100
Yes, right in the pig urine pen.

846
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,540
Like he said, the very final stanza.

847
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,740
Have you been watching the primary directions?

848
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,120
No.

849
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,200
Why not?

850
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:39,620
Dang.

851
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,300
You're supposed to be a credible witness for the defensibles.

852
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,740
That stuff will rot your ass.

853
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


854
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


855
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


856
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


857
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


858
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


859
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


860
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


861
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:43,740


862
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,560
You're brain, man.

863
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,160
Oh, I know.

864
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,240
That's the good part of it.

865
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,960
And when it starts oozing out.

866
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,400
But sometimes it makes you smell pretty bad.

867
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,240
Man, how can you take that, Dave?

868
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:59,600
Well, I, the first thing I noticed was they get what's called flaky gravitas, which is

869
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,000
a PR endorsed form of elucidation where the brows are furrowed, you know, so like somebody

870
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,460
plowed in there and they can plant the seeds of doubt.

871
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,320
And then they got the, they got the big old scowl going and stuff.

872
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:13,720
But they're not going to get the big old scowl going and stuff.

873
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:13,720


874
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:13,720


875
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:13,720


876
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,660
There's a smile underneath, like for kissing babies and stuff like that.

877
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:23,900
So I, I, I sauntered down to local party headquarters and I told them they could, you

878
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,700
know, I knew where they could find a lot of babies they could kiss.

879
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:32,340
And the guy treated like a common person.

880
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,540
You know, I don't understand.

881
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:40,620
There's just not the outreach to the normal citizenry there used to be.

882
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,260
Yeah.

883
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,700
I wonder why they're doing that.

884
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,900
I don't know why anyone doesn't think that is.

885
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,640
I, I don't get that either.

886
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,240
Really.

887
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,820
I don't have to think.

888
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,320
I'm Nenslo.

889
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,180
That's beyond thought, isn't it?

890
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:53,820
Yeah.

891
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,020
But then would a Nenslo-ish type character vote for a Huckabee?

892
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,940
It was such a whimsical sounding name just because it would make his brain go.

893
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,320
I heart Huckabee.

894
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
Hucka, Hucka, Hucka.

895
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,420
That was a good movie.

896
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:12,360
It also sounds like in swear words in Dutch, maybe.

897
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:22,980
Well, now Charleston, who vacated the station and took the good music with him, was feeling

898
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:29,700
sad about our future world, where he figured our president would be either Giuliani or

899
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,200
Huckabee and that made him sad.

900
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,500
Well.

901
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:42,340
Because it looks like the demarcated craps are going to run one of two unelected, un-elected,

902
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:42,340


903
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:47,640
electables, which, you know, that may be part of the plan.

904
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,520
If only no one voted at all, then what would happen?

905
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:58,060
Well, maybe that might be a better solution to the, well, it's not like a Mycroft Holmes

906
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:03,840
adventure or something, you know, or solutions 90% or otherwise, but, you know, we could

907
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,900
just set everybody on fire with a flame charge, maybe.

908
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,220
Well, you know, Princess, we, and I, as we were driving up here.

909
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:20,300
We were slowing down for the hidden speed cameras that dot our path these days in modern

910
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:20,840
America.

911
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,940
Is that true in that part of town?

912
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,120
There are a lot of them now.

913
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,380
Well, we found that out suddenly every day.

914
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:31,240
She started getting letters saying, here's a picture of you speeding and you owe us $100

915
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,080
in East Cleveland.

916
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:40,460
She had been driving 35 miles an hour through what was sort of secretly a 25 mile an hour

917
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:40,720
zone.

918
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,180
That's a lot of money.

919
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,880
It's a little bit more than $100 in East Cleveland, but there were robots that snap your picture

920
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,640
when you do that.

921
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,900
And then they wait a month or two or three to send you the bill.

922
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,320
So that you don't know that you've been doing wrong until you get about 10 of the bills

923
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,920
stacked up.

924
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:00,660
That's the horrible scenario that everybody has been predicting and now they're

925
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,060
doing it to we or have done it to others.

926
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,200
They're doing not only to we, but to us.

927
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,120
Big Brother is watching Big Brother watch you.

928
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:08,860
Yes.

929
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,620
From a toilet urinal.

930
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:10,700
You can't see it.

931
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:10,700


932
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:10,700


933
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:10,700


934
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:10,700


935
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:10,700


936
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:10,700


937
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:10,700


938
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:10,700


939
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:10,700


940
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:10,700


941
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,740
Right, exactly. It's frightening.

942
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,420
Some cities are more wired than others.

943
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,900
Cleveland, they probably can't watch you the minute you leave your house,

944
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,480
but as soon as you get onto a major thoroughfare, they can see you all the time.

945
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,040
Now, with some equipment, they can see inside your house, but that's expensive.

946
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,020
Want to stay cost-effective at all times, at least while the project's ongoing.

947
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,860
Right. So, you know, rather than investigate people like us,

948
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,660
they're going to be looking for marijuana smokers, for instance.

949
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,800
Now, if I were doing this synoptic spy ops, I'd be looking for bare-naked ladies.

950
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,360
I don't care who's having a puff now and then. I'm glad they do.

951
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:55,500
Well, they do, and you can see the pictures somewhere on Wired.com.

952
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:02,900
I think they collected together all the naked pictures spotted on Google Earth by FBI and other agencies.

953
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,160
I thought they went after moonshiners and pornographers.

954
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,640
Oh, moonshiners and pornographers?

955
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,140
Yeah.

956
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,380
That's when they used to have the real old-fashioned remotes back in the 1920s.

957
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:15,720
Oh.

958
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,700
Now they go after errorists.

959
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,380
Yeah, people who confuse themselves with the air they're breathing.

960
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:21,920
Yeah.

961
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,760
They get lost in the sauce sometimes.

962
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,480
Mistakers.

963
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,680
Blow me down.

964
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,840
Not slackers, but...

965
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,820
Mistakers.

966
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,440
Mistakers.

967
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,720
And not misgivers.

968
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:36,700
But if only they would take the misgivers, but only they give the mistakers.

969
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,840
100 years.

970
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,500
100 years in jail.

971
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:47,220
And sometimes it's misacronystically spelled M-I-S-S-E-D hyphen S-T-E-A-K-E-R.

972
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,940
It's like, you know, you missed out on the good stuff from being a mistaker.

973
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,440
I understand they have no misgivings about doing this either.

974
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:04,960
Now, we were speculating how a vandal or somebody not like us, but an antisocial person,

975
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,680
might want to vandalize those...

976
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,160
Robots that are everywhere.

977
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,720
One with large hair and big, beefy, man-like chests.

978
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,540
Well...

979
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,840
Go around and pound the machines, build them into the concrete.

980
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:21,860
Well, the prob is that every robot probably has another...

981
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,420
There's probably another camera watching that robot...

982
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:24,660
I know that.

983
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,420
...to see who comes up and vandalizes it, right?

984
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:32,900
Or the robot appears to only be looking at the traffic, you know, the speeders,

985
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,360
like Princess Wee going 26 in a 25.

986
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,760
But...

987
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,360
Uh...

988
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,500
But really, they may also have a wide-angle lens on the back of their heads,

989
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,940
so that when the criminal comes up to spray paint the front of it,

990
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,460
it films them from the front and the back.

991
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,860
Or a wide angle on the other three sides to cover the other 360 degrees,

992
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,440
so you're completely covered all the way around.

993
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:58,880
Right.

994
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:05,560
Because some of these lenses are over 180 degrees and will take up almost the entire concave space.

995
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,280
Indeed.

996
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:12,240
And you never know if the robot isn't just a silly-looking low-tech decoy,

997
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,440
where there's a real robot filming you and the law-breaking cars and the vandals

998
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,960
who are trying to stop the first decoy robot by spray painting black over the lens.

999
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,500
Not that anybody should do such a thing.

1000
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,520
No, we wouldn't counsel it.

1001
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:33,000
Because you would get caught unless you were to drive, like, scope it out first,

1002
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,860
then park around the block.

1003
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,920
Then put on the ski mask.

1004
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,480
Then stroll up.

1005
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:45,020
And you shouldn't vandalize with that spray paint can.

1006
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,160
But you'd...

1007
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,160
We've always said that.

1008
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:47,840
Now the bozo...

1009
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,500
You should never use...

1010
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,180
You should never...

1011
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,260
You should only vandalize your own property.

1012
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,300
Right.

1013
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,320
And there probably are some surveillance cameras on your own property,

1014
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,800
so go on out there, kids, and put on the bozo mask and enlighten the universe,

1015
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,720
but only do it within confines of your property taxes.

1016
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,020
Because if not, somebody is watching.

1017
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,460
And they're not even certain why they're watching you.

1018
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,660
That's the problem, isn't it?

1019
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,940
Key wrecked.

1020
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,680
But now I have friends who get off on being watched.

1021
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,880
They deliberately...

1022
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,840
Not only do they have their TV on all the time

1023
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,460
so that the man can watch while they're watching

1024
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,200
and see what they're watching,

1025
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,460
but also they turn on their webcam night and day

1026
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,600
so that the whole world can tune in

1027
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,240
because they want to be seen eating.

1028
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,720
And reading.

1029
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,000
And writing emails.

1030
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,460
Running out of toilet paper at the wrong time.

1031
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:41,680
And having sex.

1032
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,640
Especially having sex in front of the webcam.

1033
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:49,660
That is apparently the most fun for many young couples today.

1034
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,320
And old couples.

1035
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,480
What kind of perverse slant has it incised into our culture?

1036
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,360
I mean, think of all the millions and millions of people

1037
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,600
that are into elderly sex from a voyeuristic standpoint now.

1038
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,380
They just want to see 90-year-olds banging away on each other and stuff,

1039
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,000
making this...

1040
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,140
That's hard to see.

1041
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,700
Because it's weird, you know?

1042
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,680
It's different than,

1043
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,760
no, I've been watching 19, 24-year-olds going at it all day.

1044
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,800
It's boring.

1045
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,340
Two seniors, one cup is the latest internet fad video.

1046
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,300
One cup.

1047
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,940
Two seniors, one jug of Jenkum.

1048
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,180
One set of teeth.

1049
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,720
Or one set of uppers.

1050
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,300
Yeah.

1051
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,860
Well, I don't want to see what they're serving up.

1052
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,560
I do.

1053
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,740
Because I'm not...

1054
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,540
I'm not far from 90 years old myself.

1055
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,900
I mean, I'm only a little...

1056
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,280
Well, I'm more than halfway there.

1057
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,840
But you're also a cultural humpagrass.

1058
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,080
Meaning you'd like to...

1059
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,560
You know, if you heard people were diving out of windows in Spokane,

1060
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,520
you'd want to be, you know...

1061
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,140
Filming them.

1062
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,280
Something like that, yeah.

1063
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,820
Yeah, I'd want to film them.

1064
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,500
And sell the footage to CNN.

1065
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,660
Well, actually, first, as Puzzling Evidence put it,

1066
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,140
first you make the art,

1067
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,960
then you insure the art,

1068
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,660
then you burn the art up,

1069
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,060
then you collect the money on the art.

1070
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,300
And that's how you get around the art business.

1071
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,000
That is a brilliant...

1072
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,780
And the art conspiracy,

1073
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,480
which keeps good art in circus sideshows

1074
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,320
and bad art in the museums with big price tag.

1075
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,780
And also those big-gallon drums burning away.

1076
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,820
Oh, and they also keep the good art on college radio stations.

1077
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,040
Yeah, man.

1078
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,980
This is so much different.

1079
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:35,980


1080
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:35,980


1081
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:35,980


1082
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,740
It's so different than all the Huckabee stations

1083
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,500
that I've been bombasted to all week

1084
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,240
trying to figure out who's going to be the next criminal.

1085
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:47,500
Dave, that's where I think you're driving yourself nuts when you do that.

1086
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,380
I think I know I'm driving myself nuts when I do that

1087
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,140
because I begin arguing with appliances.

1088
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,460
So you're driving yourselves nuts.

1089
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,640
Right.

1090
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,840
All of my schizophrenic selves,

1091
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,840
all of my different multiphonic personalities

1092
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,680
begin arguing with appliances.

1093
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,540
But you still get the picture that it's not done.

1094
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,280
In 2008, it's arguing with your appliances.

1095
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,120
You can kick them, you can swear at them,

1096
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,240
but these complex philosophical questions

1097
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,300
just go right over their heads

1098
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,040
or the cooling element, whichever.

1099
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,040
Right.

1100
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,220
And who's really the servant?

1101
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,380
The appliance?

1102
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,920
Or are you the servant to the appliance?

1103
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,400
Well, we know that we, the consumer,

1104
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,980
is the product, which is the...

1105
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,580
Oh, never mind.

1106
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,880
Well, when Bob sells you something,

1107
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,360
it's not the product you're buying.

1108
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,600
It's Bob.

1109
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,060
It's Bob's sales job that you're buying.

1110
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,900
It's Bob's, sure, let's call them lies,

1111
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,380
that you're forking out that money for

1112
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,580
because it makes you feel good.

1113
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,400
It's not that owning the product is going to...

1114
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,560
It's not that the product's going to do that much for you.

1115
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,620
You probably won't even use it.

1116
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:01,800
But it'll remind you of that time you bought it from Bob.

1117
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,700
Don't you know?

1118
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,140
Yeah.

1119
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:05,840
That's what...

1120
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,420
One of them big kudos at the ecclesiastical primates

1121
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:13,200
was just letting people know that dishonesty was the truth.

1122
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,320
And that, well, I'm sure...

1123
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,180
And Bob is God.

1124
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,500
Well, we've already done that there.

1125
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,780
Bob is God and the politicians are all the devil.

1126
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,180
Individual devils or demons?

1127
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:23,480
All of them.

1128
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,680
Oh, they're all one big...

1129
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,080
Make a part of the devil.

1130
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,720
Well, yeah.

1131
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,260
Little devils that become one big devil

1132
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,260
when they transform at the end of time.

1133
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,540
In some...

1134
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,080
Steven Spielberg movie.

1135
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,940
You guys let me know when you're done talking about devils

1136
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:42,200
because I don't believe in those, so I can't...

1137
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,100
What about angels, Princess Wee?

1138
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,220
I don't believe in them either.

1139
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,340
But you are like an angel.

1140
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,140
Well, that's so sweet that people say that.

1141
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,760
You told me one time she was a devil in underpants

1142
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,180
as you were running, fleeing from a hatchet.

1143
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,380
That was a compliment.

1144
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,780
Well, to most poor po-buckers who live in the woods,

1145
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:04,440
when grandma's chasing you in underpants with a hatchet,

1146
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,340
it is a compliment.

1147
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,280
She's a devil in underpants!

1148
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:07,840
She loves you enough to want to kill you.

1149
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,080
You know, that kind of thing.

1150
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,980
At least that's the way I remember it.

1151
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,760
First slices I got.

1152
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,860
I still got scars from it.

1153
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,520
I don't think I'll ever grow out of it either.

1154
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,860
Like how orcas say that I balance my halo well on my horns,

1155
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,460
but I don't know what they're talking about.

1156
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,800
That's just balloon art.

1157
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:31,240
And she keeps her white feathery wings

1158
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,620
wrapped up with her long pointed tail.

1159
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,920
Well, that's the way it should be.

1160
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:41,240
I mean, a synesthetic stick, yeah, religion,

1161
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,660
or, um, not personages like the demi-urges.

1162
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,180
Is that a devil in your left pocket?

1163
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,420
Or are you just happy to see me?

1164
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,780
Or is that an angel in your right pocket?

1165
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,460
Or are you just a little flaccid this week?

1166
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:54,940
No.

1167
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,680
How come everybody assumes that the demonistic urge

1168
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,580
has to do with your lower chakras there?

1169
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,780
Well, I think the demonistic urge

1170
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:05,520
has to do with your lower chakras there.

1171
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,060
With your income.

1172
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,000
Oh.

1173
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,640
How much, you know, the more devil you got in you,

1174
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,060
the more you can make.

1175
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,640
The more angel you got in you,

1176
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,340
the more somebody else is going to make off of you.

1177
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:20,220
Well, that's a crappy way of...

1178
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:20,940
Yeah, I know.

1179
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:25,640
That's a stereotype way of viewing the world.

1180
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:30,000
Actually, it's not just all angel and devil.

1181
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,600
It's we're devil and we're angel

1182
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,420
and all sorts of things in between.

1183
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:34,920
Right.

1184
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:35,680
And the thing about this was,

1185
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,820
I was hoping for there were a bunch of things in between.

1186
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,260
You know, they wouldn't even have to have horns

1187
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,020
or wings or halos or anything like that.

1188
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,320
They could have stun guns

1189
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,980
and they could have like tiny bio...

1190
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:47,300
Taisers.

1191
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,180
Like they used to have in China and stuff,

1192
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,740
you know, big headdresses or...

1193
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,580
Nah, I don't know.

1194
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,340
Oh, what about the jammy devils

1195
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,480
that I was reading about today?

1196
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:57,520
It's a confection that's made in Terry Pratchett books.

1197
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,040
Jammy devils.

1198
00:45:59,140 --> 00:45:59,780
Mm-mm.

1199
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,080
Well, if you have had any experience with children,

1200
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,440
you know they're all far-extended

1201
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,500
and require an awful lot of water.

1202
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:05,500


1203
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:05,500


1204
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,040
And they're all splashing and stuff

1205
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,520
and you don't want to get involved with that.

1206
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,140
Well, every time somebody lets some...

1207
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,140
or breaks wind,

1208
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,240
a devil gets his horns.

1209
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,200
A blessed day it is indeed today.

1210
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,700
Yeah, and I think I smell a two-horner in this.

1211
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,740
A two-match special is what...

1212
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,140
That was the name of one of Brother Cleve's albums.

1213
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,460
Well, isn't that what Richie Valens said?

1214
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,040
At the Sodium Empire event last Global Tuesday,

1215
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:39,900
I think it was,

1216
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,580
when he was commenting about President Butch,

1217
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,340
Bush, not Richie Valens.

1218
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,780
What's his name from Venezuela?

1219
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,440
Caesar.

1220
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,740
The great Caesar was talking about the great Caesar

1221
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,700
and made a, you know, a whiffy thing like,

1222
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,160
ooh-ooh.

1223
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,680
But everybody in the media of America said

1224
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,380
he made a fart joke.

1225
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:04,580
And everybody in the Soviet pluralistic baboon area

1226
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,500
said, oh, well, I don't know.

1227
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,460
They said that he was saying he was the devil

1228
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,860
because he smelled like a fart.

1229
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,360
Infernal.

1230
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,180
Infernal.

1231
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,100
Sulfuric.

1232
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:13,760
Sulfuric.

1233
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,140
Belching up from the very bowels of the earth.

1234
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:24,560
The volcanic, the evil-smelling jenkum of Gaia.

1235
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:25,580
Yes?

1236
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,900
Well, every volcano that goes off,

1237
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,880
that's Gaia presenting the innocence

1238
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,020
with a big flow of jenkum.

1239
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,500
It's her flow.

1240
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:35,500


1241
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:35,500


1242
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:35,500


1243
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,960
Her jenkum flow.

1244
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:37,580
Yes.

1245
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:41,160
When the lava comes belching and bubbling up out.

1246
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,780
And the poisonous gas goes to the, you know,

1247
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:44,380
runs downhill.

1248
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,300
Why?

1249
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,160
Because the prisons are kept,

1250
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,620
the prisoners are kept in the basement

1251
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,100
and it wants to kill them first.

1252
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,480
Then it kills the janitors who live just above the basement.

1253
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,980
Then it finally kills the big man on the top of the hill.

1254
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,100
And they all end up on their heads,

1255
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:01,960
every one of them.

1256
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:02,320
Don't they?

1257
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,280
Yes, they do.

1258
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:03,780
Don't they?

1259
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,880
In every game,

1260
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,600
no matter who wins,

1261
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,580
they all end up on their heads,

1262
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,240
sooner or later.

1263
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,200
Yep.

1264
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,920
And the soles of their shoes are ignited

1265
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,780
by the starry vistas we choose to neglect.

1266
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,160
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1267
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:23,700
Yes, and neglect is such a wonderful thing to a subgenius.

1268
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:28,540
Why, it's the backbone of our slovenliness and uselessness.

1269
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,360
It's more than benignness.

1270
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,800
It's a form of creamy fulfillment.

1271
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:34,740
Dave, and you know,

1272
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:38,400
I'm proud of all the medals you've gotten for neglect

1273
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,300
in the church over the years at the Bobby Awards.

1274
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:43,840
I only got one.

1275
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,240
Well, see, we...

1276
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:47,340
We neglected to...

1277
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,020
That's right.

1278
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,560
We, with the accent on we...

1279
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,700
Yes, we neglected to give you the rest

1280
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,880
because we wanted the prize next year.

1281
00:48:55,020 --> 00:49:00,580
No, we was too bad and lazy to make the Bobby Award, you see.

1282
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,120
It's true.

1283
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:02,820
Well, we'll get around to those.

1284
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,560
When we finally mail out the Bobby,

1285
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:04,720
we'll get the Bobby Award.

1286
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,600
When we get the Bobby Award to the winners,

1287
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,060
they'll be getting three years' worth of them.

1288
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:10,360
Maybe when Joseph, Daddy of Jesus,

1289
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,040
makes his round two-its.

1290
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,140
That was a real relief

1291
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,460
because I thought you were going to say

1292
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:16,640
three years in the joint.

1293
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,440
Or, you know, that's three years with a joint or two.

1294
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,940
That would make me seem like...

1295
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,760
You know, ironically, I can't smoke those joints

1296
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,860
because they make my joints hurt.

1297
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,960
That sounds like a joke,

1298
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,360
but now that I'm old,

1299
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,160
I can't smoke those joints

1300
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,720
because it affects my joints.

1301
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,060
It affects my joints.

1302
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,340
It's my arthritis, you know, rheumatism.

1303
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,940
Don't you also have fits of cannibalism with that, too?

1304
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:45,720
And you want to...

1305
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,380
Well, no, that's the thing.

1306
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,340
That's the sad thing.

1307
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,000
Since I had to quit smoking joints,

1308
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,560
there's nothing to cure my cannibalism anymore.

1309
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,760
I had medical marijuana to cure cannibalism,

1310
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,100
and they took it away from me.

1311
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,840
Have you tried those...

1312
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,040
They call them pup chews.

1313
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:04,640
You get them out.

1314
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:04,760
They're not Walmart.

1315
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:08,380
Even Walmart pee tests you for cannibalism.

1316
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:09,440
Yep.

1317
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:10,900
It's a conspiracy.

1318
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,900
You know, and we sound like...

1319
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,260
When you say that word conspiracy,

1320
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,100
then you sound like a conspiracy...

1321
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:16,340
Coo!

1322
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,320
A crackpot!

1323
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,880
But how else are you going to find out what's in that pot

1324
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,900
but by cracking it?

1325
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:22,800
Really?

1326
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,180
You know, the conspiracy...

1327
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:27,100
Crack your knuckles if the pot makes your joints hurt.

1328
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,600
Or just crack open that pot

1329
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,140
and look at the secrets inside,

1330
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,840
the secret wisdom of all ages,

1331
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,240
which is that the mace...

1332
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,700
...sonic, satanic, Jewish conspiracy

1333
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,620
doesn't exist compared to the subgenius

1334
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,860
sex goddess conspiracy,

1335
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,900
which is so much bigger and more long-lasting.

1336
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,800
Because where theirs lasts a thousand years,

1337
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:53,140
ours will last a billion years, yes.

1338
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,300
Our own conspiracy.

1339
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,960
In the meantime, we have to live with them and it.

1340
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,300
Actually, not for much longer.

1341
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,080
Something's going to happen?

1342
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:04,520
Soon?

1343
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,460
Yes, the show's going to end in about seven minutes.

1344
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:08,500
Oh, seven minutes?

1345
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,760
Yes, and I'm going to start wrapping it up now

1346
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,700
because I have powerful rants to play at the very end.

1347
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:17,120
I thought you were going to start wrapping.

1348
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,540
Well, we've been wrapping and I'm going to wrap up.

1349
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,920
First, I should say that the Cleveland officers

1350
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,420
are listening to Hour of Slut number 1133,

1351
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:31,700
which is out of order, in a way,

1352
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,620
with all the others that will follow

1353
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,060
because...

1354
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,600
The Clevelanders are lucky enough to be

1355
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,520
in the confusing state of Ohio

1356
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,880
where we do this show.

1357
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,200
And for those who want information

1358
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,800
on why we do this show,

1359
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,480
it's the Church of the Subgenius.

1360
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,440
And you can learn about that

1361
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,840
and when the world ends

1362
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:54,600
at subgenius.com.

1363
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,360
Don't forget to give the address.

1364
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,260
Don't forget to give the phone number.

1365
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,880
You know, the prisoners out there

1366
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,080
who can't get on the internet

1367
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,240
do need the address.

1368
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,220
So I'm going to give it.

1369
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,060
And I'm going to give them time

1370
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:07,660
to get their pins ready

1371
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,080
to write this in blood.

1372
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,100
Right, I thought you said

1373
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,260
get their pants up.

1374
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,960
But at least you didn't say that.

1375
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,440
It's subgenius or Bob or Hour of Slut

1376
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,760
or Reverend Stag or Princess We

1377
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,780
or Relevant to Cabin Dave

1378
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,240
at post office box...

1379
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,080
Oh, counselor.

1380
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,120
Counselor.

1381
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,320
No, be quiet, Dave.

1382
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,000
I'm giving you...

1383
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,800
You're a lovely wife,

1384
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,060
a question counselor.

1385
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,360
No.

1386
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:33,040
It's box 181417.

1387
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,400
Cleveland Heights.

1388
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,400
Not Cleveland Buffs.

1389
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,000
Bluffs.

1390
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,240
But Cleveland Heights

1391
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,460
in the Buff.

1392
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,320
Ohio.

1393
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:45,500
44118.

1394
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,460
Naked Cleveland Heights?

1395
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:49,460
Cleveland what?

1396
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,240
Cleveland Bluffs.

1397
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,260
And now, Dave,

1398
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,900
I want to thank you for calling in.

1399
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,300
I would like to thank you

1400
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,120
for allegedly writing down

1401
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,260
the last few comments.

1402
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,000
And now we're going to go back

1403
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,140
into the mind of Norrell.

1404
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,440
George Bush

1405
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,280
and Dr. Howell

1406
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:07,940
in Amsterdam.

1407
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:09,740
And finally,

1408
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:12,200
a little end of the lost horizon

1409
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,360
and goodbye.

1410
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,640
Long may it reign.

1411
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:16,600
Broad for your life.

1412
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:17,980
Central intelligence

1413
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:18,940
had been destroyed.

1414
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,020
Terrible blunder.

1415
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,280
The CIA must be full

1416
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,140
of those agents.

1417
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:24,960
And I'm sort of reading backwards here.

1418
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,240
What do you think?

1419
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:28,440
It's also just plain stupid.

1420
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,740
People want to see it.

1421
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,440
People want to see it

1422
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,220
and need to see it.

1423
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,080
There's torture on those tapes.

1424
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:33,920
Really bad.

1425
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,360
They have choices.

1426
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:34,980
They have choices.

1427
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:35,960
I'm mystified.

1428
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:36,440
Whatever.

1429
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,400
Destroying intelligence.

1430
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,420
You don't have money to fund the war.

1431
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:42,080
You don't have money to fund the war.

1432
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,040
But you're going to spend it.

1433
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:43,940
You're going to grow up.

1434
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,040
But you're going to spend it.

1435
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:45,920
People grow up.

1436
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,740
You can get enough kids

1437
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:47,900
to grow old enough

1438
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:48,780
to get enough kids

1439
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:49,880
to grow old enough

1440
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,960
to get their heads blown off.

1441
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:55,320
For the president's abuse of it.

1442
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,260
That Bush just trusted.

1443
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,000
That Bush just trusted.

1444
00:53:59,020 --> 00:53:59,300
In Iraq.

1445
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,600
In the United States.

1446
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,260
In Iraq.

1447
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,400
In the United States.

1448
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,320
I am purged by God.

1449
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,600
The white override is veto.

1450
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,520
America's override is veto.

1451
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,780
America's override is veto.

1452
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:14,260
The president's desire to deny it to them.

1453
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,200
Bush just iced more things up.

1454
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,800
Slack is what the subgenius must have.

1455
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,680
Slack is the soft voice.

1456
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,900
Slack the luminous cloud.

1457
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,120
We in ourselves rejoice.

1458
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,260
And although you may laugh,

1459
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,640
snicker and titter at subgeniuses

1460
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,540
for thirsting after slack,

1461
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,260
while a dying world collapses around them,

1462
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,840
the subgeniuses may have the last snicker

1463
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,520
because it will ultimately be found out

1464
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,580
that you also need slack.

1465
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:47,460
You were born with original slack.

1466
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,020
But the conspiracy,

1467
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,000
which is what wants you to work for a living,

1468
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,840
wants to take away your original slack

1469
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,260
and sell you in its place false slack

1470
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:01,100
for which you must labor at meaningless toil

1471
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,300
interspersed by grief.

1472
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,980
And perhaps even enjoyable patches of meaningless leisure.

1473
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,320
Yes, that's how it is.

1474
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,160
Because the conspiracy Reverend Stang was talking about

1475
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,680
is, as he pointed out,

1476
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,700
not just the John F. Kennedy conspiracy,

1477
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,200
the 9-11 conspiracy,

1478
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:20,200
or even the Sofa Bed conspiracy,

1479
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,640
if anyone can remember that.

1480
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,120
That was an actual store during the 1970s in the US.

1481
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,980
And one of the worst conspiracies too,

1482
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,700
not that I have time to go into it.

1483
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,340
None of these specifically, but all together,

1484
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,280
for they all have a story.

1485
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:37,240
All mix and meld into one overarching super-conspiracy.

1486
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,480
The word conspiracy comes from the Latin com,

1487
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:41,200
meaning with,

1488
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,340
and spheros, to breathe,

1489
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:46,700
as in inspiration one takes in a breath.

1490
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,420
In a conspiracy, all breathe together.

1491
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,440
They may not plot together,

1492
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,200
but they breathe together,

1493
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,140
because they think together alike

1494
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,320
as one giant, crawling hive mind,

1495
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,640
or to speak more narrowly, vacuity of mind.

1496
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,300
An organism which operates autonomically,

1497
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:10,480
and has automatic checks to cut down any stalks

1498
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,820
that may have the temerity to grow taller

1499
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:15,680
than any others of the field.

1500
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,600
And so this conspiracy was detected by J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1501
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,460
and it is we, the subgeniuses,

1502
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:27,180
who eternally struggle to elude its blandishments,

1503
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,780
and concentrate only on ours.

1504
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,840
Now, I'll also say that many people

1505
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,280
in the world,

1506
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,600
insist that we tell them,

1507
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,820
they insist that we reassure them,

1508
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,220
that what we do is all a joke.

1509
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,940
And we are happy to do so.

1510
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,880
It is all a joke.

1511
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,500
It is a form of satire.

1512
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,800
But satire can only work

1513
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,660
if it is about something.

1514
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,500
It must be trenchant.

1515
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,780
Because the form of something is humorous,

1516
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,420
it doesn't mean that the substance

1517
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,900
of what is introduced and discussed

1518
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,880
is not to be considered,

1519
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,180
is negligible, is inconsiderable.

1520
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:01,980
Rather,

1521
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,840
it is something which supports

1522
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,880
the entire tottering structure of satire,

1523
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,060
humor, and saleable items and commodities.

1524
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,820
Therefore, there is something to it.

1525
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,220
And that thing brought us,

1526
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,660
me and my friends, them,

1527
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:18,780
here tonight,

1528
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,520
to participate in this

1529
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,460
seventh annual Amsterdam Subgenius Frog Cup.

1530
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,000
It came to me in a vision.

1531
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,140
Long, long ago.

1532
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:37,160
I saw all the nations strengthening,

1533
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,900
not in wisdom,

1534
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,040
but in the vulgar passions

1535
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,940
and the will to destroy.

1536
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,540
I saw the machine power multiplying

1537
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:49,980
until a single weaponed man

1538
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:53,280
might match a whole army.

1539
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:56,660
I foresaw a time

1540
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,980
when man, exulting with his might,

1541
00:57:59,000 --> 00:57:59,920
and the technique of murder

1542
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,320
would rage so hotly over the world

1543
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,340
that every book, every treasure,

1544
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,440
would be doomed to destruction.

1545
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:14,880
Look at the world today.

1546
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,540
Is there anything more pitiful?

1547
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,920
What madness there is.

1548
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,160
What blindness.

1549
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,140
What unintelligent leadership.

1550
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,640
A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity,

1551
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,360
crashing headlong against each other,

1552
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:38,780
propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality.

1553
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,580
The time must come, my friend,

1554
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,120
when this orgy will spend itself.

1555
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:53,660
When brutality and the lust for power

1556
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:57,640
must perish by its own sword.

1557
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,540
When the world is destroyed,

1558
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:03,540


1559
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:03,540


1560
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:04,980
it will be destroyed.

1561
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:05,800
When the world is destroyed,

1562
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,160
it will be destroyed.

1563
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,360
And praise Bob.

1564
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,460
Dear friends.

1565
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,460
I could walk out as a bum

1566
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,180
and drop my diving wheel.

1567
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,420
This afternoon,

1568
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,740
Wang Mei will be at the library

1569
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,140
to borrow a few things.

1570
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:27,680
That will be about 12.30?

1571
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:28,220
Yeah.

1572
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:28,940
10.30?

1573
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:29,520
That's right.

1574
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,080
Yes?

1575
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:30,580
Yeah.

1576
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:31,380
He said,

1577
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,940
then call on the Mason-ass-face.

1578
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,160
My image has just changed.

1579
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,320
The man with the scab-like,

1580
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,240
war-gold mind.

1581
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,320
Why did you wait in boots

1582
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:38,300
to order to get a clean clean?

1583
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:38,960
Well,

1584
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:40,900
we saw him at the red-eyed

1585
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,560
in Sly the Lay with the triads

1586
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:43,700
here with an ad-gib and a door.

1587
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:44,820
How did you know it?

1588
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:46,140
We saw Mr. Hentix

1589
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,300
that was standing his down

1590
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,060
slumped his chest.

1591
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:48,660
Dart, dart.

1592
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,460
Dart, dart.

1593
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,480
Did he through the window?

1594
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:51,760
No, through the window.

1595
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:52,480
Touch anything?

1596
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:53,300
No.

1597
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:53,700
Dart.

1598
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:54,260
Ah.

1599
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:54,880
Go ahead.

1600
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,640
Well, he went local.

1601
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,140
Yes.

1602
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:57,820
The range.

1603
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:58,620
Mm-hmm.

1604
00:59:58,660 --> 00:59:58,980
Yes.

1605
00:59:59,080 --> 00:59:59,660
Through the window?

1606
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:00,340
No.

1607
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,180
Through the window.

1608
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1609
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:04,600
.

1610
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:04,600


1611
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:08,620
.

1612
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:08,900
.

1613
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:09,120
.

1614
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:09,300
.

1615
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,000
.

1616
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,480
.

1617
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:11,540
.

1618
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:12,700
.

1619
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:12,720
.

1620
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:12,760
.

1621
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:12,780
.

1622
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:12,840
.

1623
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:13,040
.

1624
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:13,040


1625
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:13,080
.

1626
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:13,080


1627
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:13,080


1628
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:13,200
.

1629
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:13,320
.

1630
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:13,320
