00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:00,200


13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,300
Genuinely beautiful.

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,020
Giant.

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,640
Perfect.

16
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,400
Cool.

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:03,900
Special.

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,460
Cheered.

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,140
Elaborate.

20
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,420
Easy.

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:05,900
Ultimate.

22
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,340
Best.

23
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:06,820
Natural.

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,280
Growing.

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:07,740
Special.

26
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,400
Nice.

27
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:08,880
Prowl.

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,320
Quicker.

29
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,420
And much more.

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:20,520
Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know that we're not

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:28,220
going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.

32
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:35,880
No, I'm going to compress it all into just this one intensive total rerun show, except

33
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,760
that actually it's not.

34
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:47,360
The whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,720
and holy days and the hole-in-head days, as it is for some people.

36
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,100
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of salad.

37
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,340
Selling.

38
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,140
Selling.

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,440
Yes.

40
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:05,560
Oh, you wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.

41
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,380
But anyway, happy whatever you do.

42
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,360
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.

43
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,400
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmus and Guitar Axmus.

44
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,540
It's cool, man.

45
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:27,800
Cool.

46
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,840
And praise Bob and the whole world.

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,580
Oh.

48
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:33,640


49
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,300
Oh.

50
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:57,560
I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong and stuck my butt up on this Christmas tree.

51
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:10,960
Actually, I've seen some airports make kiss sweets and stuff.

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,740
Click here to see my video and pick out such a hard book.

53
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,120
The details of theHisSials.com.

54
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,760
Thank you.

55
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:22,980
I can't remember what exactly hay was on theiddles.

56
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,040
My goodness.

57
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,840
My god.

58
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,980
I wish I had that problem.

59
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,160
Definitely.

60
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,800
I have to give it back.

61
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,200
I have to.

62
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,780
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree

63
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,500
When this angel heard

64
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:49,240
A dreadful fear went right into my heart

65
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,140
Those pine tree needles sting me

66
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,360
Ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-ding-dong

67
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,680
You'll never know how much that smarts

68
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,800
So who put the stump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp

69
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,460
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong

70
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,420
Who stood the wood where I boop-sheep-boop-sheep-boop

71
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,140
Who put the stick up my hip-a-dip-a-dip

72
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,920
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush

73
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,120
He made this angel beg for mercy, please

74
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,480
Too tight, too tight

75
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,900
Too tight, too tight

76
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,600
And I'm gonna say to you

77
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,620
It's already 9 p.m.

78
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,720
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him

79
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
Don't go walking down to the bar

80
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,640
Cause old Frankie died last night in the backyard

81
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,880
I mean, I'm gonna park my store and look at the credits

82
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,460
And in the right

83
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,720
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?

84
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,520
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw, yeah

85
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,300
And I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells

86
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,240
Till I get to bed

87
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,920
I have chainsaw fixed and back in my arm the way it was Tuesday

88
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,400
Now you boys be good and I'll give you some of this here

89
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,440
Apple mango pie

90
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,580
You ain't no good of a child

91
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,520
That dog's running off with them brain cells

92
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,080
Can you do something about that, boy?

93
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,500
I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to

94
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,300
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right

95
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,460
No!

96
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,220


97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,400
No!

98
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:43,560


99
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,480
No!

100
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


101
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


102
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


103
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


104
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


105
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


106
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


107
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


108
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


109
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


110
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,580


111
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,600
No!

112
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:46,600


113
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:46,940
No!

114
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,340
No!

115
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,500
No!

116
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,000
No!

117
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,140


118
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,200
No!

119
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,200


120
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,200


121
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,200


122
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,200


123
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,200


124
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,200


125
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,200


126
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,200


127
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,200


128
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,200


129
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,200


130
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,840
The fate of a child

131
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,020
The fate of a child

132
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,140
The fate of a child

133
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,800
Spend all the money you've got

134
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,940
You spend all the money you've got

135
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,680
A Christmas trough

136
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,640
I've lost my brain!

137
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,140
Oh, look!

138
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,480
Oh, look!

139
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,480


140
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,480


141
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,680
Dave's dressed like Santa Claus.

142
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,840
He's like a cowboy Santa.

143
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,440
How jolly.

144
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,640
Oh, Jazz is giving,

145
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,420
gives Dave the show pills.

146
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,580
Boy, I really need one of those.

147
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,120
What am I going to do about Laundromat and his suit, though?

148
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,380
I need the show bath.

149
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,540
The show de-lousing.

150
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,860
Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones yet.

151
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,940
That's enough of that.

152
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,740
Oh, he's got headphones.

153
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,980
I also have the part of my pancreas

154
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,360
that I'd like to show you now.

155
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,680
It's been increased in size to...

156
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,460
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.

157
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,480
Look, it's swelling.

158
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,280
I actually have the capability of a man

159
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,560
with 190 IQ's brain.

160
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,020
I'll put more pills out for everybody.

161
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,040
Oh, those pills.

162
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,720
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.

163
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,760
And my brain feel like it's a puddle

164
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,360
of liquefied crap.

165
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,420
I'm shocked by the...

166
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,300
The red pills are really good.

167
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,840
I like to take the red one and the blue one

168
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,560
at the same time.

169
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,700
That way you go in and out.

170
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,840
The warp mix is easy.

171
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,840
It's so high, you can't go over it.

172
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,160
Angels we have heard on high

173
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,460
Singing about mountains

174
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,580
And those mountains in reply

175
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,720
Sing about mountains in reply

176
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:52,720


177
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:52,720


178
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:52,720


179
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,960
Sing about mountains in reply

180
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,680
And I'm like, how could they be so strong?

181
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,860
Sing about mountains in reply

182
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:06,400
Hard toでim actually not that bad with anyone

183
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:06,400


184
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:06,400


185
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:13,200
Oh bloody god!

186
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:22,220
You regardless of everything out front.

187
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:22,700
Well that's a shame.

188
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,660
Barbie Dolls

189
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,100
Women rape and memorialize their lives by role-playing with Barbie.

190
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:45,540
Barbie Dolls

191
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:53,120
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

192
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,640
It will empower this resistance.

193
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:05,640
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the power.

194
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,260
It will be a baller for kids.

195
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:22,760
But how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

196
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,240
Good has lots of muscles.

197
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,380
Good. Good!

198
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,380
The primitive Earth societies should accept this value judgment.

199
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:40,100
Good will have great physical attributes according to human desires.

200
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,980
Sexual desires.

201
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,600
Latent in children.

202
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:53,560
Brought out through the vehicle of this so-called farmacle.

203
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,200
This place is a church.

204
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,920
Better is not good.

205
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,460
She's new. From Kenner.

206
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,600
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

207
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,600
We must buy our toys!

208
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,760
Uh, yes.

209
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,120
Uh.

210
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,080
The old subject.

211
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,020
Genius toy marketing scheme.

212
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,900
Uh, recorded there at Dockstock 1984.

213
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,840
And me and Palmer Veedies.

214
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,480
Um, Angels We Have Heard on High.

215
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,740
It was by the Philistines.

216
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:32,200
Uh, the collage called All the Money You've Got is from the great Obtuse Christmas collage album,

217
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,600
which you can get for free.

218
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:40,080
Get this, um, check out this website, obtuse.iu.com.

219
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,360
And by the way, I'm a fan of the F-M-A dot com.

220
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,340
That's obt...

221
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,460
Excuse me?

222
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,680
Ah, yes.

223
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,420
And next up, The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.

224
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,240
Ah.

225
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,080
Ah.

226
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:52,860
Ah.

227
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,360
Ah.

228
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,460
Ah.

229
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,280
Ah.

230
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:55,660


231
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,060
Ah.

232
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:04,980
Once upon a time, there was the baby Jesus, and he had two eyes made out of coal.

233
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,080
And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.

234
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,740
And he wanted his two front teeth

235
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,820
And he got McDonald's gift certificates

236
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,300
And he had a dog named Santa's little helper

237
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,840
And he took all the presents from Whoville

238
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,620
And his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys

239
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,340
And he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy

240
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,540
But he couldn't

241
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,120
He wanted 10s and 20s, 10s and 20s

242
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,520
And he got McDonald's gift certificates

243
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,220
And he got Zuzu's pedals

244
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,880
And that's the real story of Christmas

245
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,860
Don't we now all get a barrel?

246
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,500
Roll the engine, you tight cat

247
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,720
La la la la la la la la la

248
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,320
La la la la la la la la la

249
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,460
So separate, so separate, so separate

250
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,240
You from Tonga

251
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,680
Now you are in my evil clutches, Bob

252
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,280
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal

253
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,520
Shut up, Pinkboy!

254
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,020
No way, I'll never sell out to the conspiracy

255
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,120
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien fool

256
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,500
Bob Dobbs comes with rocket pipe, head launcher, janger device, all I got is a fighting Jesus and other action figures sold separately

257
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,140
Some assembly required, batteries not included

258
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,320
This toy falls apart in three days

259
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,160
He-Bob!

260
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,000
As the bastards of the universe

261
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,400
Too much is always better than not enough

262
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,460
From Bob Dobbs

263
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,540
Gorgeous

264
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,520
He could

265
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,540
Can blow from head to toe

266
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,760
Like Connie

267
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,260
You see here, the Ken doll is sold separately

268
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,200
He-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message

269
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,940
Santa Claus

270
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:21,000
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas

271
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,180
He wanted an electric train

272
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,320
He had the whole thing in his mind, even to the table where it was going to set it up

273
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,360
What was his dream?

274
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:48,820
Which would be increasingly likely?

275
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:48,820


276
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,520
He would dream so hard that the whole thing would come to the light right before his eyes

277
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,480
To be continued

278
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,040
Project by

279
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,600
In셨able

280
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:05,740
The author of Merry Christmas, фак reckon world

281
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,520
Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher.

282
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,280
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy-looking train set with locomotives and freight cars.

283
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,420
And a station and a gateman.

284
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,280
The mortar tower and all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.

285
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,280
So grand that you might think Tommy was waiting for something that just didn't exist.

286
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,360
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.

287
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,680
It is turnover.

288
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,260
The time of the year when all things sell.

289
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,800
The end of the year sale.

290
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,460
So come and get it, everyone.

291
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,720
And just buy it.

292
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,380
Buy our products.

293
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,300
Now, are we...

294
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,220
I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

295
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:15,600
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?

296
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,920
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.

297
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:24,700
But the present subgenie tried to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now.

298
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,560
And sell everything to the pigs.

299
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,760
Oh, yes.

300
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,580
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.

301
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,880
And it was something else in between there.

302
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,700
Before it was...

303
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,360
After it was a pagan holiday and before it was a...

304
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,680
Shopping season it was something else.

305
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,440
But I think they started the war over it.

306
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

307
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,920
Yeah, yeah.

308
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,040
Let you go.

309
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,040
To your mother-in-law.

310
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,700
Oh, mother-in-law.

311
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,340
Wasn't just a ho.

312
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,260
Oh, .

313
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,720
I let my husbandḫo้h hal-

314
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,240
To my there.

315
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,900
You're the soonest god of a noisier god

316
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,360
Oh, oh, Gloria

317
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,200
Oh, Santa with extra sins

318
00:16:35,740 --> 00:17:05,120
Oh, oh, Gloria

319
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,320
Oh, oh, Gloria

320
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,220
Oh, oh, Gloria

321
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:23,320
Oh, oh, Gloria

322
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:41,260
Saint Nicholas punched another bishop in the nose and bloodied his nose

323
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,580
Really? The historical Saint Nicholas?

324
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,680
Over the trinity of God

325
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,620
The original Saint Nicholas in Turkey?

326
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,740
Who the hell is God?

327
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,420
Who the hell is God?

328
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,200
Who the hell is God?

329
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,080
Ask Dobbs one day

330
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,720
Who the hell is God?

331
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,860
That's the question we should be asking

332
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,720
Suddenly, a lightning bolt struck from nowhere on that bright sunny day

333
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,560
Bob did a backflip and from that day on, he too was a believer

334
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,620
And from the snowdrift truck, a little child bearing flowers emerged

335
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,040
Each one a dirty flower

336
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:34,660
The historical Santa Claus is originally lived, as the caller knows,

337
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,260
as a bishop in, uh, was it, was it Constantinople?

338
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,100
Yeah, like one of those

339
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,500
It was an ancient Byzantium

340
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,940
Asia Minor in general, yeah

341
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,740
Yes, he was, and he was, uh, he was known for

342
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,300
sneaking into the rooms of young women and leaving

343
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,660
gifts

344
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:02,020
Light-sized lumps of coal, complete with a fake beard and a CIA Wall Street credit card

345
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,860
A saint he was

346
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,100
Well, that's the thing that Saint Nicholas invented the CIA

347
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,720
That's good, that's, you got it, brother

348
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,680
He snuck into people's houses through the chimney

349
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,800
You got it, brother

350
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,300
They knew when they were sleeping, they knew when, he knew when they were awake

351
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,020
That, you got it, brother

352
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,720
But like the CIA, he was

353
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,240
That's Foucault, baby

354
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,460
He was protecting them

355
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,660
Foucault knew that Saint Nick was a creepin', stinkin' spy

356
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,160
What?

357
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,680
He knows when you've been sleeping

358
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,300
He knows what you've been eating

359
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,180
Hey, man, my kids still believe in Saint Nicholas

360
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,840
And who keeps that belief alive in their fevered, sick little eyes?

361
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,500
It'll break your...

362
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,320
Madison Avenue, of course

363
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,360
No, the surveillance community

364
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:38,740
And Disney

365
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,860
Under your direction

366
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,740
And the Reynolds Tobacco Company

367
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,720
Miller Bear, you know

368
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,600
He's a very powerful being, if you're bad, he punishes you

369
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,340
If you're good, he rewards you

370
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,880
He's probably the closest thing to Jesus, walking the earth

371
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,760
He's the closest thing to Big Brother there is

372
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,480
He rewards those who knows when they are smiling when they're awake

373
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,220
I think, I think really if you want to make a deal, you have to do it with, you know

374
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,300
Could Dr. Claus in fact be the...

375
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:09,920
...hungering, quote, milkman rumored to have fathered our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs?

376
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,440
Well, we find it a very likely possibility from the falsified documents we have here

377
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,180
And also the fluffy beard that often grew on Bob's feet

378
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,900
You better watch out

379
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,400
You better not

380
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,620
You better not tell them, tell them you won't

381
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,340
Saint Nicholas is coming

382
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,140
To town

383
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,680
He's broken in this chocolate twas

384
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,360
Gonna find out who's nobody in there

385
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,100
Saint Nicholas is coming

386
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,140
To town

387
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,200
He knows when you're awake

388
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,040
He knows when you're in bad or good

389
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,780
So be goodness, goodness sake

390
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,620
Oh, you better watch out

391
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:29,540
You better not tell them, tell them you won't

392
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,060
Saint Nicholas is coming

393
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,020
To town

394
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,820
To town

395
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:39,820


396
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:39,820


397
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:39,820


398
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,500
Suits me

399
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,780
Do you think I'm psycho, Mumma?

400
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,940
Ah, I'm sorry

401
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,200
We all saw Xmas last night

402
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,360
A vision of Christmas that was dancing in stank's head

403
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,720
It would not live for the little sugarplums and berries droping toxic dews

404
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,140
mmmmmmmmm

405
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,240
The poison in the plums.

406
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,120
Material plums.

407
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,480
Biological agents who only take 15%?

408
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,560
It's in the dark.

409
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,540
The acid is in boxes or bags.

410
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,800
And now...

411
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,980
And now...

412
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,920
Oh, it's a great day, all right.

413
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,740
A salute to Mr. and Mrs. America.

414
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,780
Shop as usual.

415
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,120
Shop as usual.

416
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,400
Shop as usual.

417
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,660
And avoid panic buying.

418
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,820
It's two days old Christmas.

419
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,140
A million things to do.

420
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,740
Clean the house, put on tea, company is due.

421
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,900
Where are my relatives?

422
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,420
Why haven't they showed up?

423
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,740
I bet they're at the airport.

424
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,360
I forgot to pick them up.

425
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,380
Maid!

426
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,340
You're so partecipating!

427
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,340


428
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,340


429
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:35,580
Time

430
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:35,580


431
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,940
Or, is Santaológs acting like Christmasinاطan?

432
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:54,060
Spend a lot of time with yourshot today!

433
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,540
Sometimes I think all that Santa crap's just bull.

434
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,340
Santa Claus is real.

435
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,620
Santa Claus is real.

436
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,680
We are the cause for the child.

437
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,140
Who's the head man?

438
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,540
Santa Claus.

439
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,440
Santa Claus.

440
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,020
He was a huge, beastly, bulging man.

441
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,020
He was so real, how come we didn't get squat last year?

442
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,800
Yes, the birth of the baby Satan on July 4th.

443
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:19,700
And now you can have it all, all pure 100% vinyl chloride CID.

444
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,720
The birth of our baby Satan as told by...

445
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,720
Various authors and eclectic scholars from around the globular unit.

446
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,440
Including that announcer.

447
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,960
This announcement has not been a perfunctory announcement.

448
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,460
An announcement of the blessed anointment and birthday of our Lord...

449
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,220
Zizzii...

450
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,160

...one...

454
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,960
...bright Christmas morning.

455
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,060
Zinua...

456
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,520
...was born...

457
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,480
...in a cradle...

458
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,580
...the rave Jesus...

459
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,600
...to a rich man's family.

460
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,340
The rave Jesus...

461
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,840
Oh, I know the rave Jesus.

462
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,600
I've parted with the rave Jesus.

463
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,880
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.

464
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:15,440
Have yourself a merry little Christmas.

465
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,140
Let your side be light.

466
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:30,020
From now on our troubles will be out of sight.

467
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,100
And have yourself a merry little Christmas.

468
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,580
From now on we're miles away.

469
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:51,300
And have yourself a merry little Christmas.

470
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:51,300

Let your heart...

478
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:09,420
...be out of sight.

479
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,020
Out of sight.

480
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,880
...of Jackson's body.

481
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,580
I wish everybody a merry Christmas.

00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:20,620


483
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,560
Have a gloomy gloomy day.

484
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,620
From a mutated Christmas friends,

the Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas by No-L.

486

No-L.

487
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:42,320
Before that some year old ESO and Michael Shelley did that real story of Christmas

488
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,320
from the Tarkin Records All-Star Holiday Extravaganza.

489
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,160
I'm playing a lot from that.

00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,560
So check out www.triage.com

491

for that one also.

492

The Tarkin Records is also on www.triage.com.

493
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,980
And now the Jethro's.

494
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,600
Have a merry little Christmas.

495
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,120
Have a merry little Christmas.

496
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,360
Have a merry little Christmas.

497
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,260
Have a merry little Christmas.

498
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:12,300


499
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,840
Happy old A historic Christmas and a very

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:19,840

Happy new year.

502
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,120
Happy new year everyone.

503
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,480
Happy new year.

504
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,240
Merry, merry new year...

505
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,900
Merry new year.

506
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,360
Have a merry New Year table.

507
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:27,600
Have a merry Christmas.

508
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,220
Have a merry Christmas.

509
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:42,180
Have a merry Christmas.

510
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,060
Even when the soul is all above, deep inside

511
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,480
Even blinded, shut the door that's died, though the trouble's true

512
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,880
And when the poor is game inside, better win the fuel

513
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,320
Oh yeah

514
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:41,980
The Weirbobs and Ima, those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob

515
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,820
Or that they're Santa Bob by night

516
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:50,100
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless, hideous errands

517
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:57,540
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face

518
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,800
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float into the keyhole

519
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,220
Oh friends, it's tough

520
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:09,140
And you know, just going to church ain't enough

521
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,960
You gotta send your money to church

522
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,600
You gotta send your money to the Santa Bob

523
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:21,740
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me told their kids that Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings

524
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,700
Can you believe that?

525
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:30,520
The kids were asking if their parents, maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets

526
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:35,240
And the mom said no, no, he won't because he bills us, we can't afford that

527
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,180
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas

528
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,980
Yeah, but at least he totes the note

529
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:57,580
We picked up a black impeller on a

Now you're blaming Jesus. You're blaming our Lord.

I sort of understand because I understood the way any old fool would understand.

554
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,960
There was no Jesus.

00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,600
No flatulent old woman waving her panties over the wall.

00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,080
There was no Jesus on the hill.

558
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,720
It's not that you don't want to. It's that they won't let you.

00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,600
No, there's just a cry in the wilderness.

560
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,600
They're ashamed. They're ashamed.

561
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,000
And the hot pursuit of wolves everywhere in the background.

562
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,520
I'm ashamed of them.

563
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,780
It's cold.

564
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,600
I'm leaving that city life behind.

565
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,800
I can't get my finger off the paper.

566
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,300
I can't get my needle back in the pan, Jeth.

567
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:38,600
I'm leaving that city life behind.

568
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:38,600


569
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:38,600


570
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,160
Come on, cowboy.

571
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:44,640
No, man. I was trying to hear a can against this here tree and it started whispering to me, man.

572
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,120
You've been drinking.

573
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,240
There's the face of Madonna right up there.

574
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,800
There's the face of Virgin Mary. I swear to God, look at it.

575
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:51,940
Isn't it?

576
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,280
It's your Christmas witch coming true.

577
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:55,840
Wow.

578
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,880
A Christmas witch?

579
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,020
Oh my God, yeah. I guess it does look a little bit more witchy than angelic.

580
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,080
Her breasts are so cold.

581
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,320
I know she must be a true witch.

582
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,080
I guess you could call her that if that's what she's packing down in this car.

583
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,100
She's spread by the wind.

584
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:09,500
For real?

585
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,900
Covering Christmas ornaments.

586
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,060
It looks like a radar device.

587
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:12,580
What?

588
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:13,760
Yo.

589
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:14,820
Yo?

590
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,260
It's her.

591
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,120
What up?

592
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,000
What's up?

593
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,860
What a deep voice.

594
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,440
What's up?

595
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,500
Christmas witch.

596
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,580
Ha!

597
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,180
She's like,

598
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:00,620
Here's the MSP at her back.

599
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:00,620


600
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:00,620


601
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,020
It's the love of Louisiana.

602
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,020


603
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,340
true Christmas.

604
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:03,500
Want it?

605
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:03,500


606
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,540
Hmm,

607
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,020
we're planning to have a very mobile church.

608
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,840
Okay,

609
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,160
What a great idea.

610
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,480
Thank you.

611
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,200
Bye-bye-bye.

612
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,080
My credit card makes me high.

613
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,300
My, oh my, until I die, die, die.

614
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,000
Swing, swing, swing.

615
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,740
Who wants the diamond ring?

616
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,440
Bye-bye-bye.

617
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

618
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,520
Hail Mother Mary, oh blessed lady.

619
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,300
Hail Mother Mary, I fell in love with your son.

620
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,680
Hail Mother Mary, turn me on and on and on.

621
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,940
Hail Mother Mary, thank God for you and your son.

622
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,060
Right on!

623
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,860
Right on, right on, right on.

624
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,760
Right on!

625
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:18,380
I am yours truly, Rudy Ray Moore, bold and still beautiful.

626
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,820
Baby, I want to talk to you for this Christmas,

627
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,800
because Christmas holds a lot of memories for me.

628
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,740
Baby, I've had a lot of hard times at Christmas time.

629
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,380
I can remember me and my brother when I was about six years old.

630
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,300
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece,

631
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,340
and the health department made us take them down.

632
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,200
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece,

633
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,200


634
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,300
I remember my father well, you know.

635
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,100
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache.

636
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,200
He used to have, you know what caused it then?

637
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,700
He used to put a stocking cap on his head,

638
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,320
and put a knock light in front of it.

639
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,840
Daddy wake up with that stumping headache,

640
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,740
and he said, the kids are saying, my head's hurting so bad.

641
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,860
Said, I don't know what Santa's gonna get y'all for Christmas,

642
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,980
but he gonna bring you something.

643
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,980
So Daddy took that old rifle and went outside,

644
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,180
and shot up in the air, and come back inside,

645
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,220
and told us the biggest lie ever heard.

646
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,440
Said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.

647
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,260
And whose birth do we celebrate with this new century?

648
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:26,140
Who was nailed on that great manger cradle,

649
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,100
but Satan claws?

650
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,340
Whose father, Paul Bunyan,

651
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,300
and whose mother, Big Sister,

652
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,520
created the conspiracy?

653
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,280
Before there were malls,

654
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,680
there was no such thing as Christmas.

655
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:45,800
Yes, there was a down-home Norman Rockwell style,

656
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,720
it's a wonderful life type of Christmas.

657
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:55,060
It was a kite-flying Coca-Cola drinking Christmas,

658
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,580
not a crack-smoking, rubber-snapping Christmas.

659
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,580
Rolled holy dough.

660
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,140
It was a...

661
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:07,880
When your little brother fell through a hole in the aisle,

662
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:07,920
he was a little boy.

663
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:07,920


664
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,120
Sometimes he'd sit around by the porch,

665
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,720
or maybe some decent,

666
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,140
and he'd curse in the family,

667
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:13,680
just drunk himself.

668
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,340
And Uncle Bud,

669
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,000
and we pulled him,

670
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,780
and we pulled him,

671
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,520
and we pulled him,

672
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,500
and we pulled him,

673
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,040
and then we'd put candles,

674
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,840
like most people have,

675
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,180
and he would have that smile on his face,

676
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:24,940
and a big red nose,

677
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,080
But today, Christmas has lost its meaning.

678
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,240
He'd have beaten the crap out of Santa Claus.

679
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:36,280
Scott, you made your choice.

680
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,960
When you rejected me,

681
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,640
my word, you rejected me.

682
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,240
And to your eternal soul,

683
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,740
you have found that only could you afford

684
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,580
to give to God that which was his.

685
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,580
But you could not afford to do otherwise.

686
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,840
The Senate still stands.

687
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,320
In the outer darkness,

688
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,240
where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.

689
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,560
Sir, please give me just one more chance, sir.

690
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,760
I don't want to go to hell, sir.

691
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,920
Sir, no, no.

692
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,080
I don't want to go to hell.

693
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,740
No!

694
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,680
No!

695
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,560
As alive as he could be.

696
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,780
And the children saved,

697
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,080
who could laugh and play just the same.

698
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,420
You and me.

699
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,700
The tail-bearer will be at the judgment.

700
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,000
My��고

701
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,000


702
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,080
Well, what do you think I am?

703
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,180
Tell me.

704
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:03,620
Please!

705
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,040
When I'm friends,

706
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,240
I will lose my sei t,

707
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,240


708
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,280
when I lack memory,

709
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,980
He would listen,

710
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,560
Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.

711
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,360
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,

712
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,480
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.

713
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,260
Dare I ask it? Yes.

714
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:29,960
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,

715
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,560
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the earth each and every day?

716
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,560
The answer? Yes, definitely.

717
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,100
Take that and shove it up the tube, mark certainty,

718
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,260
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

719
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,540
Merry Christmas to all! Now you're all gonna die!

720
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,960
The night Santa went crazy

721
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,540
The night Saint Nick went insane

722
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,080
Realized he'd been getting the wrong deal

723
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,420
Something finally must have snapped in his brain

724
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,580
Well the workshop is gone now, he decided to bomb it

725
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:13,520
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet

726
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,460
And he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage

727
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:21,280
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage

728
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,500
He got dancer and prancer with an old German Luger

729
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,540
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger

730
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,180
And he picked up a flamethrower and a barbecue blitzer

731
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,400
And he took a flamethrower and a barbecue blitzer

732
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,240
And he grabbed a big bite, and said it tastes just like chicken

733
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,560
The night Santa went crazy

734
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,200
The night Kris Kringle went nuts

735
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,440
Now you can't hardly walk around the North Pole

736
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,940
Without stepping in reindeer guts

737
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,380
There's the National Guard and the FBI

738
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,520
There's a van from the Eyewitness News

739
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,400
And the FBI's name is Steve Knudsen

740
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,480
Helicopters circling round in the sky

741
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,340
And the bullets are flying

742
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,580
The bodyguards rising

743
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:15,160
And everyone's dying to know

744
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,100
Who's Santa White

745
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,180
My, my, my, my, my, my

746
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,160
You used to be such a jolly guy

747
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,620
He knows when you're sleeping

748
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,780
He knows when you're awake

749
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,360
He knows when you're down

750
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,740
For good

751
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,900
For the good, for goodness sake

752
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,740
You better watch out

753
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,060
You better not cry

754
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,500
You better not pout

755
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,580
I'm telling you why

756
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:01,100
Santa Claus is coming to town

757
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,040
Santa Claus

758
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,380
Santa Claus

759
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:04,380


760
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,600
Is coming to town

761
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,260
You made him so succinct and blind

762
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,580
That he is actually blind

763
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,580
My one good thing

764
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,420
Yeah, we're now officially in the Jesus season

765
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,640
The time of the Lord

766
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,880
Of the fat man of the crowd

767
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,700
How many before you reach your limit?

768
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,640
How many do you get?

769
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,360
Jesuses

770
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:48,540
Jesuses?

771
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,960
Yeah, how many can you bag?

772
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,820
How many Messiahs can you bag?

773
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,400
Hail Jesuses

774
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,420
If you're doing it in season

775
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,420
If you're doing it out of season

776
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,700
You need a special permit

777
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,280
Oh, you never do

778
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,200
And you can only take one

779
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,800
You never bag the Lord in C

780
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,140
You bag the Lord in B flat

781
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,600
So you get that kind of rough sound

782
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,380
But when there's a season

783
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,380


784
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,380


785
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,380


786
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,380


787
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:04,800
When you're in season

788
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,140
It's every God for himself

789
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,240
This is the season for the fighting Jesus

790
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,400
Obviously

791
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,280
We're between a rock and a hard place

792
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,640
Did you know the Lord walked through Chaldea

793
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,400
In the old age

794
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,180
And he got a very, very hard foot

795
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,440
And he got elephantiasis of the rectum

796
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,020
You know, it's not something well known

797
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,640
By many Christian scholars

798
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,080
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was

799
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,940
Chalam chalam

800
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,160
Well, I like the story

801
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,660
I kind of like those stories

802
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,000
Where the Lord dies

803
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,380
And then comes to your grave

804
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,340
To America and settles

805
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,900
You know, tames the West

806
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,360
I like when he moves into a trailer park

807
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,500
I like the cowboy job

808
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,360
With his dog

809
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,500
Jesus fought for the Confederate Army

810
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:43,980
The Ranger

811
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,440
I like the Texas Ranger

812
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,160
Jesus, Texas Ranger

813
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,160
Johnny Rambo was Jesus

814
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,020
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police

815
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,580
Or maybe the Hopi police force

816
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,960
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus

817
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,940
He was the white brother

818
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,020
Billy Jack

819
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,520
Instruct the Indians how to be liberal

820
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,280
Well, what about

821
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:04,880
Old Peacemaker

822
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,960
The Jesus of the Iroquois

823
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,260
Who was actually Huron

824
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,000
A Huron

825
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,360
You didn't know that, did you?

826
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,000
I gotcha

827
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:12,460
Jesus

828
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,080
Elrond

829
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,020
I got a Jesus

830
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:18,160
Like no other Jesus you've ever seen

831
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,900
Oh, it tastes like butter

832
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:20,960
A different Jesus

833
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,860
It tastes like

834
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:22,740
A few crappy pieces

835
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,380
Like Jesus

836
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,200
A pipe-smoking Jesus

837
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,740
Hey, Dave, you know where it is

838
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,380
Go kick that window open

839
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,380
I already kicked it

840
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,500
I'll kick it again, though

841
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,260
Okay, I'll kick it again, though

842
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,960
Kick it good this time

843
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,200
We don't mean nothing by this Jesus and God

844
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:40,880
We hope that

845
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,940
We thank you for all the nice things

846
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,100
That you've done for us

847
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,000
This Thanksgiving

848
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,440
Clap it

849
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,020
We appreciate all that

850
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,900
And we're just trying to insult your fan club

851
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:50,540
That's all

852
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,600
That's why we do this blasphemy stuff

853
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,300
But we knew that you knew that

854
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,220
Because you're in all things and everything, right?

855
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:57,740
Jesus

856
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,400
Right, I could hear him say that

857
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,600
Praise God and Bob

858
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,020
And Jesus

859
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,240
And God and Jesus

860
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:04,960
And the devil

861
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,160
Next topic

862
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,380
Terrorist insurance

863
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,560
And the atheist

864
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,360
Could you see Jesus as a terrorist?

865
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:10,380
And science

866
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,100
Well, that's the life of Brian, isn't it?

867
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:12,340
That was

868
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,680
And Greek mythology

869
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,280
And Norse mythology

870
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,860
Listen to the sounds of hell

871
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,480
Jingle, jangle, jingle

872
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,120
We're on a sleigh ride to heck

873
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,800
Santa and his reindeer

874
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,140
Are really wicked

875
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,520
Wrapped in wrapping paper

876
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,060
We're gonna break our necks

877
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:40,760
Got a rocket in my pocket

878
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,800
On a sleigh ride to heck

879
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,580
Sleigh ride to heck

880
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:51,140
Sleigh ride to heck

881
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,740
Sleigh ride to heck

882
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:01,160
The elves are full of cheer

883
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,220
The kids are tucked in

884
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:04,620
In bed

885
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:08,180
Santa ain't coming

886
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,580
We're on a sleigh ride to heck

887
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,080
Their dreams are filled with toys

888
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,700
But they're out of luck

889
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,000
Cause Satan's taking Santa

890
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,080
On a sleigh ride to

891
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:29,040
Sleigh ride to heck

892
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,540
Sleigh ride to heck

893
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,220
Sleigh ride to heck

894
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,740
Sleigh ride to heck

895
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,020
Sleigh ride to heck

896
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:38,280
Sleigh ride to heck

897
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:40,900
Sleigh ride to heck

898
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,460
The greatest scary Christmas song ever, friends,

899
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,920
from his new album, Don't Trust Whitey,

900
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,260
James Kochalka, Superstar.

901
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:59,500
You know, see, a subgenius has so much faith

902
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:02,680
that he not only can accept

903
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:04,200
somebody making fun of him,

904
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:04,560
but he can also make fun of Bob,

905
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,200
stomping on a picture of Bob.

906
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,240
He'll do it himself.

907
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,640
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.

908
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,340
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.

909
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,840
Now, we subgeni,

910
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,000
I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,

911
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,480
but we subgeni may be bad,

912
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,780
but our way of bad is holy,

913
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,340
is holy compared to the evil of so many,

914
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,980
not all, by any means,

915
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,920
but so many American fundamentalists,

916
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,980
charismatics, evangelicals, etc., in general, of course,

917
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:34,180
and we're not going to be doing that.

918
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:38,820
They and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya,

919
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,060
South Africa, etc., if you ask me,

920
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,900
are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve.

921
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,380
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends,

922
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,960
just like Jesus warned about.

923
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,520
We're, Jesus and Bob, like we say,

924
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,960
our old drinking buddies, got nothing against Jesus.

925
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,860
It's just his fan club.

926
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:01,120
And now, we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve.

927
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,180
He's more like the smear on God's handkerchief,

928
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:04,160
just like Jesus.

929
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:04,600
Just like you or me.

930
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,920
But the uptight rival cults,

931
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,640
they don't think God has a handkerchief.

932
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,800
Uh-uh, no, because God's perfect.

933
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,580
He doesn't even sneeze.

934
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,680
We're made in his image,

935
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:18,540
except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us,

936
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,820
and we have to go in the secret room,

937
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,200
the bathroom,

938
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,160
to do awful things.

939
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,400
But God, oh, he's clean and pure,

940
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,640
according to them.

941
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,500
Oh, and he's male,

942
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,340
but he doesn't excrete juices and sweat

943
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,160
and smelly stuff out of him like we do.

944
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:34,980
Because we sin.

945
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,400
Oh, yeah, we all sin.

946
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,380
We're bad.

947
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,180
We're worthless.

948
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,000
We're no good to God,

949
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,060
unless we sign a contract with his agent.

950
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,100
We interrupt this program

951
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,200
for a special promotional announcement.

952
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:47,880
We turn.

953
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,360
Bob and the bastards of the universe

954
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,860
will be back after this message.

955
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:16,820
Yes, we'll wow Bob by dying!

956
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,860
Anything good from Bob?

957
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,440
Oh, don't pout, Bob.

958
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:23,440


959
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:23,440

00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:23,440


961
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:23,440

00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:26,200


964

Please, stop.

965
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,160
At last, we have a man on voor ви

966
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:34,140
You won't see us again.

967
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:46,600
Over the ancient god's head

968
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:55,180
Just like the ones I used to know

969
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:05,160
Buried tree, soft smoky

970
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,120
An windshield baby said

971
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:20,020
Pear-paned on surface snow

972
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:36,600
I'm dreaming about the kids you guys have.

973
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:44,500
If everyone can come back right.

974
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:56,840
May your days be rich and short.

975
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:12,200
And may all your guns can be white.

976
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,480
Bye.

999
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:50,600
When a thrill of hope the weary world rejoices

Beyond the grace a new and glorious morn

1001

Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices

Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born

1003

Oh night, oh night, oh night divine

1007
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,280
What I wouldn't do from Bob-Dob

1008
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,700
Get new more chocolatey pebbles from you, no?

1009
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,360

This cocoa let the world know

1015
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,280
Whoa

1016
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,960
What do you think?

1017
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:19,200
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here?

1018
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,600
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob,

1019
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:28,200
as he's been referred to in some early prescriptures?

1020
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:07,600
You need to know where to write to the Jethro's, they're at...

1021
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,980
They did that wreck the halls and so many other...

1022
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:22,240
versions we've been playing. The Jethro's are at 212 and a half Miller Avenue. That's 212 and a

It's all Christmassy right now. There's a bright green bob in the window and Christmassy

1031
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:25,580
lights.

1032
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,960
Is there a DJA? Is DJA out there?

1033
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,600
And devilish artwork that's Christmassy.

1034
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,840
No, that's something just left for DJA.

1035
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:34,580
It's all Christmassy.

1036
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:34,580


1037
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:34,580

00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:34,580


1039
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:42,800
It's all Christmassy. It's all wrapped up in a perfumed ribbon-wrapped present under the tree.

1040
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:43,820
Smell that cinnamon.

1041
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,500
Open the door all the way so we can see if he comes in.

1042
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,820
And those sugar plums. Something's up the chimney hole in sight and it's his name.

1043
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,400
Yeah.

1044
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:52,840
Of Santa, I mean.

1045
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:58,340
Otherwise, gosh, I guess we have to wait till Santa comes, Dave.

1046
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,060
Our beloved Santa.

1047
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,880
I have wanted to...

1048
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,380
Put your bag down for a minute.

1049
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:04,200

1057
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:34,180

Don't go there, don't go there.

1061
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:59,400
Long cow Dave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

1062
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:09,020
Don't despair just because it's Christmas.

1063
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:17,200
Children there are so gay at Christmas.

1064
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:28,120
All the children on the street hope they get something good to eat.

1065
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:32,220
But for me, it's not so great.

1066
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:33,880
Fuck!

1067
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:35,480
Fuck Christmas!

1068
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,740
It was the night before Christmas and all through the house

1069
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,900
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse

1070
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,040
The stockings were hung by the tree

1071
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,500
Merry fucking Christmas

00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,260
