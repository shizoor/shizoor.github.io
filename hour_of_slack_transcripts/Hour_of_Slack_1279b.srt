1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:07,000
Friends, we're still off-planet, or at X-Day, or something, and therefore this is not the

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,440
Hour of Slack that you may have expected, but a rerun of number 903 from 6X-Day of 2004.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,040
Praise Bob.

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,860
Welcome to the subgenius radio hour of Slack.

5
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,860
Send 6.8 for the album.

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,100
Only 9.8.

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,440
The UFO exhibiting anti-gravity capabilities follows the airliner right down to the surface

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,980
of the earth to its landing.

9
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:50,000
The UFO is a bell-shaped type, which has been seen and photographed all over the world.

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,800
Angels flash through the heavenlies.

11
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,680
You know, Ezekiel saw a wheel.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,940
But what a lot of us do not realize is that in chapter 1 of Ezekiel, verse 4, the angels

13
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,100
traveled in whirlwind fashion.

14
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,740
Not like our jets straight ahead.

15
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,660
Whirlwind.

16
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,940
They move from one end of heaven to the other like a flash of lightning, verse 14.

17
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,600
And verse 15 says their color was burl.

18
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,640
Do you know what they put into spaceships now that are heaved out there?

19
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,640
The only thing that can withstand the heat.

20
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,960
Other things would disintegrate.

21
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,240
Burl ilium.

22
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,560
It's like some kind of vision like I've never seen before.

23
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,780
It was like a wagon wheel coming out of the sky.

24
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,660
And I was sitting on the porch with Aunt May.

25
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,600
She said, what is it, boy?

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,440
What is it?

27
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,700
And I said, I don't know, ma'am.

28
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,900
I swear to God, I don't know.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,640
But she said, praise Bob.

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,340
You know, if Bob says something,

31
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,820
that wall climbing.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,340
What is it?

33
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Wall climbing.

34
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,840
Is it wall climbing?

35
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,600
Well, I was wall climbing.

36
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,900
I was wall climbing.

37
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,960
And that's what Bob said to do.

38
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,820
That's what Bob told me to.

39
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,300
I was wall climbing.

40
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:28,320
And, uh, and, uh, I get real scared.

41
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,920
Bob.

42
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,040
Because, uh, I've seen them.

43
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,400
I've seen them before.

44
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,060
But there's more of them now.

45
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,020
And, uh, because there's lots more.

46
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,620
They're floating in the air.

47
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,440
And they're living in the wood and the rocks and everything.

48
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,680
And they're always kind of.

49
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:06,720
Laughing and, and, uh, fucking and killing and laughing and all the time.

50
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,840
Duncan Lunan of the British Interplanetary Society

51
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,560
has interpreted the signals as a message from the space probe.

52
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,260
A message from a dying planet in Epsilon Bootes.

53
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,420
When did you see your last flying saucer?

54
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,240
The last thing I seen was here Sunday week.

55
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,460
It was out in the wheat field.

56
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,220
In the wheat.

57
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:28,580
In the wheat field.

58
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,540
Isn't that a little unusual?

59
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,540
No, I'm, I think they must feed off wheat or something.

60
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,160
Yeah, the little green man's day was real headcats.

61
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,780
Rocking and a-rolling to the crazy flats.

62
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,600
Brought out the sacks and they started to flow.

63
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,480
Brought out the drums and they started to roll.

64
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,300
Flying saucer, rock and roll.

65
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,080
Flying saucer, rock and roll.

66
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,680
I couldn't understand it.

67
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,500
A thing they said it was a crazy beat.

68
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,720
It just stopped me dead.

69
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,280
Jump!

70
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,100
Yeah!

71
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,940
Ah, yes, dear friends.

72
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,880
From Media Barrage number two.

73
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,340
The ancient one about UFOs.

74
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,800
And we heard from, well actually it was 1981, I think.

75
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Jano Hypercletes and the late Reverend David Boone.

76
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,460
And Jonathan Winters.

77
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:26,660
And despite having those ancient crumbling recordings around,

78
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,420
my friends.

79
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,120
I barely remember.

80
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,560
Oh yeah, no I forgot.

81
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,000
This is the part that you can remember.

82
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,260
Ok, you know what show it is now?

83
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,420
Yeah, oh this is the Puzzling Evidence Show.

84
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,740
Oh, a cup of coffee.

85
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,280
The Little Puzzling Evidence Show on the little KPFA here in Berkeley.

86
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,040
Oh yeah, you can't play all of it.

87
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,720
You can't cut it off.

88
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,320
You've got it wrong.

89
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,280
On the new radio, we can't play anything.

90
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,900
That's why, you know, that's why on all kinds of radio stations you only hear about

91
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,040
eight bars of something.

92
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,580
Because then you don't have to pay the royalties and do the paperwork.

93
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,460
So no more old songs.

94
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,060
No more old songs for us.

95
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,680
Unless of course they're original material.

96
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,100
Thank you.

97
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,020
The copyright owners are us.

98
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,920
But it is good to be back here in California.

99
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:23,820
Yes.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,900
After walking.

101
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,480
Horrorwood, Carlisle.

102
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,260
After schlepping it over the edge of the road.

103
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,260


104
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,260


105
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,260


106
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,260


107
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,260


108
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,260


109
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,260


110
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,260


111
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,260


112
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,260


113
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,760
Over to X Day on my bare feet.

114
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,720
Oh, X Day.

115
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,640
Yeah, I want to hear about X Day.

116
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,800
And the audience goes wild.

117
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,600
Yeah, X Day.

118
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,500
They love it because they're thinking of XXX Day.

119
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,800
So how was it to see Guy Duhl and Ivan Stang and Queen of UFOs and Nikki Jepchick?

120
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,900
And who else would have been there?

121
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,100
Oh, so all those people, they were great.

122
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,960
It was excellent.

123
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,360
One day we were, we had good weather.

124
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,280
Except for one day we had this wonderful thunderstorm that rolled through during the night.

125
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,140
Yeah, I missed that.

126
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,760
And like, rained like crazy.

127
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,900
And, and, uh.

128
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,640
And you slept in the van down by the river?

129
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,160
Guy and I drove around in the, no I didn't sleep in the van.

130
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,160
I slept in the trailer.

131
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,600
The van was like next to the fire and next to lots of people.

132
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,120
And would have been a miserable place to stay.

133
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,640
And so I moved up on the hill to the hierarchy trailer.

134
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,160
Just like the old Docs Docs.

135
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,620
And when I was in the hierarchy trailer, no one bothered me.

136
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,360
I set up my coffee making stand and my little brewing post.

137
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,600
So I had coffee every morning and afternoon.

138
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,680
And good, strong California coffee.

139
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,120
Not that wimpy ass Eastern coffee.

140
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,780
And then of course, let's see, but overall it was good.

141
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,280
It was great.

142
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,500
We had a great time.

143
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,240
We had the amino acids played one night.

144
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,220
The ESO played another night.

145
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,580
And I got a chance to jam with ESO for two different nights.

146
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:55,580


147
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:55,580


148
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,860
And that was great.

149
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,700
I had a, I mean we really, we wailed.

150
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,440
We rocked.

151
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,600
We rocked!

152
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,260
We didn't suck!

153
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,700
Sure, sure, of course.

154
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,000
We tried to suck, but we just couldn't.

155
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,680
Yeah, you rocked.

156
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,340
We sucked at sucking!

157
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,140
No, no.

158
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,300
You didn't suck.

159
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,700
You rocked.

160
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,660
Well, that's could be true.

161
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,120
Yes, I did you.

162
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,040
I think we did.

163
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,680
Believe me.

164
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,580
I did.

165
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:25,580


166
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:25,580


167
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:25,580


168
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:25,580


169
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:25,580


170
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,200
You got to.

171
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,080
I think we did.

172
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,140
You got to.

173
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,780
It's just a matter of time.

174
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,680
We're going to give it all I got.

175
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,980
It's just a matter of time.

176
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,580
We got to.

177
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,580
Yeah, we got to.

178
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,800
We got to.

179
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,720
We got to.

180
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,480
We got to.

181
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,220
Yeah.

182
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,500
We grew our mullets out while we were there.

183
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,580
Mullet bearing load sharing.

184
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,800
And one night, Guy and I drove.

185
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:51,900
We did the drumming routine where we drive around the compound in our narc-looking vehicle.

186
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,000
Compounding the problem.

187
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,520
Scaring the various pinks that happen to be there and the bobbies that all shy away from it.

188
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,100
And of course, it was pouring down rain.

189
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,180
And I'm not kidding.

190
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,340
It was like it never rains that hard here.

191
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,060
No.

192
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,480
It was raining in giant cascades where one foot was raining like a bucket per second.

193
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,520
Much like a couple of cascades.

194
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:12,920
Where I used to live.

195
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,500
Yeah, a lot like where I used to live.

196
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,880
Big thunderheads rolling over with lots of thunder and lightning.

197
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,680
That's what they used to call me.

198
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,400
Thunderhead.

199
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
Big cracking.

200
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,460
Yeah.

201
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:29,380
And so, yeah, Guy and I drove out in the middle of the compound road while it was raining like that.

202
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,460
And did various ritualistic activities in the rain.

203
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,240
That was actually a compound city.

204
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,200
Along with some young Bobby Ites.

205
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,140
Bobby Ites.

206
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,160
Because Bobby was involved in those cult activities.

207
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,040
That we took with us and performed ritualistic activities up on.

208
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,560
Stay away.

209
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,780
Get your hands off me.

210
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,440
Do cops rock or do they suck?

211
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,920
He's right over there, officer.

212
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,720
They rock.

213
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,040
Do your duty.

214
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,260
While we're on the air.

215
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,020
And incidentally, we think you guys.

216
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,840
After we get out on the air.

217
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,500
Rock.

218
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,780
They may not rock as much.

219
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,260
How many days were you out there?

220
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,100
I mean, what happened to the end of the world?

221
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,500
Well, we got down to the end of the world.

222
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,700
I mean, first of all, it's, you know, 6X day.

223
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:23,600
So, it's the sixth year after the time when we thought the world was supposed to end the first time.

224
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,740
So, now there's a whole.

225
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,460
All the new kids, the people that are getting into it now, each have their own theory on why the X's haven't landed yet.

226
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:41,320
So, it's sort of like all these theories are jockeying for position as to the predominant theory.

227
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,460
That's as it should.

228
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:52,660
And, of course, I ascribe to the next 100 years theory, which we have expounded upon on this very show ad infinitum.

229
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,980
Yes, I don't know if this show is the place to hash out that abstruse subgenius theology.

230
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:05,940
It could only be of interest to the inner meaning of that strange cult.

231
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,020
Extrusion of logic in reality.

232
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,120
Hmm.

233
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:11,880
Hmm.

234
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,300
Hmm.

235
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:12,560


236
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:12,560


237
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:12,560


238
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:12,560


239
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:12,560


240
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:12,560


241
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:12,560


242
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:12,560


243
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:12,560


244
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:12,560


245
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,500
What was your question now?

246
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:23,760
Well, Dr. Drummond, is it true that Dr. Howell, your comrade there at the show, is going to join me, Reverend Ivan Stang,

247
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:30,040
at the Indy Bible on September 20th in Indianapolis for a huge subgenius freakout?

248
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,620
Can I get that info at subgenius.com?

249
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,480
What other news is there?

250
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,000
This is BR News.

251
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,300
I'm creating unintended problems.

252
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,100
For BR News, I'm completely contained.

253
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,980
From Los Angeles, PR's 600 Kmart stores report.

254
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:57,020
From Eugene, Morgan Smith continues to battle two major campgrounds and several homes over the weekend.

255
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,400
PR radios at PR.org.

256
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,760
PR's Ricard resigned after a plagiarism scandal.

257
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,700
Yeah.

258
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,060
For PR News, I'm expected to return late in the week.

259
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,980
PR's Madeline Brand blamed for the continuing attacks on the dance floor.

260
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,080
This is PR News.

261
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,900
I'm selected by the U.S.-led Occupation Authority to help baby abandonments.

262
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,160
No questions asked.

263
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,300
This is coming up on 9.30 at 10 o'clock this morning.

264
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,460
This is PR.

265
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,760
PR brought to you by Fernand and Ambie.

266
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,560
Lemur.

267
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,100
Hey, Atlanta.

268
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,480
Hey, Atlanta.

269
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:42,560
Hey, Atlanta.

270
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:42,780
Hey, Atlanta.

271
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,240
Hey, Atlanta.

272
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,300
Hey, Atlanta.

273
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,620
Hey, Atlanta.

274
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,100
Hey, Atlanta.

275
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,100


276
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,100


277
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,100


278
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,100


279
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,100


280
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:49,100


281
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,120
They spelled Namby in this publication.

282
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,680
I want them written up right now.

283
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,080
They misspelled Namby.

284
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,060
They spelled it Mamby.

285
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,660
Namby Pamby.

286
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,320
Namby.

287
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,680
This is what we're stuck at here at 412 in the morning at Subgenius International Airport.

288
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,620
I have the crap.

289
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,000
All the dreams got me.

290
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,500
Next day's turned into such a big thing.

291
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,540
They had to build an airport just to handle all the stuff.

292
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:12,540


293
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,880
the people that come to X-Day now. Here they get their subgenius church hair, and then

294
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,360
they march off to the area where the end of the world will happen. And Philodrumon is

295
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,580
down there. We can see him on the floor. Philo, what, how, what, how?

296
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,320
Goodbye belly fat.

297
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,920
How about it? How about it?

298
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:42,140
Oh, yes, here. In another edition of the ancient subgenius traditions, we can, we can now

299
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:50,840
add treasured and hated symbols of our lives to this fire. Janina Grinder here has apparently

300
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,400
a Virgin Mary, which she is...

301
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,220
My mom, thanks. That's nice.

302
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:04,600
Some people have thrown in their driver's licenses, their work records, their time punch-outs,

303
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:10,560
their parents' divorce papers, in one especially poignant example.

304
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,120
If I...

305
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,580
If I could throw my self-esteem in the fire, I sure would, but...

306
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,420
I got two things.

307
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:25,420
I have Bob's rally monkey. Bob did not rally. Bob did not save us. Bob's rally monkey. Fat

308
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,460
fucking lot of good it did. Feed the fire, asshole!

309
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,340
Burn the monkey! Burn the monkey! Burn the monkey!

310
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:33,960
Burn the monkey!

311
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,740
And now, we're the pagans.

312
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh.

313
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,600
We have hundreds of beautiful topless women. We have Banjo Bob.

314
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,900
Look at him stamp on it.

315
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:56,280
Sample of the ultimate spouse dance. The sacred dance of the subgenius.

316
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,880
Hurry up and burn, Bob! We're tired of waiting! We're tired of waiting for the goddamn saucer,

317
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,940
and we want to see your face burn!

318
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,080
Bob, Bob once asked the classic question.

319
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,980
Would you tell me if my...

320
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,160
My face was on fire?

321
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,620
This is our chance. Bob, your goddamn face is on fire.

322
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,740
My face is on fire. My face is on fire.

323
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,760
Snap out of it!

324
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,520
Wake the fuck up!

325
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,860
Oh, where is the fuck?

326
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,400
Wake the fuck up!

327
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,960
Fuck!

328
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:30,660
Fuck!

329
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:30,660


330
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:30,660


331
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:30,660


332
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:30,660


333
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,580
Fuck!

334
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,220
Fuck!

335
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,580
Fuck!

336
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:35,640


337
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,040
Fuck!

338
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,040


339
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:38,820
Fuck!

340
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:38,880
Fuck!

341
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,040
Fuck!

342
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:48,500


343
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:48,500


344
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:48,500


345
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,380
Fuck!

346
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,340
Collek.

347
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,680
Not, not, not!

348
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:53,680


349
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:53,680


350
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:53,680


351
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:53,680


352
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:53,680


353
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,640
I experienced, a complete �

354
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,920
evaluations.

355
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,240
This ship will从ologies We're a matter for España.

356
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,840
The beep!

357
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,640
John R. Rie our thứ пар traffic strategy.

358
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,800
Can you see me?

359
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,760
Along with me

360
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,440
We can't dance and trip and be anarchist

361
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,360
We gotta get the manual and put it in the oven till it cooks

362
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,560
We're gonna take the ashes to the waffle and drink

363
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:47,540
We're gonna take the ashes to the waffle and drink

364
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,860
Muslim Anarchy Camp

365
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,740
Reckless abandonment

366
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,140
Random acts of dumbness

367
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,820
Will be rewarded if you see somebody taking charge

368
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,800
But you won't

369
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,140
You'll be expected to beat them

370
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,940
Everyone who's no one

371
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,280
Will be participating

372
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,880
No one who is someone

373
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,220
Will ever get to know the joys of anarchism

374
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
Destruction of the system, yeah

375
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,420
So come along with us

376
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,620
Selling days and nights on the Anarchaic Bus

377
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,700
Gonna pick up indigents and crusties and a half a dozen nuts

378
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,900
And we're never coming home

379
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,100
Yeah...

380
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,500
Underwater basket weaving

381
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,820
Methamphetamine symposium

382
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,940
African killers spelling bees

383
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,280
Bowling in ice hockey rinks

384
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,580
Anarchy Camp's never a nerd

385
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,200
You think we don't know that at all?

386
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,900
Not much fun till someone gets hurt.

387
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,120
So we're greasing up the Rusty Bird ramp.

388
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,880
Time to make some reservations for next year's Anarchy Camp.

389
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,620
Oh, just like X-Day, Anarchy Camp by the band NoFX.

390
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:36,640
And now, back to KPFA Berkeley, the puzzling evidence show where Philo is reporting on 6X Day.

391
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,680
Although, Dr. Howell had decided not to attend.

392
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,080
I know I've made some very bad decisions.

393
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,160
And I had people feeding me each day with gourmet food.

394
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,540
Just because, I found out later, it's because I was a hierarchite.

395
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,260
And they could have me like a figurehead in their camp.

396
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,440
And when I was sitting there, they attracted the bobbies up.

397
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,300
Now, did the camps have names to the camps?

398
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,380
People do stuff like the Tranquility Bay.

399
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,320
Yeah, they had different names.

400
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,160
You know, they didn't.

401
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,040
They were names.

402
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:17,460
Like, there was one of the new subgenius bases that had a lot of the new subgenius guys from alt.slack and alt.binaries.slack.

403
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,740
Some of those new subgeniuses are a little off base.

404
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,100
Internet subgenii had met in a compound called Pound Subgenius.

405
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,540
And that's just what I'd like to do.

406
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,960
And you could see it off in the distance.

407
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,520
It had these big flags and giant bob heads.

408
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,220
I went in there, and they were all computer geeks.

409
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,040
So you have to log into their camp.

410
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,140
When you walk up, you had to sign a big board, this rotating board.

411
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,520
They had this arcane mechanical device.

412
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,480
And you couldn't walk in unless you logged in, you know.

413
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,560
Board? Never.

414
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,580
I was entertained every second.

415
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,560
And then Doc Frop had his compound.

416
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,100
I don't know what other than we just always called it Frop's place.

417
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,420
If only I could leave the compound.

418
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,080
And then, let's see, there was Tranquility Base is really cool.

419
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,620
They have the Bonobo Bar and the Tiki Bar.

420
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,720
The Banzai Grill is there.

421
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,800
Bonobos? I say, aren't those pick-me chimps?

422
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,720
Bonobos?

423
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,260
Bonobos?

424
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,620
Bonobos?

425
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,260
Bonobos?

426
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,660
Bonobos?

427
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:34,720
Bonobos?

428
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:34,720


429
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:34,980
Bonobos?

430
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,160
Bonobos?

431
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:36,560
Bonobos?

432
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,480
So you guys were jamming.

433
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,700
Who was the jammies?

434
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,000
I jammed with ESO and Princess Wee.

435
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,380
They were so cute.

436
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,640
Jammed with us.

437
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:05,100
We had, you know, Chaz was there and Dave, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

438
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,960
Dave and Bob.

439
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,860
He's a great American.

440
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,320
I know.

441
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,620
I'd like to be on their show someday.

442
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,880
We should all go be on their show.

443
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,720
Lonesome Cowboy Dave is what makes this country great.

444
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,500
Yeah, I was thinking, did you go?

445
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,520
I wasn't on the show, though.

446
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,540
Oh, you should have gone to be on show.

447
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,620
That would have been fun, but they were all getting ready for X Day.

448
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,200
I don't know that they even had time for the show.

449
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,320
That's pathetic.

450
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:24,900
How can that be?

451
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,860
Yeah, no lie.

452
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,280
Because the show is like just a tiny snatch of X Day.

453
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,160
I don't understand.

454
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,980
When you saw, I mean, you saw how elaborate Chaz is at camp.

455
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,760
He has this cool crate that he's built down there in the middle of T-Base Camp.

456
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,740
And it's under the trees back in the woods.

457
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,460
And he's got his like, he could live back in there.

458
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,760
It's got a little mini kitchen, his computers in there, all his history.

459
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,340
Oh, that's really a new setup.

460
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:56,060
His whole history of CDs is his, you know, he's got a place to sleep.

461
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:56,760
CDs?

462
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,180
It's really nice and cozy back in there.

463
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:58,860
I guess I saw those.

464
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,500
Plus he has all these young chicks that hang around.

465
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,640
And caulking and balking and going, balk, balk, balk.

466
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,360
He sails in on his own yacht.

467
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,160
He sails in on his van.

468
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:13,760
Yeah.

469
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,200
He's got a van, you know.

470
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,620
What's the name of his book?

471
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,820
I couldn't even look for it.

472
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,060
He's a history of rock and roll.

473
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,360
Yeah.

474
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,040
I'd like to get that.

475
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,020
I have a good and silly.

476
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,240
He's a real musicologist kind of guy.

477
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,720
Yeah, that's fine.

478
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,060
And he grouses the girls on the show.

479
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,420
But the Tranquility Base plays is mostly.

480
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,620
I wonder if he listens to this show.

481
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,380
See, I think it's important that he listens to this show.

482
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,060
As soon as I finish this.

483
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,620
Okay, I need a little more church air here.

484
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,540
I don't know if he listens to this show or not.

485
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,300
Look, there's a caller.

486
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:45,700
Oh.

487
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,900
Thanks for waiting and go right ahead.

488
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,960
Yeah, I'm calling from Glen Rose.

489
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,660
I talked to these two a couple of months ago about some cattle mutilation.

490
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,320
Yeah, you were the farmer, right?

491
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:54,800
Right.

492
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,240
Raised cattle.

493
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,060
Yeah.

494
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,760
And I told you all about the mutilation.

495
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,820
It's also a big good idea.

496
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,220
I sent some money in.

497
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,060
Might give me an edge.

498
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:04,720
Right.

499
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,280
Right.

500
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,540
Friends, I must interrupt here.

501
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,760
My own wife didn't recognize these voices.

502
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:21,440
So I should explain that what follows is like the third radio appearance ever in 1980 of yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

503
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:29,060
And my partner, Dr. Philo Drummond on George Nolan's show on KFJZ in Fort Worth.

504
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,220
The guy calling in is my brother.

505
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:34,500
Well, it's.

506
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,900
We've had another one down here.

507
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,840
Is that right?

508
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,640
Cattle mutilation.

509
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,120
How much money did you send in?

510
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,160
Well, that's the problem.

511
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,400
I never got around to sending some money in.

512
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,420
Well, that's why.

513
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,420
Well, we can't.

514
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:53,520
We don't have that much to do with cattle mutilation, but we can help put you on the alert to who might be doing it.

515
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,320
And how to watch out for.

516
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,260
Yeah, we that that whole situation with the cattle mutilation is pretty spooky.

517
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,580
Not very many people know about it.

518
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:10,800
And we've found that lately an even scarier aspect, a UFO related goldfish mutilates gold right.

519
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,120
Right.

520
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,360
And right in your own home, you're going to see a lot more of that people.

521
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:22,460
It's like you'll you'll wake up in the morning and people will find that their goldfishes have been mutilated and no explainable reason for whatsoever.

522
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,040
No breaking surgery.

523
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,100
Surgically.

524
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:25,340
Yeah.

525
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,480
The organs, certain organs surgically removed.

526
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,740
It's it's just scary as can be.

527
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,220
We've seen that in some animals.

528
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,440
Down here.

529
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,040
Uh huh.

530
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,860
Is there any way to find out who's doing it?

531
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,320
Well, maybe another.

532
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,880
There's a lot of theories on that.

533
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:48,040
One theory says that it's the conspiracy doing it and making it look like UFOs to to discredit law enforcement agencies.

534
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:54,580
Another theory says that it is UFOs and they're using cattle eyeballs for rocket fuel.

535
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:02,560
And another theory is that it's some crazed teenage zombies out there that are going wild.

536
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:02,740
Yeah.

537
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,020
Some weird religious cult doing it for who knows what reason.

538
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,000
Boy, there are weird cults around, aren't there?

539
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,400
There are.

540
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:15,260
Most of the cults, I might add, some of them are us, but most of them are them.

541
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,700
And most of the ones that are us don't know they're us.

542
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,080
Yeah.

543
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:23,680
Well, the way they get it straight now, the us are the good guys, the them are the bad guys.

544
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:23,900
That's right.

545
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,020
There are a lot of blatant subgeniuses.

546
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,640
But by the same token, there are a lot of conspiracy members there who don't know they're working for the conspiracy.

547
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,540
A lot of latent homosapiens.

548
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:32,540


549
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,420
And they're sapiens, too, you know.

550
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:33,780
That's right.

551
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,060
Yeah.

552
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,080
Or homo correctus is what the subgenius is descended from.

553
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,360
Okay.

554
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,120
Well, I wanted to know if there's...

555
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,980
Should I try to find out who's doing it or catch anybody doing it or...

556
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,480
Well, send us some money to begin with and we can fill you in on a whole lot more.

557
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:57,600
That box number you can send it to is box 1403-06, Dallas 75214.

558
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:58,900
And...

559
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,520
I might add, that is a real post office box.

560
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,740
I have seen it, touched it, opened it, and it actually exists.

561
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,140
Yeah.

562
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,340
We're not kidding about that.

563
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,080
And we will send you material that will help explain not only cattle mutilations but hundreds

564
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,720
of other true mysteries in this modern space age agogo world.

565
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,440
And I can also verify that these guys, not only is that a real post office box number,

566
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,640
these guys are real actual solicitators, solicitation-er, they are asking for money, really.

567
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,860
I'll send you money in this time.

568
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,480
Maybe it'll help.

569
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:30,800
Okay.

570
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:36,440
In the meantime, you can sit out on your ranch in the dark and just watch for bright lights in the sky.

571
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,460
And different kinds of things.

572
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,860
Well, the different kind of things is what I'm worried about finding.

573
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,120
Don't worry about taking a gun with you. It won't do any good.

574
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,360
Well, that's a hell.

575
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,240
Yeah, bullets cannot stop them.

576
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,940
Come, my creatures. I summon all of you to attend.

577
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,880
On March 22nd, hundreds of people witnessed a pair of flying objects.

578
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,780
For the next nine days, UFOs rose out of the sea.

579
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,200
Tongue in the air remained motionless.

580
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,360
And in various manners, reported over the metropolitan city of Sorocco.

581
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,560
I've opened the surface of the earth. It's time to attack.

582
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,360
All the other women are why you're there and whether you really had your tongue in your cheek or not.

583
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,800
Especially the farmer who had...

584
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:25,820
The guy.

585
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,520
He had a special accumulation, yeah, on his land.

586
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,200
And his neighbor thought it was strange, too.

587
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,020
Are not the angels ministering spirits?

588
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,720
And so, the ministering spirits, who shall be the air of salvation?

589
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:46,320
Only earth with a single moon can have exactly total solar eclipses.

590
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:51,800
He is too remarkable an occurrence to be due entirely to chance.

591
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,340
We have just discovered an important node from space.

592
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:08,120
The Martians plan to throw a dance for all the human race.

593
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,420
Good. Nothing can stop us now.

594
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,160
It'll only take a few hours to attach this detonator.

595
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,000
Then we can all take off for Mars.

596
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,180
Are you sure the rocket can carry all of us?

597
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,920
And you're meant for me?

598
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,400
And the island, too?

599
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,040
Oh, yes.

600
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,500
Now get Dr. Harding.

601
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,080
He's going to help me make the final adjustments on the bomb.

602
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:31,580
Okay.

603
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,880
You've got the robot in the car.

604
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,620
We've got the control panel here.

605
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,100
We'll take it along and let the robot do the fighting for us.

606
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,380
Then we'll have to wait before we find out what this is all about.

607
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,440
Not entirely.

608
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,340
The papers we found in Harding's laboratory explain why they're building the hydrogen bomb.

609
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:51,400
Its explosion was intended to deflect the rotation of the earth enough to send it out of its orbit and spinning off into space.

610
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,020
Those zombies must have been as crazy as they looked.

611
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,700
It may sound ridiculous.

612
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,120
But it's theoretically possible.

613
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,720
It's certainly lucky you managed to stop them in time.

614
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,200
Yeah, we're safe now.

615
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,320
For the time being.

616
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,240
But there are undoubtedly more of those power-mad creatures loose another planet.

617
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,040
So it'll take constant vigilance on our part, to ensure the safety of this world.

618
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:20,400
If the people do not cease to offend you, another and worse war will break out.

619
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,560
Then you see a night with a strange light in the sky.

620
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:30,220
You will know it is a sign that the world is about to be punished for its crime.

621
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,960
You irresponsible bitch.

622
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,300
Yes, baby.

623
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,040
You irrepressible bitch.

624
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,020
Why did you take my fun time away from me?

625
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,800
Give me back my fun time.

626
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,600
Got to give me back my fun time.

627
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,380
Give me back my fun time.

628
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,180
Give me back my fun time.

629
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,780
Give me back my fun time.

630
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,400
Give me back my fun time.

631
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,000
Give me back my fun time.

632
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,000


633
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,620
I'm gonna make it all up to you.

634
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,740
I'd like to give it all to you.

635
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,920
Objects in motion.

636
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,340
Earth, Venus, Mars.

637
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,080
A place without gravity.

638
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,480
I no longer see stars.

639
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,940
Not far in the future.

640
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,520
Where did that galaxy go?

641
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,940
The fading of photographs.

642
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,300
A dying light bulb.

643
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,360
I'm gonna make it all up to you.

644
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,600
I'm gonna make it all up to you.

645
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:01,700
I'd like to give it all to you.

646
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,500
Across the horizon for an infinite time.

647
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,220
Dying of loneliness without the sunshine.

648
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,580
All together but away from each other.

649
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,240
With darkness between us.

650
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,700
With darkness between us.

651
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,640
I'm gonna make it all up to you.

652
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,040
I...

653
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,720
I'd like to give it all to you.

654
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,800
I'm gonna make it all up to you.

655
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,680
I'd like to give it all to you.

656
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,240
I'm gonna make it all up to you.

657
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,120
Without a funeral.

658
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,240
Before attempts, un dessevered.

659
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,240


660
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:08,100
I'm gonna make it all up to you

661
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:14,260
I'd like to give it all to you

662
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,280
I'm gonna make it all up to you

663
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,500
I'd like to give it all to you

664
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,060
Objects in motion, Earth, Venus, Mars

665
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,120
A place without gravity, I no longer see stars

666
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,180
Not far in the future, where did that galaxy go?

667
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,960
The fading of photographs, a dying light bulb

668
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,920
I'll cross the horizon for an infinite time

669
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,240
Dying of loneliness with eyes closed

670
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,220
Off to sunshine, all together

671
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,080
But away from each other

672
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,420
With darkness between us, with darkness between us

673
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,960
Let's let her see, let her be true

674
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,500
Dot com

675
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,840
Wonderful band that we see every year at the devotional

676
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,920
And before that we heard Gimme Back My Fun Thing

677
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,660
By the baby Philo Drummond

678
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,800
Singing with his old band, the Swingin' Love Corpses

679
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,320
This music in the background, by the way

680
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,620
Is Einstein's Secret Orchestra jamming at 6X Day

681
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,040
With Dr. Philo Drummond and Princess We Are Doe

682
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,460
As well as I think Dr. Lake King

683
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,900
And, ah yes, and now

684
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,460
We stand here

685
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,080
At this anti-progressiveness warehouse

686
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,200
Filled with so many of our comrades, com-comrades of ours

687
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,400
Kings of corn, we used to call them before the Bolshevik days

688
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,840
Back when the Tsarist police hunted us like

689
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,020
It's the Wellman-Hall Syndrome

690
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,820
Roman-Hall?

691
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,240
Roman-Hall?

692
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,200
It's an outside joke

693
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:22,800
But physicists on three international teams have discovered the Pentaquark

694
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,240
But did they take their fresh fruit, organic vegetables?

695
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,920
So you can imagine what it's like to be stuck on this narrow-gauge railway

696
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,100
With these subgenius gods all day yakking about their me shows

697
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,800
Yeah, they're one-wheeled narrow-gauge railways

698
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,240
It's like a unicycle

699
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,240
Railway?

700
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:44,460
It's like a railroad

701
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,380
They didn't catch on very well

702
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,940
It's like this bulletin that just in

703
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,240
No, subatomic

704
00:34:53,240 --> 00:35:01,380
You can't read the bulletin that's just in because it is a violation of FCC law

705
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,220
And they do, it is law folks, I'm not kidding you

706
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:11,960
We have to sign on to these new laws, these special laws, this high purpose

707
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,120
This is Pila driving around X-Tan's NARC car

708
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,240
He's speeding around a certain area

709
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,240


710
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,240


711
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,240


712
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,240


713
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,240


714
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,240


715
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,240


716
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,240


717
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,240


718
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,240


719
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,180
Super laws.

720
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,280
Enforcing the laws of the subgenius church.

721
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,580
If you were not

722
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,520
observing the laws

723
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,060
of the subgenius church during the

724
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,220
X-Day observance, it was

725
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,700
quite often seen that apparently

726
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,340
the old church would pull you over

727
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,400
and say, I notice you have not

728
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,020
offered me your phone number.

729
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,300
And they'd search your mind

730
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,640
and your

731
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,360
search your soul.

732
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,420
At your fine home.

733
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,120
I'm frightened by your shapely legs.

734
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,460
Your flashing eyes.

735
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,620
Your floating hair.

736
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,840
I am provoked by your weight.

737
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,980
All-consuming lust.

738
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,020
No for my lift, nubile flesh.

739
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,400
And so here comes Stang with his security force.

740
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,020
He's landing.

741
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,900
Up came Stang with his big boots on.

742
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,640
He says to Doug,

743
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,180
Oh, there he is. I see.

744
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,520
So this is a fake Stang with the helicopter landing.

745
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,440
And the real Stang is over there

746
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,740
behind the fence on that grassy knoll

747
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,120
with a set of binoculars watching.

748
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,760
And oh my, I see.

749
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,660
He's watching with his one hand.

750
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,560
Okay, so

751
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,740
we're going to go back to X-Day now.

752
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,540
The Amino Acids.

753
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,480
Live at 6XX.

754
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,200
Amino Acids.

755
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,360
Amino Acids.

756
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:54,520
Amino Acids.

757
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,160
Amino Acids.

758
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,840
Amino Acids.

759
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,080
The Amino Acids Live

760
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,380
at 6X Die Friends.

761
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,880
Ah, and they never stop.

762
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,840
And this is a good time for me to mention that at 6X Die,

763
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,480
one of the most joyous events is the Bull Dada Auction.

764
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,520
Yes, where the subgenius ministers auction off the weirdest crap they can locate.

765
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,980
Sometimes it's not just stuff.

766
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:02,360
Sometimes it is their own bodies or sex acts or glands or fluids.

767
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,700
Once G. Gordon Gordon auctioned off his septum.

768
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,240
Yes.

769
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,260
Yes, his septum for a lap dance.

770
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,820
Anyway, friends, the Bull Dada Auction.

771
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,980
You know, Bull Dada is the latest exploration of advanced surrealistic Dadaism

772
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,820
in which the mind is filled with dirt and lugs,

773
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,980
which trickle like mutilated centipedes down the sides of the now empty cranium

774
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,840
to find shelter and rest inside the now sightless eye sockets.

775
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,160
This definition of Bull Dada was broached first by the great Shredney Chisholm

776
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,040
in, I believe, the year 19...

777
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,380
1972.

778
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:46,220
Since elaborated on to include everything kitschy, marvelous, insane,

779
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,760
and somehow packed with meaning for the subgenius.

780
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:55,740
Although it might appear like this show to be absolute trash to those without discernment,

781
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:01,700
those pathetic normworms and pig boys who crawl their way through their jobs

782
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,120
and misperceptions that they call life.

783
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:05,800
Praise Bob.

784
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,980
Good morning.

785
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,400
Morning.

786
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,260
What do you want to talk about?

787
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,420
Oh, I have something else I need to auction off.

788
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,300
You know, every X day, some things instantly become relics.

789
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,200
And we have a couple of relics back at the camp.

790
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:20,940
That was three?

791
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,640
I'm probably going to get rid of them later on.

792
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,580
But anyway, a relic has been created.

793
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,200
Let me see the hands of all of those who know what teabagging is.

794
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:30,880
Yeah.

795
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,400
All right, you subgeniuses, you all know what teabagging is.

796
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,140
How many of you know who Doc Propp is?

797
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:37,960
Tea party.

798
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,240


799
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,300
All right.

800
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,440
That was a good one.

801
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,180
One human soul.

802
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:45,800
How many of you know what Chewy Chips Ahoy Chocolate Chip Cookies are?

803
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,020
Oh yeah.

804
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:53,960
Well, I'm here auctioning off Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies that have been teabagged by Doc

805
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,540
Propp.

806
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,300
Come on.

807
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,400
Right before the Bulldada auction began.

808
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,920
All my business now.

809
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,220
I'm going to get you a new one.

810
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:08,220


811
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:08,220


812
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:08,220


813
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:08,220


814
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:08,220


815
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:17,360
The going price for a brand new, unopened, sealed bag is $3.69.

816
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,200
They're mostly gone.

817
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,380
I was handing them out right before I came up.

818
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,380
Damn you!

819
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,360
Damn you all to hell!

820
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,960
I saved Princess Waif.

821
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,720
I would not allow her to eat a cookie.

822
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,540
But you, Stan!

823
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,480
Yes, you.

824
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,520
And the Lord.

825
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:44,400
The bidding starts at 50 cents for the last remaining teabagged cookies.

826
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,560
Think of the fun you could have at your next campground gathering.

827
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:48,960
$2.

828
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,180
$2!

829
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:50,520
Damn.

830
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,160
Going once, going twice?

831
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:54,900
Three.

832
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,760
The text will never go away.

833
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,440
Sold for $2.

834
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,120
All right.

835
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,660
Thank you.

836
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,940
Thank you.

837
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:04,640
Thank you.

838
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,120
Thank you.

839
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,540
Thank you.

840
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,180
Thank you.

841
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:07,500
Thank you.

842
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:07,500


843
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:07,500


844
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:07,500


845
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:07,500


846
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:07,500


847
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,020
I'm going to raise a bar.

848
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,720
And you're listening to P.R. News.

849
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,000
But there comes a time we need to get things done.

850
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,480
The time is past.

851
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,640
Yesterday was also Bob's Day.

852
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,700
P.R. News.

853
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:32,860
Support for P.R. comes from the Northwestern Pitt Children Foundation, driven to suicide.

854
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,500
From P.R. News in Washington, I will not say where the bodies are buried.

855
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:47,960
being taken and from this is PR radio seven provocative mental girls at noon

MPR's radical in reports Brad will not report in the coming days

00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,880
Philip Pan Beijing correspondent for The Washington Post has barricaded himself

00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,700
for the betterment of our planet.

906
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:32,780
Lubricated tunnels.

907
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,140
But of course,

908
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,440
people's funds for salty snacks

909
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,940
reflects a fundamental biological imperative.

910
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,420
All cells, in order to survive,

911
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:49,960
have to have salt.

912
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,300
They've just got to have salt.

913
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,300
They've just got to have it.

914
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,500
Every cell in your body

915
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,280
They're just licking it up.

916
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,460
They need a big old salt lick

917
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,220
to go down there.

918
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,420
A jumbo-sized bag of KFC barbecue potatoes.

919
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,420
So how many times did you do that?

920
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,140
I'm an ex-tanker.

921
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:03,460
What?

922
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,800
Did you say somebody was rocking out in there?

923
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,840
Oh my God, it's Carter LeBlanc.

924
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,920
It's Reverend Carter LeBlanc.

925
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:20,740
Ranting.

926
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:21,280
What?

927
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:21,740
What?

928
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:21,920


929
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,480
How dare he?

930
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,460
I can't.

931
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,500
Oh, this...

932
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,060
When Buddha sees me on the road,

933
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,340
he tries to kill me.

934
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,980
I abduct aliens

935
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,600
and I shove them up my ass.

936
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,640
I can kick more ass than a five-legged girl.

937
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:48,720
I floss my teeth with ten-dimensional hyperspin.

938
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:52,480
I blow my nose with the fabric of reality.

939
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,940
And I wipe my ass with the...

940
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,820
Why don't they shoot accidents?

941
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:58,640
Why don't they try to kill me with their own hands?

942
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,580
And with that, I kickcuności versus the dolphin.

943
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,560
I'm inTF.

944
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,340
Two- ceased.

945
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:08,580


946
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,380
Everybody tare you over.

947
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,400
He has transportation issues,

948
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:11,500
odds and straight to nothing.

949
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,140
But I'm wireing the way out for you already West,

950
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:12,140


951
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:12,140


952
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:16,920
with the view for a good reason.

953
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,960
It's cold outside.

954
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,140
Now I'm watching this show,

955
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:24,420
What?

956
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:29,160
Good shit! It doesn't matter if it's hot cereal! It doesn't matter if it's...

957
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,400
Friends, you can't understand a word he's saying, but...

958
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,380
Go, baby, go!

959
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:38,740
It doesn't matter if it's a crime budget! It doesn't matter if it's industrial secrets!

960
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:44,160
If you're selling good shit, it's not hard to sell!

961
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:58,240
Anybody, anybody who has studied any form of transcendental mysticism knows and know...

962
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:05,380
That this reality is an illusion! The things that surround us are nothing at all!

963
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,420
And that's a great deal for you! That's a great deal for your life!

964
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,140
Because...

965
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,060
In the world...

966
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:14,920
We live in...

967
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:20,660
If the world we live in is truly nothing, then Bob Dobbs has a great deal for you!

968
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,920
He's got something for nothing! And it's only gonna cost you...

969
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,600
$30!

970
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:36,740
Amazing, dear friends! The Minoan Brain Eaters opening for amino acids...

971
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:40,840
And Reverend Carter LeBlanc ranting his fool head off!

972
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,100
It's no use waiting.

973
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,680
Up to 20 years ago, there were many missionaries...

974
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,660
But in Monterey, all the built-up nullities around the world remained wanted.

975
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:03,740
Just like Bob Rhodes-

976
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,780
She patientlyθ sanctions for using women's money!

977
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:06,800
And leverages femt Jr.

978
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:06,800


979
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:06,800


980
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,700
...she is engage dnobs, who founded probes, create nuclear neutrality with a man whom her PE age considered a savior.

981
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:11,500
Once, we were born into a perfect civilization...

982
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,140
But in this government with nothing but bCap...

983
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,240
I mean, was there a mass?

984
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,900
Like Burning Man has a mass.

985
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:23,760
No, it was like Tranquility Base.

986
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:30,720
It would be like having a club at one of the clubs, one of the camp clubs, theme camps,

987
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,340
as opposed to the main stage.

988
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,200
There is a main stage at X-Day.

989
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:41,540
And the main stage is where the events take place, like, you know, the Bobby contest,

990
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,760
the alien contest.

991
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,120
They have to put up steel spears pointing out where the Bobby is at.

992
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,180
The bands that played were at the main stage.

993
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,020
I think I've seen that in the...

994
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,040
I took pictures of that.

995
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:59,100
There was kind of like an artsy band there that was playing Casios and had a...

996
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,980
His frizzling body hangs on the wires until it decays and falls away.

997
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:10,620
A fae-like lead singer that was spouting some kind of obtuse poetry.

998
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,400
Yeah.

999
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:17,660
And then they have, of course, the swimming pool and the various hot tubs in the area.

1000
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,020
There's like two hot tubs.

1001
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,440
Hop in.

1002
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,760
And then...

1003
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,700
That's just a copy.

1004
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,320
Don't jump in.

1005
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:30,100
You know, the various dump stations that we like to visit periodically.

1006
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,400
And all the various places where you can purchase your subgenius...

1007
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,980
Yeah, it's developed, but it's private.

1008
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,180
It's like Grandview?

1009
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,260
I mean...

1010
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,520
Oh, it's much more...

1011
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,540
It's more developed than Grandview.

1012
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,640
It's a private campground.

1013
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,180
Yeah.

1014
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,360
For privates only.

1015
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,000
No corporals are allowed.

1016
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:55,320
So, you know, people wander around without any clothes on, without feeling restricted or inhibited in any way.

1017
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,080
But they can play the violin.

1018
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,200
It's a show.

1019
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:03,380
Other than through the nasty stares of those traveling in subgeni that just gawk and gawk and gander.

1020
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:07,980
Well, when I get up in the morning and my feet are cold, I don't like to get down on some stairs.

1021
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,960
Flying over there.

1022
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:23,280
But then we were naturally endowed with astonishing powers of renewal, self-repair, regeneration.

1023
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,700
And here we are.

1024
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,380
You listening.

1025
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,160
Me talking.

1026
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,180
Nothing seems different.

1027
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,260
I don't get it.

1028
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,700
What happened?

1029
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,040
The aliens came.

1030
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,820
Let's rewind that.

1031
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,560
One millisecond when the world ended.

1032
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,580
Let's play that video.

1033
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,140
Wow.

1034
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,040
Oh, there the aliens are.

1035
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:49,920
Cut it.

1036
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:50,460
Cut it.

1037
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,540
I really like the way that sample caller made it sound so real this time.

1038
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,140
So that's what the aliens did.

1039
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:01,400
They came, they exterminated, and here we are.

1040
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,300
Are you getting enough magnesium?

1041
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,300
Well, I'm getting my zinc.

1042
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,360
And I'm also getting the...

1043
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:08,940
Look, he's packing his zinc in the air.

1044
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,480
He's going to do a seat bag and he's ready to go.

1045
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,040
What about the talking Apollo 11 lunar module?

1046
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,600
What about the maximizing your ear and brain function?

1047
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,700
Take technique pills.

1048
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,380
What about exorcising a demon?

1049
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,400
Yeah, we'll bring it up to about 190 PSI.

1050
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:29,160
These are the pills you take to learn the techniques it takes to make tapes that teach you those techniques.

1051
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,940
We're preparing for the end of the show here.

1052
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:31,760
I think...

1053
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,140
Yeah, we're starting to put our records away.

1054
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,980
We're putting our tapes back in our tape boxes.

1055
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:37,840
We're putting them...

1056
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:38,920
We're putting them in the...

1057
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:39,240
We're putting our...

1058
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,440
...in each tape.

1059
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:51,160
...all of our catalogs and our healing magazines and our various subgenius regalia back in its little packages and its holders and its holsters.

1060
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:51,880
Subgenius? You mean like Nancy?

1061
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,720
I'm putting my guns back in their holsters.

1062
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:59,480
And I am wrapping up all my fish, my dead fish.

1063
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,640
I'm just showing you my dying joy.

1064
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:08,560
Reverend Hal is placing his accoutrements in his well-worn leather.

1065
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,100
Leather attache.

1066
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,740
I call it my pouch.

1067
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,380
It's attached to him.

1068
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,360
It's sewn onto his back.

1069
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:16,920
Hmm.

1070
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,300
Well, okay.

1071
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,320
It may have migrated there.

1072
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:19,820
It's a back pouch.

1073
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,600
I haven't felt anything below the waist for years, but...

1074
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:23,200
He goes!

1075
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,000
What?

1076
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,420
We're doing the show over here.

1077
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,080
Slow over here.

1078
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:30,440
The matter of animal tissue thirsting after lusting after salt is of crucial importance.

1079
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:38,500
And to keep themselves supplied with this critical liquid, animal oils have developed ways for sensing sodium chloride.

1080
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:38,540


1081
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:39,360
And other salts.

1082
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:44,460
Then with their long tongues, they lick it and they snap it up.

1083
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,100
They lick it.

1084
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,240
They lick it.

1085
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,220
So I guess all this licking occurred at X-Tag?

1086
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,640
Ah, yeah.

1087
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:54,100
We had the big old subgenius salt licks.

1088
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:59,980
We all went down to the river together and we licked on the big old salt licks.

1089
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,220
So what happened right at the end of the world?

1090
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,600
What did you guys do?

1091
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,860
The X-ists didn't come again.

1092
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,180
And of course, I never get up.

1093
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,960
It's traditional that Philo always sleeps over sleeps.

1094
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:20,800
Knowing that when that actually comes, the sex goddesses will come to the cabin, the hierarchy trailer, for me.

1095
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:24,060
And I won't have to worry about actually waking up.

1096
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,340
If he is not going to wake up, we will not come down.

1097
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,040
Sex goddesses.

1098
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,860
Try again next year.

1099
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:32,880
They're plural.

1100
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,220
Sorry.

1101
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,380
Goodbye.

1102
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,160
Oh, you thought I was talking about sex goddesses?

1103
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:38,160


1104
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:38,560
I was talking about you.

1105
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,300
I get it.

1106
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:39,640
Okay.

1107
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,380
Well, I was.

1108
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:42,240
Actually, we were talking about you.

1109
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,000
You probably think this show is about you.

1110
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:44,320
Don't you?

1111
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,580
Especially if your name just happens to be Robert.

1112
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:58,180
But this show is about the one true slack master, J.R. Bob Doggs, the pipe-smoking super salesman

1113
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,680
of belief and disbelief.

1114
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:08,160
And the infinite detail can be had about Bob at www.subtitles.com.

1115
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:15,020
Or you can send me crap at stang, P.O.

1116
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:25,440

1117
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:31,680
Or send a self-addressed stamped envelope for free information to subgenius at P.O.

1118
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:37,180

1119
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:43,000
www.subgenius.com.

1120
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,500
And now, here's So-So Donna with his latest mix, Voodoo Crispy X Day 6.

1121
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,240
Bob is back, and he's better than ever.

1122
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,500
So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so.

1123
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,160
Are you ready, babe?

1124
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:03,980
Ready?

1125
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,160
Thank you.

1126
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,320
Thank you.

1127
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:18,660
Thank you.

1128
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:34,720
Thank you.

1129
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,500
Thank you.

1130
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:01,060
Thank you.

1131
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,520
Thank you.

1132
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,420
Oh, when the Dom's heads.

1133
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,700
Oh, when the Dom's heads.

1134
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:39,940
Oh, when the Dom's heads.

1135
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,920
When the Dom's heads

1136
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:42,680
go killing things.

1137
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:46,140
Oh, oh,

1138
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:47,700
I want to be in that Dom's town.

1139
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:51,740
When the Dom's heads go killing things.

1140
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:54,900
Do you know,

1141
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,520
Bob needs you right now.

1142
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:57,880
He needs your $30.

1143
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,740
Thank you.
