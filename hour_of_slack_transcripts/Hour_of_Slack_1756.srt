1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:07,780
Meanwhile, gaseous rhetoric and stupid, bombastic, empty speechifying.

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,380
The subgenius power of swat.

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,440
They need Jesus.

4
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,820
Come forward and open the flaps of the oxygen tent.

5
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,860
There you will find Farley Granger.

6
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,980
His nostrils held tight.

7
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,960
He is called a gape with jewel-encrusted tongues.

8
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:10,020
He offers you an appetizer of auricula and possum.

9
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,760
Braised in ash bar.

10
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,020
Nestled on a soft bed with organic free trade quinoa.

11
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,000
Bombardier beetles work boiling anal chemicals

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,960
to make the best of the skin.

13
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:36,700
Their throbbing owners of moral indignation

14
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:42,340
form a burning pentagram through which you must pass.

15
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,960
Into the twilight of the unknown.

16
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,440
Into the recesses where your darkest anxieties reside.

17
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,720
Where you will land face down in a hobo's yard.

18
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,080
Through a hole.

19
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,120
Intoラs, portal.

20
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,340
In the dark.

21
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,560
Into the Helen Greenwbage.

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,480
Into a campfire.

23
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:13,520
Into a remembrance murky old hospital.

24
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,420
divisel everyone knows him.

25
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:17,420


26
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,640
Axe is kind of the feel of rehci.

27
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:19,640


28
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,480
I smile at them, baby.

29
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,960
and all the people.

30
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:21,960


31
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:21,960


32
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:21,960


33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:21,960


34
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:21,960


35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:21,960


36
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:21,960


37
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,100
God gets you up.

38
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,100


39
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,100


40
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,800
for james h.

41
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,560
Thank you.

42
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,020
Thank you.

43
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,700
Thank you.

44
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,700
Thank you.

45
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,820
Thank you.

46
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,180
Thank you.

47
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,500
Thank you.

48
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,580
Thank you.

49
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,440
Thank you.

50
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,620
Thank you.

51
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,700
Thank you.

52
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,700
Thank you.

53
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,740
Thank you.

54
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,560
Thank you.

55
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,140
Thank you.

56
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,800
Thank you.

57
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:08,960
Thank you.

58
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,300
Thank you.

59
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:14,860
Thank you.

60
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,480
Oh, there you go, friends.

61
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,920
The slot rods.

62
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,900
Surfing glue.

63
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,800
That one's called Push Start the Fury.

64
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,860
But actually, that's not a proper rug for a radio show

65
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,200
because it's too good.

66
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,100
It's not a rug.

67
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,980
A proper rug.

68
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:08,140
It fights the laid-back ambiance of the blabbering blatherers.

69
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,360
Reverend Angry Lay is here.

70
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,880
We're the blabbering blabberers.

71
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,480
He's the agent for more than one of these bands, though, now.

72
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,060
He's got this whole stable of bands that he represents.

73
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,800
Wow, there's even the vinyl slack hole.

74
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,600
From PR News in Washington, I'm the guest PR supervisor.

75
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,020
Reporting.

76
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,400
There are reports, but there have been no reports.

77
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,600
The New York Times reports the FBI began shooting.

78
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,060
The report says the FBI were unjustified.

79
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,080
On Wall Street, 936-1313-612.

80
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:48,060
81% of 54,000, as well as 71% of 118,000, as part of PR News.

81
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,360
This is PR.

82
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,820
French commuters are stuffing themselves in front of Justice Department employees.

83
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,640
The Army said it pushed back French workers

84
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,780
fighting against workers.

85
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,080
Authorities in Chile say there has been some damage following a major PR news.

86
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,560
Oh, you just woke up.

87
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,360
Will one of you guys make room for Reverend Angry Larry, since you're just going to be

88
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,760
poking at your phones and being, you know, button pushing modern day millennials?

89
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,580
Hey, that was a question.

90
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,780
I answered you.

91
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,840
I said no, I'm not.

92
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,280
Oh, okay.

93
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,260
I'm not.

94
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:27,320
I'm not.

95
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:27,320


96
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,000
I'll make some room at the end of the table.

97
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,700
But I'm not going to let it encroach upon my tiny little two square foot area.

98
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,980
Yes, there's only so much that one might reasonably expect.

99
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,740
I'll sublet my six square inch area, though.

100
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,160
There are new, there's new business on the docket, and we will waive the-

101
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,660
I'm going to send him a line with a microphone on it.

102
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,480
The reading of the minutes will not necessarily have to happen.

103
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,780
But-

104
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,740
There is new business.

105
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,420
Oh, Reverend Angry Larry, I bet you haven't gotten your prescription yet.

106
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,900
What about your new album?

107
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,300
Handing out prescriptions.

108
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,920
Don't you want to talk about Reverend Angry Larry's new album?

109
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:18,400
You'll have to untie the arthritis proof knot before you can give him the pill.

110
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,160
In that case, I need a big sharp sword.

111
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,500
Are those those pills, Bob?

112
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,100
Alexander the Great.

113
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,180
Are those the pills, Bob?

114
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:25,960
Yeah.

115
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,780
We're going to give you some of those pills.

116
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:32,500
As soon as we can get through the knotage.

117
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:33,960
Give me the pills, Bob.

118
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,460
Give me those pills, Bob.

119
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,900
Some wiry old sailors tied some semen knots in the bag.

120
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,660
Give me those pills, Bob.

121
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:38,660


122
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:38,660


123
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,080
There you are.

124
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,300
Here you go.

125
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,840
Can I get some pills, Barry?

126
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,660
Right.

127
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,060
Now, don't allow those to overwhelm you with the side effect.

128
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,660
Them kind pills.

129
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,900
I need kind pills.

130
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,740
They're them kind.

131
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,960
Oh, they're kind enough.

132
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,540
To you?

133
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,360
They're kinder than they might be.

134
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,760
The kind pills?

135
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:57,760


136
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:57,760


137
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:57,760


138
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:57,760


139
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:57,760


140
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:57,760


141
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:57,900
Yeah.

142
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,820
Hey, I noticed that you bought your car at Dobbs Auto.

143
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:00,720
Yeah.

144
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,640
Yeah.

145
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,200
That's awesome.

146
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:02,540
Pretty good, huh?

147
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,940
Yeah, Dobbs Honda, actually, even though that's a Toyota.

148
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,480
Yeah, but that's all right.

149
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,160
You know, there's a lot of, oh, there's cotton batten in these pills, too.

150
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,940
You don't see that very often anymore.

151
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,700
No.

152
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,960
Oh, that's professional.

153
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,840
You get fake cotton now.

154
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,120
It's from a real pharmacy.

155
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,420
Yeah.

156
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,860
It's not made, it's not really made with, you know, cotton.

157
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,800
They don't want you to have cotton anymore.

158
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,220
No, I don't blame them.

159
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,320
Who wants cotton?

160
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,740
Princess Wee went shopping for my cotton.

161
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:27,740


162
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:27,740


163
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:27,740


164
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,680
She had cotton socks, and they wouldn't sell them to her.

165
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,820
She had to have a prescription.

166
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,360
Cotton Mather socks.

167
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,240
I didn't have my cotton sock prescription with me.

168
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,680
Sock and cots.

169
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,280
Box and cocks.

170
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,060
Right in the cot.

171
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,920
Right in the cocks, coccyx.

172
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,900
Right in the fat cot.

173
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,440
Good Lord.

174
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,140
This is what happens.

175
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,820
You put them on the radio, and that's what you get.

176
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,120
Overweight people sleep in fat cots.

177
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah.

178
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,540
Them and their fat.

179
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:57,720
Yeah.

180
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,740
They're fat cots.

181
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,460
How juvenile.

182
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,460
Big fat.

183
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,560
Trying to fat shame people in this day and age.

184
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,020
Yeah.

185
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,320
Yeah, because by the end of, by the time they wake up, no, they just sweat a lot.

186
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,620
So therefore, it's big, fat, wet cot.

187
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,980
No wonder this is a sausage fest.

188
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,440
Hardly any chicks are hanging around.

189
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,420
Actually there are some, but they're all among themselves.

190
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,240
They don't like being referred to as chicks.

191
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,220
They're looking askance.

192
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:28,880
Dames.

193
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,880
Well, of course not.

194
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:30,720
Dames.

195
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,000
Rods.

196
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,120
Dames.

197
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,540
Babes.

198
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:32,980
Oh, it's dames.

199
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,880
You know, the gals.

200
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,820
The fair sex.

201
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:36,800
Yeah.

202
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,960
Yeah, my better half.

203
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,960
Actually, she's not.

204
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,620
The smart ones.

205
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,140
My sleeping half.

206
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,220
Let sleeping halves lie.

207
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,360
Yeah.

208
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,740
Let lines your email.

209
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,360
I found it, but it wouldn't come up on it.

210
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,700
It says, welcome, Harry, but then it doesn't proceed far.

211
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,220
And it's a little bit of a, you know, a little bit of a, you know, a little bit of a, you

212
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:57,220


213
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,020
know, a little bit of a, you know, whatever.

214
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,020


215
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,020


216
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,020


217
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,020


218
00:15:59,020 --> 00:15:59,080
That would be me.

219
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,080


220
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,140
That would be me.

221
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,620
What does it do?

222
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,440
Can you say that?

223
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,120
Oh, you oh, F u c h.

224
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:08,960
Yeah.

225
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,480
Right.

226
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,720
Reverend Mad magazine's and stop publishing.

227
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,620
Oh, well.

228
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,720
Rory G Fox.

229
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,360
Yeah.

230
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,900
From PR news in Washington on safer than previous models.

231
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,400
Several airline executives hold a house panel today that their companies targeted senior

232
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,560
police officials.

233
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,780
At least six people were killed.

234
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,780
Police officials were badly wounded, including several bad children who were on their way to school.

235
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,600
On Wall Street 38132896235,

236
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,780
the Democratic candidates don't care for stranded passengers in the event of weather or PR.

237
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,680
PR's bad.

238
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,280
French commuters killed at least two people for nearly 11 hours.

239
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:56,020
President Bush is expected to announce a set of measures today intended to reduce PR news in Washington.

240
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,200
PR comes from cholera.

241
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:07,240
Hey, have you noticed that a lot of these new folks on subgenius sites are spelling Bob's name completely wrong?

242
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,120
I noticed. It's terrible.

243
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,780
They're talking about some guy named Bob, and I don't know if they're talking about the guy that washes their car, cuts their meat, does something like that.

244
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,060
But I always go, who is this Bob?

245
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,480
And it's really kind of funny because they'll go, you shouldn't be on this page if you don't know who Bob is.

246
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,600
And I'm like, I know who Bob is, and I spell it properly.

247
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,000
And yeah.

248
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:25,920
Then I was told.

249
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,520
I was told that I was being too much of a Bobby hipster by Bobby hipsters.

250
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:31,040
By being so strict.

251
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,560
Yeah, by being so strict.

252
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,120
It's like, listen, I take this religion nearly seriously.

253
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,640
Oh, usually they get dogpiled by the older and wiser ones.

254
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:42,840
Right.

255
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,620
Depends on which Facebook group you're looking at.

256
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,520
Well, I was looking at the official X Day.

257
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,140
The official X Day?

258
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,000
There shouldn't be anybody on there but members.

259
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:52,420
Right.

260
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,900
They should know.

261
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,180
That's why.

262
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,420
I asked the question.

263
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,120
Like, all kidding aside, how do you spell our Savior's name?

264
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,620
That's a tricky one.

265
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,780
The Saint of Sales name.

266
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,460
And then somebody will type out the Saint of Sales.

267
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,140
Oh, that Savior.

268
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:08,620
Yeah.

269
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,200
Oh, I love it when they go, who are you to be more slackful than me?

270
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:12,500
Right.

271
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,600
It's like, well, but for one thing, I'm actually Reverend Ivan Stang.

272
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,900
And you'd know that that was my pen name if you'd ever really bothered to read anything about this religion.

273
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,040
Oh, yeah.

274
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,480
The newest one is somebody going, how come Stang and Philo are never on here?

275
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:24,900
Oh, yeah.

276
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:25,380
Right.

277
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,180
People were like, uh.

278
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,260
That was on the Church of the Subgenius one.

279
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,120
So it's kind of funny.

280
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,040
Which one?

281
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,980
Well, there's two Church of the Subgenius, at least two.

282
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,380
I don't remember which one.

283
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,480
I just remember I kind of monitor it and listen to these people go on.

284
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:46,000
There's an asinine one and there's an official unofficial one that's run by our friends.

285
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,380
Yeah.

286
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,980
G. Gordon Gordon and Pease.

287
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,180
They're banning each other every other hour.

288
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,400
And.

289
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,680
Pickles has a pickup truck now.

290
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,620
Yeah, he does.

291
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,080
He picks up a lot more deliveries that way.

292
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,600
Pickles up truck.

293
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,720
Mm hmm.

294
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,460
Yeah.

295
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,480
I dig that.

296
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,340
You can find out what's up with pickles and a whole bunch of other things just listening to this program.

297
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:12,880
Oh, no.

298
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,960
Your tomfoolery is about to end.

299
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:21,380
Well, we've got this is our audience has doubled in size from two and a half to five.

300
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:21,960
Yes.

301
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,580
These are very favorable trends.

302
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,680
Our ratings.

303
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,280
They're certainly increasing.

304
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,520
And the back office is very pleased.

305
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,520
Guardedly.

306
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,320
They say, just keep doing what you're doing.

307
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,240
Constantly for that.

308
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,040
Well, the word just got out from from our announcement five minutes ago.

309
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,960
The Susie made it here.

310
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,040
So that's important.

311
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,160
You know, a bunch of people weren't OK.

312
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,680
Well, in that case, it's a real X day and all kinds.

313
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,120
Well, it's no phony X day with no Ivan staying there.

314
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,140
There's you know, I.

315
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,660
Call.

316
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,060
Talk about bait and switch.

317
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,700
I don't know.

318
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,780
There was some kind of standing on there, according to the tapes I heard.

319
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,660
I don't remember the original.

320
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,380
I just met Dr. X last night in the dark.

321
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,980
Paul Z did inferior.

322
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,100
And I think that's him.

323
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,720
Yeah.

324
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,220
Yeah.

325
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:22,640
Oh, I've had terrible conversations out here that went on for 15 or 20 minutes with some with the wrong person.

326
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,580
I thought I was talking to somebody.

327
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,700
That happened yesterday.

328
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,880
It happened again today.

329
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,800
Happened horribly two years ago.

330
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,000
I thought this person was peas.

331
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,760
And I just went on and on and on.

332
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,660
He thought I was insane.

333
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,820
And I felt rather embarrassed when I figured it out.

334
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,240
Well, who did it turn out to be?

335
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,880
Reverend Christian, strangely enough.

336
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,680
And that was his real name.

337
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,500
I mean, his human street name.

338
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,040
Conspiracy name as well as that's a double conspiracy name.

339
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,160
Isn't it being called Christian?

340
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,920
There's well, that was his last name.

341
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,520
Oh, okay.

342
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,360
There's another way.

343
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:10,500
And there's Christian Blatter who sends me a lot of very strange recordings and collages.

344
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,320
And he's an all analog musician.

345
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,200
Well, that's a good thing.

346
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:16,500
Yeah.

347
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,620
He uses only analog synthesizers.

348
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,220
And he only reads analog.

349
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,040
Analog magazines.

350
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,380
Yeah.

351
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,800
Analog magazines.

352
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,180
Yeah.

353
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,340
Analog magazines.

354
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:25,660
Yep.

355
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:26,920
So.

356
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,180
He's in the true cut and paste.

357
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,020
Christian Blatter.

358
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:32,920
What about.

359
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,280
With a name like that, you don't need a funny name.

360
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,200
Christian Blatter informs us.

361
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,460
Cool Hand Chris is the name he goes by.

362
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:41,920
Oh, wow.

363
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,940
Anyway, but he'll never make it here.

364
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
If he can't make it here.

365
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:50,740
Like most of them.

366
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,200
He can't make it here.

367
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,680
He can't make it anywhere.

368
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,180
Right.

369
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:52,420
Yeah.

370
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,300
That's right.

371
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,260
He was just a big five minutes.

372
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:55,980
It was serious.

373
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,700
So true.

374
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:05,320
Well, you know, we've talked about holding X days and gatherings at staying ranch, which is.

375
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:05,860
Yeah.

376
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,140
I brought that up to you one year and you were like, oh, no, never.

377
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,200
Oh, I'm sure.

378
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:15,200
I just cackled out among the red hot rocks, razor sharp cactus and scuttling scorpions.

379
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,120
Well, the cannibal rednecks.

380
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,220
And there's dinosaurs that walk around your property.

381
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,960
I've seen them.

382
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,180
Radioactive mutants.

383
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:21,880
Rednecks.

384
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,220
Rattlesnakes.

385
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,560
Engorged with venom.

386
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,380
I've gone to Google Maps.

387
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,240
A hundred and fifteen in the shade.

388
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,320
Ghosts go and watch the dinosaurs walk on staying ranch.

389
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,680
There are dinosaurs everywhere.

390
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,040
And I can prove it when I take my phone down off that tripod.

391
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,560
Profane normals will never understand subgenius esoterica.

392
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,820
Oh, he's going off to his camera now.

393
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,760
Oh, he took the camera itself off.

394
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,140
Well, it was only a half hour attempt to record.

395
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,940
It looks like a harp machine.

396
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,520
Well, it was only a half hour attempt to record.

397
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:50,700
It's a little bit of a mess.

398
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:50,760


399
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:50,760


400
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:50,760


401
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:50,760


402
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:50,780
It's a little bit of a mess.

403
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,060
I'm going to record us in any case.

404
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,860
I know what it is.

405
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,980
I wanted to show you that we're...

406
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,620
Anybody.

407
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,300
In fact, if you have the right to filter, I got this from Miskatonic University.

408
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,440
It's kind of specially made for me.

409
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:08,400
It'll show you that the ghosts and spirit creatures that are walking around a place

410
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,100
like this.

411
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,200
Very well.

412
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:10,600
Oh, here it is.

413
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,140
Oh, wait.

414
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,160
Let's see these.

415
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,180
But I'm not interested in the sprites or pixies.

416
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,720
Creatures that you're speaking of.

417
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,240
Yeah, all right.

418
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,160
Anybody can...

419
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,860
Now, you'll get your sprites and pixies anywhere.

420
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,160
Oh, yeah.

421
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,160


422
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,160
Very well.

423
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:22,600
Let's see what...

424
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,120
Oh, my God.

425
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,780
There's a triceratops walking right across the green room.

426
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,920
Oh, I remember seeing that.

427
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,800
That looks like a stegosaurus to me.

428
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:29,800
Look, here.

429
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,360
Hold on.

430
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,660
You have to hold it and follow the action.

431
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,980
The sound of a triceratops eating children.

432
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,380
Oh, there's some stegosaurus in the background.

433
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,500
That's the sound of a triceratops walking.

434
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,120
Eating children.

435
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:39,960
Walking children.

436
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,620
Walking on children.

437
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,940
Yeah, they are eating on Philo's head.

438
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,440
Now, this is very disturbing.

439
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,260
So...

440
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,040
That looks a little more real.

441
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,160
Triceratops and stegosaurus never met, like Queen Lizzie and the other ones.

442
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,160


443
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,160


444
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,160


445
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,160


446
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,520
Oh, that's the sound of Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots.

447
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,280
Philo?

448
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,120
That's too loud.

449
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:55,940
Shh.

450
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:56,860
Philo.

451
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,600
He's playing the Philo drumming theme, the pulsating TV theme.

452
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:02,760
The Philo phone.

453
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,220
It's terrible the way I have to scold him like that, but it's like a romper room that

454
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,980
gets out of hand.

455
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,740
It's like the Alvin show, and he's Alvin and you're Dave Seville.

456
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:12,780
Oh.

457
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,340
Watch me go take a break.

458
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,560
Once upon a time they sang the vodeo do.

459
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,340
But that was long ago.

460
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,000
Then everybody started in to boop, boop, a do.

461
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,140
They got tired of that, you know.

462
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,180
How do you like those guys?

463
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,420
Everybody puts in extra notes.

464
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,720
I'll overlook it.

465
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,520
But the tune for you and me is that swinging symphony.

466
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:50,900
Ding.

467
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,640
A-ding-a-dee, a-ding-a-do, a-ding-a-dee.

468
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,360
Oh, what a tune for crooning.

469
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,560
Ding.

470
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,980
A-ding-a-dee, a-ding-a-do, a-ding-a-dee.

471
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,880
It's got the whole world spooning.

472
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,060
Eskimo bells up in Iceland.

473
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,940
Are ringing.

474
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,240
They've made their own paradise land.

475
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,300
Singing.

476
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,120
Ding.

477
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,240
A-ding-a-dee.

478
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,500
A-ding-a-do, a-ding-a-dee.

479
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,980
Stiffly me ding, a-ding-a-dee, a-ding-a-do.

480
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,480
Ding.

481
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,220
A-ding-a-dee, a-ding-a-do, let me hear that choir.

482
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,920
Oh, what a tune for crooning.

483
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,120
Colossia.

484
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:37,920
Ding.

485
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,920
A-ding-a-dee, a-ding-a-do, let me hear that band.

486
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:46,800
Stupendous.

487
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,640
Now let me hear the trumpets.

488
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,360
That's not a trumpet

489
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,680
That's not a trumpet

490
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,480
That's a trumpet

491
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:19,340
Oh, what a tune for crooning

492
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,300
That's enough, fellas, I'll take it alone

493
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,440
Adink-a-dee, adink-a-doo

494
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,500
You know, boys, last week I sang for the Sultan of Passion

495
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,120
And the Sultan offered me his harem of 500 beautiful wives

496
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,620
But I turned them down

497
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,740
Because when I get up every morning

498
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,900
Who wants to find a thousand stock and tank it in the bathroom?

499
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,160
Not Durrani

500
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,280
Adink-a-dee, adink-a-doo

501
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,200
Adink-a-dee

502
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:47,980
Adink-a-dee

503
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,320
That note was given

504
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,540
To me by Bink Crosby

505
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,720
And was he glad to get rid of it

506
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,540
Simply means

507
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,040
Adink-a-dee, adink-a-doo

508
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,700
Now, listen, Dr. Howell

509
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,760
You spent about half an hour yesterday

510
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,420
Bad-mouthing these millennials

511
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,360
That are glued to their telephones

512
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:13,700
I did?

513
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:18,520
Well, I'm simply trying to access my e-mail

514
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,240
You see?

515
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,540
But, oops, this page was not found

516
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,260
Oops, we broke out

517
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,020
There's no service here

518
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,620
Yeah, you can't surf here

519
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,940
No, you cannot surf here

520
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,240
There's no surface here

521
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,320
It's a hard metal road

522
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,940
There's no surface

523
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,340
No, and see, you can see with Dr. Howell

524
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,720
The surface tension is getting a little out of hand

525
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,540
Because he cannot read his e-mail

526
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,720
This has to do with girlfriends

527
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,080
Yes, I got a...

528
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,320
Oh, my God

529
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,040
Girlfriends

530
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,300
Directing girlfriend traffic from far away

531
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,620
With no e-mail

532
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:53,960
It's our...

533
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,240
I agree

534
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,980
I'm speaking of female stand-up, you guys

535
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,520
Two women just entered the room

536
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,400
And at one agent

537
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,400
All right, now

538
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,460
Reverend Susie DeFluzzi is here with the...

539
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,260
She's our favorite buxom redhead

540
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,800
Yes, with Reverend Lucy

541
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:18,600
Oh, look, Miss Star-Sis-Star's getting his head ensconced in the...

542
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,520
Balcony of the Flues

543
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,280
The kindly...

544
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,500
What are you doing under the table, sir?

545
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,680
Susie DeFluzzi

546
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,520
She's a Flues with a heart of gold

547
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,120
What is that you're touching?

548
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,780
And a head of Swiss cheese

549
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,420
I'm talking over him

550
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:39,780
But her golden heart is loved by everyone who invests in gold

551
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,660
She just tiptoed away

552
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,900
Gold, you understand?

553
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:44,580
Gold

554
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,180
She's lured Miss Star-Sis-Star away

555
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,580
Well, I'm not sure if she's a Miss Star-Sis-Star

556
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:48,580


557
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:48,580


558
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,460
Well, she probably has a special gift

559
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,560
You know the way she is

560
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,680
She fabricates those gifts in her workshop

561
00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:03,040
My house is entirely furnished with Susie DeFluzzi gifts, decorations, clothing, furniture, everything

562
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,660
That same happens in my house

563
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,820
You mean that...

564
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:10,160
There's a lot of Susie DeFluzzi things that I run across in my house

565
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,720
Yeah

566
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,700
You know, we're...

567
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,660
The painted rocks that she did a few years ago

568
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,620
I've got those

569
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,580
I have those interspersed with my house

570
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:18,580


571
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,920
I have those interspersed with my fossil collection

572
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,200
I've got those proudly and prominently displayed

573
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:24,780
Squat a few

574
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,780
On the archway to my chamber

575
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:32,220
The first time my grandson saw the word shit written out

576
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,660
All right now, keep it clean

577
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,140
It was in a piece of artwork

578
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,260
Original A&W root beer cup

579
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,680
The framed piece of art by Susie that we put up there

580
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,600
Squat a few

581
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,860
Oh, look, well this will be...

582
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,240
Susie just brought me a water glass

583
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,400
With a fisherman and fish theme that says

584
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,540
Take two pills

585
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,280
Pills spelled with one L

586
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,840
The subgenius way

587
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,480
Pilsner

588
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,540
Well, I know, but it's...

589
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,120
Yeah, but it's more them kind pills

590
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
Get this

591
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,920
They do not what they do

592
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,420
Take your pills

593
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,040
There it is

594
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,460
The more them kind official pills

595
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,320
Oh, wow

596
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,320
Official pills

597
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,040
There's real cotton batting in there

598
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,140
Are these...

599
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,640
There's cotton bunting and...

600
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:19,780
Suppositories?

601
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,520
Well, they have the other...

602
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,580
It's real 100% cotton batting

603
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:22,980
Oh

604
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,960
From that Texas suppository building

605
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,160
They're sugary, I'll tell you that

606
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,640
Oh, good, my cheeks will stick together

607
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,920
Sugar, the vital building block of life

608
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,160
Mmm

609
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,100
Yeah, those two

610
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,880
Along with vitamin dough and vitamin grease

611
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,420
Oh, I like those cotton pills, Bob

612
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,540
And vitamin V

613
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,020
This is from the original...

614
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,620
Yo, you can take those

615
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:44,840
Oh, wow

616
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,580
These are for everyone

617
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,260
We got...

618
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:46,560
We...

619
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,140
These actually came from Sandy Boone Productions

620
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,940
You always have a bag of pills

621
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,840
And there it is

622
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,160
Well, I always have a bag of something, but...

623
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,840
Yeah

624
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,820
You have baggage

625
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,700
It's just one thing in it

626
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,000
Got a whole bunch of pills this time

627
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,500
You have luggage that...

628
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,540
From PR News in Washington, I'm in jeopardy

629
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:10,000
President Bush is accusing John Negroponte of genocide in Paris

630
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,620
On Wednesday, once again

631
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,540
Negroponte is bad

632
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,440
Negroponte derailed tracks

633
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:15,860
And the president of Pakistan

634
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,360
It isn't clear, though, that the Greek local power won its return

635
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,840
Congress knows to do

636
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,480
It is clear, though, that PR News is bad

637
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,360
From Washington, this is PR

638
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,120
More than 1,600 people completed a five-page report

639
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,840
The 26-page report summarizes the latest findings on Thanksgiving

640
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,840
A special 500-page report

641
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,300
Which documents France's role in this busy Thanksgiving holiday week

642
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,240
This holiday season is also the busiest time for PR News

643
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,860
PR offers you the gift of PR

644
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,180
Oh, oh, oh, oh

645
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,300
But now we need to focus on the locusts

646
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,460
And get some traction on the action

647
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,960
We need to stop spinning our wheels

648
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,320
The show is starting now

649
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,440
Now it's the hour of slot number 1,730

650
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,280
By the old rock and roll

651
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:13,580
And then we get our next game

652
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:13,680
The game is starting

653
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:13,820
One of Hollywood fans

654
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,320
About 200 miles from the barn, yonder

655
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,020
No, that's not gonna happen

656
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,280
I'm sure 22 x day

657
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
That's got to be it

658
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,780
That's got a ring to it, doesn't it

659
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,780
It does have a ring to it

660
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:29,560
It is, or otherwise it'll technically be the 24th drill

661
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,320
All these subgeniuses armed with 22s

662
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,360
Well, after all the mathematic equations and whatnots

663
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,380
When will 1998 actually be here?

664
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:44,340
It has already come according to the Dobbs down nano heliograph

665
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,840
Well but in that case these pills are expired

666
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,300
So I prefer to think that it isn't 1998 yet

667
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,500
It has just come so those pills are freshly

668
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,120
So maybe there's hope

669
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,460
Maybe it's tomorrow morning

670
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,920
We've got to get up at 6 in the morning you guys

671
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,560
Tomorrow?

672
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,500
Yes

673
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,240
Oh well I

674
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,320
Yes Hal it's July 4th

675
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,520
These nosebleeds keep me on my back

676
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,400
You know I might not be able to

677
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,920
Well at least I remember that tomorrow the world ends

678
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,420
And some people don't bother to know what day it is

679
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,580
The horrible wrenching sound

680
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,140
The day before

681
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,620
Those guys without earphones can hear you

682
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,720
Maybe you should go up here

683
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,160
Kelly

684
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:37,300
Kelly

685
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:37,300


686
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:37,720
I've been out of the way

687
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,900
Put on some earphones

688
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,840
So you get on the same page with us legitimate broadcasters

689
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,080
Philo's just sitting up there trying to irritate me with this

690
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,000
I'm talking, listening, doing the whole thing man

691
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,900
We're what you call color commentary

692
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,280
You guys are the guys doing the stuff on the sidelines

693
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,640
And we're accentuating the

694
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,400
The peanut gallery

695
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:57,820
Yeah

696
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,860
We're like Jim Ross and we're like Jerry the King Lawler

697
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,780
You're Eric Severite to our rocket launch

698
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,860
We try to make the dirty jokes

699
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,600
Fly past the censors

700
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,200
Hmm

701
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,980
Alright

702
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,180
Even if there isn't a delay

703
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:11,840
Delay

704
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,580
Delay

705
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,880
On the censor

706
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:19,900
That background noise sounds like what my gas station sandwich is doing to me right now

707
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,400
It is

708
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,020
Gas station sandwich

709
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,800
Oh dear

710
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,240
We actually got that from

711
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,940
This thing is an amazing thing

712
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,300
It actually picked that up

713
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:27,700
It is

714
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,040
And that's how

715
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,060
That's what we're listening to

716
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:30,900
We're listening to

717
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,040
To the remote Borgerigmus broadcast

718
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,520
Yeah

719
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,900
Borgerigmi Bluetooth

720
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,300
Borgerigmi Bluetooth

721
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:37,540
Borgerigmi

722
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,540
Yeah

723
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,220
Bob Origmi

724
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:41,960
Yes

725
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,260
The careful rites and rituals of the Borgerigmi people

726
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,500
That's

727
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,220
There you go

728
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:48,820
Okay

729
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,440
You're hopelessly lost in the

730
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,600
Cisgender patriarchal paradigm

731
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,260
With your evil egeomarchy

732
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,040
Here is my Bob Woodsism

733
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,180
Today is

734
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:02,960
In

735
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,020
Deep

736
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,880
Ends

737
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,240
Ants

738
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,740
Day

739
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,280
Bob

740
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:07,740
In

741
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,020
Dependance

742
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,280
He's got ants in his in-deep-endance

743
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,640
I guess

744
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:12,860
So

745
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,160
The ants in your depends are dancing

746
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,260
In da pants

747
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,080
In da pants

748
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,040
Ants in the

749
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,300
I got ants in my pants

750
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,520
In the plants

751
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,000
In my depends pants

752
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,620
Hello

753
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,340
Who should I say is calling

754
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,340
Al

755
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,120
Al de Pantsio

756
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,280
Al de Pantsio

757
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,880
Boy that was

758
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,280
Al de Pantsio

759
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,280


760
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,280


761
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,280


762
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,280


763
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,280


764
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,280


765
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,360
Some era when you could make prank calls

766
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,440
I'll cut the Z's on your two cheeks

767
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,480
No are we reverting to red again

768
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,660
We did that yesterday

769
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,760
No we did that this morning

770
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,900
We didn't do that yesterday

771
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,880
It was yesterday

772
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,920
As in Red's sugary cider

773
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,660
Red's pineapple AR

774
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,920
Red's tube bar

775
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,320
Red's

776
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,660
Red's

777
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:57,960
Yeah

778
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,860
Why don't you come over to my joint

779
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,360
You come over here and say it to me

780
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,720
Yeah

781
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,220
You come over here and say it to me

782
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:07,220


783
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:07,280
You come over here and say it to me

784
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,280


785
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,340
Red bastard

786
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,540
See I don't want to start into that

787
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,000
No

788
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,260
It'll never end

789
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:12,440
It'll trigger

790
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,620
It triggers me

791
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,100
I know the red bastard personally

792
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,400
Red bastard is a friend of mine

793
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,420
And you sir

794
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,260
Red bastard was friend of mine

795
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,860
He's a New York performer

796
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:27,020
He's very famous in his performance

797
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,720
He used to take me fishing all the time

798
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,860
He used to throw the ball to you

799
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,900
When you were just a kid

800
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,400
They say he shot the president

801
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,000
I don't think he did

802
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,260
I don't think he did

803
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,360
I don't think he did

804
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,360
Um

805
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,620
Cause red bastard was friend of mine

806
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:54,040
Hey Rudy, why is that guy across the street loading grenade launchers into his SUV?

807
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,600
Oh don't worry Waldo, that's just Trig.

808
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,160
He's probably loading up for his weekend retreat at the militia camp.

809
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,980
What the fuck is that thing?

810
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,740
I think it's either an Uzi or an AR-15.

811
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,260
Hard to say since I'm just a student.

812
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,400
I'm just a stupid fucking libtard.

813
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,580
Yeah, I guess we should just live and let live, right?

814
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,800
That's right Waldo.

815
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,000
In fact, I've even written a little song about our Republican friend.

816
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,540
Gosh, will you sing it for me?

817
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,280
Well, okay.

818
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,000
My Republican neighbor

819
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,220
Has a wife and a house and a company

820
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:32,920
That lobbies for deregulating privatized prisons to feed his family

821
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,240
Sometimes he wonders just how much money he's going to make

822
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,380
How big his daughter's tits are gonna be

823
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,400
He's my Republican neighbor

824
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,220
Hey, I've got a neighbor too.

825
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,720
Would you like to hear about him?

826
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,800
I sure would.

827
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,580
Okay.

828
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,980
My Republican neighbor

829
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,700
Has a white trash wife and an unemployment check

830
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,580
A Nazi flag that's the color of his neck

831
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,220
He's saving up his ammo for a new job

832
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,340
And for that glorious day

833
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,260
When the white man takes a stand

834
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,220
And the race war purifies the land

835
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,900
We're watching Dixie Land

836
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,780
But until that day he can masturbate

837
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,160
When he's watching Tucker Carlson

838
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,580
Look away, look away, look away

839
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,560
Dixie Land

840
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,120
Look away, look away, look away

841
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,920
Dixie Land

842
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,980
Dixie Land

843
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,900
Dixie Land

844
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:50,180
Dixie Land

845
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,120
Dixie Land

846
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:11,160
My Republican neighbors got a flag on the porch and knees that jerk

847
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,160
Dress it up on Sunday for they toddle off to church

848
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,000
Where a guy who fucks hookers tells them who they oughta hate

849
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,880
And there ain't no separation between the church and state

850
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,620
And Jesus hated taxes just to sure that you're born

851
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:30,640
But he'll always forgive you when you stare at kiddie porn

852
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,560
So long as you can pull your weight

853
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,420
When the good Reverend Hooker Fucker passes round the plate

854
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:42,180
Cause he's raising cash, oh yes sirree

855
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,080
For the lily white tent called the GOP

856
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,200
They're my Republicans, your Republicans

857
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,000
His and even hers

858
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,720
Everyone's Republican neighbor

859
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:10,600
And that was the Rudy Schwartz Project from the new CD

860
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,620
Take Me in Your Arms and Sing to Me Like Dick Powell

861
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:21,160
And now back to 22X Day Drill at Tarzan's radio station

862
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,380
Well that's a good robot noise that one is

863
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,220
A robot?

864
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,240
Yeah what?

865
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,740
Okay here's a doc, ask Dr. Howell

866
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,160
Why do some people call them robots and some people call them robits?

867
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,320
I don't know it always bugged the be jabers out of me

868
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:39,580
Me too

869
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,340
Somebody who says a robot you know

870
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,740
A robot or a robit?

871
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,120
Yeah that's just a

872
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:49,360
We, Dr. Howell actually Princess we and I say robot because of you

873
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,640
We learned it from you Dr. Howell

874
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:57,120
I'm riffing on it because I find it aesthetically unpleasant not to say robot

875
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,000
Robot

876
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,520
Or robot is the way it acts

877
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,680
It actually should be pronounced from robota meaning a worker, a servant, a slave

878
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,160
Row, row, row your bot

879
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,860
So robit is just off

880
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,000
It sounds like you're getting ready to say robit-a-son to me

881
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,700
Oh that reminds me

882
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:24,320
Down with more quack medicine than nostrums for desperate Ivan Stang

883
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,640
No actually I don't have a robot in other judge for now

884
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,900
No see you're giving the robot a command

885
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:34,560
Go ahead swill another shot of drugstore generic robit-a-son

886
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,040
Robot-a-son, D-M

887
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,700
You're telling the robot he's on your team

888
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,640
The D-M is a scary book

889
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:41,880
A-son

890
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:42,680
Right

891
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,100
Not them-en, a-son

892
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,720
It could be robot, robot listen

893
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,540
Robot this-en, them-en

894
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,280
This-en

895
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,140
Robot them-en

896
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,320
Aren't you glad you had this chair brought up here for me?

897
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,140
You brought this chair up here for me

898
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,660
And then you've got Shemp over here

899
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,340
And the others

900
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,020
Look we have a question from the audience member

901
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,000
I believe Mr. Sistar has something to say

902
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,540
Where do robots go for lunch?

903
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,440
Where?

904
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,360
To the robot-a-son

905
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,980
Oh well okay I would have said the

906
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,680
What do they eat their batteries?

907
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,280
The lube shack but

908
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,280
They get a fill up, a battery fill up

909
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,280
They plug in their USB connector into the handy USB port

910
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,540
They jack on

911
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,160
They jack on

912
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,980
Yeah there was a long Futurama thing about the guilt of robots jacking on

913
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:34,000
I believe my Ukrainian ancestors would say ra-bot

914
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,600
Well here's yet another way to pronounce it, ra-bot

915
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,980
That's just more commie fake news

916
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,280
Fork, fork like

917
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,620
This dirty joke that Philo is telling

918
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,060
Oh let's walk down the hill

919
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,980
Why don't you just phone Reverend Angra-Leary and tell him not over the phone Philo

920
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,360
Say what?

921
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,020
So it's just a mumble

922
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,140
A phonus

923
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,020
What?

924
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,340
He's telling you

925
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,740
It's an inside joke and I'm like well there's a microphone right there

926
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,980
It's not like you have to worry about FCC you know

927
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,740
Okay here's how it goes see I'm covering up the mic

928
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:11,820
You know that's the first good sound I've had from that mic off you

929
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,740
So I need to have a hand dampener

930
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,280
You should keep your hand on your mouth whenever you're on the radio

931
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,280
Okay no

932
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,020
No no

933
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:22,040
How about now just turn it the other way

934
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,180
Alright

935
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:31,060
He was telling the story of a hickory bull in the swelter of summer come in his great good time to the sultry biting herd

936
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,740
Oh I've heard that one

937
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,520
That's the one

938
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,480
That's the one that's what he was telling

939
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,500
I've heard that one

940
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,880
We've all heard it

941
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,520
Oh that's right we're gonna be at Drummond Farm next year right?

942
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,060
The tater farm, are you a tater farmer now?

943
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:51,640
I'm a tater farmer do you wanna come by and get some taters or I'll bring them down to you?

944
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,440
He's digging the taters out of the craters out there

945
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,400
I'll bring them down to you

946
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,020
Let's have Beck stay at your place

947
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:57,400
I'm a lot

948
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,820
Am I bleeding?

949
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,320
Huh?

950
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,120
Am I bleeding?

951
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,680
Where? From where? Your eyes?

952
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,600
Well you know you looked at me like I thought I had a hatchet in the back of my head

953
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,300
I was looking for potatoes in your ears

954
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,580
Firelar your face is on fire

955
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,760
I felt this unknown pain

956
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,060
Oh you got a bunch of ants in your hair so

957
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,760
It was not directed at any specific spot

958
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,000
It was just general pain

959
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,540
He's being complimentary

960
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,820
Boy Philo your face is on fire today

961
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,740
No I wasn't he's

962
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,220
Thank you

963
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,280
Jesus

964
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:35,600
My own suite of facial injuries has completely healed

965
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:40,940
Even the hole up here in the top of the head seems to be filled in

966
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:46,980
He's not exaggerating when we picked Hal up at the airport there were holes in his face

967
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,660
I had a bit of a mishap

968
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,960
Besides the normal ones?

969
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:50,540
Yeah

970
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,100
I did it

971
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,140
Extra ones

972
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,040
Someone's trying to hit a golf club off his face

973
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,960
Now he had, Hal had dived a hundred feet into it, three feet of water

974
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,520
One and a half feet of water

975
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,000
A bunch of rocks yeah

976
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,760
There were no rocks fortunately

977
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,500
Oh

978
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,460
Just the bottom that

979
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:07,960
Some sort of a side show thing

980
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,520
Slammed my poor face

981
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,300
Part of the flying Walendas

982
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,920
Yeah that was a performance gig yeah

983
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,520
Oh okay

984
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,120
I made a little money off that one

985
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,260
It was a bottomless abyss that turned out to be only one foot deep

986
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,440
A foot and a half deep

987
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,000
Yeah he says he got paid

988
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:31,380
What it was was some kid said I'll give you a dollar if you jump off this cliff here into that swimming hole down there

989
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,040
He was like show me the dollar first

990
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:40,300
Well the kid gave him the dollar and then he jumped a hundred feet into a one and a half foot deep pool

991
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,520
A kiddie pool

992
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,820
Scraping, scrunching along the bottom

993
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,240
He's now a dollar richer

994
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,100
Yeah

995
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,300
And a day later

996
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:48,760
Yeah

997
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,640
That's a sub genius for you

998
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,940
I needed it

999
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:52,300
Make a risk game

1000
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,040
I needed it

1001
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,200
They'll do anything for money

1002
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,440
Every bit of

1003
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,480
They'll take any risk

1004
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,920
Currency in order to lift off and come here especially with

1005
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,820
Encounter any displeasure

1006
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:04,020
Roommates saving all the bills to present to me at the last moment

1007
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:08,880
I had to get everything together and I did but it wasn't easy

1008
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,000
For a dollar

1009
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,080
For a single

1010
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,020
That dollar tipped the balance

1011
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,340
Hey would you do it again if I gave you two dollars

1012
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,740
I have several two-way bills

1013
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:18,740


1014
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,440
I had to spend mine

1015
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:28,760
They're not the ones that are colorfully decorated with images of TVs beloved monkeys and so forth that you can buy online

1016
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,700
My dad

1017
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,180
No I wish I knew about those

1018
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:35,940
My brother stole my two dollar bills and used them to buy heroin

1019
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,440
Oh your brother

1020
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,180
You know what I don't have my wallet on me

1021
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,760
Ah likely story

1022
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,620
You don't need your wallet here a thousand miles from the atmosphere

1023
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:48,740
He didn't do heroin but he sold it to I mean he used it to buy heroin

1024
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:48,740


1025
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:48,740


1026
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:54,160
My brother stole my two dollar bills so he could buy banana peels

1027
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,140
Are you talking about Phoenix

1028
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,160
To smoke banana peels

1029
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:57,980
Project Phoenix

1030
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,200
We rarely discuss it

1031
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,180
Project Sphinx

1032
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,880
Woodrow's seeds

1033
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,240
Hawaiian woodrow seeds

1034
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,400
Besides phyllo

1035
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,960
Hey I just noticed that

1036
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,800
What did you notice

1037
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,800
That he has a PH in his name too

1038
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,740
Ah but it's his last name is his PHD

1039
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:18,560
PHD

1040
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:19,740
Philodrumon

1041
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,180
Right

1042
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,260
No Sphinx

1043
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:21,980
Yeah

1044
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:22,860
Sphinx has a PH

1045
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,040
Right no I know that but there's no PH

1046
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:25,240
High PH

1047
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,460
Very high PH

1048
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,160
Sounds like the beginning of the monsters there

1049
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,700
This is my arse

1050
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,740
Are you referring me

1051
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:59,980
Ah no NO

1052
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,580
A door right here

1053
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:05,580


1054
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:05,700
Ahew

1055
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,820
Come on

1056
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:07,960
I've never heard of it

1057
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,360
죄다

1058
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,720
I'm notús

1059
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,660
Thank you.

1060
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,540
Thank you.

1061
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,720
Thank you.

1062
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,260
Thank you, skeletons.

1063
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,460
Psycho, that is.

1064
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,700
The psychoskeletons.

1065
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,340
The psychoskeletons.

1066
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,580
That sounds like Mr. Sister's stomach again.

1067
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,120
That's the borgerigmus detector.

1068
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,420
Oh, don't remind me.

1069
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,500
This sounds like he's talking.

1070
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:04,580
It's rattling from tube to tube, from system to system.

1071
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,100
Remember, man is a food tube.

1072
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,920
The food goes in here and it comes out there.

1073
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,160
A little too loud, Fyler.

1074
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,340
Buddy, settle down.

1075
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,100
I'm going to have to put you out.

1076
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,640
He's like dad outside the door when you're trying to listen to some Peter Frampton.

1077
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,400
You don't want me to come in there.

1078
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,520
Shut off that squirrel music.

1079
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,020
You kids keep it down.

1080
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,460
This is my last warning.

1081
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,960
Confine your shenanigans to the rumpus room and keep it down to a dull roar.

1082
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:41,700
Fuck it.

1083
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,480
Listen, we're going to be put out.

1084
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,500
It's raining.

1085
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,460
I know you don't like it outside when it's raining.

1086
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,700
Well, that was a nice show we had once there.

1087
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,620
I have no control over the dog.

1088
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:55,160
I'm sorry.

1089
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:55,620
Yeah.

1090
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,980
We're receiving wild sound effects.

1091
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:05,180
He'll bite some valuable piece of furniture or videotape and look at me.

1092
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,340
Are you noticing me yet?

1093
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,700
Are you noticing me yet?

1094
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,480
I'm noticing I'm about to place my dog.

1095
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,360
Doggy lips and palate on these valuable pieces.

1096
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,880
There's a dog over here looking at him.

1097
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:19,980
And as soon as he turns to look at the dog, the dog turns his head and looks away.

1098
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,160
But as soon as he goes back to the sandwich, the dog looks again.

1099
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:23,800
Yep.

1100
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,520
It's hilarious.

1101
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,620
The hope that springs eternal in the canine breast.

1102
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,740
It's hilarious.

1103
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,560
Hilarious.

1104
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,000
You see what I have to deal with?

1105
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:39,600
Well, why don't you deal a new hand?

1106
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,600
Here, we can just go on with our broadcast.

1107
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:45,800
Ouch.

1108
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,340
Don't worry.

1109
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,760
It's just as loud out here as what it is on your headphones.

1110
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,620
It's electronical music.

1111
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:54,560
It's actually much louder out there.

1112
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:57,820
The latest thing from the avant-garde.

1113
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:58,440
I'm not out there.

1114
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:05,220
I got a prescription last week for my scaly toes.

1115
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:07,260
An extension, you say?

1116
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:07,520
Really?

1117
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,460
I've got scaly toes.

1118
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:09,740
What did you use?

1119
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,340
You have scaly ptosis?

1120
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:11,480


1121
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,000
Honchitalisine or something like that.

1122
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,020
Can you email it to me?

1123
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,060
I can email you.

1124
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,460
It costs $74 a tube at Walgreens.

1125
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:18,940
Well, that's fine.

1126
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:19,440
It'll be good.

1127
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,380
Yeah, it's good.

1128
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:24,200
You don't have to skitch your scaly toes as much.

1129
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,200
You have to scrape the Glaxo out from between those toes.

1130
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,680
It definitely reduces the jam.

1131
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,280
New wild mountain blackberry.

1132
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:38,600
I saw there was some Amish people selling toe jam.

1133
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,680
By the...

1134
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,700
By the...

1135
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:41,720
I don't know.

1136
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,120
By the pint.

1137
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,100
More homage to the Amish.

1138
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,920
Do you know where I can get some butt paste?

1139
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,920
Yes, I've got some calmacine butt paste at my camper.

1140
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,440
He's got it right up there in his trailer.

1141
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,520
That's actually his toe jam, isn't it?

1142
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,040
I don't know.

1143
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,760
He's trying to trick me.

1144
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,740
It's definitely real butt paste.

1145
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,260
He sells toe jam as butt paste.

1146
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,660
Can't be on the Matrix.

1147
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,320
I have a great story that a lot of people don't know.

1148
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:10,960
I used to run an adult bookstore.

1149
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,240
Okay.

1150
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,280
And we used to sell things, you know.

1151
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,600
I had an old man that used to come in all the time.

1152
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,120
Marital aids?

1153
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:18,580
Yes.

1154
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,060
Yep.

1155
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,320
Had an old man that used to come in and buy stay hard cream.

1156
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:23,320
Okay?

1157
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,400
All the time.

1158
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,400
Well, we were out of it.

1159
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,920
Stay hard cream, anal ease.

1160
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,160
They were all the same exact thing.

1161
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:34,660
Okay, so the guy was out of his stay hard cream.

1162
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,920
And we sold him the anal ease and said,

1163
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:37,860
it's the same exact thing.

1164
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,000
Use it the same exact way.

1165
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,000
The guy came back the next day.

1166
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:41,980
Very angry.

1167
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,560
And said that he wiped this all over his asshole.

1168
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,220
And it did not make his dick hard.

1169
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:50,620
And we told you, put it, use it like you would the other way.

1170
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,740
But see, he read the instructions.

1171
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:57,240
And today that old man sits on the Supreme Court of the United States.

1172
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:57,920
Yes, he does.

1173
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,040
And he looks a little bit like a turd.

1174
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,240
A little bit pissed off still.

1175
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:04,760
Yeah.

1176
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,840
Because he hadn't been whacking it.

1177
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:07,260
Nope.

1178
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,500
But that's just to go, you know.

1179
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:10,980
Yeah.

1180
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,040
Certain things are certain things.

1181
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,160
You've got to be whacking it.

1182
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:14,680
Yep.

1183
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:17,360
You know, just blow out some impurities.

1184
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,720
Is any of this suitable for air play?

1185
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,320
Wanking.

1186
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,060
This all shocking vulgar waste.

1187
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,020
You didn't like the noises I was making on my machine.

1188
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,840
So I figured I would try a different tap.

1189
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,740
She made the noises in his mouth.

1190
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:33,020
Well, you can't let the poisons of the flu nads build up.

1191
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,460
It distorts your thinking.

1192
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:38,660
Now what?

1193
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:39,860
Well, you got to.

1194
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,120
You should give your tips.

1195
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:44,760
He's just been a really expensive piece of furniture and he's just looking at you now.

1196
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,820
Just waiting to see if you saw him or heard him.

1197
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,380
He's got the whole X-Day folder in his mouth.

1198
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,860
I'm not biting it.

1199
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,820
I'm just putting my mouth around the leg.

1200
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,580
I could.

1201
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,140
I could chew it.

1202
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,860
Just laying there with my mouth around like this.

1203
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,980
You could close his iron jaws on you.

1204
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,480
I could chew it if you don't take me out and play.

1205
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,220
Yeah.

1206
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:07,020
If you don't feed me, I could eat your chair leg.

1207
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,440
What a playful pup.

1208
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,120
Yeah.

1209
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:11,020
I'll get a bunch of delays on her.

1210
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:11,660
You left me ours.

1211
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:13,020
I am so drunk.

1212
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,340
The Kid Show.

1213
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:28,140
The Stan Kid Show.

1214
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,500
Welcome to Dobbs Town Kid Show.

1215
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:31,840
Going to show some cartoons?

1216
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,460
Kids have got to have something to do.

1217
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,320
Yeah.

1218
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:38,220
In this one, we put an iPad in front of our littlest one over here.

1219
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:44,400
And just let him go to town while we shop at Walmart and look at the marital aids.

1220
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,440
Isn't that cute?

1221
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,600
What a well-behaved group of youngsters we have in the peanut gallery today.

1222
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:58,120
It's a lot like the times that I've invited my grandsons to be on Hour of Slap.

1223
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,260
And what happened?

1224
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:05,400
I have to edit it down to five minutes out of ten minutes of screaming and nonsense.

1225
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,200
Saying fuck and things like that?

1226
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,980
Or it's even, no, they're doing the exact same thing Philo does.

1227
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,640
Because they can't, their attention span is just like, woo.

1228
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:15,800
Irritate grandpa.

1229
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,400
They're sampling.

1230
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,560
You're irritating grandpa, now be quiet.

1231
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,120
You mean I'm bad grandpa?

1232
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:23,880
No, you're irritating grandpa.

1233
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,540
You're irritating grandpa.

1234
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:28,540
Another form of...

1235
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,420
Oh yes, you are irritating.

1236
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,840
That's like a superhero name, irritating grandpa.

1237
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,260
A form of irritation.

1238
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,680
He wears his suspenders and belt.

1239
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:36,580
And belt.

1240
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:36,880
Yep.

1241
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,900
That's a super villain name, irritating grandpa.

1242
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:39,660
Yeah, irritating grandpa.

1243
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:43,120
Of course, the super villains all think they're the superheroes.

1244
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:44,600
Well, they're super something.

1245
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,140
And vice versa.

1246
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:50,100
You know, the Joker thinks he's the one who's on the side of right.

1247
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,980
And Batman's a hypocrite.

1248
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,400
Which, they're both right in a way.

1249
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:55,600
Sure.

1250
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,280
Well, they're both operating outside the law.

1251
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,420
Vigilantes.

1252
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,180
No one elected the Joker.

1253
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,640
No one elected Batman either.

1254
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,080
That's right.

1255
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:07,060
Batman has no super powers.

1256
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:07,980
He's just a man.

1257
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:08,420
Oh yes, he does.

1258
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:09,700
Wealth.

1259
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,920
He's just a man.

1260
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:11,540
No, he's rich.

1261
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:12,740
He says he's just a man.

1262
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:15,360
He pointed that out to The Flash in that last movie.

1263
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:15,740
Oh, did he?

1264
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,160
Yeah, The Flash goes, so what's your super power, sir?

1265
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,180
I'm rich.

1266
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:19,820
Oh.

1267
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:20,780
Yeah.

1268
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,260
It's the only good line in the whole movie.

1269
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:23,840
I drive a really bad ass car.

1270
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:24,560
Yeah.

1271
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,520
You've just heard everything in the movie we're seeing.

1272
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,400
Actually, it wasn't too bad.

1273
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,020
And what was the name of that movie?

1274
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,260
Batman versus Aquaman versus Superman versus Wonder Woman versus Lex Luthor.

1275
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,320
Was that the Justice League of America?

1276
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:36,860
I don't know.

1277
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:37,840
They're all on the same team.

1278
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,400
Just Us League of America?

1279
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:40,600
Oh, now I get it.

1280
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:41,720
It's like a religious thing.

1281
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:46,340
All the religions all believe in the same thing, but they all want to kick the snot

1282
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:46,940
out of one another.

1283
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:47,300
Yeah.

1284
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:47,900
I wasn't kidding.

1285
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,060
That's the same thing with all the superheroes.

1286
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,240
I find it hard to keep these movies, sir.

1287
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:55,040
The only thing they all believe that's in common is that they have the right belief.

1288
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:55,940
Yeah.

1289
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,520
Which movie was that?

1290
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,140
And all the other guys are wrong.

1291
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:00,920
The Ten Commandments.

1292
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,700
Justice League.

1293
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,780
Oh, Justice League of America.

1294
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:04,620
Yeah.

1295
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,840
Yeah, I saw the Ten Commandments again.

1296
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:06,840


1297
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:06,840


1298
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:06,840


1299
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:06,840


1300
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:06,840


1301
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,580
I saw the Ten Commandments again too recently.

1302
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:13,000
Basically, in the end, as usual, like in real life, Wonder Woman has to come in and kick

1303
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,680
everybody's ass and get them to, you know, go to bed.

1304
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,060
And clean the furniture.

1305
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,240
And clean the furniture.

1306
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:18,580
Yeah, right.

1307
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,320
And clean up your room and go to bed.

1308
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,960
Stupid superheroes.

1309
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:22,520
Mm-hmm.

1310
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:24,580
Yeah.

1311
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:27,840
A bunch of smelly, tight-wearing creeps.

1312
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:34,280
Oh, it's just the women's conspiracy is making all the women superheroes into the, you know,

1313
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,000
top dogs.

1314
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:35,800
Yeah.

1315
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,480
Captain Marvel, I don't understand.

1316
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:42,780
Somehow, this female character, what happened to the Big Red Cheese?

1317
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:49,800
They had to change his name because the Marvel trademarked the Captain Marvel thing before

1318
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,180
the Shazam guys did.

1319
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,000
The Big Cheese?

1320
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,440
Is that like Flaming Carrot?

1321
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:53,740
Yeah.

1322
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:57,780
They used to call Captain Marvel, or the villains in Captain Marvel, used to call

1323
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:01,040
him the Big Red Cheese as they mocked him.

1324
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:06,580
Remember, Captain Marvel was a super being, but he was secretly, actually, crippled,

1325
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,860
rich, Warszaw be-b guilt, apparently.

1326
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:10,860
He was a poor MALE.

1327
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,580
He was a poor little minnow.

1328
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:12,900


1329
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:18,980
The captain of the big awesome crew.

1330
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:19,220
It's right.

1331
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:19,220


1332
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:19,220


1333
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:19,220


1334
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:19,720
I can't believe races where you can change someone's actionว

1335
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,600
because you can't change the expression that seems unscientific, but just the focusing

1336
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,280
levels of bracome.

1337
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,960
Trying to get those mountains, like in Cycl Scot.

1338
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,140
Yeah, like in IPYO today.

1339
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:31,140


1340
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,400
Just like in the班уш시죠 Jun death movie, which is considered to be Königreich

1341
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:32,400


1342
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:32,400


1343
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,640
All these are like either Y两kalena here, or night?

1344
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,400
As long as you can remember.

1345
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,140
Junk and the Mori people.

1346
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:36,160
Right?

1347
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:43,500
But now it's like Mary Marvel turning into Captain Marvel.

1348
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:49,620
We'll gently fade out on that nerd comic book yak fest

1349
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:55,200
with a big thanks to Dr. Howell, Philo Drummond, and Reverend Angry Larry.

1350
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:59,080
We'll surely continue this next week or year.

1351
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:04,840
In the meantime, you can know everything worth not knowing

1352
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,520
at subgenius.com,

1353
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:13,940
the cobweb-wrapped archive of the Church of the Subgenius.

1354
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:18,840
Yeah, it's old, but the front pages will point you to current subgenius activity

1355
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,720
which is best followed on social media,

1356
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:27,820
which I can't and don't have to edit or archive

1357
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:31,120
because there's just too damn much.

1358
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:32,080
Praise Bob.

1359
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,820
That's subgenius.com.

1360
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,360
Yeah.
