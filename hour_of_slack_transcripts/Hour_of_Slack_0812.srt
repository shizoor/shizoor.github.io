1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,000
The greatest trick the devil ever pulled

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,720
was convincing the world he didn't exist.

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,760
And like that, he's gone.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,320
This is your last chance.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,040
After this, there is no turning back.

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,040
You take the blue pill.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,660
The story ends.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,100
You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,840
You take the red pill.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,500
You stay in Wonderland.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,020
And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,380
Remember, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,000
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slang.

14
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,320
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,160
Make way.

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,000
Quoted.

17
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,340
I created light and created darkness, created goodness and created evil.

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,260
I, the Lord God, do all these things.

19
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,240
God is the source of evil and he admits it.

20
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,280
What's the burr under your saddle?

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,920
Sweet mother of God, what is the holdup?

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,560
I think we're at a cool. We can go.

23
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,100
We can go.

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,060
We can go.

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,200
We can go.

26
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:27,280
We can go.

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,280


28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,280


29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,280


30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,280


31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,280


32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,280


33
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,460
We can go.

34
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,600
We can go.

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:34,600


36
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:34,600


37
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,140
We can go.

38
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:35,180


39
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:35,180


40
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:35,180


41
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:35,180


42
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:35,180


43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,200


44
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,200


45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,200


46
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,200


47
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,200


48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,680
What the hell do you think you're doing?

49
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,560
Dragging your butt through the day?

50
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,960
Selling body and soul to a bunch of bland normals?

51
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,380
Acting stupid so they'll think you're one of them?

52
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,180
Tired of getting all of the guilt but none of the sex.

53
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,240
There is a simple answer dear friend.

54
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,000
A glowing beacon of slack amidst the turmoil and darkness.

55
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,300
It's JR Broadcast.

56
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,820
J R Broadcast.

57
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:04,140
Bob Dobbs, the living slack master in his church of the subgenius.

58
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,160
Bob brings a new destiny for the abnormal.

59
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:15,660
For Bob comes to justify our sins, to unmask the conspiracy, and to get us back the slack they stole away.

60
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,460
It's us versus them.

61
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,580
Are you going to fry in hell on earth alongside the pink boys?

62
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,480
Or will you pull the wool over your own eyes and accept Bob into your mind?

63
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,280
Repent. Quit your job.

64
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,160
Slack off and praise Bob.

65
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,840
Church of the subgenius eternal salvation will triple your money back.

66
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,880
Man, you are one pathetic loser.

67
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,140
There's a lot of triple tonguing in this arrangement.

68
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,920
Oh, I think I'll manage, thank you.

69
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,660
Are you digging this character? He's gonna manage.

70
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,660
So your boots are laced, Junior. We'll all read, all read, all read.

71
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,280
Give it to me. A one, a two, a seat, a zoo.

72
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,000
criteriously

73
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,080
our

74
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,100
and

75
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,860
have all theae sprawl

76
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:45,900
day 130

77
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:45,920
dean

78
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,700
And all American boy sings his way into your heart.

79
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,000
Anything is possible.

80
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,700
Simultaneously getting all kinds of polytonal effects.

81
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,160
Don't make us print those skin shots.

82
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,520
We'll dominate over the...

83
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,340
We'll dominate over the...

84
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,020
We'll dominate over the...

85
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,340
We'll dominate over the...

86
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,200
We'll dominate over the...

87
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,640
We'll dominate over the...

88
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,080
We'll dominate over the...

89
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,320
We'll dominate over the...

90
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,840
You're sick.

91
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,520
Yeah.

92
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,620
Going newly.

93
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,500
Higher, faster, farther, longer.

94
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,940
All right, one note.

95
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,340
I love it, man.

96
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,560
It's the greatest.

97
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,440
I'm in yellow tomorrow.

98
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,360
A frenzy of music and action.

99
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,140
Won't.

100
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,100
Reality is a sad new face.

101
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,400
And, uh, we're gonna be in the music at the floor.

102
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,540
As I said to him, to him, to him.

103
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,280
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.

104
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,520
The gals have laughed and have followed me when I left their dressing room, but, uh,

105
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,620
I said, I imagine they were expecting somebody rather groovy looking, and, uh,

106
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,040
well, there you go, disappointed.

107
00:04:59,400 --> 00:04:59,600
Anyway.

108
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,580
Oh, anyway, anyway, anyway.

109
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,240
Dear friends, that was a collage.

110
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,640
By Electric Elf.

111
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,060
Yes, Electric Elf.

112
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,180
And we'll be hearing more from Electric Elf.

113
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:22,580
Before that, some of the subgenius MTV soundtrack by me and Mark Mothersbaugh.

114
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,600
And the music in the background is the Swingin' Love Corpses, friends,

115
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,480
from the brand-newly-released Infamous Bay Dat Sessions.

116
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,940
So nice to have that.

117
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,220
And, uh, and friends, it's, uh,

118
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,540
it's been a rough, uh, few weeks of slack, you might say.

119
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,400
This, we're nearing now the Christmas Eve of destruction,

120
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,460
and I'm late, my friends, I'm late.

121
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,780
I actually fell behind a whole week's worth of hour of slack.

122
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,340
That's the first time that's happened in 14 years

123
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,900
due to, uh, an illness among loved ones,

124
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,920
which is all better now.

125
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,280
But, uh, but we're back.

126
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,400
We're back in Cleveland.

127
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,600
And, uh, trying to, uh, to catch up.

128
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:17,700
And, uh, luckily there were some great war-related songs posted to all Binary Slack,

129
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,040
uh, by, uh, Popes Lilith and various other folks as well.

130
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:29,280
And, uh, uh, and there's a new James Kochalka Superstar album out, my dear, dear friends.

131
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,900
And, uh, I got to, to pulling stuff off of a Burning Man collection that,

132
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,160
of just all kinds of music that Gustav Salas,

133
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,000
gave to us.

134
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,360
There's, uh, KPFA, uh, old new, old KPFA that sounds just like it's new,

135
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,840
with Puzzling Evidence and Dr. Howell,

136
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,780
and of course, uh, some ESO.

137
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,860
But first, but first, my friends,

138
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:56,300
James Kochalka Superstar with this, uh, song from the album of the same name,

139
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,900
Don't Trust Whitey.

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,480
.

141
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:01,480

00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:03,540


151
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,640
.

152
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:04,640


153
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:04,640

.

161
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,160
Don't trust whitey.

162
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,540
Whitey is not very nice.

163
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,140
He's not friendly.

164
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,020
He always cheats and he lies.

165
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,780
Whitey is white as a ghost.

166
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,280
Whitey as white as the snow.

167
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,100
Why is whitey so mean?

168
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,760
Nobody, nobody knows.

169
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,000
Don't trust whitey.

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,140
Don't trust him whatever you do.

171
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:43,760
He's not friendly, you know that Whitey hates you

172
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,100
Whitey is white as a ghost Whitey is white as the snow

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,360
Don't trust Whitey No!

189
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,980
Don't trust Whitey No!

190
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,020
Don't trust Whitey or you will be screwed

191
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,880
Whitey is white as a ghost

192
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,480
Whitey is white as the snow

193
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,280
I hate Whitey the most

194
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,100
I hate his white little nose

195
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,780
Whitey is white as a ghost

196
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,380
Whitey is white as the snow

197
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,220
I hate Whitey the most

198
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,980
I hate his white little Тоes

199
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,020
Why ye, no, don't trust

200
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:50,740
Why ye, why ye

201
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,880
No, don't trust

202
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:01,400
Why ye, why ye

203
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,760
No, don't trust

204
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:12,360
Why ye, why ye

205
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,640
No, don't trust

206
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:23,180
Why ye, why ye

207
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,560
No, don't trust

208
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,700
Why ye

209
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,160
Why ye

210
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,440
No, don't trust

211
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,400
Why ye

212
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,100
No, don't trust

213
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,680
Why ye, why ye

214
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,140
No, don't trust

215
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,800
Why ye, why ye

216
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:28,680
No, don't trust

217
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,020
Why ye, why ye

218
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,960
They took the whole eastern nation

219
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,860
Put us on this reservation

220
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,020
Took away our ways of life

221
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,480
Brotherhood and the culture knife

222
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,020
Took away our native tongue

223
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,740
And told the English to hurry on

224
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,560
And all the things we made by hand

225
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,720
Are now a taste made in Japan

226
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,920
Eastern people

227
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,220
Eastern tribe

228
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,200
So proud to live

229
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,500
So proud to die

230
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:36,260
They took the whole eastern nation

231
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,360
Lotus in this reservation

232
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:53,100
Blood on we were blue shirts and tie

233
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,840
They took the whole eastern nation

234
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:56,840


235
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:56,840


236
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,340
We're still the red men deep inside

237
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,200
Although they changed our ways of hope

238
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,520
They'll never change our heart and soul

239
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,840
We're the red men deep inside

240
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:26,840


241
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:26,840


242
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,640
And on Sunday when the world has learned

243
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,820
Civilization will return

244
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,440
Will return

245
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,680
Will return

246
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,540
Will return

247
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,840
Will return

248
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,880
Will return

249
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,020
Will return

250
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,960
Will return

251
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,380
Will return

252
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,300
We'll return

253
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,460
We'll return

254
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:05,660
We'll return

255
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:05,660


256
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:05,660


257
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:05,780
We'll return

258
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,160
Ladies and gentlemen

259
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,420
Our mayor has asked that we all remain calm in this emergency

260
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,440
Everything possible will be done to protect you

261
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,380
On orders from Washington

262
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,320
The Commander of Strategic Defense has alerted all branches of the service

263
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,980
This is not the usual flying saucer scare

264
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,820
This unidentified aircraft was seen by thousands of Americans

265
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:24,820


266
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,020
thousands as it flew through the Lincoln Tunnel.

267
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,580
If they're not careful, they're going to have an accident.

268
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,560
Anyone sighting a strange aircraft, phone your nearest branch of civilian air defense.

269
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,940
What are we going to do now?

270
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,100
We either go to Mars or get shot down.

271
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,680
So we'll go to Mars.

272
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,660
We'll go to Mars.

273
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:49,360
The road to the western lands is by definition the most dangerous road in the world.

274
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:56,840
For it is a journey beyond death, beyond the basic God standard of fear and danger.

275
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:07,300
It is the most heavily guarded road in the world, where it gives access to the gift that supersedes all other gifts.

276
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,540
Immortality.

277
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,520
The road to the western lands is devious, unpredictable.

278
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,560
Today's easy passage may be tomorrow's death trap.

279
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,000
The obvious road is almost always a fool's road.

280
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,340
And beware the middle road.

281
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,320
The roads of moderation, common sense and careful planning.

282
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,140
However,

283
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,000
there is a time for planning, moderation and common sense.

284
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:26,900
Paul Richard

285
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:26,900


286
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:46,680
The unredeemable

287
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:49,300
College of Engineering

288
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:49,320
victims,

289
00:17:49,360 --> 00:18:00,560
A dangerous road, every pitfall, every error, every snare to which every man has been liable since the beginning.

290
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,740
You are sure to meet on the road to the western lands.

291
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,320
You are sure to meet on the road to the western lands.

292
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:19,340
You are sure to meet on the road to the western lands.

293
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:48,500
You are sure to meet on the road to the western lands.

294
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,940
You are sure to meet on the road to the western lands.

295
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,060
The guilt and horror, fear, hate, disease, and death of human history

296
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,540
throws the green yield in the western lands.

297
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:43,160
How long does it take a man to learn that he does not and cannot want what he wants?

298
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,260
You have to be in hell to see heaven.

299
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,340
Eclipses and all the rest of it are in heaven.

300
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,140
The land of the dead.

301
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,120
Flashes of serene, timeless joy.

302
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,760
A joy as bold as suffering and despair.

303
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,300
Ooh la la, dear friends.

304
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,820
Reverend Bill Burroughs, William S. Burroughs there.

305
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,340
From a collection that I'm not sure what it is.

306
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:26,720
Before that, we heard some news from Abbott and Costello go to Mars.

307
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,460
I rented that because it has space princesses and space queens in it.

308
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,540
They actually go to Venus.

309
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:41,360
But at one point, Abbott and Costello sort of destroy the ghost of the World Trade Center.

310
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,040
And it's just amazing.

311
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,220
I would just say check SubSight or rent that movie.

312
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,160
It's very strange.

313
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,180
Before that, friends.

314
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,940
How about that Leibach version of the old Indian reservation?

315
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,400
They call it National Reservation.

316
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,020
Leibach.

317
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,760
It's strange indeed.

318
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,140
From next, friends, some Einstein's Secret Orchestra ESO Swamp Radio.

319
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,400
But first, before that, Michael Pepe.

320
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,340
St. Michael Pepe on Dr. Philo Drummond's phone message machine.

321
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,040
September 11th at 4.53.

322
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,120
P.M.

323
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,560
Hey, what happened, man?

324
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,120
What happened?

325
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:31,180
I got this two, the two flags that I can see from my window here are both a half-mass,

326
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,640
man.

327
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,620
Who died?

328
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,480
I'm kind of concerned.

329
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:41,200
I hope another president didn't get assassinated and then, you know, another assassin get assassinated

330
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,100
by the assassin's assassin.

331
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,220
Because, you know, I'm sick of that .

332
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,180
Um.

333
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,020
Uh.

334
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,660
Well, yeah, what happened?

335
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,120
Well, anyway.

336
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,140
By the way, you know what?

337
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,500
Did you ever, you know, did you ever notice that when you picked the skin off your feet,

338
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:06,240
even though, you know, I took a shower last night, but just, you know, just having my,

339
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:17,540
having worn the socks that I wore at Burning Man like 20 hours ago, you know, and my feet

340
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,880
were clean when I put them in.

341
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:30,760
And, uh, it's really, it's very sweet.

342
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,400
Do you ever notice that?

343
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,120
Do that, you know, put on the socks that you wore at Burning Man, even just for a few minutes,

344
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,280
and then peel the, um, the skin off your feet and eat it.

345
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,320
And, uh, it, it, it has a nice little, uh, sweet taste.

346
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,360

370
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,300
I knew it.

371
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,120
They, they made them go, they made, they made me go home.

372
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,280
Hello?

373

381
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:18,840

00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:18,840


384
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:18,840


385
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:18,840


386
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:18,840


387
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:18,840


388
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:18,840


389
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:18,840


390
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:18,840

396
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:06,920
part of the act i thought you were i thought there was actually a buzzing signal had intercepted us

397
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,180
well that may also be true i thought we were split up

398
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,800
i thought like

399
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,000
you

400
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:18,300
know some signal from langley or or cape meat or whatever the name of it is you just split us

401
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,240
right in three different parts and we're like no dave it was the black helicopters in hush mode

402
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:32,080
yeah bombs not racism man okay what's coming down to is it's coming up to the time when we're going

403
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,920
to have to accept the fact that the only way we're going to be able to survive is to live solely in

404
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,700
our avatars in our avatars as a building until the power goes out

405
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:49,540
an avatar is a person not a building you're talking about live through your yeah yeah in the metaverse

406
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:57,180
right so it's like we're gonna have to move to the metaverse dave well i've already been meta

407
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:03,200
and i think we all have at some time in our proto existence a thought in the mind of the exuberant

408
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,000
well they're cutting down on the mail in federal offices now they're uh some geniuses who work in

409
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,680
such offices have told me they've been told we are not accessible to the public and we're not

410
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:12,680


411
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:20,340
accepting snail mail at all at this office tell your people to email or fax all documentation

412
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:31,360
because you know in your role as a avatar of evil perhaps even would you uh perhaps tell people to uh

413
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,380
what would you tell them to do i don't know they can read your email starting tomorrow without

414
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:42,180
opening it you know without right right they've said the postmaster general said wash your hands

415
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:49,580
you must use your mail well i heard if you can just use email which we can read well and all

417
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,900
kind of social dysfunction with or something like that you are here henceforth we're supposed to

418
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:08,600
refer to him as evil doors and you're not allowed to think about what motivates them or even yourself

419
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,580
you have to think of them as evil doors evil door

420
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:19,980
yeah and somehow you'll be able to solve that was a great band the evil doors yeah they were

00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:27,880
the original band i have a couple evil doors that i uh don't take a man that stuff's bad for you

against canadian attack well now it's all come true

429
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:19,700
that was a prophetic piece of pierced nose literature released from a person without a you know any hair on their body

430
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,900
oh

431
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,440
oh

432
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,120
oh

433
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,840
oh

434
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,120
oh

435
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,260
oh

436
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:38,900
oh

437
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,440
oh

438
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,660
oh

439
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:40,760
oh

440
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:40,760


441
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,160
oh oh

442
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,500
oh

443
00:28:59,500 --> 00:28:59,500


444
00:28:59,500 --> 00:28:59,500


445
00:28:59,500 --> 00:28:59,520
oh

446
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,960
and

447
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,220
we're to blame for everything

448
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:10,520
we're to blame for everything

449
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:10,640
we're to blame for everything

450
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,200
is there

451
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,600
beaches

452
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:20,120
Basically against anything that requires anybody to do anything that requires anybody to do anything that requires anybody to do

453
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,500
Anything as a member of society that helps make it safer

454
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:29,120
You pervert current events to sentence the National Rifle Association

455
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,040
a fraud a fraud

456
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,960
gun theft rings and

457
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,480
agents of evil

458
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,540
in American culture for example that

459
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:44,200
Father six-year-old kid living in a crack house infested the NRA

460
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,900
eight in San Francisco

461
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,260
14 in New Jersey

462
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:53,860
nine in Pittsburgh two in Washington DC

463
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,220
That's a lie

464
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:04,060
The truth is it was the NRA who pioneered and passed 13 funerals a day

465
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,480
Do I think that of course I do of course I do

466
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:09,520
guns

467
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,560
You incite media bias and fuel the politics of hate

468
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,420
You never miss a chance to step before the cameras and play out the gun haters drama of distortion

469
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,120
defamation and downright lies

470
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,200
Eastern world it is exploding

471
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,380
violence flaring

472
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,160
bullets load

473
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,480
You're old enough to kill

474
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,480
But not for vote

475
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,520
You don't believe in war

476
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,920
Boards and gun you're toting

477
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,460
And even the Jordan River has

478
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,540
bodies floating

479
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:54,140
But you tell me over and over and over again my friend

480
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:00,160
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

481
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,040
music

482
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,700
music

483
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:04,740
music

484
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:05,860
music

485
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:35,860


486
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,520
Just like human beings

487
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:50,480
The 라는

488
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,820
beat the poor little warlike people and bring peace forever and ever just like real life

489
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,620
But then the evil art dictators can

490
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,840
the art bombs have finally taken front

491
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:10,420
power in the far future and they object to the firing of the space gun.

492
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:20,140
They incite an unruly mob to come forward and smash the space gun, but it fires anyway,

493
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:29,160
shooting a young, comely pair of youths into space, male and female, seeding the cosmos.

494
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,900
They seeded Earth.

495
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,260
To the Indians for $24.

496
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,580
It was a mystery.

497
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,700
A mystery wrapped in an enigma.

498
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,160
Surrounded with creamy milk chocolate.

499
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,600
And velvety nougat.

500
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,140
And little rice crispy things.

501
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,360
They didn't actually have a name.

502
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,400
But they cost more than the inflated ones.

503
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,900
They had the stamp of approval.

504
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,100
The reason the Jews made a mistake with the man on the cross and the suffering serpent,

505
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:16,000
or the man that was suffering and bearing sickness in the 53rd of Isaiah,

506
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,500
their theology said you suffer because you sin.

507
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,140
It's carried over into Christianity to where people will say,

508
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:31,180
what those Jews did when they came to Jesus in the New Testament and said,

509
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,560
here's a man born blind.

510
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,360
Who sinned, him or his parents?

511
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,320
Jesus dismissed it cavalierly.

512
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,320
Neither, he said.

513
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:46,760
Neither.

514
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:53,320
But that the glory of God might be displayed in this moment to paraphrase the situation.

515
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,620
Christianity has abused Christians.

516
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,080
Christians.

517
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,680
Christianity has abused Christians.

518
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,880
As though when something wrong goes wrong,

519
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,060
or wronger,

520
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,360
it's because you sinned.

521
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,240
Oh, there will be those that will preach,

522
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,860
because of America's sin,

523
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,600
the judgment of God's on them.

524
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,780
Well, go to hell, you voices of the devil.

525
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:30,780
Well, go to hell, you voices of the devil.

526
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,760
Now, a wonderful message.

527
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,140
Will not be played on Christian networks.

528
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,680
But we have our own network.

529
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,200
24 hours a day.

530
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,480
Thank you.

531
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:55,120
Jesus, I beg of thee, don't take my life.

532
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,040
Return me to the womb from which I was torn.

533
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,360
Birth is a sin.

534
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,740
And the punishment...

535
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,060
The end of respite and the time...

536
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,060


537
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,140
And the punishment...

538
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,680
Is not perfect.

539
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,860
If you stop religion,

540
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,600
your rights are ruined.

541
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,940
Spare time with the sick.

542
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,740
The enormity of all paint,

543
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,000
It makes no sense.

544
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,000


545
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,000


546
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,460
The power of nature is abolished.

547
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,240
Spidet honesty is lost without küçük hate.

548
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,760
Unimog quem questo entferne.

549
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,280
Undigit фу.

550
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,340
We'll be right back.

551
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:48,600
Yeah!

552
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,900
Yeah!

553
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,740
Yeah!

554
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,220
Yeah!

555
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:15,100
Ground Zero Brooklyn is the name of that song by Retaliation, my friends.

556
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,260
And before that, we heard some Dr. Gene Scrappy.

557
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,620
Scott, some KPFA subgenius show from KPFA Berkeley with puzzling evidence,

558
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,680
and Dr. Howe, Barry McGuire, Eve of Destruction,

559
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,600
Charlton Heston in a rant by Electric Elf,

560
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:35,640
and I should mention where you can get Electric Elf's stuff.

561
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,660
Now, where is that?

562
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,080
Dang it!

563
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,840
I put these things sitting out so that I can smoothly do a transition

564
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,020
and describe Electric, and it's...

565
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,660
Oh, hold on.

566
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,620
Here it is, dear friends.

567
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,440
I've got the miracle of editing.

568
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,280
ElectricElf at loop.com.

569
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,020
That's an email address.

570
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:03,780
ElectricElf, one word, just like you would think,

571
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,220
at loop.com, L-O-O-P dot com.

572
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,480
That's ElectricElfTestKitchen.

573
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,620
And now, friends,

574
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,980
the great subgenius,

575
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:20,380
this album from Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket

576
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:24,440
features this upcoming song, 13013.

577
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,280
Write those numbers out and see what it spells out to you.

578
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,860
And then after that, a Cleveland rap band,

579
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,380
and listen real closely to the subgenius code words

580
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,740
embedded in that song by Bone Thugs-N-Harmony.

581
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,480
Eh, yes.

582
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,540
Eh, God.

583
00:38:46,020 --> 00:39:13,280
Eh, God.

584
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,080
There is nothing left to say

585
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,920
Human life so depraved

586
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,640
This was all Bob's plan

587
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,060
We've done what we can

588
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,780
Alien gods, monster squads

589
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,580
UFOs and chaos

590
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,720
The dark

591
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,460
Fighting Jesus

592
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,820
River God

593
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:57,340
Mighty J-H-V-H-1

594
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,700
Over there, cash machine

595
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,320
Number 13013

596
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,480
Think of dying

597
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,160
Over there, cash machine

598
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,840
Number 13013

599
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,080

601
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,120

602
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,800
Think of dying

603
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,400
All our hopes and dreams

604
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,200

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:45,200

All our dreams

607
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:50,480
Coming to an end, doesn't mean anything

608
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,460
Times are near, going fast

609
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:58,800
How long, how long, how long

610
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:58,960
To an end?

611
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:15,660
Million guards, monster squads

612
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:20,440
UFOs and chariot dogs

613
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,700
Fighting Jesus with a gun

614
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,540

Thugs as convicts

658

in God's prison.

659
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,960
Hands on the strap.

660
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,140
Praying so far

661
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,380
but please forgive me.

662
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,600
Police be rushing

663
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,640

664
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,320
I flaunt it.

665
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,800
America's most wanted.

666
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,860
Live on TV.

667
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,440
Like pleasure and pain.

668
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,760
Stuck in this game.

669
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,940
Holler my name.

670
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,300
We all gonna die.

671
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,320
We bleed through

672
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,260
similar veins.

673
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,480
Please explain to me.

674
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,600
Now don't panic

675
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,820
when my guns burst.

676
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,640
Heard the last jam,

677
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,020
nigga.

678
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,440
This one's worse.

679
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,760
My nigga bone

680
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,680
held the chrome

681
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,020
till I came home.

682
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,320
Thug love player.

683
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,860
Tell these bitch niggas

684
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:31,580
bring it on.

685
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,020
I caught a plane

686
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:33,900
out to Cleveland

687
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,820
late last evening

688
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,160
to help my niggas

689
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,260
clean up some niggas

690
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,380
no longer breathing.

691
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:38,780
Now,

692
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,480
who do you believe in?

693
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,480
Hit the weed

694
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,040
and breathe.

695
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,680
It's a cold ass world,

696
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,240
niggas.

697
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,340
Kill you in your sleep.

698
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,000
Watch me

699
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,360
until they stop me.

700
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,440
Burry, murder me

701
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,120
or drop me.

702
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:49,600

00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,820

704
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,800
for my nation

705
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,720
while I'm possibly

706
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,180
human.

707
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,600
I'm a hitter

708
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,400

and a nigga like

711
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:09,640
Nogata.

712
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,260
Stay high.

713
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,140
Thug love to the

714
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:11,360
dock.

715
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:11,820
Keep a breath

716
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,180
in the sky.

717
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:12,700
But it's filled

718
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,120

719
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:13,760
smoking fry.

720
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,720
So I beg

721
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,860

00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:16,320
us all.

723
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,480
Escapers of misery.

724
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,620

725
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,720

Long dead,

753
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,280
I see a red door

754
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,760
and I want them

755
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,120
painted black.

756
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,160
No colors anymore.

757
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,740
I want them

758
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,220
to turn black.

759
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,520
I see a lot of cars

760
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,520
but they are

761
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,120
painted black.

762
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,540
They pass me

763
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,500
by with war

764
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,380
who's never

765
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,660
coming back.

766
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:32,860
I look inside myself and see my heart is black

767
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,760
I see a red door and a hand door haven't blocked

768
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:45,180
Maybe I'll fade away, I'd have to face the facts

769
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:51,560
Man, it's not easy when your whole world's turning black

770
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,160
Fading black

771
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,660
I was black

772
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:20,880
If we look hard enough into the setting sun

773
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,160
These leaves will last for me before the morning

774
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:26,660
Fading black

775
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:26,660


776
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:32,880
I see them walking by, all dressed up in their clothes

777
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,640
I had to turn away until my goodness was

778
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,420
Fading black

779
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:50,740
I was black

780
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,180
Fading black

781
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,880
I was black

782
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,840
Fading black

783
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:09,840
Fading black

784
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,800
I was black

785
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:19,800


786
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:19,800


787
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:25,820
Well, you know, some people like it, but you never can tell what will happen in the future.

788
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,660
For example?

789
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:31,540
For example, no one ever knew that spiders would colonize outer space.

790
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,340
Building webs in outer space.

791
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:42,060
NASA constructed a laboratory called Skylab in which experiments could be conducted in

792
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,780
zero gravity outside the Earth's atmosphere.

793
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:51,500
Sending spiders up in Skylab to see how they performed in conditions of weightlessness

794
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,640
was a prize-winning proposal from a high school student from Lexington, New York.

795
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:56,640


796
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:56,640


797
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,200
A student at the time, a graduate student, had been assigned to a class of science subjects

798
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:57,200


799
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,040
Because they had real Jesus on there.

800
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,440
So it was really spooky.

801
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:09,240
When the Apollo spacecraft with Skylab 2 and 3 astronauts was launched on July 28, 1973,

802
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,340
two spiders were aboard.

803
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:19,640
Of the genus Aramudus diadematos, together with two flies for their food.

804
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:26,060
A week after lift-off, spider number one was placed on a frame in a cage.

805
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:26,620
The next day, a new spider was born.

806
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:26,620


807
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:26,620


808
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:26,620


809
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:33,340
Spider number two was kept in a small tube until being released onto the frame four weeks after launch.

810
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:41,700
Seeing the spiders in space on TV was for me very exciting and worth all the years of waiting.

811
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,180
I saw something which no human eye had ever observed before.

812
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:52,780
Spider number two floated slowly in microgravity when introduced into the cage.

813
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:56,900
It touched the frame, bounced back and floated in the opposite direction.

814
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,700
Its legs were extended and hardly moved.

815
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:07,000
The spider silk which one could observe coming from the spinnerets at the end of the bulbous abdomen

816
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,200
wafted in wide waves through the air.

817
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,800
On Earth it would have been stretched tight by the spider's weight.

818
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,680
The spider obviously missed its usual clues.

819
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,260
It could no longer handle the situation in an appropriate way

820
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,720
and presumably waited for what would happen next.

821
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,180
But with perfect equanimity.

822
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:43,060
The experiment succeeded in showing that spiders can build orb webs in zero gravity.

823
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,380
And it is obvious that under long term conditions

824
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:52,420
spiders in a microgravity without gravitational constraints

825
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,900
can grow to an enormous size.

826
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:00,220
Becoming the fearsome giant spiders of legend and popular culture.

827
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,140
Once spiders are permanently introduced to space

828
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,960
in an increased oxygen atmosphere particularly

829
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,880
spider growth can achieve prodigies

830
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,520
never before

831
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,480
reached.

832
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,180
buyer

833
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,320
near

834
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:52,220
However there are

835
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:52,700
others

836
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:03,080
Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale

837
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,140
A tale of a fateful trip

838
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,640
That started from this tropic port

839
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,040
Aboard this tiny ship

840
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,680
The mate was a mighty sailing man

841
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,940
Skipper brave and sure

842
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,600
Five passengers set sail that day

843
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,960
For a three-hour tour

844
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,180
A three-hour tour

845
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:32,080
That makes me wonder

846
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:38,900
Now the ship's aground on the shore

847
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,840
Of this uncharted desert island

848
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:46,640
With Gilligan, the skipper too

849
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,280
A millionaire

850
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,900
And his wife

851
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,660
The movie star

852
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:58,560
Oh, and the rest

853
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:03,280
Well, they're here on Gilligan's Island

854
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,660
Here in the parajuan

855
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,660
On the ambrosia

856
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,680
In the espíritu

857
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,980
All that happens

858
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:37,020
is you and me

859
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,020


860
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,020


861
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,340
Woo,ullie

862
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,420
Boy, we got a loig

863
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:43,440
esterol

864
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,900
Man, we'll be right back

865
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,600
And my wife's the reason

866
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,540
He starts his trip

867
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:50,540


868
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:50,540


869
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:50,580
This is the gist is

870
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:55,420
And that tiny ship was tossed

871
00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:00,100
Back for the courage of the grief

872
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,660
A little minute would be lost

873
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,780
And the ships are grinding on the shore

874
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,260
And the sun surely doesn't rise

875
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:37,220
And they're here on Gilligan's Island

876
00:53:51,980 --> 00:54:15,240
And they're here on Gilligan's Island

877
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:16,000
In harmony

878
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,880
A Cleveland band that I don't know

879
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,940
But somehow they picked up some subgenius slang

880
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:24,100
Probably because they are subgeniuses

881
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,340
And now speaking of people who are not subgeniuses

882
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,720
But don't know it yet

883
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,060
It's the great James Kochalka superstar

884
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,940
With Even the Clouds Get High

885
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,740
If you're offered dope

886
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,920
Don't be shy

887
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,040
Just take a toke

888
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,020
That's my advice

889
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:48,520
Cause even the clouds get high

890
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,460
Even the clouds get high

891
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,440
And if you're smoking dope

892
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,700
Don't ask why

893
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,820
Don't think twice

894
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,620
That's my advice

895
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:05,220
Cause even the clouds get high

896
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,080
Even the clouds get high

897
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:09,920
Everybody!

898
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:13,500
Even the clouds get high

899
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,000
Even the clouds get high

900
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:15,700
Come on!

901
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,100
Even the clouds get high

902
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:17,780
Come on!

903
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:21,020
Even the clouds get high

904
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,160
Even the clouds get high

905
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:25,500
Even the clouds get high

906
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,160
That's right!

907
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:29,280
Even the clouds get high

908
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,220
Even the clouds get high

909
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,900
Oh man, I forgot

910
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,280
Steve called today

911
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:39,120
Who?

912
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,780
Steven the mouse

913
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,440
What did he say?

914
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,560
Well...

915
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,980
Steven the mouse!

916
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:44,980


917
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,100
Oh I remember now

918
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:58,660
So we've got four the book

919
00:55:58,660 --> 00:55:58,680
He's had a really fantastic time

920
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:03,620
What are you back so proud of

921
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:04,440
It's the你

922
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:05,420
Your phone

923
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:05,520
I don't talk about it

924
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,460
What are you talking about?

925
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:06,620
This is a great show

926
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:06,780
Feel it

927
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,640
He knows it

928
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,080
Yeah

929
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,400
This is really good

930
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,560
He's an amazing man

931
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:44,940
The Piper and Cljuie of organization.

932
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,140
You have reached the Alzheimer's Research...

933
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,380
Lavatory. No.

934
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:50,900
Lobotomy.

935
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:55,180
Oh, anyway, the place thingy where we study...

936
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:56,580
What was it? Anyway.

937
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,180
If you wish to leave a...

938
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:00,380
Oh, gosh, what was it?

939
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,440
A menage a trois...

940
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,700
