1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,240
And, uh, gosh, tonight, friends, I had to bring my little dafter, Sivit, the Blivit, down here.

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,000
I guess just to show off to her friend, Em.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,800
Tell Em hello. Go ahead.

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:17,760
Hi, Emily.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,380
Okay, that's done.

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,940
And, uh, we can soon get into the show.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:32,880
The horrible show, tonight's show, specializing in the, uh, or featuring the oral tradition of the Pobucker.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,280
Ah, yes.

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,980
This film is shown to you not only for the benefit of your own personal good health, but for that of your entire unit.

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,540
Lights out.

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,920
Some of the things that you'll see...

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,620
...that you'll soon see are highly spectacular.

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:04,640
But let me assure you that they are authentic in every respect and are dramatic proof of the excellence built in to your...

14
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,920
...subgenius.

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,280
Our most watch.

16
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,940
Now, see for yourself and take what you find here and put it to work.

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,980
I am authorized to assure you that so far there is no reasonable cause for alarm.

18
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,780
Cover yourself with wet newspapers and lies.

19
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,540
Stay still until the blast has subsided.

20
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,640
Oh my God.

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,900
Have no fear.

22
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,800
You will not be hypnotized.

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,180
You will not lose consciousness.

24
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,880
Nor will you be made uncomfortable in any way.

25
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,820
Bob?

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,780
Bob?

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,920
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

28
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,920
Every time you say, see, hear, or see something, you are not alone.

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:53,920


30
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:53,920


31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:53,920


32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,460
Think.

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,080
Bob?

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,960
That's your key phrase.

35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,800
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

36
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,080
We are controlling transmission.

37
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,200
Now, did you ever see anything as new and as fresh looking as that?

38
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,140
It's so new, it's almost too new to be true.

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,500
Don't kill that.

40
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,600
Well, we take our initiates and we string a little tendon between their heels...

41
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,540
...and drag them three times around the radio station before beginning.

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,080
Then we dip them in the sacred waters of the slot.

43
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,160
And what exactly does this do for them?

44
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,480
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned...

45
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,000
...and it prepares their mind for the slate-like impression, the imprinting of the true subgenius.

46
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,500
You know, by golly, he's absolutely right.

47
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,340
Wake up, puppet boy!

48
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,880
Oh!

49
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:48,880


50
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,800
Unbelievably big sea monsters.

51
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,500
Sea. Man-eating bugs. Bigger than buildings.

52
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,760
A spectacular adventure on the Angry...

53
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,500
Subgenius Hour of Swatch.

54
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:15,280
A Mother Nature-grown berserk striking back at the industrial society that has exploited her.

55
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,600
We must stop it. Mankind hangs in the balance.

56
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,640
It's just crazy enough to work.

57
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,660
Oh, Jim. Don't make me relive that nightmare.

58
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,700
The Subgenius Hour of Swatch.

59
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,560
Clean, aristocratic, modern styling. Truly distinctive.

60
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,540
There it goes. A little scuff, but basically undamaged.

61
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,200
That's us, friends. A little scuff, but...

62
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,300
Uh...

63
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,340
Yeah.

64
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,440
Yes, it's gonna be a study in Pobuckerdom tonight.

65
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,100
A study of the oral tradition of the Pobucker.

66
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:02,720
We have many funny and revealing, and yes, telling, telling...

67
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:12,340
...archival recordings of Pobuckers, both subgenius and pink, in top spouting mode.

68
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,740
And also some of the all-time great...

69
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,600
...moments in talk radio.

70
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,680
Uh...

71
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,780
You'll certainly want to have your illegal bootlegging equipment up and running at all times.

72
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,620
Uh...

73
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,720
But before...

74
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,300
I guess before we sing the song of the Pobucker, we'll let...

75
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,460
We'll go into this, uh...

76
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,260
...this little section of tape.

77
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,820
Jane Eyre Hypercletes, I think, is mayhaps the...

78
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:46,160
...the greatest of the subgenius Pobucker scholars.

79
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,360
And we'll let him speak for everyone.

80
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,900
Here we go, here we go!

81
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,660
Ah!

82
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:54,980
Ah!

83
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:03,320
Savage and deadly, their one hope is to rule our planet as they once had thousands of years back.

84
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,900
And that ain't all...

85
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,420
...since!

86
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:16,140
The Pobucker's Pobucker

87
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,140


88
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,440
They steal cars!

89
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,980
There's just certain areas of Southwest City that are designated as Bobby-Free Tollway Zones.

90
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,060
You park in a Bobby-Toeway Zone, that ain't your car anymore, that's Bobby's car.

91
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,820
Hey, wait, where are you going with my car?

92
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,960
Sorry, this ain't your car anymore.

93
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,540
Check your city map, you in a Bobby-Free Tollway Zone.

94
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,020
But there's not any kind of sign!

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,540
See that cigarette butt?

96
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,080
But laying on the ground, that's your sign.

97
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,280
No, don't steal my car.

98
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,640
You can have my incurable cancer.

99
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,540
You can have my deaths.

100
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,420
You can have my screaming bratty kids.

101
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,340
You can have my bitchy wife.

102
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,140
But just don't take my car.

103
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,640
I'm taking your car, boy.

104
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,480
No, wait.

105
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,640
You can have my personality defects.

106
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,960
You can have my schizophrenia.

107
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,740
You can have the voices I hear in my mind.

108
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,680
You can have my personal problems.

109
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,540
You can have my $3,000 debt.

110
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,780
But just don't take my car and my mistress.

111
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,640
You're in a Bobby Free Tollway zone.

112
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,080
Your mistress is in a Bobby Free Tollway zone, too.

113
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,860
Bobby, no.

114
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,440
Bobby, please.

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,760
Bobby, no.

116
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,400
Thank you, Bobby.

117
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,020
Thank you, Bobby.

118
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:01,640
You know, Bobby can steal cars that, even if they ain't whole cars, he can...

119
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,480
Like, I mean, who's going to buy their garden salvage yard?

120
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,600
All there are are just rusted out frames out there.

121
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,300
Bobby just got in the chassis of a...

122
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,880
A rusty, rusted out old 57 Chevy.

123
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,740
It didn't have an engine.

124
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,800
It didn't have tires.

125
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,460
It didn't have...

126
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,580
It didn't have a body.

127
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,100
It didn't have nothing.

128
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,680
I just...

129
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,660
Don't ask me how, but Bobby somehow hot-wired it.

130
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,720
Drove that sucker home.

131
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,220
He said all this needs is a couple of lug nuts.

132
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,300
He just put a couple of lug nuts on there.

133
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,000
Lo and behold, there was a car.

134
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,300
There was one old car.

135
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,000
There was nothing left of it but a camshaft.

136
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,060
Just an old camshaft laying there on the ground.

137
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,760
There wasn't anybody going to guard it.

138
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,880
Just an old camshaft.

139
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,700
Now, don't ask me how.

140
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,040
Bobby Free just started it up and just drove it off.

141
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,180
Just an old camshaft.

142
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,060
Then Bobby can just change it into a brand new car.

143
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,620
He just took some paint out.

144
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,820
He took some spray paint.

145
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,920
He painted it.

146
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,500
There was a car sitting there.

147
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,980
Freaked me out.

148
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,020
He sold it to Billy Ray for $20,000.

149
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,800
Billy Ray took his gal, Charlene, to the drive-in movie.

150
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,000
He was making out with her.

151
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,200
I was sitting in a bar with Bobby.

152
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,920
All of a sudden, Bobby just said,

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,860
Look at this.

154
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,280
Took two lug nuts out of his pocket.

155
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,920
That car just disintegrated.

156
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,400
Just turned back into a camshaft.

157
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,960
Science was baffled and powerless.

158
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,740
This is confusing.

159
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,440
A terror-stricken humanity knew that it was on the brink of total destruction.

160
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,140
Well, things are looking up.

161
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:09,700
A once proud civilization now had to place its trust and hope in Godzilla

162
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,400
and his powerful ally, Bob.

163
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,160
Type.

164
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,180
Make-Ins Titan.

165
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,800
Giant against giant in the most spectacular battle yet.

166
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,800
You'll see it all in Godzilla vs. Megalon.

167
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,520
But things weren't normal.

168
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,500
There were changes.

169
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,060
Ah!

170
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:29,920
Ah!

171
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:30,720
Ah!

172
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:30,800
Ah!

173
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,960
Your mother bit me.

174
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,780
I never saw him by like that.

175
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,080
It's a beautiful sight.

176
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,460
Strange.

177
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,620
Frightful changes.

178
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,200
That night, it all started.

179
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,540
Stop doing that.

180
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,600
Oh!

181
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,880
Take this line.

182
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,160
Boy, here's what I call the McCounty line.

183
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,280
Step over this line, you stand in the McCounty.

184
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,940
You break the law over here in the...

185
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,900
In Arkansas, we got three kinds of laws.

186
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,340
Commissar meter, felony, and sodomy.

187
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,500
Felony will get you sent to this federal penitentiary.

188
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,960
Sodomy will get you sawed, boy.

189
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,740
Cut you in half.

190
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,060
Have some of me and you get busted.

191
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,620
You get busted for a...

192
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,560
Sodomy in their precinct.

193
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,620
They're just gonna cut you a little bit.

194
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,080
You get busted for a sodomy in my precinct, I'm gonna cut you, boy.

195
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,500
I'm gonna hurt you.

196
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,100
I'm gonna cut you in half, and I want you to know that.

197
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,460
You cross over...

198
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:35,280
I don't know how they do things out in California or Los Angeles or wherever the hell you come from.

199
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,400
I'm just saying that you cross over this line, you're in...

200
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,740
You're in standing in the McCounty line.

201
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,460
You're standing in McCounty.

202
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,080
You break the law in McCounty, I shoot you dead.

203
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,120
You fall over dead on that sidewalk, I give you a ticket for loitering.

204
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,660
You don't pay that ticket for loitering within 30 days, I'll throw you in jail.

205
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,820
And jail's one place you sure as hell don't want to be, especially if you're dead, boy.

206
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,460
You're in standing in the...

207
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,020
...on the...

208
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,080
...on the...

209
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,980
...rest of the...

210
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,620
...part of your...

211
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,320
...are rewarded...

212
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,740
Oh, boy.

213
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,600
Are you listening to this show on a stereo or a...

214
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,400
Well, you...

215
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,980
Hello, am I still here?

216
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,640
I keep...

217
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,060
Of course, Frank, you're still here.

218
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,480
...being hit on the finger bone by this other person, you know, this other one.

219
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:22,840


220
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,320
Well, you know, some folks are...

221
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,460
Well, and how...

222
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,580
...they take the show on their fillings and their teeth.

223
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,000
I don't know, well...

224
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,400
I mean, how did you know about this show?

225
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,640
Come on, admit it, fess up, get it off your chest.

226
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,680
I just know my friend told me.

227
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,240
Aha.

228
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,520
Word of mouth.

229
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,560
Okay, put that down.

230
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,300
Now, are you a Democrat or a Republican?

231
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:37,720
I'll get it.

232
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,980
Oh, I'll get it, no.

233
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:39,900
I'm...

234
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,760
It just doesn't matter.

235
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,960
I'm not into politics or political things.

236
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,380
Well, they're into you...

237
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,480
And where are you calling from?

238
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,420
...to the tune of a $4 trillion debt.

239
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,380
General Jigar, after you're out on the air.

240
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,440
Yeah, I don't know if they have anything to do...

241
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,500
But it doesn't matter, I don't vote.

242
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,900
Okay, here we go, line 17.

243
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,520
Where are you calling from, mother's maiden name and...

244
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,780
Ah, yes, the tune of the unknown voter in Washington, D.C., our nation's capital.

245
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,560
Oh, yes, we better just vote for these unknown fornits here.

246
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,420
I'll get the word out, probably.

247
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,480
Well, we're not that unknown.

248
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,620
When you cast your vote for us, you're really voting for change that is a spare change for

249
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:10,740
both of us.

250
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,200
Oh, right on.

251
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,860
I mean, for...

252
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,860
You could call it chump change.

253
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,880
Yeah, what are you saying?

254
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,140
Is it time to change your tape if you're doing a 90-minute tape?

255
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,680
That's right.

256
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,540
If you're taping this marvelous show with its splendid sound effects, it's now time

257
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,000
to discontinue your 90-minute tape and flippancy-flop it over.

258
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,780
Oh, did I do the tape?

259
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,320
Oh!

260
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,380
Flippancy-flop it over.

261
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,420
I'm sorry, excuse me.

262
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,480
That was, uh, I was impetuous, a youthful impetuousness.

263
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,740
I often go off that way.

264
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,160
There we go.

265
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,640
I need a, I need a bucket of ice water dashed across my loins.

266
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:40,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

267
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:40,720


268
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,360
I hate to get on your shows, but I do, I do, I do, I do think I make myself a big deal

269
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,360


270
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,360


271
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,160
Then I'm myself again.

272
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,100
Okay, I, uh...

273
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,020
It's that disease I caught in the tropics.

274
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,880
Uh, what...

275
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,360
That's how we wake up for each show.

276
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,740
Oh, that terrible alarm clock.

277
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,720
Then I'd better get off the phone with you guys, because this, I do not want to create

278
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,920
the most enormous phone bill.

279
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,800
Oh, you're calling from outside the caller area.

280
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,040
Well.

281
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:58,520
Yeah.

282
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,800
Thanks for lending your, dulcet tones.

283
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,940
Thanks for lending your voice and angelic presence to our divine symposium.

284
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,520
Unless you have a, a much more cheaper form of calling.

285
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,200
Well, you can come down and be on the show.

286
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,700
Now we'll get...

287
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,680
some cheap person to call next.

288
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,060
Good evening, Bob.

289
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,500
Good evening, Rocky.

290
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,300
I'm very, very confused.

291
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,120
Well, what are you confused about?

292
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,900
I'm kind of confused myself,

293
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,140
and we all get to that point in our life,

294
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,260
but we have to stop,

295
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,660
sit down, smell the roses,

296
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,120
and try to put our morals together

297
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,440
and see what's wrong,

298
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,200
what seems to be out of place tonight with you.

299
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,640
Well, first of all, Rocky,

300
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,180
I mean, you used to be very, very selective

301
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,160
with who you would call.

302
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,680
Oh, now you're calling just anybody.

303
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,580
Well, I'm going to become more selective

304
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,280
to who I call against.

305
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,720
Gee, some people just don't appreciate good callers.

306
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,480
I'm not too concerned about what Sick Norman says or does.

307
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,080
I ain't never calling that freak.

308
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,940
I ain't listening to his show.

309
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,600
That's it.

310
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,420
Forget about that fat boy.

311
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,140
That man is a real...

312
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,820
real smooth-talking Yankee

313
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,800
that come down here,

314
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,420
come down to my neighborhood,

315
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,900
my Southland,

316
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,700
my Coat-of-the-Hills area.

317
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,260
He wants to tell me

318
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,240
and everybody else

319
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,180
what to do and how to live.

320
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,740
I want my statements made.

321
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,100
I want the people to listen to me.

322
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,100
I am the man on the phone.

323
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,600
I am the man that calls these people.

324
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,960
I ain't got no book in front of me.

325
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,020
I ain't got no magazine in front of me.

326
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,180
I'm sitting here in a phone booth.

327
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,360
I am not fading into an oblivion.

328
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,600
I am going to be stronger, harder.

329
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,320
You talk about your solar-flex machine.

330
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,800
Are you going to break out of the jug again, Rocky?

331
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,040
Oh, no.

332
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,740
My voice might sound a little bit different tonight.

333
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,360
Does it?

334
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,600
Well, yes, it does.

335
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,940
That's because I'm in a phone booth

336
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,760
and it sounds like I'm in an echo chamber.

337
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,140
And I'm in a phone booth.

338
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,140


339
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,840
A lot of times when I sing,

340
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,460
I sing in a phone booth.

341
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,140
You go in the phone booth and sing?

342
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,120
I'm a songwriter, Mr. Lassler,

343
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,360
and I'm also a poet.

344
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,880
I'm also a person that cares more

345
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,240
about people out here

346
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,640
than the people that call in

347
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,380
and they just say,

348
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,480
Rocky's a bum.

349
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,160
He hates everybody.

350
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,300
Authorities believe that he had as many as 18 women

351
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,760
living in a large house there with him

352
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,640
playing the role of wives

353
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,980
in a polygamous situation.

354
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,700
And that, uh, that he, uh,

355
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,840
had at least one of them.

356
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,880
Well, yes, he did.

357
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,100
Please!

358
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,480
Let me out!

359
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,300
Let me out!

360
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,140
Let me out!

361
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,920
Let me out!

362
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,760
Let, let, let, let me out!

363
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,360
It doesn't look good.

364
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,760
You know, sometimes I think all North Americanos are crazy.

365
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,140
If he's dead, you waste your money.

366
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,520
If he's alive, maybe you'll be sorry you find him.

367
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:08,880
Yeah.

368
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,980
No, we...

369
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,460
We must find Bob.

370
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,140
Now I tell you what I believe.

371
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,860
Yes, what about it?

372
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,060
This beast exists because it is stronger than the thing that you call evolution.

373
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,960
Bob is stronger than...

374
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:27,540
In it is some force of life, a demon driving it through millions of centuries.

375
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,120
No, it can't.

376
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,720
It does not surrender so easily to weaklings like you and me.

377
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,300
Now look, we're not paying you to make jokes.

378
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,680
Bob loves us.

379
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,440
No joke.

380
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,860
Well, I'll try to explain it to you.

381
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,800
Sometimes a species gets isolated in time.

382
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,680
If the conditions are right, it reproduces itself without change,

383
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,840
skipping a chapter of evolution.

384
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:59,400
Way back, there must have been some major link between Bob and terrestrial life.

385
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,160
It's just possible that this is it.

386
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,760
Well, that's all there is to it.

387
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,700
And that, kiddies, is our fairy story for tonight.

388
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,140
And now...

389
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,860
And that, Civet, is our fairy story for tonight.

390
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,740
Now we have to get down to the brass tacks, to the real thing, right?

391
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,600
Right.

392
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,560
Like, uh...

393
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,540
Well, how would you define a po-bucker, Civet?

394
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:34,720
What would you think of when I say the word po-bucker?

395
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,840
Cheap.

396
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,020
Cheap.

397
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:38,920
Cheap.

398
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,140
Cheap.

399
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,140


400
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,140


401
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,140


402
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,140


403
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,140


404
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,960
Well, maybe we should do the song.

405
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,520
Some, because many, some po-buckers are very generous.

406
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,420
I think perhaps what you mean is poor.

407
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,060
But that's not always the case either, for there are many, many a rich po-bucker.

408
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,060
They're the most dangerous of all.

409
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,220
Let's, let's, let's do our song, okay?

410
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:01,860
Okay.

411
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:08,220
This is an old song that we made up a couple years ago on the road in our vacation in Appalachia.

412
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,560
That one.

413
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:17,840
I'm a po po po bucka I like to cuss and drink

414
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:25,660
But there's one thing that makes my head hurt Please don't ask me to thank

415
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,580
That's it dear friends.

416
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:38,180
And in honor of this well some further exploration into that world

417
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:44,560
Well actually what I should do is tell you what we've been listening to first.

418
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,120
The collage tapes.

419
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:57,740
The pepper all the hour of slack shows tonight have been a combination of tapes by the good Joe Riley.

420
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,340
Bob Hall.

421
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,740
The tape Beatles.

422
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,300
And everyone else.

423
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,740
Puzzling evidence and so forth.

424
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,140
You heard.

425
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:17,640
Some Jane or hyper cleats there from the new Southland Corporation rock opera called Tales of Bobby Free.

426
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,740
The pieces we heard were Bobby Free Toe Away Zone.

427
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,540
And the McCounty piece from Cherry Don't Cry.

428
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,920
Jane or Hyper Cleats Southland Corporation.

429
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,740
We also heard some KPFA Berkeley.

430
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,200
Puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell's genius show.

431
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,560
Attacking the callers.

432
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,840
And some of those callers then later came to include.

433
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,560
Well these old rednecks.

434
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,280
Pobuckers and.

435
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,740
Coups crackpots and subgeniuses.

436
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,900
On the apparently the Bob Lasseter show.

437
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,680
This tape was sent in by.

438
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,000
The St.

439
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,280
Dave Mitchell of Headlines magazine.

440
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:21,000
And I'd like to continue with these pieces from the Bob Lasseter show.

441
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,520
And thank you.

442
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,940
You see this is the point I'm trying to make.

443
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:35,800
I wish these people would forget about New York for long enough to try to grasp what I'm trying to do.

444
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,020
Here.

445
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,200
They have to realize that.

446
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,480
They're in my neighborhood.

447
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,300
I was born and raised in this area.

448
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,040
And all my ancestors were.

449
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,940
These people are coming in here pushing me around.

450
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,500
Said hey.

451
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,440
I want to raise taxes here.

452
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,840
We want to build a stadium over here.

453
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,360
We don't want that.

454
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,940
Us good old boys.

455
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,820
We want our pickup trucks.

456
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,880
We want our Magnums.

457
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,880
We want our blonde blue women.

458
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,640
And maybe a little snort of Jack Daniels every once in a while.

459
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,580
I heard on the radio.

460
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:05,920
Today.

461
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,140
They're going to have to cut the water down.

462
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,740
The bridges are falling down because the Yankees come down here.

463
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,980
They don't know how to build a bridge.

464
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,840
Now they're all falling down.

465
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,460
And now they realize that the Yankees can't even build a bridge.

466
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,020
So they got to go to France and get them to build bridges.

467
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,200
They got to get them from Romania and build bridges.

468
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,620
Because we ain't got nobody left here that wants to work for an honest day's living.

469
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,520
It's too hot for them.

470
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,360
They got to spend all the money on beer.

471
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,840
All roads.

472
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,020
All roads.

473
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:35,680
All roads.

474
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,500
I don't care how many marshmallows a man eats.

475
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,980
I don't care how many rich crackers these Yankees come in and buy these stores.

476
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,800
They ain't supporting me.

477
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,540
Yankees are known to eat marshmallows?

478
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,840
They eat marshmallows like they're going out of style.

479
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:52,580
They do?

480
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,080
They eat them like crazy.

481
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:59,520
Very rarely do you see a confederate going in a grocery store and buying marshmallows.

482
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,520
You won't see me buying no moon pies and RC Cola.

483
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,280
I won't do it.

484
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,320
And I ain't buying no more Pepsi either.

485
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,760
Now I'll drink a Coke.

486
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,260
But I'm not buying no Pepsi and I think you can figure that one out.

487
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:13,460
Why?

488
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,980
No I can't.

489
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,000
I tell you because Michael Jackson is behind that.

490
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,080
Oh.

491
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,040
He's up here buying and selling all this advertising, all this Pepsi.

492
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:26,780
Wait a second.

493
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,940
Don't they have wine over there?

494
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,860
They drink a whole lot of deris and Coke and Pepsi.

495
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,500
When they drink a Coke, they ain't going to buy it.

496
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,640
They're going to put it on the TV screen.

497
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:34,900
But Rocky.

498
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,400
Go ahead.

499
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,900
I'm listening to you.

500
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,240
I think this Coke hired Lionel Richie.

501
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,800
If he does, it's too bad because I'll boycott both of them.

502
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,900
I'll go to Sprite.

503
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,960
I'll go to 7-Up.

504
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,340
I'll make my own brew.

505
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,360
Well, don't you remember the guy, you know, for 7-Up, that black man with the bald head?

506
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,040
Oh, you're right.

507
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,080
There goes 7-Up too.

508
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,000
You're right.

509
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,560
And Sprite is made by either Coke or Pepsi.

510
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,480
I'm going to go to Sprite.

511
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,400
Coke makes the Sprite.

512
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,200
It's all controlled by the same people.

513
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,600
There was a time in the South when we didn't have Coca-Cola.

514
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,540
The only place you could get that was up where the Yankees lived.

515
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,180
We were happy with our Sassafras.

516
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,520
We were happy with our Shine.

517
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,900
But you had to have all these Yankees come down here and tear down all the stills.

518
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,200
Yankees don't even like the cars.

519
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,560
I don't think we got all the stills.

520
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,460
Well, they ain't got the stills.

521
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:33,780
They ain't got mine.

522
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,620
Didn't think so.

523
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:42,860
I got my still up here in Clearwater, and they never, ever going to bust it up.

524
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,540
I don't care if it's an insurance man, the IRS man.

525
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,800
They don't mess with my moonshine.

526
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,920
Nobody messes my shine.

527
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,440
Nobody.

528
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,520
Let them come in.

529
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,380
I got a 12-gauge double-barrel half-sawed-off shotgun.

530
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:10,080
And anybody that messes with me or my organization or my family is in trouble.

531
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,780
I'm from the old school.

532
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,020
I'm not a liberal.

533
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,840
I am not a liberal.

534
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,840
I didn't think so.

535
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,140
I thought that was all an act.

536
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,600
I ain't a Yankee.

537
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,620
I got a Confederate flag.

538
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,440
I won't even fly this Union flag on a holiday.

539
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,160
I'll fly a Confederate flag.

540
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,840
If my neighbors don't like it, that's too bad.

541
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:51,080
My name's Terry its math Yamiche his signaling for yes, sir, it was a sampai,

the 不是我 ل奇,

547
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,900
reported to the Chamber of Commerce or the SPC.

548
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,620
I am going to write letters.

549
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,320
I spent $800 to get down here.

550
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:18,700
Alice is listening, and she is not very appreciative of what you've been doing.

551
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,860
Who's not very appreciative?

552
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,620
Who's not very appreciative?

553
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,740
She's very upset.

554
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,140
Who's upset, sir?

555
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,280
She's very upset.

556
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,220
Who is upset?

557
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,000
My wife is very upset.

558
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,080
You've got no business talking about us in this manner.

559
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,180
We are supporting you people.

560
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,780
Don't you understand?

561
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,020
If we quit coming down here, you'll be out of a job, sir.

562
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:42,820
Why?

563
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,680
And I'll report you, and I've heard about you before in the trailer parks.

564
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,520
What's so funny about that, buddy?

565
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,920
You mean my fame has spread to the trailer parks?

566
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,380
Why, what is so funny about living in a trailer park?

567
00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,980
Nothing, sir.

568
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,040
I'm living in an Airstream right now, and I don't think it's very funny about the way...

569
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,800
Wait, wait a second.

570
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,660
You come down here from where?

571
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,460
What was that, Iowa?

572
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:17,680
Driving a trailer, and you're not even staying in a motel, and you think you're supporting me?

573
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,120
Are you on drugs, sir?

574
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,280
I bet you use marijuana and all this kind of stuff.

575
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,760
I bet you live a life style.

576
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,460
What kind of a life style?

577
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,720
A very loose life style.

578
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,460
Very loose.

579
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,920
I'm listening to you every night, and you've got to remember this, that we might stay here.

580
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,360
Oh, my God!

581
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,840
You might stay here?

582
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,120
I might report you.

583
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,980
I'm going to report you to the...

584
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,540
Trailer Park Association.

585
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:56,940
I'm going to write management a letter, and you won't like it.

586
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,260
You'll be very afraid.

587
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,780
Sir, my name is...

588
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,340
Lassiter.

589
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,480
That's L-A-S-S-I-T-E-R.

590
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,600
Care of the Lassiter Broadcasting Company.

591
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,440
You're in trouble now.

592
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,220
No, sir.

593
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,020
I own the station.

594
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,800
You're in trouble now.

595
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,860
No, I own the place.

596
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,740
My mother bought it.

597
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:20,580
And I've heard about the way you talk about our president, and I think it's a disgrace.

598
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,920
Why don't you write him a letter?

599
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,460
I have written him many letters.

600
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,180
Hasn't done you a damn bit of good, has it?

601
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:26,660
You don't think...

602
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,720
And I don't like the way you talked about Jim.

603
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,000
I don't like the way you talked about Jim and Tammy Faye Baker.

604
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:37,400
Me and my wife stayed at the resort for two weeks, and we had a lovely and various enjoyment time.

605
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,260
Would you park your air stream there, or would you stay in a hotel room there?

606
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,900
We stayed in a hotel room there.

607
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,180
Thank you.

608
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,120
And we're going to go back, and I will help support his ministry.

609
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,840
Great.

610
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,520
You have done a disservice...

611
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,240
Would you leave tonight?

612
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:49,560
...to God.

613
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:57,680
I have never heard anyone lambaste the ministers and the nation in such a sense in my entire life, sir.

614
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,560
Well, you're lucky.

615
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,540
You've heard somebody do it.

616
00:27:59,720 --> 00:27:59,940
Now...

617
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,100
I'm going to write a letter to the manager.

618
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,420
I'm going to write a letter to...

619
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,800
That's Mrs. Lassiter, L-A-S-S-I-T-E-R.

620
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,300
That's the manager's name, Mrs. Lassiter.

621
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,260
In the phone book.

622
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,020
That's right, in the phone book.

623
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,240
Now you're making me scream, and you're making me scream and holler.

624
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,000
That's one of the things I do best.

625
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,660
Sir, why do you carry on in this matter?

626
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:31,260
This is a very, very outlandish and monstrous tactic you're using.

627
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,160
You got it.

628
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,360
This is...

629
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,900
This is not right.

630
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,500
Why don't you help the old people?

631
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,940
Why don't you help us...

632
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,400
Sir, I'd like to help you out.

633
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,340
Which way did you come in?

634
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,840
Sir, I'm not going anywhere.

635
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,580
I'm going to write you a letter.

636
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,860
And you will receive this letter.

637
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,600
And you won't like it.

638
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,300
I'm going to write more than one letter.

639
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,100
I'm going to write the station.

640
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm going to write the Chamber of Commerce.

641
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,880
I, too, will write the Chamber of Commerce.

642
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,900
And the Chamber of Commerce will be up flooded with letters.

643
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,260
Will you put a lot of kisses up the bottom?

644
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,060
I bet you have a surfboard, don't you?

645
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:21,640
I bet you wear short, cut-off jeans and sandals and beads

646
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,200
and probably wear sunglasses.

647
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,120
All the time.

648
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,820
And I bet you haven't shaved in three months.

649
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,040
Closer to three years, sir.

650
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,280
When was the last time you had a shave?

651
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,640
About three years ago.

652
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,600
Are you married or are you living in sin?

653
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,220
Little of each.

654
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,240
You continue to...

655
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,700
How outrageous.

656
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,580
Well, thank you.

657
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,860
You continue to tell the whole world, the whole public here,

658
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,780
that you're living in sin.

659
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,180
This is monstrous.

660
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,620
I give 10% of my...

661
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,040
I'm going to pay to the PTL Club.

662
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,980
And I will continue to write to PTL Club.

663
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,980
Oh, Jim's living in sin.

664
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,800
And I am going to...

665
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,160
You're going to send me 10% too?

666
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,880
I am going to write a letter to the PTL Club

667
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,980
and tell them what you've been saying about them.

668
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,920
And you may hear from the PTL Club.

669
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,280
Sir, we've tried to get them on the show before.

670
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:13,940
They won't come on.

671
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,140
You're in trouble now.

672
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,720
You're in trouble now.

673
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,420
Well, sir, I guess I'll just have to wax up my board

674
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,780
and go with the flow, you know?

675
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,600
I'm wondering...

676
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,100
Stay here.

677
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,220
I'm going to call the police.

678
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,340
We're all in trouble now.

679
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,580
I'll call the police on you.

680
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,460
I mean it.

681
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,080
I'm serious.

682
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:30,700
Whoa.

683
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:31,820
Whoa there.

684
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,020
You're going to call the police?

685
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,320
I'm threatening now, sir.

686
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,320
You've got me upset.

687
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,240
I'll call the police.

688
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,820
I swear I'll call the police.

689
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,780
Do you want me to call the police on you?

690
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,920
This is funny.

691
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,100
I will call the...

692
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,020
Do I think it's funny?

693
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,980
Do I think it's funny?

694
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,940
Are you kidding me?

695
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,120
You're kidding me, aren't you?

696
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,340
You put on my leg.

697
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,000
Sir, I'll lock you up.

698
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,580
I'll have you locked up, sir.

699
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,900
You can't do this.

700
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,100
This is the greatest call I've ever had in my entire career.

701
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,040
You think...

702
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,020
You think you're...

703
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,220
You think that you're...

704
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,760
This is probably the greatest call ever to talk radio.

705
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,600
You think by laughing that you're showing me that you're...

706
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:23,600


707
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:23,600


708
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,320
You're not afraid.

709
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,600
That you're all afraid.

710
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,300
I know it.

711
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,300
Oh.

712
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,820
Oh, God.

713
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,800
I've got five letters to write, sir.

714
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,540
Five letters now?

715
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,360
Oh, my goodness.

716
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,620
You've got a busy night ahead of you.

717
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,880
I'm going to start right now.

718
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:42,820
Okay.

719
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,000
Have a bad night.

720
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,040
Hippie.

721
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,300
Hippie.

722
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,560
They're

723
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,180
standing

724
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:07,840
in a

725
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:07,840


726
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:07,880
room.

727
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,520
My 자것

728
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:10,520


729
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:10,880
numbers.

730
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:18,260
No no,

731
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,740
they won't

732
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,820
give me

733
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,580
I'm a native moment.

734
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,640
Chair, my mother.

735
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,120
I could blow a little bit of glue.

736
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,060
What?

737
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,120
No imagination.

738
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,460
Kill him.

739
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,020
Do not think that you are the lucky one to go on on stage.

740
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,300
Germans know no distinction between one man and another.

741
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,140
I brought the atom bomb.

742
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,200
I think it's a good time to use it.

743
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:49,980
Talk about stability.

744
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,240
No sway, dive, or shudder.

745
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,300
And now, punishment beyond the call of duty.

746
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,820
The subgenius hour of swat.

747
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,480
Right now, it's being flown to Florida's famed Ocean Harbor Oceanarium,

748
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,200
where the experts hope to restore it to consciousness.

749
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,120
The greatest scientific stir since the explosion of the atomic bomb.

750
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,880
Honda, Honda, Honda, Honda.

751
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,760
City.

752
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,360
Honda, Honda, Honda, Honda.

753
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,900
It will catch your eye in the city.

754
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:23,840
City.

755
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,200
Hey, it's horrible.

756
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,200
How horrible?

757
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,020
Are you shocked, Miss Desmond?

758
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,320
No.

759
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,220
Don't last a minute amongst those fiends.

760
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,820
I hope we haven't interrupted you in the middle of a trance or something.

761
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,280
As a matter of fact, you did.

762
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,180
But don't worry, we'll forgive you anyway.

763
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,160
Oh!

764
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:42,900
Oh!

765
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:44,840


766
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,580
Oh!

767
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:45,980
Oh!

768
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,080
Oh!

769
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,160
Oh!

770
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,160


771
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,220
Oh!

772
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:46,260
Oh!

773
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:46,680
Oh!

774
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,420
Oh!

775
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:48,940


776
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:48,940


777
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,160


778
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,160


779
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:49,580


780
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:49,680
Oh!

781
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:49,680


782
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:49,760
Oh!

783
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,220
Oh!

784
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:50,460
Oh!

785
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:51,940
Oh!

786
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:52,680
Oh!

787
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:53,500
Oh!

788
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:53,580
Oh!

789
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:53,580


790
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:53,580


791
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:53,580


792
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:53,580


793
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:53,580


794
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:53,580


795
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:53,580


796
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,460
Oh!

797
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:55,460


798
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:55,460


799
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:55,460


800
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:55,460


801
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:55,460


802
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:55,460


803
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:55,460


804
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:55,460


805
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,240
The subgenius hour of swag!

806
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,700
Good swag!

807
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,880
Oh, dear friends.

808
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,680
And it is indeed that show.

809
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:15,840
And I promised some of the classic talk show or talk radio clips ever.

810
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,380
Hey, will you kids quit fooling around?

811
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,140
You wouldn't believe this.

812
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,360
Will Adab, who is supposedly an adult,

813
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:32,460
They're sitting over here picking hits, hitting each other with Sivit, who's only 12 years old.

814
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,940
She started it.

815
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,120
Yeah, they always say that.

816
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:47,000
Okay, anyway, yeah, here's, well, I don't know what city this is from.

817
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,140
It doesn't really matter.

818
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,360
But I think that we should all have pity for this young man.

819
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:58,040
There's a lot of discussion, Eric, that's getting in the way of you really accepting real people.

820
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:05,340
And I agree, I'd be a little alarmed if I were you, because it sounds like you're retreating into it more and more rather than less.

821
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:15,820
And what's scary is that the more you decide that these are the perfect women and real women are imperfect, the more that you're going to push yourself into it.

822
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,340
My goodness.

823
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,820
What if you started wearing Little Mermaid clothes?

824
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,680
I have a pen.

825
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,340
I mean, I have a pen.

826
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:22,340


827
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,380
I mean, actually, last night I had a wet dream when I was with Little Mermaid.

828
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,600
And I think that's the thing that really scared me was when I started to have the wet dreams about her.

829
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,680
And I have, like, a little pen on my jacket.

830
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,240
I have a shirt.

831
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,600
I have an Aladdin shirt, which I always wear around all the time.

832
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,100
And my friends kind of know.

833
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,900
They just kind of make fun of me.

834
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,780
They don't understand, you know, what I'm going through and all.

835
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,280
What would you like them to understand about you, Eric?

836
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,120
That, you know, that it's normal.

837
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,860
It's not crazy to be in love with a cartoon.

838
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,120
You know?

839
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,880
You know, I don't think it's that weird.

840
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,960
I mean, she's beautiful.

841
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,600
She's absolutely perfect.

842
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,080
No girl could ever compare to the way the Little Mermaid looked.

843
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,400
Who turns you on the most?

844
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,720
Is it Jasmine from Aladdin, Belle from Beauty and the Beast, or Little Mermaid?

845
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,360
It might be.

846
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,280
It's definitely between Little Mermaid and Jasmine.

847
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,380
Of course, I think because Belle was always covered up.

848
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,560
She was always fully clothed, except during maybe the ballroom scene.

849
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,760
You saw a little bit of cleavage.

850
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:19,400
But Jasmine and Ariel were always, they only had, like, a bikini top on.

851
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,780
So it was always.

852
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,660
It was always between the two of them.

853
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,680
And it was always Little Mermaid until when I saw Jasmine.

854
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,460
And she also just stole my heart away.

855
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,500
Mm-hmm.

856
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,800
I mean, she's beautiful.

857
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,060
She's totally beautiful.

858
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,180
I mean, I don't know what I should do.

859
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,720
Like I said, I can't.

860
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,500
I go out with girls, but I just don't want to be with them.

861
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,160
They just can't measure up to the way cartoons are.

862
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,140
Mm-hmm.

863
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,140
How do you feel that girls treat you, though?

864
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:44,860
On the whole?

865
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:45,460
Yeah.

866
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,540
I guess pretty well.

867
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,920
I mean, girls who I've been with in the past, I mean, have had some pretty decentable relationships

868
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,100
with.

869
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,100


870
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,100


871
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,500
I had one relationship with this one girl, and she hurt me really, really bad.

872
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,320
This girl back.

873
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:55,460
Yeah.

874
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:56,820
How'd she do that?

875
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,160
Well, she, we were like best friends.

876
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,260
We went out, and then, and we were best friends, and I think I fell in love with her.

877
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,200
And then she told me that, you know, we were together for a while, and she told me that

878
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,680
she couldn't handle it, and she broke it off.

879
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,820
Then we got back, and then she broke it off again.

880
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,860
This happened about 12 times, on and off.

881
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,880
You know, every time that she, we got back together, I was so happy, and then she would

882
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,680
break up with me again.

883
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,380
Right.

884
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:25,940
Well, you know, I think this is really at the heart of why you're so turned on to The

885
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,740
Little Mermaid and Jasmine and, you know, all these other cartoon figures.

886
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,200
Because real love is painful!

887
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,360
I mean, could you really...

888
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,080
It hurt you!

889
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:36,940
I like your voice.

890
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,020
You were a bouncing ball.

891
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,100
You were a yo-yo, and you didn't like it.

892
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:47,720
So why shouldn't you be happier having a paper woman who totally would never treat you poorly,

893
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,080
you could make up anything you want about her.

894
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,320
And you're totally in control, because there she is on paper.

895
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,460
I mean, I think she's more than just paper, though.

896
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,460
I mean, I don't know, sometimes I like to think that she maybe exists somewhere, like

897
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:06,280
some possible way in some world that she actually exists, and maybe I'll find her.

898
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,040
I don't know.

899
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,520
I mean, or Jasmine.

900
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,120
I mean, either one of the two, I guess.

901
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,360
Or I guess I would sacrifice for Belle.

902
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,820
I mean, these are the girls that I want to be with.

903
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,040
No one even, no one could possibly compare to them.

904
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,060
I mean, I don't know what I'm going to do later.

905
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,060


906
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,060


907
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,680
I mean, I don't know what I'm going to do later on in life.

908
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,340
You're going to have a real problem, Eric.

909
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,140
Because you're right.

910
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,360
You know, like I said, I masturbate to them.

911
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,680
I couldn't, I had an erection throughout the whole movie of Aladdin with Jasmine.

912
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,720
And even, like I said, when there was cleavage shown in Beauty and the Beast, I couldn't

913
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,100
believe it.

914
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,620
I got so turned on so quickly.

915
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,280
Well, you're absolutely right, Eric.

916
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:46,320
No girl's ever going to match up to that, because they get pimples.

917
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:48,920
They...

918
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,660
They might have a runny nose.

919
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,860
Their hair is oily sometimes.

920
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,140
Their eyes are puffy.

921
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,920
They're grumpy sometimes.

922
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,280
Yep.

923
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,180
They'll never, they'll never match.

924
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,080
You're right.

925
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,140
Oh, but that's okay.

926
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,460
Cut the, cut the poor guy some slack, okay?

927
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,780
John Bartle's here.

928
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,120
Oh, by the way, that tape.

929
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,900
We make good tape.

930
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:18,900


931
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,880
I'm going to show back to that, because it's so bizarre.

932
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:30,700
And yet, I bet some of you boys been thinking, baby, last time you saw that, uh, how about

933
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,460
Roger Rabbit?

934
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,760
Cool world.

935
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,840
The invisible girl.

936
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:44,300
That was the one I, I, well, uh, yeah, Dr. Legume up in Philadelphia submitted that,

937
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,600
that submission.

938
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,880
And, uh, I think with this song.

939
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:48,880


940
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,800
by John Bartles has a great deal of bearing on the exact same thing.

941
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,420
Thank you.

942
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:09,880
I'm hopelessly heterosexual, not overly intellectual, and I see you're heterosexual too.

943
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:25,600
So why don't we cut the crap and give in to this crazy trap and have a hopelessly heterosexual relationship, me and you.

944
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:36,140
Yep, I'm hopelessly heterosexual, no use in denying it, it's just impossible.

945
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,780
I was born that way, and you were.

946
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,360
We're born that way too.

947
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:49,280
Don't you see I'm hopelessly heterosexual over you.

948
00:40:51,500 --> 00:41:00,960
I'm hopelessly heterosexual over, over you.

949
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,880
Over you.

950
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,080
Hello?

951
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:22,540
Hello?

952
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:22,960
Hello?

953
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,920
I just called to let you know that I was sorry.

954
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,000
You're sorry?

955
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,080
I am sorry.

956
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,280
John, I'm sorry too.

957
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,440
Well, would you tell him that I'm sorry?

958
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,400
I'll tell him that you're very sorry.

959
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,980
And also that we didn't use that thing that he did.

960
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,000
You didn't?

961
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,240
No.

962
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:37,840
Oh.

963
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,840
So I'm double sorry.

964
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,000
You're double sorry.

965
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:41,440
Yes.

966
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,220
Okay.

967
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,800
But we're going to use the part you're on.

968
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,540
You're going to use the part that I'm on?

969
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:45,920
Yes.

970
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,800
Why?

971
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,940
I'm sorry.

972
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,320
For what might happen next.

973
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,740
I'm sorry.

974
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,560
The world revolves around your...

975
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,460
Self-perception.

976
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,440
Even though it's warped by your own self-perception.

977
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,880
Guess it's my fault.

978
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,000
You've got the wrong impression.

979
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,740
I'm sorry.

980
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,740
So sorry.

981
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,360
I'm sorry.

982
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,820
I'm sorrier than you.

983
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,300
I feel awful.

984
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,260
Yes, it's true.

985
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,760
I take full responsibility for everything you think.

986
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,740
And everything.

987
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:57,040
Everything I don't do.

988
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,420
I'm sorry.

989
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:08,480
I'm sorry.

990
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:11,560
Later.

991
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:11,560


992
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,120
I can't believe our eighth's my brother.

993
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,220
Thoughts on Betty Rubble.

994
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,680
Or Marge Simpson.

995
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,200
Oh, they're not pretty.

996
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,740
I think Jessica Rabbit's a real slut.

997
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,360
I mean, my friends told me I should try to think about her.

998
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,080
But I think she's just the horse.

999
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,800
You know, she's a little slut.

1000
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,140
I think Jessica will be with anyone.

1001
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,660
You know, not like Ariel.

1002
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,860
I mean, Ariel's faithful.

1003
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,040
I think Snow White also is a slut.

1004
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,040
I think she was doing a lot with those Seven Dwarves.

1005
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,160
I think she pulled off all seven of them.

1006
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,420
You know, I think Snow White's a real slut.

1007
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,920
and I don't know about Cinderella, but Ariel's not.

1008
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,800
I mean, she's loyal, and she'll be loyal to me.

1009
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,460
I think she'll be there for me.

1010
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,080
She would definitely be there for me and take care of me if I needed her.

1011
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,940
What do you think, Dr. J?

1012
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:58,800
I think you've got to be really careful, Eric.

1013
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,520
You're slipping into a little fantasy land here

1014
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,740
from whence it will be harder and harder for you to emerge over time,

1015
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,240
and I'm worried about you.

1016
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,720
You've got to give the guy credit, though.

1017
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,280
I mean, Belle and Little Mermaid, they are pretty.

1018
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,820
Yeah, sure.

1019
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:17,480
You know what I'm saying?

1020
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,420
Well, so is Mel Gibson and Dennis Quaid.

1021
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:25,720
You know, they're handsome, but, well, at least they're real people.

1022
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,200
What about Johnny Quest?

1023
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,820
Eric, you've got a problem here.

1024
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,420
I hate to tell you this because I know you're not happy hearing it,

1025
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,560
but the more you slip into doing this,

1026
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,160
I would say you have to stop this right away

1027
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:38,900
because...

1028
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:44,160
I see you going further and further into your imagination

1029
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,760
and being disappointed with real people,

1030
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,300
and that's where I think it comes from,

1031
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,440
your disappointment with girls and your hurt from this girl.

1032
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,780
Oh, I can certainly understand this guy being disappointed with real people,

1033
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:02,100
but how many real people are there after all?

1034
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,400
Now, we're going to get back to our investigations into the world of po-buckets,

1035
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:09,520
and I'm going to tell you a little bit about the world of po-buckers.

1036
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:14,700
I've got a little bit of tape here from one of the great po-buckers of all time, Jim Jones.

1037
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:21,600
Wish I had more Koresh friends because he would also certainly qualify.

1038
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,140
Sivit, what was it you wanted to say?

1039
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:31,460
The second word I think of when I hear the word po-bucker would probably have to be...

1040
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,940
M-r-r-r-r.

1041
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,540
M-r-r-r-r.

1042
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,140
M-r-r-r-r.

1043
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,820
Explores the most controversial phenomena of our time

1044
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:39,080
and tells you everything...

1045
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,180
Everything that can be known.

1046
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,020
That's us.

1047
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:42,280
The Midwest.

1048
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,560
A mother feels a sharp pain in her right hand.

1049
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:50,400
Far away at that exact same moment, her daughter screams as she touches a hot pan.

1050
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,720
Just chance?

1051
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,100
Or is it telling us something about our own untapped capabilities?

1052
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,800
Goes deeper into unexplained phenomena than ever before.

1053
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,300
It documents the facts and it covers what people were never willing to talk about.

1054
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,040
Stonehenge.

1055
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,060
Stonehenge.

1056
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:09,060


1057
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:09,160
Stonehenge.

1058
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:13,460
A visitor fashions a wire antenna in the shape of an ancient Egyptian symbol.

1059
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:18,340
He points it at the stones and a surge of power rushes into his arm, knocking him unconscious.

1060
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,680
Was it all in his mind or was it much more than that?

1061
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,640
Sponsored by the Church of the Subterranean.

1062
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,960
They tell us that we lost our tail.

1063
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,200
Evolving up.

1064
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,060
They tell us that we lost our tail. Evolving up.

1065
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:39,060


1066
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:39,060


1067
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:39,060


1068
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,080
Some little snail.

1069
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,820
I say it's all just wind and sail.

1070
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,940
Are we not men?

1071
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,300
We are Devo.

1072
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,300
Whoa.

1073
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,340
You figure that out if you want to.

1074
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,200
Some of you are too naive.

1075
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:07,880
You don't know what I'm...

1076
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,040
What Jim Jones is all about.

1077
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,000
You can't even follow him.

1078
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,080
You haven't even...

1079
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,500
You haven't even smelled where he's at yet.

1080
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:13,060
You haven't even...

1081
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:13,060


1082
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:13,820
Much less followed him.

1083
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:18,360
You don't even know who he is and you might miss him if you didn't have a real good look

1084
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:18,600
at him.

1085
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,940
You wouldn't even know who he looked like.

1086
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,940
You really haven't gotten next to him.

1087
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,580
But I've got all kinds of things in store.

1088
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:29,980
You...

1089
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:38,800
You who are stupid piss ants and reptiles and lower than the primates.

1090
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:39,040
You...

1091
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,040


1092
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,040


1093
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,040


1094
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,040


1095
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,040


1096
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,040


1097
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,040


1098
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,040


1099
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,040
You can make a hoopie if you want, but your hoopie makes me sicky.

1100
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:47,020
And so you can make your hoopie while I do something that's far more significant.

1101
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:52,780
I got me some big plans, both here, there, and everywhere.

1102
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,600
Got lots of plans.

1103
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:07,280
The relatives of Jonestown residents, their contact cut off from their loved ones by dad,

1104
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,980
were becoming troublesome.

1105
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:12,760
A group was formed called Concerned Relatives.

1106
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,020
And with the prized effectors Timothy and Grace Stone,

1107
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:21,560
the custody battle for John Victor became the center of the challenge.

1108
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,700
They also sent a petition to the U.S. State Department

1109
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,480
charging human rights violations in Jonestown.

1110
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,640
It was complicated.

1111
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:33,840
They think it's anachronized to talk about it.

1112
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,220
Odd in the same way that it would be odd

1113
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,040
to talk about it.

1114
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:45,180
It strikes me as odd in the same way that it would be odd

1115
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,160
odd in the same way that it would be odd

1116
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,360
but for some reason

1117
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,560
but for some reason

1118
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,860
but for some reason

1119
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,500
as to stimulate that appetite

1120
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,200
as to stimulate that appetite.

1121
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,720
We have seen the coming of a savior,

1122
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,560
a beacon of slack,

1123
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,940
a banner behind which we may all unite.

1124
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:24,220
It is the coming of J.R. Bob Dobbs

1125
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,800
and his mighty Church of the Subgenius.

1126
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,840
The subgenius

1127
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,380
is coming on

1128
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,960
in business suits.

1129
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,260
The subgenius is coming on in business suits.

1130
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,220
He chose that credit

1131
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,160
all that's the proof

1132
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,380
All we're not fed

1133
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,920
We are devolved

1134
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,060
All we're not fed

1135
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:55,260
DVO

1136
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,620
So ready to race

1137
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:58,840
Come in.

1138
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,040
Hi Sam, got a minute?

1139
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,900
Hi, Paula. What's on your mind?

1140
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:06,500
Sam, I think we have a real emergency situation here.

1141
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,240
I'm calling up your office.

1142
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,160
Are you aware that we're making some submission deadlines by just one day?

1143
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,560
No, I wasn't.

1144
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,140
I've been so busy recently that I haven't paid much attention.

1145
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,260
Another symptom.

1146
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:19,400
And take a look at this financial statement I just got from accounting.

1147
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,920
Endless submission.

1148
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:31,700
And you too can submit, dear friends, to the word of J.R. Bob Dogg, whose church this is.

1149
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,040
And, you know, you really ought to write.

1150
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:38,860
It's about time you got around to writing into the Church of the Subgenius for the free information.

1151
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:42,060
Well, it's catalog is what it is.

1152
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,520
But what a catalog.

1153
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,240
A catalog of sins.

1154
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,820
And I'd like to give you that post office box number to write to.

1155
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,400
Write.

1156
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:54,340
Now.

1157
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,020
We'll give you some.

1158
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,820
If you just write to Bob at...

1159
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,660
And you can just address that.

1160
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,940
B-O-B, friends.

1161
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,460
At P-O-B.

1162
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:13,820
That's post office box 140306.

1163
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:14,380
Ah, yes.

1164
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,720
140306.

1165
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,880
Dallas, Texas.

1166
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,380
75214.

1167
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,020
Yes, we're not kidding.

1168
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:27,020
It really is Dallas, Texas.

1169
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,740
This is Walter Concrete.

1170
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,740
We're here on this busy street corner to perform an interesting experiment.

1171
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,840
I'm an amputee.

1172
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:55,620
I'm going to ask the first person I see if he can tell if the thing hanging from my shoulder and my arm is really my arm or a prosthetic device totally concealed by new creamy stumps.

1173
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,840
Now, you in a stocking cap and cut-off bell-bottom shirt.

1174
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:00,600
Look.

1175
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:01,180
Ooh.

1176
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:01,660
Ooh.

1177
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:01,960
Look.

1178
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,560
I'm waving a tennis racket.

1179
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,480
Around for no apparent reason.

1180
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,480
Uh, do you have a quarter?

1181
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,340
You're losing this interview, buddy.

1182
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,740
I'm wearing creamy stumps.

1183
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,100
In reality, I have no arms.

1184
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:15,640
See?

1185
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,760
Do you have a quarter?

1186
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,740
Eaten away by the new plague tumors.

1187
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:25,400
There's no ozone like no ozone I know.

1188
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:29,020
Everyone is also very blotchy.

1189
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:29,720
Do you have a quarter?

1190
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,540
They're in my brain now, too.

1191
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:32,560
See?

1192
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:32,820
See?

1193
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,060
See?

1194
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:33,500
See?

1195
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:33,540


1196
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:33,540


1197
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:33,540


1198
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:33,540


1199
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:33,540


1200
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:33,540


1201
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:33,540


1202
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:33,540


1203
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:33,540


1204
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:33,960
I don't know.

1205
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:34,180
I don't know.

1206
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:34,180


1207
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:34,180


1208
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:34,180


1209
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:34,180


1210
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:34,180


1211
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:34,180


1212
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:34,180


1213
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:34,180


1214
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,160
Maybe a dollar or something.

1215
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,860
No, not at all, my bad man.

1216
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:40,980
Ring.

1217
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,000
Ring.

1218
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,260
Oh, hello?

1219
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:45,560
Ring.

1220
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:46,620
Yes?

1221
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:47,600
Is that?

1222
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,300
You don't say.

1223
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:48,800
You don't say.

1224
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,280
You don't say.

1225
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,760
They didn't say.

1226
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,940
Well, friends, that was brain rot radio just then.

1227
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,580
And it is, isn't it?

1228
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,000
It is.

1229
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,220
It is.

1230
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,120
Ah.

1231
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:01,560
Ah.

1232
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,740
Brain rot radio.

1233
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:08,460
Out of Cleveland, WCSB is where those ugly guys do that, and they are, too.

1234
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,260
I, oh, God.

1235
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,020
You know, if it, they'd never make it in TV.

1236
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:15,640
I would.

1237
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:16,220
Oh, yeah.

1238
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,240
Mm-hmm.

1239
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:28,580
Well, friends and others, you know, it wouldn't be a proper Pobucker type show without playing

1240
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:32,100
this Greg Keeler classic, Manly Men.

1241
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:39,980
And Greg Keeler, lone weirdo in Bozeman, Montana, created the song The Swinging Love Corpses

1242
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:43,520
Do A Killer Cover Of This, Dude, Man, It Rocks.

1243
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,140
Oh, my God.

1244
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,440
I'm going to sell it out, man.

1245
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:50,440


1246
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,180
We're men among men, man, manly men, yes, manly men are we.

1247
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:58,780
We're men among manly men, among manly, manly men are we.

1248
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,580
Oh, my God.

1249
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:02,720
We'll sail up north and cross the iceberg.

1250
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,000
and cross the barren snow fields.

1251
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:07,220
You gotta be tough and you gotta be a man

1252
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,540
to club the baby harp seal.

1253
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,920
To club the baby harp seal.

1254
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,300
We're men among men and manly men,

1255
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,020
yes, manly men are we.

1256
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,200
We're men among manly men,

1257
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,620
among manly manly men are we.

1258
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,520
We'll drive out west on a buffalo hunt

1259
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,480
in a Venture Bowl and daring,

1260
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,040
we'll shoot one again and again and again

1261
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,120
while the others stand there staring.

1262
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,620
While the others stand there staring.

When we shoot him down he'll get back up,

1268
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,720
so we'll shoot him down again.

1269
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,760
But he'll get back up so we'll shoot him down,

1270
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,340
because we are manly men.

00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,820
so dry and hot.

1278
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:32,620
We'll blow him over and take his horn

1279
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,320
and leave the rest to rot.

1280
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,720
Yes, leave the rest to rot.

We'll take that horn and sell it to our Taiwanese connections.

1286
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,380
They'll grind it up into medicine

1287
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,900
so men can get erections.

1288
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,260
So men can get erections.

1289
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,800

And, uh...

1321

And there...

1324
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:47,400
There's little pipes and subgenius, uh, imagery in it.

1325
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:51,840
Our post office box, 1403-06, Dallas, Texas, 75214,

1326

00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:22,060

1340
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:22,940

1341
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,480
For three years...

1342
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,400
It's been three years that, uh,

1343
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,660
these four musicians got together.

1344
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,420
Each musician had an idea.

1345
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,620
Juntos hicieron unos...

1346
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:33,520
They had a...

1347
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,580
They wanted to make new sounds.

1348
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:38,840
Uh...

1349
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,880
And, uh, what they...

1350
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,360
They got into hardcore y...

1351
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,940
Music, uh, Tejano music.

1352
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:46,400

1353
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,120

Lo que resultó es como...

1356
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,420
Chiu.

1357
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,920
Chiu, I don't know.

1358
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:01,820
And when, uh...

1359
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:03,860
And...

1360
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:07,300
And when you, with the Tortilla Diablo,

1361
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,760
take care that, uh,

1362
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,840

1363
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:17,320
And, uh, Praise Dobbs,

1364
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,220
this...

1365
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,320
Here it is, cut...

1366
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,320
Um...

1367
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,220
What's the name of the song?

1368
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:29,100
El carro demonio.

1369
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1370
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:00,720
Matar, matar, no vas a ver.

1371
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:27,260
No, no, no.

1372
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:34,180
En las noches han faltado ocho desde que apareció ese carro.

1373
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:38,480
Esa muerte, esa calavera hecho de fierro.

1374
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,520
El poder anda con las luces apagadas para que nunca lo vas

1375
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,780
a mirar hasta que ya está muy tarde.

1376
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:49,000
Y ya vas sobre las llantas del carro,

1377
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,140
las llantas rojas llenas de sangre.

1378
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,520
En las noches frías, solito mueres.

1379
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,400
Solito mueres.

1380
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:56,400


1381
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:56,820
Qué pasa?

1382
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:58,540
Es un caro.

1383
01:00:58,540 --> 01:00:59,920
Un caro demonio.

1384
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,800
Es un caro.

1385
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,060
Per libro de fondo.

1386
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,340
Es un caro de mono.

1387
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:09,140
Es un caro con peligro.

1388
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:12,700
Es un carro, un carro de fondo.

1389
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:14,980
Obrigado.

1390
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,260
No hay noche que pasa que no hay muerte.

1391
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:16,260


1392
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,720
.

1393
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:26,240
No hay noche que pasa que no hay muerte.

1394
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:35,440
Since that car appeared, that skull, that cold iron with blood on its body.

1395
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:39,260
There are no nights that pass that there are no people who cry,

1396
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:45,640
that they lack, that they put together a person because they did not pay attention to what they said.

1397
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:50,080
A car without lights, running in the neighborhoods,

1398
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:54,620
wanting to fix you for a car, a car of the devil.
