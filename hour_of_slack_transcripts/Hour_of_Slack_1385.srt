1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
From PR News in Washington, I'm an international hacker.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:12,480
In other news, South Carolina officials have announced that 3.6 million people up and down the East Coast are now in Connecticut.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:21,220
Mangled trees are slowly coming back on Connecticut's roadways after the governor lay at the side of the roads, a sign of powerful PR news in Connecticut.

4
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,060
Many live wires stay off the roads.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,800
Also, New York Stock Exchange closed for a second straight day because of PR news.

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,740
Delaware appears to have escaped the worst.

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:40,540
Despite the widespread damage, Governor Jack Markell says 30 people in Delaware remain without PR news compared to neighboring states.

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,780
The Associated Press is now reporting 39 people are now believed to be without PR news in Washington.

9
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,040
It's not too late.

10
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:53,920
You.

11
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,440
You can back out, tune out, drop out, and turn off.

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,200
Or you can stay listening for the Hour of Slack.

13
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,140
I got to thinking about something.

14
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes, dear?

15
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,800
A new and wondrous thing.

16
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,260
The finest dignity and elegance.

17
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,100
What is it?

18
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,840
The subgenius.

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,140
The power of Slack.

20
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,320
What a wonderful idea.

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:23,720
Oh.

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,320
Oh.

23
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:24,840
Oh.

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,020
Uh.

25
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,200
Uh, Bob.

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,860
Oh, yes.

27
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,420
Right.

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:40,460
Still so dark because it's still so early and the chipper little girlie at the front desk

29
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,860
doesn't mind at all.

30
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,460
These phony living rooms and fake plants are killing me.

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,580
This bad coffee's filling me with equal parts joy and rage.

32
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,440
Put my makeup on and crack in half.

33
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,400
I choke back a laugh.

34
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,140
Find the camera with the red light.

35
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,600
Good morning Tucson.

36
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,400
The lights come on and so I smile wide and say, good morning Tucson.

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,160
I throw to you before I throw the rest away.

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,980
When I was coming up I got the doughnuts which means I got the doughnuts that I wanted.

39
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,420
There was no young punk, there was no young punk, there was no young punk, there was no

40
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:22,420


41
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,780
young punk, there was no youngs.

42
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,920
I burst out to the confederacy.

43
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:28,920


44
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:28,920


45
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,500
When I know you'll talk to me better than all my friends.

46
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,660
And I hear people say can't you just go see if the gun is real?

47
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,880
And I get theirわかり as if we thought we were men.

48
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:39,920
For that they put me down since the first time, I think it's there's not a place in it

49
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:39,920


50
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:51,420
I chin up and say get awry.

51
00:02:51,420 --> 00:03:03,640
I'm writing something but I'm really far away, really far away. I keep my smile warm in case they turn the camera on cause now I have something to say, I have something to say.

52
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:23,240
The camera's melting but I just keep going, it's been a pleasure knowing you, I wish you all the best of luck.

53
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:31,020
When the prompter dies I'm comfortable winging it, I'm practically singing it, the song that tears the world apart.

54
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,540
Through the smoke beyond my part.

55
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,540
I see my giant face on the billboard by the highway.

56
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:47,000
Good morning Tucson, the lights come on and so I smile wide and say good morning Tucson.

57
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,780
I throw to you before I throw the rest away.

58
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,800
From PR News in Washington, I'm George McGovern today in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

59
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,620
President Obama today said he is a Republican.

60
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,760
Mr. Obama said he is outside of a metal fabrication plant.

61
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,580
The president also said he is coming in from the West.

62
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,060
President Obama was pleased to have picked up the crucial contracts to buy Vice President Joe Biden.

63
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,140
Mitt Romney's been big all day.

64
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,560
He repeatedly said he wants big status quo.

65
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,580
And at his second rally outside of Columbus he continued traveling with the Romney campaign.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,660
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says PR News was over before he and his top commanders knew what had happened.

67
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,560
Secretary Panetta told reporters,

68
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,140
What's going on?

69
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,100
Panetta said he and senior officers decided they did not want to put PR News at risk.

70
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,140
Ford Motor Company thinks it knows how to lose more money now in order to lose more money later.

71
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,560
Ford now says it will lose a billion and a half dollars in Europe this year and that much next year too.

72
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,240
But Bob says PR News will carry it through.

73
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,180
PR News in Washington.

74
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,620
The promise of US ذ

75
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,740
makes media panic.

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:32,860
from

77
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,780
all the stupid people

78
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,200
where do

79
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,720
they all belong

80
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,020
look at this moron

81
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,540
cutting me off

82
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,060
on the freeway because

83
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,160
he can't drive

84
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,540
he should not be alive

85
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,540
here comes George Jr.

86
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,180
constructing sentences badly

87
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,060
while he smirks and grins

88
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,540
will he get in

89
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,360
all the stupid

90
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
people

91
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,600
where do they all come from

92
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,340
all the stupid people

93
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,460
where do they all belong

94
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,060
I look at all the stupid people

95
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,060
I look at all the stupid people

96
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,160
Monica Lewinsky

97
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,820
down on her knees

98
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,860
in an office

99
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,340
it's all her fault

100
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,300
she's over in shape

101
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,080
they have her own tape

102
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,600
Limbaugh and Laura

103
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,540
turning it into a radio

104
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,000
moral crusade

105
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,680
they need to get laid

106
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,580
all the stupid

107
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,380
people

108
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,840
where do they all come from

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,340
all the stupid people

110
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,520
where do they all belong

111
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,620
I know what you're thinking

112
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,960
and I just

113
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,920
so I've got

114
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,760
I've got Mr. Obama

115
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,580
sitting here

116
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,120
but

117
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,520
you know about

118
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,760
you know

119
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,980
I just

120
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,580
whatever

121
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,460
but

122
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,080
I'm talking to

123
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,440
an empty chair

124
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,080
on the sub-spot

125
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,320
I'm talking to

126
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:31,340


127
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:31,760
I don't care

128
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,240
wonder what he's doing there

129
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,440
what do I see

130
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,580
proves the way

131
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,400
hey

132
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,300
don't worry

133
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,100
now make my day

134
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,020
oh

135
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,380
that's not fair

136
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,420
I'm afraid

137
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,460
oh

138
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,800
can't almost make

139
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,920
out his face

140
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,720
oh

141
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,320
yeah

142
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,400
I'm kind of dumb but I don't care

143
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,100
Republicans are everywhere

144
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,180
Staring at the empty chair

145
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,400
Maybe I made a mistake

146
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,040
Hey, dark hair is now to the gray

147
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,240
Oh, this whole routine's a mistake

148
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,840
Hey, only a stupid fake

149
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,400
Come on, I don't mind, yeah

150
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,980
I don't mind

151
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,100
I don't mind, yeah

152
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,500
I don't mind

153
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,780
I lost my mind, yeah

154
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,220
I don't mind

155
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,300
I don't mind

156
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,240
I can't find it anywhere

157
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,040
I don't mind

158
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,620
Get off my lawn, go away

159
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,000
Hey, I really won't look away

160
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,320
Oh, that rock's not there anyway

161
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,500
Hey

162
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,980
Hey

163
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,220
Hey

164
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,240
I don't mind, yeah

165
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,240


166
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,240


167
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,660
And, uh, that's so now we're moving onward

168
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,900
I, it, it, you know, it's, uh, it's something to, uh, to be thought about

169
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:45,560
And I think that, uh, when we get to, uh, uh, maybe, uh, the, uh, what?

170
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,320
Uh, I, I just, uh, I just think that, uh, there's so much to be done

171
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,720
Oh, anyway

172
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,700
Oh, sorry

173
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,360
Principals

174
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,020
Submissive

175
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,720
Submissive

176
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,740
Where folks home is where I graze

177
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,640
Hollywood is far away

178
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,040
God, I think my brain is fine

179
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,560
Hey, there's blood saying I died

180
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,740
Oh, feel kind of stupid inside

181
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,400
Hey, Roger Ebert almost cried

182
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,800
Oh, I don't mind, yeah

183
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,300
I don't mind

184
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,540
I don't mind, yeah

185
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,900
I don't mind

186
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,360
I lost my mind, yeah

187
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,640
I don't mind

188
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,920
I can't find

189
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,660
it anywhere

190
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,440
I don't mind

191
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:22,700
I don't mind

192
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,520
God, oh my doors open

193
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:33,800
I don't mind it

194
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,060
Hey You're the most

195
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,520
kind inside

196
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,360
банjo

197
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:35,360


198
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,300
You're the best

199
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,740
the best

200
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:37,740


201
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,420
approver

202
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:38,420


203
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,360
You're the quietest

204
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,480
Inside

205
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,760
All the best

206
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,140
Think about them

207
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,360
I think you're gonna

208
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:51,720
the best

209
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,540
All the best

210
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,460
I hope there aren't, in fact, any good-looking boys in the audience,

211
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,160
because something about this outfit just...

212
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,860
I think he was wearing a Pope outfit.

213
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,940
Friends, subgeniuses, countrymen...

214
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,900
Oh, no, I'm going to move this thing around.

215
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,680
All right, here we go.

216
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,420
Throughout the course of this phenomenon that many refer to as life,

217
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,640
most of the people you encounter will be trying to sell you something.

218
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,660
They'll try and sell you goods or services.

219
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,040
They'll try and sell you on ideas.

220
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,540
Drab men in drab suits will come to your door

221
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,960
and sell you fear in the form of life insurance.

222
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,300
Armed thugs will sell you protection in the guise of uniformed public servants.

223
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,460
The television will sell you inadequacy

224
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:49,660
and the police will sell you a gun.

225
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:49,660


226
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,180
They'll sell you ads and their sitcoms

227
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,780
where everyone is happier because they drink coke

228
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,600
or they have improbable sex lives

229
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,900
or wear all the best clothes.

230
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,640
Priests or monks or imams or whatever

231
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,420
will sell you guilt you don't need for things you haven't done

232
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,560
and then, miraculously,

233
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,620
the forgiveness or absolution or inner peace

234
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,060
that services as the brief salve for the mental illness

235
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,860
that they have inflicted upon you.

236
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,660
Our society first creates a need in our lives,

237
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,540
either real,

238
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,360
or imagined,

239
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,800
and then sells us a vanishingly temporary stopgap

240
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,020
so that we spend most of the short time we are allowed on this earth

241
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,140
trying to pour an empty bucket of useless shit

242
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,000
into a leaking tub of our existence.

243
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,620
I'm trying to sell you something right now.

244
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,580
Indeed, the same thing J.R. Bob Dobbs

245
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,560
has been trying to sell us since 1953.

246
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,680
And that is an empty box.

247
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,880
Some of you may be snickering out there now

248
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,700
thinking to yourselves,

249
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,900
yeah, Bob is always screwing us over

250
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,120
or something similar.

251
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,260
But if so, then you have greatly misunderstood

252
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,000
the nature, the purpose, and the promise of this organization.

253
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,060
When you go to the store and buy something

254
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,460
or order it off the internet,

255
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,980
whenever you buy a box that is supposed to be full of something,

256
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,620
the very best thing that can happen to you

257
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,800
is when you open that box

258
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,240
with your new blender in it

259
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,600
or your morning cornflakes or whatever,

260
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,680
the best thing that can happen is that you get exactly

261
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,780
what you were expecting.

262
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,400
It could be worse.

263
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,860
The blender could be broken or just a piece of crap

264
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,840
where the cereal could be covered with ants.

265
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,780
But even under the very best of circumstances,

266
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,800
you will be getting exactly what you wanted.

267
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,980
This is what is slowly killing you inside.

268
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,060
After the fleeting rush of exerting your will on the universe

269
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,580
by spending money, thereby validating your miserable job,

270
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,760
wears off, you are left with some unimaginative, unsurprising,

271
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:48,760


272
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,260
pile of protons, neutrons, and electrons

273
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,960
that, if you're lucky, works exactly like it was supposed to.

274
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,860
This is nowhere near as much fun as what you can do with an empty box.

275
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,060
With an empty box, every day is fucking Christmas.

276
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,420
Slap a little colored paper on there, leave it in the corner for a week,

277
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,560
and then open it one day with your eyes closed.

278
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,280
Suddenly, with only the power of your imagination,

279
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,700
the box has magically been filled with friendly chinchillas and oral sex

280
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,260
and a bottle of vodka.

281
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,620
That's right. Those little bastards are fuzzy.

282
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,660
When you join this church,

283
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,900
you receive just enough nifty shit to satisfy your consumer instinct,

284
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,860
a membership card identifying you to your fellows,

285
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,800
and then something I don't think a lot of us give a lot of time to thinking about.

286
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,380
You received an empty vessel,

287
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,500
the precise size and shape of deep and abiding faith,

288
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,040
but almost completely devoid of solid substance.

289
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,760
The little chinchillas are the only ones who can get it.

290
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,180
The little dogma we have is mutable, contradictory, and blatantly, admittedly ridiculous.

291
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,600
You can watch in awe as it crowds out your previous chauvinisms,

292
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,100
stereotypes, faiths, and iconographies,

293
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,240
and instead of a typical religious conversion,

294
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,900
which would merely substitute one set of mental shackles for another,

295
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,300
leaves an empty, comforting space in their wake.

296
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,740
Afterwards, if you're a true subgenius,

297
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,360
you will never take another holiday,

298
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,860
religious ceremony, or political speech seriously again.

299
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,880
Once you get the joke,

300
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,740
part of you will never, ever stop laughing.

301
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,700
When J.R. Bob Dobbs brainwashes you,

302
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,240
your mind stays clean!

303
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,700
Or at least, you know, converts it into something like a dry erase board,

304
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,480
with only a small permanent Dobbs head imprinted unobtrusively in the corner.

305
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:44,820
Bob has sold you something you have been giving away to the conspiracy your whole life,

306
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,280
something you didn't even know you were entirely missing.

307
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,340
Your own minds.

308
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,960
Folded, pressed, cleaned of pink claptrap and conspiracy mind control devices

309
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,360
with instructions for further care and maintenance.

310
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,240
Whether or not you stay with Bob's church for just a few years,

311
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,200
the rest of your life,

312
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,340
or whether you give him and the rest of us up in the morning,

313
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,940
and having had your fill,

314
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,340
you will never have to give your mind back to the conspiracy again.

315
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,740
Never again will you entirely swallow the conspiracy's bullshit pills,

316
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,340
because Bob has showed you how to tongue and cheek them

317
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,400
when they check to see if you swallowed.

318
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,880
Never again will your lips have to touch conspiracy ass,

319
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,720
as Bob has showed you how to get just close enough so that they'd think

320
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,400
that you have their submission.

321
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,700
Praise Bob.

322
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,160
Never again will the drama in your life seem like anything more than just that,

323
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,460
a badly scripted play acted out by a bunch of clutter-brained zombie monkeys.

324
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,580
And never again will you buy anything without secretly hoping

325
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,180
that when you open up that box, it is empty.

326
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,800
I'd like to finish with a small quote from a man who does a lovely little comic strip.

327
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,420
I don't know how to pronounce his name.

328
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,500
I think it's Andrew Hussier or something.

329
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,380
It's spelled Hussie.

330
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,180
So maybe I'll just call him Andrew Hussie.

331
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,380
But it seemed particularly poignant when he wrote it.

332
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,980
And the rest of his shit is very silly. It was very strange.

333
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,640
The upper echelons of irony should always include measures of sincerity.

334
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,640
And if the satirical practice is executed faithfully,

335
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,560
it will achieve something bona fide in its own right regardless.

336
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,480
Through an intense commitment bordering on religious devotion

337
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,320
to the absolutely inane, absurd, or plain fucking stupid,

338
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,260
a very different kind of sincerity begins to materialize.

339
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,940
One of reverence to the ridiculous.

340
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,500
You will begin to mean it.

341
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,260
But what that exactly means is never quite what appears on the surface,

342
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,820
and is utterly unacceptable to obtuse and illiteral minds.

343
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,960
That you mean it then becomes inseparable from the joke,

344
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,480
and additional rick strata of humor may be stripped aggressively

345
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,060
from this irreconcilable truth.

346
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,080
Amen.

347
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,900
It is now time to rock and roll.

348
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:18,020
Yes, friends, and it's a new day and a new dawn in America,

349
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,880
because Bronco Bomney has been elected.

350
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,840
And that was Janice Blackseed at 50 Next Day live.

351
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,840
The song Empty Chair and All the Stupid People

352
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,060
both were done by Reverend Phineas Narco

353
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,240
of NationalCynical.com.

354
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:46,060
He has a regular show that he podcasts.

355
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,660
It's sort of live on Sunday nights right after the hour of slack.

356
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,380
How about that?

357
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,920
On NationalCynical.com.

358
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,440
And before, oh, this other song, Good Morning Tucson,

359
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,280
is by Jonathan Coulton,

360
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,440
who, by the way, is not a reverend in the subgenius church.

361
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,760
We just like his stuff.

362
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,240
The collages, PR news, and so forth,

363
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,420
were by Fernanda Nandilemer,

364
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,200
and the mini-rants were by G. Gordon Gord.

365
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,080
And...

366
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:27,880
I'm tired of Bronco Bomney already.

367
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,380
Hey!

368
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,080
Friends, this is one of those time control shows

369
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,700
where we're live in the studio

370
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,780
after the election here on November 4th,

371
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,300
which, oddly enough, is also Halloween in Cleveland.

372
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,180
Back then, back on November 4th.

373
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,220
Halloween here was preempted by the real thing.

374
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,980
Yes, the real thing.

375
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,740
Hurricane Katrina...

376
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,360
Sandy, one of those.

377
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,060
Uh, horrible things.

378
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,080
And instead, they had Trick or Treat here

379
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,780
on Sunday night, November 4th.

380
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,400
Hence, we sit and wait for Dave

381
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,000
to join us in commentary

382
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,520
on America's new fate

383
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,140
here in post-election

384
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,460
United States of the Americas.

385
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,420
As that Nazi said in that movie,

386
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,740
uh, Iron Sky,

387
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,160
we saw a great movie over at Mr. Sister's house

388
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,400
called Iron Sky.

389
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,200
It's about Nazi, secret Nazi bases on the moon

390
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,120
surviving into President Sarah Palin's administration

391
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,940
in 2012 or something.

392
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:05,000
And, uh, and speaking of things, perhaps,

393
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,800
could it be...

394
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,180
Could it be...

395
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,520
Oh, it is!

396
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,620
Oh, it's our Dave!

397
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,520
It's our Dave!

398
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,480
It's Monarchus Fadunderboyd,

399
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,240
new ex-president of the United Snakes of America.

400
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,760
Oh, you're so beautiful.

401
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,320
Recently elected and recently reflected.

402
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:26,540
We welcome you, Bronco...bomby.

403
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,480
Hi.

404
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,240
Oh, wait, you're not Bronco Bomby,

405
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,440
you're Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

406
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,080
You're trying to...

407
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,500
I'm tired of Bronco Bomby!

408
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,960
I'm tired of...

409
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,840
Leave Bronco Bomby alone!

410
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,960
Of course I have been for quite some time now.

411
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,780
Keep your hands off my meme!

412
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,140
Dave, I'm worried now that Bronco Bomby is president.

413
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,160
I guess we're all gonna be...

414
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,880
We're all gonna be thralls under the communist

415
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,660
Wee Party regime.

416
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,300
I'm gonna quote that little Halloween child tonight

417
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,480
and say, I'm not afraid of Mitt Romney.

418
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,820
I'm gonna carry around my...

419
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,820
I'm gonna carry around my little red book

420
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,520
with the quotations of Chairman Barranque.

421
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,520
Chairman Barranque.

422
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,820
And I'll wait eagerly for a cultural revolution.

423
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,140
People with accordions in the streets singing strange songs,

424
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,260
beating up old schoolmasters and peeing on their feet.

425
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,180
Yes, it's our new...

426
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,720
It's a new destiny for our great land.

427
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,500
Or it's the same old destiny.

428
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,500
A manifest destiny.

429
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,600
Same old.

430
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,700
As seen here written on the ship's manifest.

431
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,600
Everyone's on board together.

432
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Bored as hell.

433
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,880
With endless television commercials and...

434
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,140
Row.

435
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,240
People showing up at the door.

436
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,360
Row.

437
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:49,580
Buy.

438
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:50,840
Buy.

439
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,440
Keep those slaves rowing and buying.

440
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,120
Well thanks to President Rheumatoid,

441
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,320
the United States has returned as...

442
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,740
Excuse me, the United States is and is,

443
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,720
an it.

444
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,540
Not a bunch of its together, although it is.

445
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,960
Thanks to stakes and snates rights.

446
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,340
It happens.

447
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,760
And their existential right to be, if it were.

448
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,620
The corporate snakes, the corporate states of America,

449
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,200
have regained control of the left field.

450
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,180
Yes, and we're all being shipped off to concentration camps.

451
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,680
They have one concentration camp for the libtards

452
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,720
and one for the rich.

453
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,740
And one for the repugnatans.

454
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,660
And another one for the undecided.

455
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,880
I'm going to Chomsky Island.

456
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,640
It's on the Gulag there.

457
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,200
It's where progressive libertarians come to have tea and be beaten.

458
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,480
Chomsky Island.

459
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,780
Oh, that's the pea party we've been hearing so much about.

460
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,180
I want to go to Chomsky Island too.

461
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,240
No, you have to stay here and run the wee party.

462
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:57,920
Aww.

463
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,600
And I will play this wee game.

464
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,400
A great wee game.

465
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,860
It's small but great.

466
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,240
Man.

467
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,480
Man.

468
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,060
Thanks to the national space and snakes.

469
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,640
Once again, the snakes all come together, don't they?

470
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,660
In a little pile near the rocks, don't they?

471
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,400
Await us.

472
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,180
They come together like rat tails do in a rat king,

473
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,400
where their tails are all tangled up by some carnival,

474
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,220
some carny who's showing off a...

475
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:33,380
A carnival.

476
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,240
A rat king for 50 cents a view.

477
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,280
That's the Americas of today.

478
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,120
Yes.

479
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,520
You know what a rat king is?

480
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:46,860
Everyone is Winston Smith and full of ratophobia.

481
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:47,640
What's...

482
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,980
Now, everybody's either Winston Smith or John Galt.

483
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,380
Oh, no.

484
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:54,880
Oh, yes.

485
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,820
John Galt.

486
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,260
Who is that John Galt?

487
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,140
Liberty.

488
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,920
Where is that Joe Buck?

489
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,060
Never heard of him.

490
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,940
Who is that Joe Buck?

491
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:11,020
Now I see him doing a mashup of Midnight Cowboy and Atlas Got Bored

492
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,420
and Shrugged It All Off.

493
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:17,600
I see Adam Smith in a pair of panty, ladies' old-fashioned pantyhose.

494
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,940
Oh, mmm, I can see his invisible hand.

495
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,300
And I see Karl Marx playing with his chest hair as they both dance the escadrille.

496
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:30,540
And Charlie Chaplin bouncing a big balloon globe of the world.

497
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,300
As the little dictator.

498
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,100
The big...

499
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,480
Well, the big one is yet to come, I guess.

500
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,140
What's the difference between Castro and a jockey strap?

501
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,020
I can't tell you on the radio.

502
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,640
But you can hear it on Rudy Ray Moore's classic album, The Return of Dolomite.

503
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,400
It...

504
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,080
It really?

505
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:46,900
Yeah.

506
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,860
It chafes...

507
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,140
It chafed his underwear?

508
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,080
Yeah.

509
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,760
Well, I can't give the punchline.

510
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,840
Because it would...

511
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,280
It would...

512
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,980
It uses the word dick in an inappropriate way.

513
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,160
Oh!

514
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,180
I hear those...

515
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,240
The lead tarts are coming.

516
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,920
You hear them in the background?

517
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,780
Yeah, I can hear them.

518
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:01,920
Oh, man.

519
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,520
It makes me nervous.

520
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,700
They're hurting my speech and so forth.

521
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,940
I really have a hard time when they...

522
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:12,340
Well, first the flashing lights and then, you know, turn around, turn around, turn around.

523
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,160
I turn around, they first skew, they play with your hair, and then later...

524
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:18,860
Oh, no!

525
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,000
Now it's the puka tarts!

526
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:20,520
Oh!

527
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,280
It's a Republican monster!

528
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,000
Yeah, the tamp is bad enough.

529
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,500
No, it's the communists!

530
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,800
Oh, it's the communists.

531
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,120
Oh, it's the communists.

532
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,140
Oh, it's the communists.

533
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,340
Yes, it's the communists.

534
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:28,680
The communists are the ones that are the most, you know, um, that's the most important

535
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:28,680


536
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:28,680


537
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:28,680


538
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:28,680


539
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:28,680


540
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,760
ask you to turn around and then, uh, stand up and play some dance, dance the loud thing.

541
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,240
Would you please?

542
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,420
Water?

543
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,600
Hello?

544
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,560
Water?

545
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,840
I think Dave's been listening to the, uh, Cleveland Heights police broadcast a

546
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,620
little bit too much.

547
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:43,900
Oh.

548
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:49,540
No, I've just had my ear to the pavement, like any astute follower of the fashion of

549
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,540
mankind and their strange bequestances to themselves, you know?

550
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,980
If you really want to know about the election riots, you listen to the police bands.

551
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,120
I've just been listening to the...

552
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,320
We have two friends who do that, Puzzling Evidence and Mr. Sister.

553
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,680
You can also go outside and see which way the red sky is moving.

554
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,380
It's a lot warmer listening to the radio than putting your ear down to the ground.

555
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,000
You don't need a wind man to know which way the wind blows.

556
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,980
Well, you do need a lot of socks and pants because we're camping out again tonight, kids,

557
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,400
after the fifth consecutive hurricane in a row.

558
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,260
Good morning, Tucson.

559
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,080
Wake up from your new hurricane.

560
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,020
The hurricanes have reached all the way to Arizona.

561
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,280
What? Is that?

562
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,260
Is it?

563
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,180
You hear that?

564
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:39,480
Is that her?

565
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:40,940
It's him.

566
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,520
It's the brain police coming.

567
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,280
Man, look out.

568
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,620
Oh, man, ever since Bronco Bomby was elected,

569
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,420
I knew the brain police were going to come after us and try to force brains into our skulls.

570
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,040
Oh, no, they're going to turn it.

571
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,300
We wanted to be so geniuses.

572
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,700
There's nothing left up there that I can remember.

573
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,000
I mean, whatever they want me to remember or don't want me to remember.

574
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,240
We don't want to be normal.

575
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,280
We don't want to have brains.

576
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,840
I don't want to know.

577
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,300
Like, there's so much I don't want to know.

578
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:15,420
Please put your hands on your brain and move towards the window where I can get a better glimpse of the outline of your brain.

579
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,120
Please.

580
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,100
Oh, they're smiling.

581
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,500
The police are really, really rude this year.

582
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,720
I mean, well, since the last time, anybody?

583
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,620
No.

584
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:27,960
You remember?

585
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:28,340
Yes.

586
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,180
History repeats itself.

587
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,540
Over and over.

588
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:31,900
Yep.

589
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:39,100
Every day, I end up having to go into that little room and let fluids run out of me.

590
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,900
Every day.

591
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,280
Sometimes more than once a day.

592
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,840
I tried to quit.

593
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,840
And now they're going to make us do it.

594
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,560
Now it's compulsory.

595
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,860
It's socialistic, more Muslimic Taliban Nazism.

596
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,980
Not to mention all the gauges that are on every receptacle.

597
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,200
You're not allowed to see what's in your fluids.

598
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,880
That's right.

599
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,760
Yeah, every time.

600
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,660
And then arrest you for whatever's coming out of you.

601
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,500
Instant analysis everywhere you go.

602
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:05,900
Yep.

603
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:13,860
They got a video camera and a pee tester outside the toilet and inside the toilet.

604
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:19,420
And somebody has to sit and watch all those videos from inside the toilet.

605
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,400
Again, the pee party has...

606
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,000
Reared its ugly behind.

607
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:28,120
Yes, and has regained control of...

608
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:34,140
The country after four years of the more Muslimic Taliban under...

609
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,540
Who was that previous president?

610
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,860
Oh, Mitt Robomabot.

611
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,640
Yes.

612
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:44,160
I'm happy that a lot of that social fabric moved its way into my neighborhood.

613
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,120
Because I've got 14 wives right now.

614
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:55,960
All I got to do is pray five times a day and be uncertain about what certain aspects of my existence really point to.

615
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,980
I mean, the direct...

616
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,820
I mean, well...

617
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,680
I mean, it was hard enough having one wife.

618
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:06,320
And now every man under Bronco Bomney is going to have to have multiple wives.

619
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:13,280
As many as you can possibly be expected to afford and fit into your cardboard box.

620
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:20,300
And that means multiplication two times because the more multiplications that you arrive at,

621
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,540
the more sinister forces disengage.

622
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,580
But that means there's plenty more people.

623
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,640
From one...

624
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,140
Or two particular guys.

625
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,620
It sounds like some sort of oriental mythology or something.

626
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:39,220
Well, we'll only be overpopulated for a short time longer because...

627
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,580
Thank you, Dobson.

628
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,460
Zeus, too.

629
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,140
Yeah.

630
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,080
The end of the world is a-coming.

631
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,400
Fast and hard.

632
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,400
It's coming yesterday.

633
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,980
November 6th, Election Day.

634
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,580
The day the Earth stood still.

635
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,500
At least...

636
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,540
There will be in all these families with all these many wives and one husband,

637
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,100
at least there will be one chicken in every pot.

638
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,140
And one pair of fuzzy mittens.

639
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,100
And a rat king to boot.

640
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:10,900
If only...

641
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,940
If only...

642
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,340
And this snake with no eyes.

643
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:17,480
If only Mitt Robomobot had been elected, there'd be some pot in every pot.

644
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:23,580
But instead, the fascist communists have taken over.

645
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,500
Well, once you vote for the plutocrat party...

646
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:26,980
From Utah.

647
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:26,980


648
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,180
Yeah.

649
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,280
Yeah.

650
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:27,440
Yeah.

651
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,740
Yeah.

652
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:27,800
Yeah.

653
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:27,800


654
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:27,800


655
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:27,800


656
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:27,800


657
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:27,800


658
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,660
It's a really weird statement, and it's a statement that's gonna linger with you for

659
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,620
the rest of your life like that bad tooth in the back of your head.

660
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,960
Oh, don't remind me.

661
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,700
Oh, you need to be reminded, sonny boy.

662
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,380
Now, get back in that booth and make the right choice.

663
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,660
We're recounting today, remember?

664
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,940
It's the third Sunday from last week.

665
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,560
Man, it's getting awful stinky in there.

666
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,560
And that boat...

667
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,640
They won't let me out of this voting booth.

668
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,560
It's been weeks.

669
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,680
There's no place to go.

670
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,600
I mean, you know.

671
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:01,180
I keep marking the ballot, and it keeps coming up.

672
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,200
Reverend Ivan Spang.

673
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,460
I've got to get out of here.

674
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,020
I'm going stir-crazy.

675
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,340
That's what you call a write-in candidate,

676
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,440
written in by the news media,

677
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,780
who really control all the voting.

678
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,100
They'll never actually...

679
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,220
They don't count anybody's votes.

680
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,500
They just make up these poll numbers,

681
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,040
and then you're polled.

682
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,480
And then they get you write-in.

683
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,160
I keep seeing this commentary.

684
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,980
Nobody ever polled me.

685
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,480
Oh, buddy, you don't know.

686
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,040
You're getting polled every day.

687
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,900
Yep, long and hard.

688
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,060
And don't think the old fixed network,

689
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,220
as they used to call it,

690
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,620
is going to call the election the way they want to

691
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,500
before everybody is cleared out of them election...

692
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,800
I mean, not them election booths.

693
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,820
I mean them exit polls.

694
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,560
Oh, yeah.

695
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,240
Oh, wait, there aren't as many as there were before.

696
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,240
So that will make fixed network

697
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:56,460
incredibly...

698
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,780
even more free to jump in

699
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,960
and say whoever they want to win

700
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,340
five hours early.

701
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,100
Is that how it works?

702
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,400
Well, that's...

703
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,260
I thought it was the communist MSNBP

704
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,000
that makes the news.

705
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,800
We don't make the news.

706
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,320
We write it.

707
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,920
No, we don't write the news.

708
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,000
We make it.

709
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,660
Something like that.

710
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,480
William S. Burroughs,

711
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,760
author of Tarzan.

712
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,000
Oh, wait.

713
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,360
No, that's the wrong...

714
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,280
That was Fred Burroughs.

715
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,360
You want the one with the apple?

716
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,400
The apple on his wife's head.

717
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,620
Yeah, yeah.

718
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,420
William Tell Burroughs.

719
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,520
You want to talk about naked lunches

720
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,340
and other things

721
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,740
and speak in this tone of voice

722
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,420
that's somewhat monotonous,

723
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,380
but yet the literature is truly there.

724
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,300
It's intact.

725
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,920
You just sit there and read and read.

726
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:52,320
Take a big bite off of that naked frog

727
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,480
on the end of your fork.

728
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,600
America is a country of fakes.

729
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,960
The buzz!

730
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,240
Who's doing that?

731
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,600
How did that...

732
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,760
They're trying to overpower us again

733
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,080
with that strange noise from out of space.

734
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,120
You know, I don't think it's fair

735
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,180
that Dave gets to have a buzz and we don't.

736
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,540
I didn't move there very much,

737
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,280
so I think something is strange somewhere else.

738
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,080
It's just a conspiracy.

739
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:24,880
Interference.

740
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,500
We get it.

741
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,900
You know, you'll have that.

742
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,780
Mm-hmm.

743
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:31,880
Along with all those compulsory babies

744
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,200
you'll have to have now.

745
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,520
Hey, man, why is this buzzing so loud now?

746
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,700
You have to get out.

747
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,520
Rape is compulsory.

748
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,380
Pregnancy is compulsory.

749
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,340
For everybody, man, woman, and child.

750
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,680
Children getting pregnant.

751
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,660
What is this country coming to?

752
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,640
High-tech buzz is...

753
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,880
Children becoming pregnant

754
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,060
before they're even born.

755
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,640
Impregnated within the womb

756
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,460
by the buzz.

757
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,860
By the buzz of the gods of Aldrin.

758
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,680
The Aldrin buzz and the moon Nazis.

759
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,520
Oh, mixed up and mashed together.

760
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,800
It will be under your seat

761
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,360
while you least expect it.

762
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,340
It will be outside of the window,

763
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,600
glimmering in the distance.

764
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,260
It'll be everywhere.

765
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,180
It'll be in your ears, in your head.

766
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,720
I already said head, didn't I?

767
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,320
Did I say head?

768
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,000
It'll be in your, you know...

769
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,760
It'll be everywhere.

770
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:22,900
Everywhere?

771
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,020


772
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,440
And you just wipe it out?

773
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,640
With a Q-tip?

774
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,700
Mucus.

775
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,740
The kind of mucus this country needs

776
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:34,300
to blow away some of the incendiary devices

777
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,700
implanted in your head since November 8th and 6th by 4th.

778
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,680
Dial once more and remember...

779
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,620
The buzz is everywhere.

780
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,160
The buzz is everywhere.

781
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,860
And the Robama bots are coming.

782
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,600
And they do.

783
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,240
Whether you're...

784
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,920
Whether you're conservative,

785
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,120
taved,

786
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:55,740
or liberal,

787
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,880
liberal,

788
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,620
you will cave in.

789
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,040
You will be made into one of us.

790
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,620
Obsolete.

791
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,720
Bob.

792
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,520
Bobsolete.

793
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,300
Ob.

794
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,800
Ob.

795
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,460
Bob.

796
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,000
Abrobomny.

797
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,780
Our new leader.

798
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,060
He's half black, half white, and half robot.

799
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,800
A gigantic 900-foot-tall robot.

800
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,420
A gigantic 900-foot-tall robot.

801
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:24,420


802
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,820
but sporting a 90-foot pipe

803
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:32,340
into which he has crammed and lit the souls

804
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:37,120
of all voters and all undecideds

805
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,720
who are still twiddling their thumbs and flipping coins.

806
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,260
But Washington's head keeps coming up.

807
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,760
They're waiting for Lincoln's head,

808
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:51,080
but it just keeps being Washington's head.

809
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,480
You know, the Washington coin?

810
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,860
The one-dollar Washington coin?

811
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:57,580
Mm-hmm.

812
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,380
Mm-hmm.

813
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,540
I like the one with the design of April Knox Tours

814
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,440
in the front in a full buxom position

815
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,840
showing her hog manis,

816
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,760
just as if the bunnies were out in the backyard

817
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,060
waiting for, you know, Christmas or whatever

818
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,680
kind of holiday they're going to have.

819
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,580
Oh, God, Christmas is coming.

820
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,100
Look, it's, look, it's, my God, it's gigantic.

821
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,480
Gigantic.

822
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,620
It's a huge Jesus Santa.

823
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,580
A gigantic Jesus Santa.

824
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,960
Hey, boy, look, he's knocking down Big Ben

825
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,300
and the Tower of London

826
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,840
and now the World Trade Center.

827
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,340
The Empire, he's climbing the Empire State Building.

828
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,300
God, he's got the Virgin Mary in his hand.

829
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,400
He's fighting off, he's beating off the airplanes.

830
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,100
He's beating off the tanks.

831
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,920
He's...

832
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,080
He's...

833
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,320
He's beating off the Empire State Building.

834
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:51,880
That's insane.

835
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,400
He's beating on the children.

836
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,840
Oh, my God.

837
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,460
He's beating off...

838
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,540
And it's not even Thanksgiving yet.

839
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,740
I've never seen anything like this before in my whole life.

840
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,080
This is the worst thing I've ever seen in my whole life.

841
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,580
Not even Thanksgiving yet.

842
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,980
Halloween is not even over

843
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:16,380
and already the Santa Jesus trudges through the snow.

844
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,500
The turkeys are frightened

845
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,420
and in the distance,

846
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,160
they look around as if expecting something,

847
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,360
not knowing what.

848
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,680
It is a harsh time of the winter.

849
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,040
Usually, the ground is covered in ice

850
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,740
and a half feet of frozen muck.

851
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,600
Often, the children take their strange religious artifacts

852
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,120
to the center of town

853
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,860
and burn them

854
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,920
and then try to resurrect them with magic power.

855
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,100
It is interesting insight,

856
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,140
but we come back every year to those mountains.

857
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,400
It's...

858
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:48,480
It's...

859
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,260
Oh, my God, Dave.

860
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:49,700
Dave.

861
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,000
I just...

862
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,640
The ticker tape is coming in on the radio station news feed.

863
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,660
They've done a recount on the election.

864
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,820
Bronco Bomney's not the president.

865
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,480
It turns out that Mitt Romano bought one after all

866
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,920
and the more Muslim Taliban regime is going to be...

867
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,180
Oh, no.

868
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,160
Well, at least we can blame GD for that.

869
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,780
I guess we better get used to it.

870
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,660
Man, I was just...

871
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,400
I was getting...

872
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:17,840
I hated...

873
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,700
Bronco Bomney,

874
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,000
and now I have to hate a new Robomobot.

875
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,540
It's one after another.

876
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,220
I'm dizzy.

877
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,160
And they never oil them on their guest appearances

878
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,860
or sometimes when they're in the backyard.

879
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,300
That makes my Gary Johnson...

880
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,940
It makes my Gary Johnson wilt.

881
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,440
It's limp.

882
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,500
It's a limp little soggy Johnson now.

883
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,460
Yeah, a little.

884
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,760
And Jill Frank N. Stein

885
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,480
is still waiting for her vote to be counted.

886
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,460
Do you mean there's only...

887
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,180
It's the Green Party.

888
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,660
She and her husband Frank N.

889
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,000
were running for the Green Party.

890
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,940
Frank N. Jill Stein.

891
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,440
Yeah, they're still running.

892
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,920
They're running now.

893
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,300
They and the Libertarians are running.

894
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,900
Running, my friends.

895
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,420
But escape is impossible

896
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:05,840
because our cameras are everywhere.

897
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,480
Our pee testers are everywhere.

898
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,280
The Tang Silly Party was hiding somewhere.

899
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,900
Everywhere the guerrillas do their dirty work if they can.

900
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,440
The hunters are coming.

901
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,900
Last week they blew up the bridge to Astabula.

902
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,020
And the other week Chagrin Falls was covered in chicken fur.

903
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,900
It is becoming quite a day-to-day thing.

904
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:30,740
Many of them live in the mountains wearing cans of pigs and huge cigars

905
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:33,460
and call themselves Raincoat Philosophers

906
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,480
as they enjoy themselves before they pass the postal.

907
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:44,240
This is Merrill Priswake with Seizuring News Corporation Incorporated

908
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,400
bringing you all the corporate state news down here

909
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,440
and up here in the United States.

910
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,720
We're in the Sierra Bozoto Mountains

911
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,640
where the forces of Jumbo...

912
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,220
I can't read his name.

913
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,280
Baloney Bobomabot.

914
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,140
Baloney Bobomabot.

915
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,140
Malarkey Bobomany.

916
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,580
I mean, these headphones aren't working.

917
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,880
Am I on right?

918
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,640
Yeah, yeah.

919
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:12,700
You're on.

920
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,580
Good morning, Tucson.

921
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,060
Good morning, Tucson.

922
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,140
Good morning, Vietnam!

923
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,880
It was a goat, man.

924
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,720
It was a huge goat.

925
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,580
And he said his name was Haramunamanum.

926
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,240
Well, he was the new...

927
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,760
You know, he said he was the guy, you know?

928
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,760
So I had to...

929
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,300
What was I supposed to do?

930
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,160
I believed him, you know?

931
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,200
I didn't know what else to believe.

932
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:35,520
Hey, man.

933
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,640
I know we're wreaking cop-a-buzz.

934
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,480
All I have to do is turn the background stuff down.

935
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:41,820
Listen.

936
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,560
Oh, man!

937
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,040
It's a great buzz.

938
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,620
It's enormous.

939
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,120
That's what I was telling everybody,

940
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:47,540
that...

941
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,900
Yeah, that guy.

942
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,580
That one guy.

943
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,100
The presidential guy.

944
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,820
The guy who's presidential.

945
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,200
Not that other guy.

946
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,640
That white sideburns guy.

947
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,280
The cool-looking corporate state guy,

948
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,840
not the really, like, goofy-looking corporate state guy.

949
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,220
Hey, let me have five seconds of just the buzz.

950
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:07,960
Okay?

951
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:08,180
Okay.

952
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:08,480
Ready?

953
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,000
Okay.

954
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,640
I can use a thing called sound soap,

955
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,660
which will make the buzz lesser,

956
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,520
but...

957
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:21,160
But our voices will become kind of a soapy, weird sound.

958
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,180
That's why it's called sound soap.

959
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,280
He'll be like Dave's talking to a cup.

960
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,320
It makes me...

961
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,780
Now it makes me weep because it was not there,

962
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,100
and now it is as if to...

963
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,740
Just to torment me.

964
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,900
What, did I get up and start jumping around

965
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,280
and clicking my heels because President Rosenfeld

966
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,520
was connected in a new direction

967
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,920
for his third substantial time?

968
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,340
I mean, come on, man.

969
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,400
Just think about it.

970
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,740
You know everybody's out there.

971
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,400
Get everybody at all times.

972
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,020
I mean, I'm not paranoid.

973
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,080
I wouldn't consider myself actually

974
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,720
a paranoid person, per se.

975
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,180
Hey, I'm paranoid.

976
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:55,500
Huh.

977
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,500
But, uh...

978
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,560
If they had it their way,

979
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:01,000
the president of the U.S. would be named Schicklgruber.

980
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,480
Well, it already is.

981
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,760
Eucharist v. Schicklgruber.

982
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,620
Oh, my God, that's right.

983
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,700
It has...

984
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,600
The president of the United States

985
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,360
is named Schicklgruber

986
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,820
and has been since 1945

987
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:16,740
when they secretly switched...

988
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,440
Earth with Mars

989
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,520
in their orbits around the sun.

990
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,600
I love this theory.

991
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,980
We were born on Mars, friends.

992
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,040
And yet, we were forced to this slave planet, Earth.

993
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,460
Earth Farm One, the space aliens call it.

994
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:37,000
And here we are trapped.

995
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,100
Trapped in this sinkhole, this gravity well.

996
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,680
Oh, oh, the gravity.

997
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,300
So...

998
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,360
So densely thick.

999
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,380
This air.

1000
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,900
Too hard to breathe.

1001
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:52,000
Doesn't everything seem to take longer than it should?

1002
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,840
Isn't everything getting a little heavier all the time?

1003
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,140
I rest my case!

1004
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,500
This is Mars!

1005
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,200
Earth was left behind in the distant orbit.

1006
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,900
A ruined planet.

1007
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:07,780
Dried out.

1008
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,480
All the atmosphere and water drained away

1009
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,600
by the conspiracy of the industrialists,

1010
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,720
of the more Muslimics,

1011
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,680
and the communist we-party of the Taliban Nazis

1012
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,840
from the moon!

1013
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,380
The moon, I tell you!

1014
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,700
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1015
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,980
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1016
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:26,440
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1017
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,340
I stand back from that window,

1018
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,560
shopping cakes, Mr. Hamstrung.

1019
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,360
There's nothing to die about.

1020
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,680
Everything's fine here back on planet Earth.

1021
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,100
We've taken care of it, don't you see?

1022
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,800
We've got our fingers where they should be.

1023
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,220
And not just holding back the dykes anymore.

1024
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,460
Not until Tuesday. Ha ha ha ha!

1025
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,920
That's not where that finger goes now.

1026
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,540
No, there's no goat.

1027
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,780
There's no goat there.

1028
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,320
There's no goat anywhere anymore.

1029
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,720
No goat. Just chevron.

1030
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,360
You mean, pres red rumma?

1031
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,080
Pres red rumma.

1032
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,100
He's not, he's not real.

1033
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,160
He's a picture.

1034
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,620
He's like a three-dimensional, he's a hologram, man.

1035
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,100
It's a hologram!

1036
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,380
There is a real...

1037
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,880
There is a real...

1038
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,340
There is a real...

1039
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,120
There is a real...

1040
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:07,120


1041
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,160
We feel like in a hologram, man.

1042
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,000
I don't...

1043
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,580
I don't...

1044
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,260
Who's, who's, who's missing with my hair?

1045
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,720
Ah, can't you tell?

1046
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,080
Those are the right electrodes, not the wrong ones.

1047
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:22,160
The kind we need for today's and tomorrow's future as well.

1048
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,180
And all of our children.

1049
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,840
Don't you think Bill Dinkins knows that?

1050
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:30,780
And as I, Bill Dinkins, ignore this message...

1051
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,480
Er, I...

1052
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,500
My name is Bob Dobbs, and I ignore this message.

1053
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,400
What were you saying, Princess Wade?

1054
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,720
I'm just ignoring it as hard as I can.

1055
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,240
That's not always easy to do.

1056
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:45,960
I'm not a friend.

1057
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,280
Goodbye, Jimmy.

1058
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,740
I'm tired of Bronco Bombay!

1059
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,020
It's okay, dear.

1060
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,320
It'll be over soon.

1061
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,740
Oh, they think it will be over soon.

1062
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,920
But the fools, the blind fools, how little they know.

1063
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,380
For soon, I shall rule the very world!

1064
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,280
I shall create a race of supermen!

1065
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,020
Ubermenschen!

1066
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,700
And, uh, soon, the moon itself will go.

1067
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,140
Grovel at my feet!

1068
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,860
Merry Christmas, little boys and girls.

1069
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,800
Soon you'll be praising Bob night and day.

1070
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:43,740
No more sleep for the bad little girls and boys or the good little girls and boys.

1071
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:44,580
Mm-hmm.

1072
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:50,820
From now on, we'll all be out in the mines, mining coal for our stockings...

1073
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:51,260
Oh!

1074
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:55,300
...and fighting monsters for our dinner.

1075
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,560
Ho ho ho ho.

1076
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:57,840
Oh, no!

1077
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,780
Oh, look, there's a baby monster.

1078
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,640
Completely arranged.

1079
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:01,700
What?

1080
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,060
So you can see everything.

1081
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,920
That's a baby monster?

1082
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,120
If there is none of you, it's so beautiful.

1083
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:13,060
If that's the baby, then, my God, the mother would be over 400 feet tall.

1084
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,460
What is that sound?

1085
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,180
Wait a minute.

1086
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:15,420
What is it?

1087
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,520
That's meters, not feet.

1088
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,300
It's three times bigger.

1089
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,420
Quick, turn on the oxygen displace-ar.

1090
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,340
Wait a minute.

1091
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,060
That's the wrong button, you fool.

1092
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,360
That was the oxygen overdose button!

1093
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,160
Turn it off!

1094
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:30,760
Turn it down!

1095
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,240
M-m-m-m-must...

1096
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,020
Too much oxygen!

1097
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,200
M-m-must...

1098
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:34,920
Reach...

1099
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,220
Oxygen switch!

1100
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,060
Blacking out!

1101
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,500
Getting high!

1102
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,020
If only it was this easy!

1103
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:42,580
Bleh!

1104
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:43,320
Bleh!

1105
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:43,900
Bleh!

1106
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:44,280
Bleh!

1107
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:44,860
Let me in!

1108
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,500
The buzz!

1109
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,280
Stand back!

1110
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,600
Hey, the bu-

1111
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:48,780
Stand back!

1112
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:49,340
Is the buzz...

1113
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,100
Oh, the buzz is there.

1114
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:51,920
The buzz is never-

1115
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,320
Oh, my God, I thought the buzz was gone for a minute there.

1116
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:57,380
I don't know what I would do if I couldn't cop a buzz.

1117
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,520
I was gone for a brief moment again, now I don't know.

1118
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,120
It's-it's recurrent.

1119
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,680
This music I've been playing in-

1120
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,820
... the political state of our great land is-

1121
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,280
...

1122
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:09,280


1123
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,560
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1124
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:19,880
Do you fear the buzziness or do you fear the Romney boy?

1125
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,700
I fear nothing.

1126
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,300
I'm not afraid of Mitt Romney, as that little girl said.

1127
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,760
What was the first little girl?

1128
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:32,640
See, Dave, we had trick-or-treaters tonight, and I wore a rubber Mitt Romney.

1129
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,800
I'll go ahead and say the name.

1130
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:39,540
Rubber Mitt Romney mask that Princess Wee bought for the WCSB Masquerade Ball,

1131
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:43,280
which you can see pictures of, including the masks.

1132
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:48,420
If you go to subgenius.com, friends, and this is a good—

1133
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:53,000
Uh-oh, those cat—those me lines are after—they're going to steal our wallets and our show.

1134
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,420
If we're not—

1135
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,060
Throw some Felvine at them.

1136
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:58,020
They'll grab that instead.

1137
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,020
Oh, God.

1138
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,880
That's what that smells.

1139
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:08,400
Anyway, we—OK, last week was the WCSB Masquerade Ball.

1140
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,300
At the Cleveland Public Theater, and it was a great success, and we took pictures,

1141
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:20,040
and you can see them on subgenius.com, because, friends, you're listening to the Hour of Slack

1142
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:24,080
from the Church of the Subgenius, heard in the background, creeping up on us.

1143
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:33,460
And if you go to subgenius.com and click on the Events button—

1144
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,360
Yes, Events.

1145
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,120
You'll come to a page that—

1146
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:43,620
Right at the top, it has links to the photos of the Masquerade Ball, and you can see some—

1147
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,080
It's interesting.

1148
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:55,320
Princess, we and I spent a lot of the time at that party with Mitt Romney, Abraham Lincoln, J.R. Bob Dobbs, and Cthulhu.

1149
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,180
Hello.

1150
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:04,160
The monster from the H.P. Lovecraft novels, and you can see—I'm not lying, and you can see the photographic evidence.

1151
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,120
Photos can't be—actually, the WCSB—

1152
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:08,100
The WCSB.

1153
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:13,680
The WCSB radio Facebook page has much better pictures than ours.

1154
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,000
Dave, I'm going to get rid of the buzz.

1155
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,200
It's still there.

1156
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:23,680
Does it mean you're going to dump me, or does it mean you're going to put that special—

1157
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,700
I'm going to dump you because I have a song to play.

1158
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,400
Don't dump Dave!

1159
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:35,880
I'm going to dump Dave because we have about seven minutes of PR news, G. Gordon Gordon rant, and Devo Dan.

1160
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,140
Devo Dan.

1161
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,080
Devo Dan is a very—

1162
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,380
Devo Dan is a very obscure musical act.

1163
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:48,340
Robin Mountain Boy turned us on to that, and Robin Renee in New York turned us on to Robin Mountain Boy.

1164
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:56,540
But she is, like, obsessed with this weird act called Devo Dan, and we'll be playing that in a minute.

1165
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:04,900
This is the Hour of Slack, broadcasting live from WCSB Studios in Cleveland, Ohio, a swing state.

1166
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:08,080
And, boy, have you ever been to the Ohio Swing?

1167
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:08,680
The Ohio Swingers website?

1168
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:09,500
Mm-hmm.

1169
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:15,280
Anyway, Dave, yeah, we're going to have to dump the buzz and go back to—

1170
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,820
Yeah, the buzz is fading now.

1171
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:18,540
I think you're right.

1172
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,500
I think it does know what you're doing.

1173
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:26,620
Well, it seemed to pick a peculiar point to suddenly go on again that loud, even.

1174
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,280
It's a cognizant buzz.

1175
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,600
It was totally—perhaps.

1176
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,680
The thing on my forehead is growing again.

1177
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:34,540
No!

1178
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:36,440
Yep.

1179
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,840
Well, I'm glad.

1180
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:38,080
It's about to happen.

1181
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:38,080


1182
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:38,080


1183
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:38,080


1184
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:38,080


1185
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:39,860
I'm glad it's not growing on me anymore.

1186
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,100
I implanted and re-implanted.

1187
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,400
No, actually, we have to go now.

1188
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,040
Come on, Rat King.

1189
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:52,740
From PR News in Washington, I'm briefly weakening, which is now projected for early Tuesday.

1190
00:52:53,120 --> 00:53:00,100
President Obama and Republican Mitt Romney are urging Westerners to kidnap 12,000 minors in Egypt.

1191
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:04,160
Offering $230 per person as an incentive.

1192
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,240
This is PR.

1193
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:05,920
PR News.

1194
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:06,460
Ga-ga-ga.

1195
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,900
Major League Baseball's.

1196
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:08,480
World Series.

1197
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,840
Are two to nothing in the best of seven series.

1198
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:14,000
Despite his team's lead, his players don't have it wrapped up yet.

1199
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:14,860
We don't.

1200
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:15,600
Believe me.

1201
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:16,740
Midnight.

1202
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:17,500
Midnight.

1203
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:18,080
Ga-ga-ga.

1204
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,260
That includes 14, 15, and four for PR News.

1205
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,560
Hello, friends.

1206
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,760
Dr. Gordon here.

1207
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:26,180
You know, I'm just thinking.

1208
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:31,420
There's a lot of people who could be, like, really cool, but they aren't.

1209
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,260
But they should be.

1210
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:37,260
And, you know, I got to thinking about that and worrying about that and wondering why, you know.

1211
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,480
And then I realized what it was.

1212
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:42,340
They take themselves seriously.

1213
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:51,340
They think that everything they do is very, very serious.

1214
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,720
And that's what's wrong with them.

1215
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,220
Because you can't take anything seriously.

1216
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,280
I mean, seriously, folks.

1217
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,960
How can you be serious about anything?

1218
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:07,240
Life is a short struggle out of one darkness into the other.

1219
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,420
It's a one-go-around.

1220
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,360
It's all you've got.

1221
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,200
The only thing that separates you from the monkeys is slack.

1222
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,240
And they've probably got more than you right now.

1223
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:22,240
Because if you take yourself seriously, then everything around you is to be taken seriously.

1224
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:28,140
And that means there's just too much seriosity going around.

1225
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:30,380
Ah, well.

1226
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:37,220
One of these days, people will find out that only Bob can make you realize that it's not

1227
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:43,720
just the under things of life that are important and nothing, dear friends, is to be taken

1228
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,800
seriously.

1229
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,440
Seriously.

1230
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,420
The End.

1231
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,740
Thank you for watching.

1232
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:54,740


1233
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:54,740


1234
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:54,740


1235
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:54,740


1236
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:54,740


1237
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:54,740


1238
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:54,740


1239
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:54,740


1240
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:55,840
Bye.

1241
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:57,340
Bye.

1242
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,020
Bye.

1243
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:59,260
Bye.

1244
00:54:59,260 --> 00:54:59,280
Bye.

1245
00:54:59,280 --> 00:54:59,880
Bye.

1246
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,500
Bye.

1247
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:00,500


1248
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,100
Bye.

1249
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:01,100


1250
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:01,100


1251
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:01,100


1252
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:14,160
She sits at the top, the top of the greenest tree

1253
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:21,820
She stands up and I roll my head up

1254
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,560
Under my love

1255
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,820
It drips on down

1256
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:30,760
And I miss from above

1257
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:36,020
You call me a fool

1258
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:39,380
You say it's a crazy scheme

1259
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,420
This one's for real

1260
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:47,560
I already bought the dream

1261
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:53,660
She calls everywhere you turn

1262
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:57,740
Headed for the pleasure bird

1263
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:00,740
So call me a fool

1264
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:01,380
That fool

1265
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:06,780
I'll never be through being cool

1266
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,800
Learn to work the minimum

1267
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,560
I play just where it fits

1268
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:18,900
Drink scotch whiskey all night long

1269
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,780
And eliminate the twits

1270
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:27,280
They got a name for the ninnies in the world

1271
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,720
Stuff, stuff on the tip of your tongue

1272
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:35,340
The real thing you do all alone

1273
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:40,500
She's just the girl you want

1274
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,600
Girl you want

1275
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,260
Now look at you

1276
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,920
With your mouth watering

1277
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,640
Now look at you

1278
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,060
With your mind spinning

1279
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,260
It seems like only yesterday

1280
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,380
I gazed through the glass

1281
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:20,220
An afternoon class

1282
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:24,040
I got off my ass

1283
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,920
Learn to work the minimum

1284
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,720
You call everywhere you turn

1285
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:30,720


1286
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:30,720


1287
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:30,720


1288
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:30,720


1289
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:30,720


1290
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:30,720


1291
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,400
Headed for the pleasure bird

1292
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:31,400


1293
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:31,400


1294
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:31,400


1295
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:31,400


1296
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:31,700
And I miss from above

1297
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:31,700


1298
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:31,700


1299
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,540
I play just where it fits

1300
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:37,900
Drink scotch whiskey all night long

1301
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,760
And eliminate the twits

1302
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,300
They got a name for the ninnies in the world

1303
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:50,100
Stuff, stuff on the tip of your tongue

1304
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:54,340
The real thing you do all alone

1305
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,540
She's just the girl you want

1306
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:00,720
Girl you want

1307
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:01,440
you are

1308
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:14,320
She sings from somewhere

1309
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,440
you can't see

1310
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:22,240
She sits at the top

1311
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,240
the top of the greenest tree

1312
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:31,480
She cries undefined love

1313
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,100
drips down from a mist above

1314
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:39,160
It's a beautiful world

1315
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:44,400
You know that she's just the girl

1316
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,260
I learn to work the minimum

1317
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:52,060
I play just where it fits

1318
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,080
Drink scotch whiskey

1319
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:54,960
Oh

1320
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,220
all night long

1321
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,980
and eliminate the twists

1322
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:04,580
I got an ape on the knees in the world

1323
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:08,240
Stuck, stuck on the tip of her tongue

1324
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,760
Why don't you admit it's over?

1325
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,620
She's just the girl you want

1326
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:30,260
Oh God, can't sleep

1327
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:30,260


1328
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:31,660
Oh God, can't sleep

1329
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:51,660
She has to work

1330
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:51,740
on the good

1331
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:51,840
aur HERE

1332
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:52,300
So sharp

1333
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,440
that there is no more money

1334
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:54,940
we're going to summarize

1335
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:07,780
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1336
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:11,300
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough

1337
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:14,080
to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1338
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,120
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1339
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:26,200
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1340
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:31,740
you should go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page,

1341
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:37,040
or the catalog store pages, and help out financially as best you can.

1342
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:41,400
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1343
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,040
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1344
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:48,020
But some of you still have jobs.

1345
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:54,900
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1346
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,260
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1347
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:06,100
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1348
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:11,880
We also take checks and money orders to subgeniusfoundation.

1349
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:17,080
P.O. Box 181417.

1350
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:19,100
Cleveland, Ohio.

1351
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,380
Heights, Ohio.

1353
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:29,260
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1354
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,400
We'll see you next time.

1355
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:37,680
Bye.

1356
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:42,660


1357

Bye.

Bye.

1368
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,100
Bye.

1369
