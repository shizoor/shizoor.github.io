1
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:41,000
I love you.

2
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,900
Genuine.

3
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,240
Beautiful.

4
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:01,960
Giant.

5
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:02,680
Perfect.

6
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,380
Cool.

7
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:03,940
Special.

8
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,500
Cheered.

9
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,180
Labyrinth.

10
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:05,440
Easy.

11
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:05,940
Ultimate.

12
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:06,400
Best.

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,780
Natural.

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,300
Growing.

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:07,820
Special.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,540
Nice.

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:08,880
Proud.

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,360
Quicker.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,460
And much more.

20
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:20,560
Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know that we're not

21
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:28,280
going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,720
No, I'm going to compress it.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,620
All into just this one intensive total rerun show.

24
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,820
Except that actually it's not.

25
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:47,400
The whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays

26
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,780
and holy days and the hole in head days, as it is for some people.

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,180
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of selling.

28
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,140
Selling.

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,480
Yes.

30
00:01:59,600 --> 00:01:59,820
Oh.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,620
You wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.

32
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,440
But anyway, happy whatever you do.

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,400
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.

34
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,440
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmas, a guitar axmas.

35
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,560
It's cool, man.

36
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:27,880
Cool.

37
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,340
Cool.

38
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,480
And.

39
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,620
And.

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,400
Praise Bob and her.

41
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,160
The whole.

42
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:44,220
Stan and Steve fucking intend for freedom to up in the veuxque mausoleum of Riley abi.

43
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,480
Go, go.

44
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,900
Star Wars 2066 is the头

45
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,260
from anopic genre that's notricted by copyright revival under sanfranxi.

46
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,260


47
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,240
OC community tratby foto released some material concerning the $1.5 million money spent on

48
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,240


49
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,940
Real director

50
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:52,940


51
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:52,940


52
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:58,660
And stuck my butt up on this Christmas tree

53
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,700
Who was that man?

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,460
He shoved it up my can

55
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,800
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree

56
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,480
When this angel heard

57
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:49,200
A dreadful fear went right into my heart

58
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,660
Those pine tree needles sting

59
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:52,920
And I'm in love with the way you love me

60
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:52,920


61
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,400
Ram-a-jam-a-ram-a-jam-a-nam-a-ding-dong

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,940
You'll never know how much that smarts

63
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,840
So who put the stump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp

64
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,540
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong

65
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,320
Who stood the wood where I boop-sheep-boop-sheep-ho

66
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,220
Who put the stick up my hip-de-dip-de-dip

67
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,960
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush

68
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,080
He made this angel beg for mercy, please

69
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,080
I might squeeze him too tight

70
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,700
It's that psychedelic time of the year

71
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,580
Do you know where your brain cells are?

72
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,660
It's already 9 p.m.

73
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,720
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him

74
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,760
Don't go walking down to the bar

75
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,640
Cause old Frankie died last night in the backyard

76
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,300
I mean, I'm in the apartment store

77
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,760
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?

78
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,060
Yeah, you can.

79
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,340
I brought back the chainsaw.

80
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,320
Yeah, and I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells

81
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,760
till I get the damn chainsaw fixed and back in my arm

82
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,960
the way it was Tuesday.

83
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,440
Now you boys be good, and I'll give you some of this here.

84
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,340
I ain't being okay with the body.

85
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,760
You ain't no good of a child.

86
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,580
That dog's running off with them brain cells.

87
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,100
Can you do something about that, boy?

88
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,560
I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to.

89
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,340
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.

90
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,040
What?

91
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,120
Merry Christmas!

92
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,940
Merry Christmas!

93
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,800
Merry Christmas!

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,560
Merry Christmas!

95
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,360
Merry Christmas!

96
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,740
What we as manufacturers sell you is fun.

97
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,840
The faith of a child.

98
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,800
Spend all the money you got.

99
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,960
Spend all the money you got.

100
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,300
Spend all the money you got.

101
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,520
I read you sais here at this Christmas talk.

102
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,080
Oh, look!

103
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,340
Dave's dressed like...

104
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,620
Santa Claus.

105
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,940
He's like a cowboy Santa.

106
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,560
How jolly.

107
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,340
Oh, Jaz is giving, gives Dave the show pill.

108
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:39,780
Pills!

109
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,200
Boy, I, I really need one of that.

110
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,140
What am I gonna do about laundering his seat though.

111
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,420
I need the show bath.

112
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,660
The show delousing.

113
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,280
Oh, Dave doesn't even have a head.

114
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:50,800
That's enough of that.

115
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,120
And that's enough of that.

116
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,420
I also have the part of my pancreas that I'd like to show you now.

117
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,740
It's been increased in size to...

118
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,440
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.

119
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,480
Look, it's swelling.

120
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,620
I have the capability of a man of 190 IQ's brain.

121
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,060
I'll put more pills out for everybody.

122
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,100
Oh, those pills.

123
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,760
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.

124
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,660
And my brain feel like it's a puddle.

125
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,920
A puddle of liquefied crystals.

126
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,480
I'm shocked by the...

127
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,340
The red pills are really good.

128
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,800
I like to take the red one and the blue one.

129
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,240
The red one and the blue one.

130
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,600
At the same time.

131
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,720
That way you go in and out.

132
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,660
The warp mix is easy.

133
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,900
It's so high, you can't go over it.

134
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,240
Angels we have heard on high

135
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,920
Singing about mountains high

136
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,780
And those mountains high

137
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,680
In reply

138
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,460
Saying we fish we had cloned too

139
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,580
енно

140
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,860
Orina

141
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:15,760
In excelsis Deo

142
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,200
Orina

143
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,640
In excelsis Deo

144
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,520
Barbie dogs.

145
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,100
Women rape and memorialize their lives by role-playing with bars.

146
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,200
Barbie dogs.

147
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:53,160
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

148
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,960
It will empower us to resist us.

149
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:05,780
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the public.

150
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,280
It will be a barber for kids.

151
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,800
But how?

152
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,800
Will a battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

153
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,200
Good at what, the muscle?

154
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,520
Good.

155
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,400
Good!

156
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,440
The primitive earth societies should accept this value judgment.

157
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,300
Good will have pre-physical attributes according to human desires,

158
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,920
sexual desires,

159
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,180
latent in...

160
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,940
...their children brought out.

161
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:54,760
Through the vehicle of this so-called farmer cult exploits at church.

162
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,080
Batteries not included.

163
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,500
She's new, from Kenner.

164
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,660
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

165
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,200
We must buy our toys!

166
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,680
Yes.

167
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:14,940
The old subgenius toy marketing scheme, recorded there at Dockstock, 1989.

168
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,180
The old subgenius toy marketing scheme, recorded there at Dockstock, 1989.

169
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,180
Made in 1999.

170
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,940
Looks like now sit.

171
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:36,700
This is the last of the Gesch Ads'

172
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:38,620
Used strive,

173
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,620
but I have listed.

174
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:43,760
Internal

175
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,420
Ah yes, and next up, The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.

176
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,460
Once upon a time, there was the baby Jesus.

177
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,960
And he had two eyes made out of coal.

178
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,160
And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.

179
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,820
And he wanted his two front teeth.

180
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,860
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.

181
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,360
And he had a dog named Santa's little helper.

182
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,840
And he took all the presents from Whoville.

183
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,660
And his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys.

184
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,380
And he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy.

185
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,540
But he couldn't.

186
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,380
He wanted tens and twenties.

187
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,880
Tens and twenties.

188
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,400
And he...

189
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,300
He got McDonald's gift certificates and he got Zuzu's pedals.

190
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,900
And that's the real story of Christmas.

191
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,140
Take the halls with the miles of holly

192
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,160
Tears of the season to be jolly

193
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,740
Don't we know I'll get a thorough

194
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,700
Roll the engine, you tight-capped

La la la la la la la la la la la

197
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:33,080
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas.

198
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,260
He wanted an electric train.

199
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,400
He had the whole thing in his mind, even to the table where it was going to set it up.

200
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,360
He achieved shouldn't have fallen.

201
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:04,220

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:04,760

218
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,600
Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher.

219
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,420
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy-looking train set with locomotives and freight cars.

220
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,500
The station and the gateman.

221
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,320
The water tower and all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.

222
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,340
So grand that you might think Tommy was waiting for something that just didn't exist.

223
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,420
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.

224
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,900
So separate.

225
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,840
So separate.

226
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,660
So separate.

227
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,320
New from Tonka.

228
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,860
Now you're in my evil clutches, Bob.

229
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,420
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal.

230
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,640
Shut up, pink boy.

231
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,540
No way.

232
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,140
I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.

233
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,240
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien tool.

234
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,660
Bob Dodds comes with rocket pipe, head launcher, jayner device, oligarchatism, a fighting Jesus, and other action figures sold separately.

235
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,300
Some assembly required.

236
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,240
Batteries not included.

237
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,480
This toy falls apart in three days.

238
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,480
He-Bob.

239
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,140
And the bastards of the universe.

240
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,500
Too much is always better than not enough.

241
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,420
From Bob.

242
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,740
And I can't douse it separately.

243
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,760
Gorgeous.

244
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,660
See, girls can blow from head to toe.

245
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,400
Charlie, everything you see here, I can't douse it separately.

246
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,320
He-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message.

247
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,060
Santa Claus.

248
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,780
It is turnover.

249
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,300
The time of the year when all things sell.

250
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,860
The end of the year sale.

251
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,660
Ah, yes.

252
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,420
So come and get it, everyone, and just buy our products.

253
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,260
Now, are we, is Christmas, I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

254
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,800
Are we celebrating the birthday?

255
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,660
The birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?

256
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,960
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.

257
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:26,580
But the present subgenie try to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now and sell everything to the pigs.

258
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,800
Oh, yes.

259
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,600
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.

260
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,920
And it was something else in between there.

261
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:41,700
But before it was, after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season, it was something else.

262
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,660
But I think they started.

263
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,500
The war over it.

264
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:43,880
Yeah.

265
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,080
Yeah.

266
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,660
Yeah, it was weird.

267
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,240
Yeah.

268
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,100
Wow.

269
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:22,860
Wow.

270
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,560
People got obsessed with it.

271
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:42,560


272
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:42,560


273
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:42,560


274
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:42,560


275
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:42,600
Some are using sports figures.

276
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:42,600


277
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:42,640
It is the best.

278
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:42,780
Dealing with kids has seen this will change the fact that we areoglobal saints.

279
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:42,780


280
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,240
Thank you.

281
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,400
Thank you.

282
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,920
Thank you.

283
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,000
Thank you.

284
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,220
Thank you.

285
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,500
Bob did a backflip, and from that day on, he too was a believer.

286
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,620
And from the snowdrift, a little child bearing flowers emerged.

287
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,080
Each one a dirty flower.

288
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:39,300
The historical Santa Claus is originally lived, as the caller knows, as a bishop in, was it Constantinople?

289
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,560
It was an ancient Byzantium.

290
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,660
Asia Minor in general.

291
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:56,720
Yes, and he was known for sneaking into the rooms of young women and leaving gifts.

292
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:02,020
Light-sized lumps of coal, complete with a fake beard and a CIA Wall Street credit card.

293
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,420
A saint he was, the girl said.

294
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,160
St. Nicholas invented the CIA.

295
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,300
That's good.

296
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:08,940
That's you.

297
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,760
You got it, brother.

298
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,740
Snuck into people's houses through the chimney.

299
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,880
You got it, brother.

300
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,380
They knew when they were sleeping.

301
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,320
He knew when they were awake.

302
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,080
You got it, brother.

303
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,240
But like the CIA, he was protecting them.

304
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,720
St. Nick was a creeping, stinking spy.

305
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,760
He knows when you've been sleeping.

306
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,340
He knows what you've been eating.

307
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,200
Hey, man, my kids still believe in St. Nicholas.

308
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,220
And who keeps that belief alive in their fevered, sick little brain?

309
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,460
Madison Avenue, of course.

310
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,320
No, the surveillance community.

311
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:38,800
And Disney.

312
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,020
Under your direction.

313
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,920
And the Reynolds Tobacco Company.

314
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,120
Miller Bear.

315
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,000
He's a very powerful being.

316
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,640
If you're bad, he punishes you.

317
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,380
If you're good, he rewards you.

318
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,900
He's probably the closest thing to Jesus walking the earth.

319
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,800
He's the closest thing to Big Brother there is.

320
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,520
He rewards those who knows when they are smiling when they're awake.

321
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:00,280
I think really if you want to make a deal, you have to do it with, you know.

322
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:08,100
Could Dr. Claus in fact be the wandering, quote, milkman rumored to have fathered our savior,

323
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:08,880
James?

324
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,060
They are Bob Dobbs?

325
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:15,460
Well, we find it a very likely possibility from the falsified documents we have here.

326
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,220
And also the fluffy beard that often grew on Bob's feet.

327
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,040
You better watch out.

328
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,460
You better not.

329
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,320
You better not.

330
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,500
Because I'm telling you why.

331
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:34,180
St. Nicholas is coming to town.

332
00:21:50,860 --> 00:22:04,320
St. Nicholas is coming to town.

333
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,260
St. Nicholas is coming to town.

334
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,320
Thank you very much.

335
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:08,920
There he is.

336
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:08,920


337
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,400
Here is the thing, he knows when you are away.

338
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,980
He knows when you're in bad or good.

339
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,840
So be good in this goodness sake.

340
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,640
Oh, you better watch out.

341
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,380
You better not cry.

342
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,040
You better not tell them how you are.

343
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,980
Santa Claus is coming to town.

344
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,960
Do you think I'm psycho, mama?

345
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,600
I've seen my ex last night.

346
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

347
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,540
We all saw X-Mas last night.

348
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,000
A vision of Christmas that was dancing in Stank's head.

349
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,940
It would not live for the little sugar plums and berries dropping toxic things.

350
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,560
All those little sugar plums.

351
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,660
All those sweet and that plums.

352
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,220
The poison in the plums.

353
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,140
But the real plums.

354
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,300
Biological agents.

355
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,540
Who only take 15%?

356
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,880
It came with us, yes.

357
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,560
These boxes of bags.

358
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,480
And now.

359
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,860
And now.

360
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,640
And now.

361
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,120
And now.

362
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,660
And now.

363
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,460
And now.

364
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,080
Oh, for my baby and my Linda please.

365
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,720
This is no candy.

366
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:51,900
It will trace and conquer our future.

367
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,700
relaxed enquanto el blankets soon

368
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:58,400

372
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,180
It's two days old Christmas, a million things to do

373
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,780
Clean the house, put on tea, company is due

374
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,460
Where are my relatives? Why haven't they showed up?

375
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,540
I bet they're at the airport, I forgot to pick them up

376
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,320
Christmas is almost here

377
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,560
Sometimes I think all that Santa crap's just bull

378
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,380
Santa Claus is real

379
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,680
Santa Claus is real

00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,040
Santa Claus is real

00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,380
Santa Claus is real

Santa Claus is real

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,040
Santa Claus is real

You're the cause for the child

385
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,160
Who's the head man?

386
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,580
Santa Claus

387
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,500
Santa Claus

388
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,060
He was a huge beastly, bulging man

389
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,040
You're so real, how come we didn't get squat last year?

390
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,940
Yes, the birth of the baby Satan

On July 4th

395
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,740
By various authors and eclectic scholars from around the globular unit

396
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,440
Including that announcer

397
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,000
This announcement has not been a perfunctory announcement

398
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,260
But an announcement of the blessed anointing and birthday of our Lord

399
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:49,960
For one bright Christmas morning

400
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,760
The same

401
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,400

To a rich man's family

405
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,060
The rave Jesus

406
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,860
Oh, I know the rave Jesus

407
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,720
I'm barking with the rave Jesus

408
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:08,860
Have yourself a merry little Christmas

409
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:15,180
Have yourself a merry little Christmas

410
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,180
Let your side be light

411
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,440
Let your side bright

412
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:29,980
From now on our troubles will be out of sight

413
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:38,100
From now on have yourself a merry little Christmas

414
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,400
From now on

415
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,500
We'll be miles away

416
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,380
We'll be miles away

417
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,480
We'll be miles away

418
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,020
We'll be miles away

419
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:59,940
Once again, as in olden days, happy golden days.

420
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:09,460
Be miles away, let your heart be out of sight.

421
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,100
I love sight.

423
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:20,600
I wish everybody a crystal merry Christmas.

00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,280
And it's gonna be good.

425
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,820
From Mutated Christmas, friends.

No-L.

428
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:42,360
Before that, some year-old ESO and Michael Shelley did that real story of Christmas

429
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:48,080
from the Tarkin Records All-Star Holiday Extravaganza.

430
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,180
I'm playing a lot from that.

431
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,700

438
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:42,020
The Weir Bobs and Ima, those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.

439
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,880
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.

440
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:50,160
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless, hideous errands.

441
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:57,580
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.

442
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,780
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float into the keyhole.

443
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,300
Well, friends, it's tough.

444
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:09,180
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.

445
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,640
You've got to send your money to the Santa Bob.

446
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:21,800
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me told their kids that Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.

447
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,740
Can you believe that?

448
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:30,580
The kids were asking if their parents, maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.

449
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,880
And the mom said, no, no, he won't.

450
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,300
Because he bills us.

451
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,300
We can't afford that.

452
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,260
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.

453
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,020
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

454
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,640
Let me go.

455
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,200
Let me go.

456
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,260
Let me go.

457
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,000
Let me go.

458
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:02,860
Let me go.

459
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:02,860


460
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:02,860


461
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:02,860

00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:02,860


466
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:02,860


467
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,540
Let me go.

468
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,260
No Matthew.

469
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,300
Let me go.

470
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,840
Let me go.

471
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,040
Let me go.

472
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,020
Let me go.

473
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,020


474
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,100


475
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,100


476
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,100


477
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,320
Ja, yeah, I'd like a picture.

478
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:29,840
Because...

479
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,280
And amazing.

480
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,960
More from Corporal Blossom.

481
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,600
I am really impressed by their editing work.

482

496
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,300
I remember my father well, you know.

497
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,160
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache.

498
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,380
He used to have, you know what caused it, Ben?

499
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:55,400
He used to put a stocking cap on his head and put a knock light in front of it.

500
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,880
Daddy wake up with that stomping headache.

501
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,820
And he said, the kids are saying, my head's hurting so bad.

502
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,040
I said, I don't know what Santa's going to get y'all for Christmas, but he's going to bring you something.

503
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:12,300
So daddy took that old rifle and went outside and shot up in the air and come back inside and told us the biggest lie ever heard.

504
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,520
Said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.

505
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,340
And whose birth do we celebrate with this new century?

506
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:28,120
Who was nailed on that great manger cradle but Satan Claus?

507
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,100
Oh my gosh, dang, come on.

508
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,440
His father, Paul Bunyan.

509
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,020
And his mother, Big Sister.

510
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,000
Did they have Christmas before there were malls?

511
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,760
Before there were malls, there was no such thing as Christmas.

512
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:48,800
Yes, there was a down-home Norman Rockwell style, it's a wonderful life type of Christmas.

513
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:58,620
It was a kite flying Coca-Cola drinking Christmas, not a crack smoking rubber snapping Christmas.

514
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,660
Rolling holy dough.

515
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,700
It was a...

516
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,660
Oh man, we have the chance.

517
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,620
When your little brother broke through the hole, it fell through a hole in the ice sling.

518
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,280
And you went and saved him, you didn't laugh at him and huff some more glue.

519
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,400
It was a wonderful life back then.

520
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,660
And then we'd put candles, like most people have Christmas candles.

521
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,440
But today, Christmas is now.

522
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,120
It's me.

523
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,280
We've just eaten the crap out of Santa Claus.

524
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:36,280
Scott, you made your choice.

525
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,700
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.

526
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:48,660
And to your eternal soul, you have found that only could you afford to give to God that which was his.

527
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,560
But you could not afford to do otherwise.

528
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,880
The Senate still stands.

529
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,760
From...

530
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,240
The snowman.

531
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,480
Into outer darkness.

532
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,380
Where there is wailing and gnashing of feet.

533
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,640
Sir, please give me just one more chance, sir.

534
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,880
I don't wanna go to hell, sir!

535
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,320
Turn down!

536
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,180
No!

537
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,180
Thank God I don't wanna go to hell!

538
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,660
No!

539
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:18,800
No!

540
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,460
No!

541
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,420
No!

542
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:20,620
No!

543
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:26,160
And the children say who could laugh and play just the same.

544
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,700
No!

545
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:27,600
I can't talk!

546
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:27,680
No!

547
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,780
The tale bearer will be at the judgement.

548
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:30,720
No!

549
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,680
No!

550
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,540
Make me stand!

551
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:36,620
No!

552
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:37,740
No!

553
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,300
No!

554
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,300


555
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,300


556
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,300


557
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,400
No!

558
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:41,820
No!

559
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,080
No!

560
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,080


561
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,080


562
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:42,520
No!

563
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,280
No!

564
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:43,980
No!

565
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:43,980


566
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,220
No!

567
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,460
No!

568
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,520
No!

569
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,960
No!

570
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,640
Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.

571
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,440
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,

572
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,540
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.

573
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,340
Dare I ask it? Yes.

574
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,040
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,

575
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,640
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the earth each and every day?

576
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,620
The answer? Yes, definitely.

577
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,220
Take that and shove it up the tube marked certainty,

578
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,340
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

579
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,820
Merry Christmas to all, now you're all gonna die.

580
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,040
The night Santa went crazy.

581
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,640
The night Saint Nick went insane.

582
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:01,260
Realized he'd been getting the wrong deal.

583
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,540
Something finally must have snapped in his brain.

584
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,700
Well, the workshop is gone now.

585
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,680
He decided to bomb it.

586
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:13,600
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet.

587
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,540
And he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage.

588
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,360
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage.

589
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,340
He got desperate friends.

590
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,600
He was a great dancer with an old German Luger.

591
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,620
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger.

592
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,260
And he picked up a flamethrower and a barbecue blitzer.

593
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,280
And he took a big bite to say that it tastes just like chicken.

594
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,640
The night Santa went crazy.

595
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,360
The night Kris Kringle went nuts.

596
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:52,340
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole without stepping in reindeer.

597
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,420
There's a National Guard and the FBI.

598
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,720
There's a van from the Eyewitness News.

599
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:07,500
And helicopters circling round in the sky.

600
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,500
And the bullets are flying.

601
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,680
The bodyguards rising.

602
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,080
And everyone's dying to know who Santa was.

603
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,240
My, my, my, my, my, my.

604
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,320
Santa's not here.

605
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,320


606
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,320


607
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,320


608
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,320


609
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,320


610
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,320


611
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,320


612
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,320


613
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:22,320


614
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,220
You used to be such a jolly guy.

615
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,680
He knows when you're sleeping.

616
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,820
He knows when you're awake.

617
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,800
He knows when you've been found.

618
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,740
For good.

619
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,720
For the good.

620
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,960
For goodness sake.

621
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,780
You better watch out.

622
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,120
You better not cry.

623
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,580
You better not pout.

624
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,680
I'm telling you why.

625
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,100
Santa Claus is coming to town.

626
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,620
Santa Claus is coming to town.

627
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,720
Have yourself an advanced Dogmatic Christmas song thing called

628
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,140
Santa is Coming by F. Gillespie.

629
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,580
And F. J. Coot.

630
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,980
ElectricElf at loop.com can tell you more about that.

631
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:28,620
But now...

632
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,260
Who gave the Lord the claptrap?

633
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,740
Who made him talk in funny riddles so that we cannot understand?

634
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,680
Who made him so succinct and blind that he is actually blind?

635
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:41,480
Yeah, we're now officially in the Jesus season.

636
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,760
The time of the Lord.

637
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,760
How many before you reach your limit?

638
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,720
How many do you get?

639
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:48,720
Jesuses?

640
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,080
Yeah.

641
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:49,480
How many?

642
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,080
How many can you bag?

643
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,920
How many messiahs can you bag?

644
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,100
How many male Jesuses?

645
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,720
If you're doing it in season...

646
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,760
If you're doing it out of season, you need a special permit.

647
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,360
Oh, you never do that.

648
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,240
And you can only take one.

649
00:44:59,240 --> 00:44:59,780
Yeah, but I mean...

650
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,880
You never bag the Lord in C.

651
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,660
You bag the Lord in B-flat so you get that kind of rough sound.

652
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,200
But when they're in season, it's every God for himself.

653
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,360
This is the season for the fighting Jesus.

654
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:09,460
Obviously.

655
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,320
We are between a rock and a hard place.

656
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,500
Did you know the Lord walked through Kel-D in the old age

657
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,260
and he got a very, very hard foot?

658
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,460
And he got Elphintype.

659
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,520
Passage of the rectum.

660
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,740
You know, it's not something well-known by many Christian scholars.

661
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:25,680
That can be messy, messy, messy disease.

662
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,400
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was...

663
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,240
Well, I like the story.

664
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,080
I kind of like those stories where the Lord dies

665
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,980
and then comes here to America and settles, you know, tames the West.

666
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,560
I like when he moves into a trailer park and cowboys walk with his dog.

667
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,580
Jesus fought for the Confederate army.

668
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,100
The ranger.

669
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:44,740
I like the...

670
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,700
The Texas ranger.

671
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,260
Jesus, Texas ranger.

672
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,400
Johnny River was a Jesus.

673
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:55,680
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police, for maybe the Hopi police force.

674
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,100
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus.

675
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:58,680
Man.

676
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:03,600
The white brother who came to instruct the Indians how to be liberal.

677
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,040
Well, what about old Peacemaker, the Jesus of the Iroquois,

678
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,020
who was actually Huron, a Huron.

679
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,440
You didn't know that, did you?

680
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,060
See, I got you.

681
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,400
Thin Ron.

682
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:12,940
Jesus.

683
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,040
El Ron.

684
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,180
I got a Jesus.

685
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:15,760
Get in the club.

686
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,220
No other Jesus you've ever seen.

687
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,140
Oh, it tastes...

688
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:19,900
A new Jesus.

689
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,120
A different Jesus.

690
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,640
To taste like future Jesus.

691
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,080
A clapping Jesus.

692
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:23,720
A future Jesus.

693
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,380
A pipe-smoking Jesus.

694
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,800
Hey, Dave, you know where it is.

695
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,400
Go kick that window open.

696
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,440
I already kicked it.

697
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,520
I'll kick it again, though.

698
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,020
Kick it good this time.

699
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,280
We don't mean nothing by this Jesus and God.

700
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,120
We hope that...

701
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:45,080
We thank you for all the nice things that you've done for us this Thanksgiving.

702
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:45,500
Clapping.

703
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,100
We appreciate all that.

704
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,400
And we're just trying to insult your...

705
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:49,960
We're just trying to insult your fan club.

706
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:50,600
That's all.

707
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,740
That's why we do this blasphemous stuff.

708
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:57,740
But we knew that you knew that because you're in all things and everything, right, Jesus?

709
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,200
Right.

710
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,460
I could hear him say that.

711
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,040
Praise God and Bob and Jesus.

712
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:03,980
Next topic.

713
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,180
Next topic.

714
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,400
Terrorist insurance.

715
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,440
Could you see Jesus as a terrorist?

716
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,480
And science.

717
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,180
Well, that's the life of Brian, isn't it?

718
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:12,560
That was...

719
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,720
And Greek mythology and Norse mythology.

720
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:16,960
Listen to the sounds of hell.

721
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,800
Jingle, jingle.

722
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,160
Jingle, we're on a sleigh ride to heck.

723
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:29,320
Santa and his reindeer are really wicked.

724
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,780
Wrapped in wrapping paper.

725
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,100
We're gonna break our necks.

726
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:43,780
Got a rocket in my pocket on a sleigh ride to heck.

727
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,500
Sleigh ride to heck.

728
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,460
Sleigh ride to heck.

729
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,160
Sleigh ride to heck.

730
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:55,940
Sleigh ride to heck.

731
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,240
The elves are full of cheer.

732
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,760
The kids are tucked in bed.

733
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,320
Santa ain't coming.

734
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,680
We're on a sleigh ride to heck.

735
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,220
Their dreams are filled with toys.

736
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,700
But they're out of luck.

737
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:25,340
Cause Satan's taking Santa on a sleigh ride to...

738
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:29,040
Sleigh ride to heck.

739
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,780
Sleigh ride to heck.

740
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:37,640
Sleigh ride to heck.

741
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:47,000
The greatest scary Christmas song ever, friends, from his new album, Don't Trust Whitey.

742
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,480
James Kochalka.

743
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:49,460
James Kochalka.

744
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:50,420
Superstar.

745
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,000
Superstar.

746
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:04,620
You know, see, a subgenius has so much faith that he not only can accept somebody making fun of Bob,

747
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,300
stomping on a picture of Bob, he'll do it himself.

748
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,700
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.

749
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,420
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.

750
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:18,100
Now we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,

751
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,240
but we subgeni.

752
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:29,060
I may be bad, but our way of bad is holy, is holy compared to the evil of so, not all, by any means,

753
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:34,020
but so many American fundamentalists, charismatics, evangelicals, et cetera, in general, of course,

754
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:40,860
they and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya, South Africa, et cetera,

755
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,980
if you ask me, are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve.

756
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:49,040
Sleeve, wolves in sheep's clothing, friends, just like Jesus warned about.

757
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:55,020
Jesus and Bob, like we say, our old drinking buddies, got nothing against Jesus.

758
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,940
It's just his fan club.

759
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:01,200
And now, we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve.

760
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:04,660
He's more like the smear on God's handkerchief, just like you or me.

761
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,720
But the uptight rival cults, they don't think God has a handkerchief.

762
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,860
Uh-uh, no, because God's perfect.

763
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,640
He doesn't even sneeze.

764
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:14,820
We're made.

765
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:18,600
We're made in his image, except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us,

766
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:25,240
and we have to go in the secret room, the bathroom, to do awful things.

767
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:28,740
But God, oh, he's clean and pure, according to them.

768
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,580
Oh, and he's male.

769
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:34,260
But he doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff out of him like we do,

770
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,400
because we sinned.

771
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,700
Oh, yeah, we all sinned.

772
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,440
We're bad.

773
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:38,240
We're worthless.

774
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:43,160
We're no good to God unless we sign a contract with his agent.

775
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,220
First off.

776
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:44,760
Can we interrupt this?

777
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,240
This is our program for a special promotional announcement.

778
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:47,880
Return.

779
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:52,240
He-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this mess is over.

780
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,380
All right, thank you.

781
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,680
It's ready.

782
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:56,560
Let's go.

783
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:57,860
Let's go.

784
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,320
Here we go.

785
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,040
Here we go.

786
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,660
Let's go.

787
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,220
Here we go.

788
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:21,880
In his self-sustained

789
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:44,960
In his self-sustained

790
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,760
God's hand

791
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:55,240
Just like the ones I used to know

792
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:04,920
When she stops smoking

793
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:13,280
And she'll be the same to me

794
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:20,200
I'm on a similar slope

795
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:36,660
I'm dreaming of a Caucasian God's hand

796
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,960
With every bond and heart

797
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,960
I write

798
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,620
I write

799
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:49,620


800
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,760
In amazement

801
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,700
I write

802
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,020
through sauoshi

803
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:58,040
When she laughs

804
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:03,260
When sheかえ

805
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:03,440
In amazement

806
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:03,680
When she

807
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,000
Oh, doctor

808
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,240
Hey you

809
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:09,980
Let's stay

810
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,960
Let's stay

811
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,740
Bye.

812
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,220
Fernanda Nande-Lemore.

813
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:10,780
Fernanda Nande-Lemore.

814
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:15,100
Oh, no.

815
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,340
Divine.

816
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:27,880
Have yourselves a groovy little solstice.

817
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,480
Mithras won his fight.

818
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,320
Ho, ho, ho.

819
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,880
Ho, ho, ho.

820
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,400
Come on, come on.

821
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,520
It's He-Man.

822
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,780
Hey, kids, you can help him.

823
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:44,920
So, Tina's right.

824
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,940
Overthrow the evil normals with new Bob Dobbs action figure with Rockin' Pie.

825
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,340
What I wouldn't do from Bob Dobbs.

826
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,580
Get new more chocolatey pebbles from you.

827
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:52,980
No, no.

828
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,420
I'm a chocolate space cadet.

829
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,700
Life support system down to zero cocoa.

830
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:58,820
Feeling space.

831
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,340
We need to have some of my new cocoa pebbles.

832
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:03,160
Now so chocolatey.

833
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,980
Mmm, smells coconut.

834
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,660
Space cocoa liquid.

835
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:10,460
Blow.

836
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:12,340
Blow.

837
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:12,600
Blow, friends.

838
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:13,860
What do you, what do you,

839
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,240
what do you think?

840
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:19,260
Is, is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here?

841
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:26,980
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob, as he's been referred to in

842
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,300
some early pre-scriptures?

843
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:29,340
It's so separate.

844
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,400
It's so separate.

845
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:04,340
The Jethro's.

846
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,940
Friends, you need to know where to write to the Jethro's.

847
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:11,460
They're at, um, no, they did that wreck the halls and so many other versions.

848
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,400
We've been playing.

849
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,940
The Jethro's are at, um, the Jethro's is at the Jethro's.

850
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:13,940


851
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:19,820
at 212 and a half Miller Avenue.

852
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,100
That's 212 and a half Miller Avenue,

853
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,920
Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

854
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:32,480
Portsmouth NH 03801.

855
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,980
Santa Claus is Coming to Town

856
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:37,380
was by Corporal Blossom.

857
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,600
Information on that mutant Christmas

858
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:46,420

861
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,360
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang.

862
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,500
Friends, you can reach me, send me tapes or whatnot

863
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,960
at Post Office Box 181417

864

Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

865
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,400
And friends, as always,

866
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,580
the Hour of Slack is brought to you

867
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,660
by the Church of the Subgenius.

www.subgenius.com

869
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,720
It's all Christmassy right now.

870
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,740
There's a bright green bob in the window

871
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,640
and Christmassy lights.

872
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Is DJA out there?

873
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:31,820
And devilish artwork that's Christmassy.

874
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,900
No, that's something just left for DJA.

875
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:34,940
It's all Christmassy.

876
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:41,360
It's all wrapped up in perfumed ribbon-wrapped presents.

877
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:42,880
Under the tree.

878
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:43,620
Smell that cinnamon.

879
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,560
Open the door all the way so we can see if he comes in.

880
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,440
And those sugar plums.

881
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,780
Something's up the chimney hole in sight, isn't it?

882
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,480
Yeah.

883
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:52,880
Or Santa, I mean.

884
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,380
Otherwise, gosh.

885
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:58,420
I guess we have to wait till Santa comes, Dave.

886
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,040
Oh, beloved Santa.

887
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,960
I have wanted to...

888
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,460
Put your bag down for a minute.

889
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,760
This side is always so ready to, like...

890
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,660
Santa.

891
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:08,500
For so long.

892
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,220
Hi, Bob and Mary.

893
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,040
Merry Christmas!

894
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:38,500
Merry Christmas!

895
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:45,760
Merry Christmas!

896
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:45,760


897
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,340
Lone cow Dave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

898
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,700
Chocolate on my good day.

899
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,580
Merry Christmas!

900
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,520
Merry Christmas!

901
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,560
Merry Christmas!

902
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:57,780


903
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,060
Merry Christmas!

904
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:04,900
It was the night before Christmas and all through the house

905
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:08,080
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse

906
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,300
The stockings were hung by the tree

907
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,000
Merry Christmas!

908
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:11,480
Merry Christmas!

909
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:11,580


910
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:15,420
Merry F**king Christmas!

911
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:19,160
Merry F**king Christmas!

912
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:27,220
T Commission, my dear, I offer you aria!

913
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:36,160
I have some confetti!

914
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,500
Maybe they're coming as我說

915
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,580
Merry F**king Christmas!

916
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:41,580


917
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:41,580

00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,880
Merry Christmas!

919
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,820
Merry Christmas!

920
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,680
Merry Christmas!

921
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,480
Merry Christmas!

922
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,120
Thank you.

923
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,480
Thank you.

924
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:16,480
Don't despair just because it's Christmas

925
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:24,700
Children there are so gay at Christmas

926
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:31,760
All the children on the street

927
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,580
Hope they get something good to eat

928
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:39,700
But for me it's not so great

929
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,640
Fuck Christmas
