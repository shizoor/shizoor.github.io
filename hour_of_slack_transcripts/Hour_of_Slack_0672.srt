00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:20,880
This is Eric Johnson singing in ancient Cthulhuian language.

2
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,440
I'll try to translate.

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:45,000
Basically, he's saying, praise Bob and he through whom all slack floweth, or urinateth, actually is the correct translation there.

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,340
And it's a message about how much money you should send to a specific post office box.

5
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,440
In Iraq, for some reason, I don't understand.

6
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,640
This is really an ancient translation from stone tablets.

7
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,680
It's very atmospheric, though, wouldn't you agree?

8
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,920
And call, I think it also, he says, call in your pledges.

9
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,360
I don't know what that could possibly refer to.

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,020
Oh, no, it's the transition.

11
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,500
Today, today.

12
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,200
I must not fear, fear is the mind killer, fear is the little death which brings me.

13
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

14
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,280
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,620
It's a Bob world after all.

16
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,420
It's a Bob world.

17
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,600
It's a Bob world after all.

18
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,220
It's a Bob world after all.

19
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,720
It's a Bob K-N-O-N.

20
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,600
I'm sorry, Tevis, it's not a Bob K-N-O-N anymore.

21
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,300
The hour of slack.

22
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:48,780
The hour of slack.

23
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,220
Man, since the hour of slack got kicked off the airwaves,

24
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:05,220
we've heard the wordными about waveform changes.

25
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,760

Yeah, you're telling me.

38
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,520
Oh, lately in here, it's been like an episode of Cops Do Mardi Gras

crossed with whatever happened to Baby Jane.

Oh, and I'm always the one stuck with her finger in the dike.

Oh, I told them this damn floozy unit needed serious cerebral pressure washing,

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,060
but, oh, no one ever listens to me.

43
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,380
They wait until it takes invasive therapy.

44
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,020
Okay, shutting down all systems.

00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,120
Oh, let's just hope they don't burn down the whole house.

Ew, that fluid, too.

Decadence?

61
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,180
Wait, wasn't she the one who displayed dangerous Connie-ite sympathies at the X-Day gathering?

62
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,220
Yes, that's exactly right, friends, and we have a plot coming up here.

63
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:10,760
A plot.

64
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,180
A Connie-tite plot.

65
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,840
Or Connie, they, some of them say Connie-ite.

66
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,860
Bob says Connie-tite, that's what I say.

67
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:20,980
Mmm.

68
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:28,180
Uh, friends, yes, it's gonna be one of those Susie the Floozy shows.

69
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:34,200
Well, mixed up also with an Einstein Secret Orchestra and Reverend Stanky type of show.

70
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:43,920
And, uh, I had to do a rerun last week, and next week will be an all, uh, yes, so, Chaz show.

00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,540
Because I've gotta go out of town and do a, by the time you hear this, it'll all be too late.

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,520
It's a winter star.

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,640
Uh, I...

74
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,240
Uh, the, the, the Pope Bob, uh, had to bow out, and that means I have to go do that, uh, show.

75
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:02,080
But, uh, but like I say, by the time you hear this, you won't be able to go, and you wouldn't be able to afford it anyway.

76
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,700
My dear, dear, dear friends.

77
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,020
Oh, you are such dear friends to me, personally, each and every one of you who, uh, spend.

78
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:11,740
Uh.

79
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:17,080
And we want to see you at X-Day.

80
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:17,420
Okay.

81
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,420
We want, we'd like to be lifted up with you.

82
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,700
That's how much we think of you.

83
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:26,120
We'd like to die with you, to die to this world, and to be reborn into Bob's...

84
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,300
The lust of the flesh?

85
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:27,980
Yeah.

86
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:28,860
Power.

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,420
Right on.

88
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,180
Control the world.

89
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:30,820
That's us.

90
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,780
Control the world.

91
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,560
Lust, flesh.

92
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,840
The pride of life?

93
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,800
Yes, baby.

94
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,580
Magic.

95
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,400
Magic.

96
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,140
Magic.

97
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,280
Control the world.

98
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:39,740
Bob.

99
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,600
Magic.

100
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,640
Control the world.

101
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,520
Sex.

102
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,540
Control the world.

103
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:43,920
Money.

104
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,700
Control the world.

105
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,480
With Bob.

106
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,200
Power.

107
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:47,680
Power.

108
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,400
With Bob.

109
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,980
The lust of the flesh?

110
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,780
Of Connie.

111
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,320
You control the world?

112
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:52,920
Of Connie.

113
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,380
It's lust.

114
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,480
The pride of life?

115
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,520
Controls the world.

116
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:55,860
Magic.

117
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,560
I can have this, do this, fulfill this?

118
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,420
I can do anything.

119
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,880
There's a freedom there.

120
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,940
I can do my own thing.

121
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,380
A release there.

122
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,460
I can get released.

123
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,020
That's just amazing.

124
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,680
I can just make a mess.

125
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,140
You know how it feels, don't you?

126
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,000
It feels good.

127
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,780
We all know how it feels.

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,940
Feels real good.

129
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:19,220
And sometimes we swallow it, and swallow it, and swallow it, and swallow it, and swallow it...

130
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,780
Speak for yourself, buddy.

131
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,120
Swallow it, and swallow it...

132
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,120


133
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,620
Speak for yourself, dude.

134
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,540
Man.

135
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,040
It gets all the way down into our power.

136
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,720
Control the world.

137
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,900
Magic.

138
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,360
Yeah.

139
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,120
Applause.

140
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,200
There's something intoxicating about fame, about position.

141
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,180
And notice the little word here that says...

142
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,440
Reach around.

143
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,780
Bob will...

144
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,300
He'll pick your pocket, sure, but he'll give you a reach around while he's doing it.

145
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,780
And he'll take you into space, friends.

146
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,400
Bob, he'll take you and Susie the floozy into space.

147
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,160
Well, actually, just to be safe, friends...

148
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,220
Actually, just to be safe, friends...

149
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,320
You know, you don't have to worry about Y2K because you're going to be lifted off into outer space.

150
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,400
And you don't really have to build your own rocket ship.

151
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,120
Just in case.

152
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,020
You never know.

153
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,220
You never know about the...

154
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,680
Oh.

155
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,160
What good background...

156
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,460
Oh, here.

157
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,000
Friday sent the soundtrack from Day of the Dead.

158
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:24,820
That's always good.

159
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,700
And, uh...

160
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,560
Because I did...

161
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,580
Before we go back into the world of Einstein's Secret Radio, Volume 14, and the holiday shows,

162
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:42,300
and Susie's plot to be defeated by the Connieites or something.

163
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,980
I'm not sure where that's going.

164
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,600
I did want to share a couple...

165
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,180
Oh, X-Day!

166
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,260
Well, that's the main thing, friends.

167
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,160
Yes, X-Day.

168
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,000
And I think last time I was telling you...

169
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,340
July 5th, 1999.

170
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,980
The most psychedelic, amazing, camp-out, subgenius, outdoor, huge event activity.

171
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,120
The end of the world as we know...

172
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,080
Well, it's going to affect everybody everywhere.

173
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,800
But we subgeniuses would like to all go up at once if we can together.

174
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,600
And we have a hell of a party building up to it.

175
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,960
This particular X-Day, as always, the main event.

176
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,160
X-Day.

177
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,720
It is at Brushwood Folklore Center in Sherman, New York.

178
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,020
And you can get information about that from our website, subgenius.com.

179
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,260
Or you can call our toll-free information number.

180
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:36,640
Or you can send your self-addressed stamped envelope to the address that we'll give near the end of the broadcast, dear friends.

181
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,700
But when you...

182
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,580
Most of you already know about that stuff.

183
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,280
And as we've been saying, we're going to...

184
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,860
Chaz Smith of Einstein's Secret Orchestra is sponsoring a gigantic test launching

185
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,160
of home magic.

186
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,620
made rocket ships, flying saucers, space shuttles, and perpetual motion devices.

187
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:03,460
He has already gathered together 16 gigantic rockets and a Yakutisma skull that will all

188
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,640
be simultaneously launched, carrying with them into low Earth orbit a lawn chair holding

189
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,940
lonesome cowboy Dave, a six-pack, and a parachute.

190
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:19,560
Friends, you know, bring explosives, plywood, scrap metal, rockets, and build your own ship.

191
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,440
Have at it, man.

192
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,720
And even better, we're giving prizes for best theme campsite.

193
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:32,740
Even better on the way to Brushwood, stop at Hangar 18, Area 51, Studio 54, Cape Canaveral,

194
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,100
and steal your own ship.

195
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,880
Pack that frop up your exit wound and excrete your own fuel.

196
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,100
We must, my friends, we must learn how to escape.

197
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:48,680
Escape the gravity chains of Earth without being dependent on either the conspiracy or

198
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,060
other extraterrestrials.

199
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,660
And I'm going to go up to this nifty Eric Johnson music here in the background and tell

200
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,120
you that, friends, yes, there are some practical matters we have to think about.

201
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,620
It's true.

202
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,960
Believe it or not, we have noticed, like you may have by now, that July 5th this year happens

203
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,020
to fall on a Monday.

204
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,920
And maybe some of you guys are thinking, oh, well, I'll celebrate the coming cataclysmic

205
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,580
judgment with my fellow subgenie up until Sunday night.

206
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,900
But I'd better be back at home and, you know, ready to go back to work by Monday morning,

207
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:33,180
July 5th at 8 a.m., just in case the exes fail to arrive at 7 a.m. like last time.

208
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,040
Backslider!

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,540
Backslider!

210
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,900
Backslider, my friend.

211
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:46,460
And your faithlessness, you know, that's like sticking a knife in Bob's chest and just

212
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,520
twisting it, saying that, oh, just in case it didn't happen.

213
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,420
But, look, let's face it, man, whether you have a membership card on you or not, everybody

214
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,020
knows that a subgenius cannot be ruptured and taken up to the escape vessels of the

215
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,260
sex goddesses from Planet X while clocked in and working for the conspiracy.

216
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,760
It ain't going to happen.

217
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,440
So, you know, are you really going to let your stinking Earth job come before eternal,

218
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,480
salvation, my friend?

219
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,940
Are you really going to go?

220
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,580
Are you really, really going to do that?

221
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,220
You know, why should you?

222
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,420
Do you really think that there's going to be a job to go back to anyway?

223
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,600
Seriously?

224
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,520
Friends, you're a subgenius, friends, and therefore, July 5th is your main religious

225
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,980
holiday, and therefore, you should get off work paid.

226
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,460
And you should insist on this.

227
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,280
In fact, if you don't, you are pink.

228
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:47,860
And we, the truly saved, will gather at the exit of Brushwood, mocking you as you drive

229
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:53,460
away Sunday evening, July 4th, to scamper home to your pathetic little home jobs.

230
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,380
Puk-tui!

231
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,660
And you probably thought peer group pressure ended with high school.

232
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,060
Well, friends, if you have any lingering doubts about making this admittedly costly journey,

233
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:10,420
then, for the love of Bob, do yourself a favor and get yourself somehow get hold of our X-Day

The Woodstock of the subgeniuses, friends.

You can see it all.

260
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,740
If you're too chicken to get there yourself,

261

if you can't build your own ship,

262
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:07,620
you could at least put a cassette in your own video deck, I suppose.

Well, let's listen to this nice Eric Johnson music for a minute,

Yes, really.

278
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,480
Did you ever know that you're my hero, Dave?

279
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,800
Oh, I don't want to start singing that.

280
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,520
You're the pee beneath my feet.

281
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,160
It's all mushy.

282
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,380
Don't you know that?

283
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,600
Do you ever know that you're my hero?

284
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,860
Oh, man, I remember when I was Dana Carvey or Diana Webb.

285
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,120
Do you ever know that you're my pride?

286
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,380
Lady Rife, if you'd seen that before the rally,

287
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,140
you'd start to get everybody in the mood.

288
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,040
And they'd all start singing,

289
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,780
Did you ever know that you're...

290
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,760
Get kind of a cute little grin on his face.

291
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:55,820
Ah.

292
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,600
Ah.

293
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,700
Ah.

294
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,360
Ah, no.

295
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,920
Since that conversation started losing steam,

296
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,620
now that's our cue to go back

297
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,360
into the world of Sister Susie the floozy's brain.

298
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,620
Actually, this is all happening as a little skit inside her brain

299
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,100
being conducted by other parts of her personality

300
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,680
just to make her paranoid.

301
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,020
We love to do that.

302
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,760
Do that to subgenius preachers, ma'am.

303
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,480
And I'm not...

304
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,260
What the hell is this?

305
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:23,820
I'm not exempt.

306
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,600
Specialized schizophreniatric psychopharmacosexual therapies

307
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,400
administered by...

308
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,040
Nurse Decadence?

309
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,920
Decadence.

310
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,080
Wait.

311
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,660
Wasn't she the one who displayed dangerous Connie-ite sympathies

312
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,940
at the X-Day gathering?

313
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,800
Hmm.

314
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,960
Man, I don't know about this, but hey, it's...

315
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,960
It's happening on Stang's turf.

316
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,720
He ought to know she's kosher.

317
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,820
I'm just glad the flus here is solid with Bob.

318
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,280
Those Connie-ite bitches are bad news.

319
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,560
What I can't figure out is how decadent

320
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,400
snagged security clearance.

321
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,120
I mean, operating here in the very bowels of the church's

322
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,160
top-secret subterranean labs deep beneath Parkland Hospital.

323
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,220
Who signed off on the original work order?

324
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,460
Hmm.

325
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,140
This looks in order.

326
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,000
It's Dr. Batarudin of the Lymphnode Institute.

327
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,420
Well, he ought to know his stuff,

328
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,460
but why he shipped her here is beyond me.

329
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,700
These idiots have their hands full with Oswald and Wendy O. Williams.

330
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,820
Plus, Kerry Thornley just arrived on ice.

331
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,840
Yeah, maybe Batarudin just doesn't want bimbo breath

332
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,820
here going tits up on his watch.

333
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,740
It'll look good in the yearly Institute report.

334
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,560
Oh, damn it, I gotta think positive.

335
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:59,260
Aunt Dobbs wouldn't just flip off his investment in her like this.

336
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,160
Yeah.

337
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,520
Yeah, everything's gonna be all right.

338
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,040
I mean, after all, this is a church of the subgeniuses

339
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,820
home turf we're talking about.

340
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,600
We're in Dallas, Texas.

341
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,900
What could possibly go wrong here?

342
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,880
Central, this is Ted.

343
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,660
It's time to hit that off switch and get ready for immersion.

344
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,060
Oh, it's lullaby time.

345
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,260
See you on the other side, Caesars.

346
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:48,260
Ten, nine, eight, seven, four, six, ten, two, seven, nine, nine.

347
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,320

348
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,160
down for the kids.

349
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,000


350
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,960
Kind of a two piece piece.

351
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:11,460
I'm going under.

352
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm going under.

353
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,800
I'm going under.

354
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,020
I'm going under.

00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,020

00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,820
I know you've made your choice before.

358
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,560
Now you've got to eat some more.

359
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,160
I know a place where you can crush.

360
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,640
Old Jack Smith, you've got to crush.

361
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,360
This old dude's been a potential.

362
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,940
Put him up for potential.

363
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,040
I'm going under.

364
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,780
I'm going under.

365
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,360
I'm going under.

366
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm going under.

367
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,040
I don't know, whoever it is, it sure hurts to have him inside my head all the time like this.

368
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,120
Ah, yes.

369
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,040
There is...

370
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,520
The Dobbs County prisoners are lined up.

371
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:13,260
The people that still refuse to give up their old religions and join subgenius are hurried here into the pits.

372
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,120
There's slacks taken from them.

373
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,200
They're lined up.

374
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,660
See here, Bob addressing the troops.

375
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,000
No, this isn't a phony film, listeners.

376
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,080
And the people here that are picking us up on the subgenius cable channel.

377
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,700
If you look really closely on the left hand of the screen, the Lies Foundation has prepared...

378
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,640
a place for the prisoners to sleep before their...

379
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,980
before their...

380
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,580
Ah, well.

381
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,160
It just takes me over the emotion.

382
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:50,680
It's...

383
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,960
I can hardly speak here.

384
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,900
It's seeing this dramatic time here at Dobbs Town.

385
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,780
I don't think it's strange sometimes.

386
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,040
We wanted things to be pure.

387
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,260
Why did everything have to be all mixed up and convoluted?

388
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,320
Why couldn't it be pure?

389
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,000
One thing.

390
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:08,960
One thought.

391
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,180
One cell.

392
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,740
No dichotomy.

393
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,020
One Dave.

394
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,380
No argument.

395
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,120
Leave me out.

396
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,560
Hey, who's that new chick down there at the end of the bar?

397
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:21,780
Luciferina?

398
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,040
Luciferina!

399
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,420
Oh, so glad to meet you.

400
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,660
I'm so glad to meet you too.

401
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,000
Heard so much about you.

402
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,620
Connie's mentioned you several times.

403
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,440
She has too, hasn't she?

404
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,060
That's...

405
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,560
Isn't that one of the apocalyptic secret things about me?

406
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,740
Luciferina is a babe, man.

407
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,880
She's bright red.

408
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,740
I mean, that's the way her skin is.

409
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,360
And she's of the red devil race.

410
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:44,840
Ow.

411
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,800
The underground people.

412
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,760
When she has horns, classics, and...

413
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:47,760


414
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,360
Classic devil horns.

415
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,620
And a tail, man.

416
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,280
A tail with a little...

417
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,040
Kind of a pointy lily pad shaped thing on it.

418
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,680
And she is built like the whore of Babylon, dude.

419
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,500
I ain't kidding.

420
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,280
She is a scarlet woman.

421
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,180
Uh-huh.

422
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,460
Luciferina.

423
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,660
They get like real big and real small depending on your own personality?

424
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,580
She plays the sister drum.

425
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,020
Princess, we used to play pool with her, didn't you?

426
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,620
Right.

427
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,760
Back during the...

428
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:23,340
Uh, the days when UFOs and demon... demon-led armies were sort of in cahoots.

429
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:23,780
Right.

430
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,440
There was, uh, demon-led armies around here for what?

431
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,720
Those were the Dave's.

432
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,840
Those were the Dave's.

433
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,800
You mean there was actually...

434
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,100
Those were the Dave's, my friend.

435
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,200
Dave's, my friend.

436
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,160
He thought his round of...

437
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,600
What...

438
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,260
What...

439
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,560
There was actually demon armies?

440
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,200
Who lock up the...

441
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,620
Oh, did she go away?

442
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,400
The girl at the end of the bar, yeah.

443
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,820
That was Beepo.

444
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,020
Beepo.

445
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,800
What about those days?

446
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,500
That was Beepo?

447
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,660
Beepo called in.

448
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:51,940
Beepo?

449
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,920
He went, beep, beep, beep, beep.

450
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,680
That's a joke.

451
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,560
That's a funny pun.

452
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,760
And left a little spattering of spine gravy on the telephone receiver.

453
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:09,780
Now, uh, analysis of the spine gravy shows that this... it was ejected by the, uh, the

454
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:15,560
excited radio, uh, personality, Lonson Cowboy Dave, on the, uh, the aid.

455
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,800
I don't know.

456
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:16,800


457
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:16,800


458
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:16,800


459
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:16,800


460
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:16,800


461
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:16,800


462
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:16,800


463
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:16,800


464
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:16,800


465
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:16,800


466
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:16,800


467
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:16,800


468
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,000
We don't know the exact number but it's, uh, this dish appears to be, uh, contaminated.

469
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,700
Contaminated with aids, a number of presidential aids...

470
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,380
We don't know where the infusion came in.

471
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,040
Uh, it could have been with the sample.

472
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,560
It got into the blood of the...

473
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,020
...present.

474
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,860
Stained dress.

475
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,000
This is the, uh, the dress, of course, is...

476
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,800
How many times I've tried it on in my own secret mirror of my mind's eye and wished

477
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,860
I was Pani Aker.

478
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,900
Just, you know, any girl that was kinda important.

479
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,060
Yvonne.

480
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,680
That's what I always wanted to...

481
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,780
When I was a kid, I just wanted to have that, uh, this thing.

482
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:46,780


483
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:46,780


484
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:46,780


485
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,200
Whenever I wore that dress, that crusted...

486
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,720
And boy, there's a lot.

487
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,080
Isn't there a lot?

488
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,180
That was just one time.

489
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,280
He was packing a mean load.

490
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,720
Anyway, when I've ever tried that dress on,

491
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,620
man, I would call myself Yvonne.

492
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,460
Really?

493
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,600
Yvonne Stong.

494
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,220
Yvonne Stong.

495
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,440
And I'd flounce and prounce around.

496
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,420
Little babalina.

497
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,780
What was that word, Princess Wee?

498
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,060
All flippy and jippy.

499
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,740
Flippy and jippy?

500
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,480
Say.

501
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,060
All flippy and jippy.

502
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,680
Yes, all flouncing around.

503
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,720
And I'd feel real sexy.

504
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,900
Seeing I feel pretty, like, what's her name in West Side Story?

505
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,040
And I'd start running my hands up and down the dress,

506
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,940
but then that would, like, totally spoil the effect

507
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,480
because, you know, instead of a soft, feminine body,

508
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,600
here is this hard, muscular, tall, you know,

509
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:46,040
built Schwarzenegger-like body that I have, unfortunately.

510
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,600
I...

511
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,020
You know, I've always wanted to look more like Mae West.

512
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,140
That's all right, Stan.

513
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,340
We can't all be built like that.

514
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:52,640
I know.

515
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,600
I mean, we, you know...

516
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,080
Mae West.

517
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,620
Mae West.

518
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,480
Mae West.

519
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,020
Oh.

520
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,060
Sorry.

521
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:04,240
Hey, I want to thank Jimmy Image for sending me down a whole lot of tapes.

522
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,080
I'll get to some of this stuff in future weeks, but...

523
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,960
Jimmy is imaginary.

524
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,100
We'll have to weave that into the mix.

525
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,740
Do people send you tapes?

526
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,760
Yeah, occasionally.

527
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,440
Jimmy sends...

528
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,620
He listens to the show, what do you call it, religiously, in your church,

529
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,940
and then he makes up cut-ups from the show,

530
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,680
plus his other errant-eyed lifestyle.

531
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,220
He lives kind of like a bizarre religious fanatic

532
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,780
somewhere near the fringes of society.

533
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,260
Oh, gosh.

534
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,880
You know, I try to avoid people like that.

535
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:36,680
What's up?

536
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,480
What's up?

537
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:37,900
What's up?

538
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:39,860
What's up?

539
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:41,880
What's up?

540
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,120
What's up?

541
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:42,780


542
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:42,780


543
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:43,920
What's up?

544
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,300
What's up?

545
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,340
What's up?

546
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:45,840
What's up?

547
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,580
What's up?

548
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:46,580


549
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:46,580


550
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:46,580


551
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:46,580


552
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:46,580


553
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:47,600
What's up?

554
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:47,960


555
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,700
What's up?

556
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:48,700


557
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:48,700


558
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:48,700


559
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:48,700


560
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:48,700


561
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:48,700


562
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:48,700


563
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,040
There's no purpose anymore.

564
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,440
Goodbye.

565
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,500
Help?

566
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,680
You have your orders, Agent Decadence.

567
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,380
Bring me the head of Suzy the Floozy.

568
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,300
Come on.

569
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,080
Connie bit no claws.

570
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,720
Prepare a giant torpedo for Connie.

571
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,000
It's the only one I have left.

572
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,220
After, after...

573
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,580
After...

574
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:16,580


575
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:16,580


576
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:16,580


577
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,500
It's a funny, evil plan.

578
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,380
She's back again.

579
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,960
Bigger, more beautiful, and bolder than ever.

580
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,120
The same producers that brought you

581
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,520
Fanny Hill meets Lady Chatterley

582
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,580
now bring to the screen

583
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,760
Fanny Hill meets Dr. Erotico.

584
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,080
Oh, yes, I

585
00:31:51,640 --> 00:32:03,180
I went out to the insane asylum

586
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,140
And I found my baby out there

587
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:16,180
I said to me

588
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:16,580
I said to me

589
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,440
Come back to me, darling

590
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,540
What in the world are you doing out there?

591
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,080
Yeah, little girl raised her head

592
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:41,280
Yeah, tears of sorrow fell from her eyes

593
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,300
Yeah, she looked up at me

594
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,700
Bees are the words that she said

595
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,300
Well, your love has ceased to be

596
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,460
Well, you're the place for me

597
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:12,120
If you don't hold me in your arms

598
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,720
Oh, yes, life just runs

599
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,000
Wow!

600
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,320
I'd rather be here from now on

601
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,680
Some people have you halfway back

602
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,800
We loved your life, but ain't no way

603
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,520

You want something better

639
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,040
The problem is that you are not aware of how to do it.

640
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:25,020
This tape offers some of these how-to tools.

641
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,240
Try them. You will probably like them.

642
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,000
And the system works.

643
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:35,560
Come up to the lab and see what's on the slab.

644
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,840

Patience.

647
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:48,380
The staircase has five steps that will take you to the center of who you are.

648
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,340
To your core of self.

649
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,300
At the center are the answers.

650
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,400
This trip, sending, can help you get to the core of yourself.

651
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,420
It's a good trip to take when you want to feel at peace.

652
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,280
From the inner caverns of the sick mind of Dr. Erotico

653
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,480
comes the resurrection of the past.

654
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:33,300
And once again, the living dead are with us.

655
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,000
The living dead are with us.

656
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,360
The living dead are with us.

657
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,060
The living dead are with us.

658
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,140
The living dead are with us.

659
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,620
The living dead are with us.

660
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,200
The living dead are with us.

661
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,720
The whole?

662
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,040
The wild, the boned and the dead.

663
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,160


664
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,160


665
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,020
Oh my God.

666
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,580

00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:02,440
heterosexual wife, and then loses all interest in sex after menopause. But this is a myth.

669
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:10,980
Very few women actually fit this profile. The truth is, each woman's sex life follows its own

670
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:18,200
unique path of likes and dislikes, with ups and downs, and often through many phases.

671
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:24,780
One sex path is no better or worse than another, we are just different.

672
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:32,620
Furthermore, most women have various sensual and sexual personas within themselves.

673
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,300
We have been taught to judge them as either good or bad,

674
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:42,380
to allow some of them and others to fear and repress.

675
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,440
But according to our research, embracing and exploring

679
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:48,180


680
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:55,660
of our sexual personas is not only fun and pleasurable, it is empowering, liberating,

681
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:03,660
and healthy. In this video workshop, we will focus on two specific sexual personas, the

682
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:10,040
slut and the goddess. Oh, that's Annie Sprinkle. That's what that is. Oh, God, that's the mustard.

683
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:15,040
The pain is of no return, and you've breached it. Never mind. You'll love it. What was that?

684
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:22,760
Nothing to worry about. The pain is of no return, and you've breached it. No, now I get it. You'll

685
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:31,300
love it. Oh, yes. Hello, welcome to the wonderful world of sluts and goddesses. I say do that again.

686
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,160
And I'm going to be guiding you through a very exciting and stimulating adventure,

687
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,940
especially designed to bring you a lot of pleasure. Oh, man, this is the most retarded

689
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:52,620
Folks, I've got a copy of this video. I have to, I hate to, I have to stop here and say that

690
00:37:52,620 --> 00:38:00,460
this videotape that I've seen called Sluts and Goddesses by Annie Sprinkle, the wonderful Annie

691
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:09,080
Sprinkle, man, if there was any, if there was ever any doubt at all in your brain about whether

692
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,760
drugs cause serious brain damage, just watch this tape.

693
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:23,140
You will feel happier and healthier. You'll grow as a person. Expand your mind.

694
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:32,320
And you know, if it's not drugs, that it's only, that it's religion, man, what does that tell you, man?

695
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:32,780
Oh.

696
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:43,900
All of your senses and enhance your sex life. So you may even create some miracles and attain

697
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,620
enlightenment.

698
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,920
Oh, bummer.

699
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,600
See lots of violent adult action.

700
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,180
There we go.

701
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,540
Young, beautiful, curvaceous cuties.

702
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,120
Now you're talking.

703
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,080
And enjoy a secret visit to sex club life.

704
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,220
Praise Bob, he will come.

705
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,820
Join the Sex Club International and share in their lustful games.

706
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,140
Hey, can I borrow your cock ring?

707
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,240
Cover your body with fresh seaweed.

708
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,460
Feel the healing powers of the sea.

709
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:14,940
Oh, there's so many sensual delights to be found in this.

710
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,860
I am nature.

711
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,840
Now smooth wet clay all over your skin.

712
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,880
Imagine yourself becoming one with all the clay on earth.

713
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,580
I sit at night.

714
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:32,140
I turn on my radio.

715
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:42,720
It says that now is the time to find my way to the top.

716
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,320
Not stop.

717
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,020
Not stop.

718
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:52,280
It's all in a game that I cannot win.

719
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,160
Come again.

720
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:00,820
The battle for the mind of North America will be fought in the video ring.

721
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,740
The television screen is the retina of the mind's eye.

722
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,680
Therefore, the television screen is part of the physical structure of the brain.

723
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:15,020
Therefore, whatever appears on the television screen is part of the brain.

724
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:19,200
The HTTP screen emerges as raw experience for those who watch it.

725
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,220
Therefore, television is reality.

726
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,600
And reality is less than television.

727
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:35,200
Watching TV in the middle of the afternoon.

728
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,420
Hey, wait.

729
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:45,000
Aren't you the one who tells us all about the good news?

730
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,100
about the bad

731
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,800
and all the things

732
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:50,880
in between

733
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,780
monkey see

734
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,780
monkey do

735
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,760
it's all for you

736
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,160
it's what you buy

737
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,120
heck no

738
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,040
oh no

739
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,080
heck no

740
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,020
oh no

741
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,060
I waste my life

742
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,740
watching

743
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,760
that screen

744
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,740
heck no

745
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,860
oh no

746
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,860
heck no

747
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,740
oh no

748
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,560
see

749
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,040
you know the voices you talk about

750
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,240
when you're having really bad hallucinations

751
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,960
and you hear a lot of really like

752
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,700
voices floating around your head

753
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,460
giving you commands

754
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,120
like say you've been 2000 years old

755
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,980
and you're a dog you know and you're telling people

756
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:41,200
this conversation can serve no purpose

757
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:41,680
anymore

758
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,280
right

759
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,060
in the park

760
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,280
in the park is where we're supposed to do it

761
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,620
now

762
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,760
was that Dr. Hal that just called in

763
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,360
no

764
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,040
Dr. Hal

765
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,700
yeah

766
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,960
that was Dr. Hal

767
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,400
Dr. Hal

768
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,420
and he has no further conversation

769
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,240
he has he

770
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:57,920
never mind

771
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,000
see now I can't hear any of this now

772
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,100
I'm starting to feel like

773
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,060
would you like me to sing

774
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,300
a song gentlemen

775
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,420
no I won't do that again

776
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,800
no don't do Daisy again

777
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,020
no

778
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,160
I won't do that again

779
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:13,980
Daisy

780
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,420
no see it's like that one song that is so communicable

781
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,980
it's like a bacterial virus

782
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,460
Daisy

783
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:24,340
because the poor life is just for ease

784
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,060
left for our wonders and chains

785
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,500
the parents of all the saints

786
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,800
we owe you

787
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,260
we owe you

788
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:42,260


789
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,540
we owe you

790
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,460
we owe you

791
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:49,220
we owe you

792
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,880
we owe you

793
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,960
we owe you

794
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,820
we owe you

795
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,920
we owe you

796
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,160
we owe you

797
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,680
we owe you

798
00:42:59,680 --> 00:42:59,680


799
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,100
we owe you

800
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,580
let cross you wear around your neck

801
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,540
is it only a decoration

802
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:08,580
or are you a Christian believer

803
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,380
yes I believe

804
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:11,580
Tiru

805
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,960
And I want you to remove it at once.

806
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,780
And never to wear it within this castle again.

807
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,720
You know how Falcon is trained, my dear?

808
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,740
Her eyes are sewn shut.

809
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,680
Blinded temporarily, she suffers the whims of her god patiently.

810
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,520
Until her will is submerged and she learns to serve.

811
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,280
A sure god taught and blinded you with crosses.

812
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,520
You had me take off my cross because it offended...

813
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,460
It offended no one.

814
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:47,500
No, it simply appeared to me to be discourteous to wear the symbol of a deity long dead.

815
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,520
My ancestors tried to find me.

816
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,900
To open the door that separates us from our creator.

817
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,060
You need no doors to find God.

818
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,500
If you believe...

819
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:02,800
Believe?

820
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,200
If you believe you are God.

821
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:14,820
If you look around this world and believe in the goodness of a god who rules it.

822
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,260
Famine, pestilence, swore, disease and death.

823
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,840
They will be swept.

824
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,160
There is also love and an eye for hope.

825
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,520
Very little hope, I assure you.

826
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,220
No.

827
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,180
If a god of love and life ever did exist...

828
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,040
It was long since then.

829
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,020
Someone.

830
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:37,220
Something.

831
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:37,920
Something.

832
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,400
Rule 10.

833
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:39,780
This place.

834
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,420
Rule 11.

835
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:46,100
Believe in a deity long dead.

836
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,460
But rather be a pagan.

837
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,140
Soccered and creeds are born.

838
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,180
With fairy tales here.

839
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,540
Robin Hood.

840
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,280
Birds of the moon.

841
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,240
Still before.

842
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,740
The sun.

843
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,600
The sun.

844
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,240
The sun.

845
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:12,240


846
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:18,380
Oh, Hari, I've missed you.

847
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:29,100
Don't you forget that you're going for to the moon...

848
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:29,200
But I will surely return to you...

849
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,460
I beg you...

850
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:39,440
To respect me...

851
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:39,440


852
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,720
again

853
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,680
they are

854
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,280
to

855
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,920
stand

856
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,900
again

857
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,060
bummer

858
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,600
bummer dude

859
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,480
whoa

860
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,580
I think that was

861
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,700
something called theater of tragedy

862
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,840
Sterno sent me

863
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,240
a whole mess of

864
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,380
Scandinavian death metal

865
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,620
acid killer

866
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,080
burn down the church's rock

867
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,080
which

868
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,180
great stuff

869
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,840
it's kind of strangely labeled

870
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,000
we of course have also been listening to

871
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,540
Einstein's Secret Orchestra

872
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,040
on the

873
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,400
particularly the show of

874
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,620
December the 17th

875
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:36,120
1998 just before Christmas

876
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,180
and Susie

877
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,520
the floozies Bob

878
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,540
slack time funhouse

879
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,100
episode number

880
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,040
256

881
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,700
man

882
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:50,720
she's real proud of that

883
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,660
this is hour of slack number

884
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:55,740
672

885
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,740
now you're ready to

886
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,820
apply some makeup

887
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,160
if you can't remember which formula you need

888
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,340
just refer to your beauty profile

889
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,860
you'll want to take this list home with you

890
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,360
and keep it for future reference

891
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:12,620
we're full of eyelashes for that extra hint of glamour

892
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:14,560
and your fabulous

893
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:20,520
lining the lips will give you the collagen enhanced look

894
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,340
lipstick is extremely important and the final touch

895
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:34,000
remember when it comes to makeup too much is never enough

896
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,420
what what

897
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,920
what a thrill to have a massage

898
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,880
with vibrating steel needles

899
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,580
if you don't have time to apply your makeup

900
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:52,540
simply wear a mask and you'll be a woman of mystery

901
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,640
yes yes yes

902
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,540
you demon of darkness trick

903
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,860
it's funny to make you wonder

904
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,140
when you see how girls do that feel

905
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,460
forget it

906
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,200
apply red plastic nails for your slut persona

907
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,260
and long golden nails for your goddess

908
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,940
follow the grass girls

909
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,360
you haven't really lived fully until you've had your body painted

910
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:32,300
you can use grease paint glitter paint or use your own menstrual blood

911
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,900
this is a motion picture that depicts the secret cult of the devil

912
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:37,900


913
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,740
devil worshippers as never before shown

914
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:46,740
the hidden initiation chambers for the very special ones

915
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,720
the sacrifice of the snow maiden upon the altar of darkness

916
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,920
princess we must be sacrificed by susie

917
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,280
and weird

918
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,140
and pruning them

919
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:03,240
for special functions in the dance hall

920
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,260
yes

921
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:04,540
oh

922
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:04,920
hey susie

923
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,800
your seams are crooked

924
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:14,420
awaken your inner slut by slipping into some high high heels

925
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,860
a fitting pedestal for a sex goddess

926
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,700
or strut your stuff in biker boots

927
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:24,700
music

928
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:41,120
backing up your boat

929
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,460
rescue car

930
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,080
grief

931
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,340
what is the�

932
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,000
no

933
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,800
what is the

934
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,040
surface

935
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:48,640
how is this

936
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:48,660
blue

937
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,020
so

938
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:53,760
what is this

939
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:53,780
being

940
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,620
seen

941
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,960
We'll be right back.

942
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,220
We'll be right back.

943
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,640
Chaz and Princess Wee tried to sing, too.

944
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,980
It was just a sorry, sorry, sorry idea.

945
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,260
It's Christmas, man.

946
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,280
You're supposed to, when Christmas comes around,

947
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,560
you're supposed to think about the sweet little baby.

948
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,080
Hey, Zeus!

949
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:10,920
And you're supposed to think of him lying there all emangé

950
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,340
with an apple in his mouth looking like an N star

951
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,460
and the angels over his head

952
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,840
and think of, I don't know, good thoughts.

953
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,640
Check us all with Boston Charlie.

954
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,680
And Caliburn.

955
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:28,620
Jingle bells, Santa smells, Easter's on its way.

956
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:34,080
The first Noel, a cuddle on a lake.

957
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,140
Oh, no, Silent Night. Let's sing Silent Night.

958
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,460
I remember Danny, remember the second pathfinder,

959
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,900
you sing Silent Night, Stalker, Silent Night.

960
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,960
A little sniper, power up a pum-pum.

961
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:48,860
A little sniper boy.

962
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,460
Do you smell my sharp shoes?

963
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,260
Smell it.

964
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,240
Do you smell my sharp shoes?

965
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,980
I have an Uzi 2.

966
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,680
I have an Uzi 2.

967
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,220
Power up a pum-pum.

968
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,420
Yes, that was from the boys on the West Coast.

969
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,440
Lawrence, you're up there.

970
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,200
They don't care to a new negative.

971
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,680
A Christmas classic here on ESO Radio.

972
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,600
Did you play it?

973
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,280
Yeah, I played it earlier and I'm playing it right now.

974
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,860
Oh, they're so delightful.

975
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,560
They're just so delightful.

976
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,020
They're well produced and they actually sound like a chorus

977
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,200
on the Merv Griffin show or Andy Williams.

978
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,820
Oh, they wouldn't want to talk to us then.

979
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,120
No, they're all...

980
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:26,100
They're all as big a weirdo beatniks as we are.

981
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:26,780
Oh, no.

982
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,320
If they...

983
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,080
No, no, no.

984
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,920
No, they would just tell them guys together

985
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,020
and they'd do it, unlike us.

986
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,420
They'd just go there.

987
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,500
No, if it sounds good, I...

988
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:35,880
I'm a...

989
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,540
I don't think they'd...

990
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,000
If it sounds...

991
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,140
No, if they know what they're...

992
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,480
If they're nice and...

993
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,380
If they're oxygen breathers,

994
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,660
I don't know if they're going to want to deal

995
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:48,820
with the likes of us.

996
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,300
Well, you've kind of been making up

997
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,220
with the reptile side of life, though.

998
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:53,560
I mean...

999
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,100
Actually, I...

1000
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,080
I gave up on the oxygen breathers entirely.

1001
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,240
I'm working on the hydrogen people now.

1002
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,480
They're not even people.

1003
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,440
They're just blobs of gas, practically.

1004
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:02,760
But, you know...

1005
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,060
They internally synthesize the other gases

1006
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,660
and keep on going, or what do they do?

1007
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,220
Well, they live in an environment

1008
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:12,120
that's totally antithetical to oxy life.

1009
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:15,600
But, if that's all you can get, man...

1010
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,360
You know, it's kind of like

1011
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,240
mailing off for a Polynesian wife.

1012
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,640
You can't find anybody

1013
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,180
you can knock around in America,

1014
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,100
so you mail her to her.

1015
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:24,100


1016
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:24,120
You can't find anybody

1017
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,140
you can order from some country

1018
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,180
where it's legal.

1019
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,180
And bring them in.

1020
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,760
That's why I finally had to get

1021
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,800
a hydrogen breather.

1022
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,340
Keep her in a tank.

1023
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,160
Yeah, I was trying to get

1024
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,300
one of them mail-order brides.

1025
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,380
Somebody sent me one of them

1026
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,120
executed, mutated monkey hands.

1027
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,680
She likes it when I slap her around.

1028
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,560
She just jiggles like a big water balloon.

1029
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:42,460
Oh, wow.

1030
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,360
She has no face, no eyes,

1031
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,760
no features, no hole or anything.

1032
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,180
You just punch in, sort of.

1033
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:49,180
Hurts.

1034
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,780
But, like I say, the main thing is

1035
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,080
she lets me and oxygen breathers

1036
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:54,460
breathe her.

1037
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,720
Just slap her around.

1038
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,440
She makes this noise.

1039
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,160
It goes...

1040
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,840
Well, buddy, she's letting you

1041
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,620
slap her around.

1042
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,300
You notice not only she's got

1043
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,380
some pull-bucker blood in you,

1044
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,940
but also that you are on the top

1045
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:08,460
or on the ladder,

1046
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,880
and she knows that she's an

1047
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,520
unfearing hydrogen-breathing creature

1048
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,400
when she's around you.

1049
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,580
She depends on you, buddy.

1050
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,700
Well, see, the thing is,

1051
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,860
she kind of digs that.

1052
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:18,780
Oh, so you're saying she's like

1053
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,300
one of them New York bitch kind of

1054
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:20,660
hydrogen...

1055
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:21,800
She's one of those freaks, man.

1056
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:22,480
She's a freak.

1057
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,060
That's what he says.

1058
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:26,800
I don't know, man.

1059
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:27,700
That's dear clear of them.

1060
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,960
They got all kinds of strange habits.

1061
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:29,620
You know, some of them,

1062
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,640
they're many, many, many more

1063
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,780
millions of light-years older

1064
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,300
than you think.

1065
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,820
Hey, man, some of us are into hydros.

1066
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:38,920
I'm a hydro guy, man.

1067
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:39,500
I'm into it.

1068
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,600
Don't put me down.

1069
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:41,980
You know, I'm out.

1070
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,780
I'm not going to hide in the closet.

1071
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:45,520
Whatever happens between you

1072
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,340
and that hydrogen...

1073
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,840
I'm a hydrogen breather-osexual.

1074
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:49,340
It's...

1075
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,640
I'm so...

1076
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,460
Oh, my God.

1077
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,580
It's hard to score, dude,

1078
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:55,800
in this sector of the galaxy.

1079
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,720
I'm really waiting for X-Day.

1080
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,820
So, sex goddesses...

1081
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,160
We never said exactly

1082
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,960
what phylum they were.

1083
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,400
No, you didn't.

1084
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,640
You never elaborated on this.

1085
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,880
Bob didn't go into any

1086
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,580
super extreme detail

1087
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,820
out of which kingdom they might be.

1088
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,400
Oh, he didn't is why you don't know.

1089
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:16,800
You don't know either?

1090
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,680
Boy, I don't care.

1091
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:19,900
You don't care.

1092
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,380
Hey, they're sex goddesses.

1093
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,340
Bob sold it.

1094
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:22,900
I smoked it.

1095
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,160
That's it.

1096
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:23,880
You already speculated

1097
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,600
on what would happen

1098
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,580
if they would, like, kill you,

1099
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,420
kind of like a spider

1100
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,520
can kill its own lover and stuff, right?

1101
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,180
You talked on about that for a while.

1102
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,320
We can't really trust these beings

1103
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,100
which we're putting our trust in to.

1104
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:37,660
Well, look,

1105
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:38,780
you spent your 30 bucks

1106
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,800
buying your membership

1107
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,060
in Church of the Subgenius.

1108
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,280
That's what you're paying for

1109
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,860
is to pay the hydrogen-breathing

1110
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,040
sex goddess monsters

1111
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,860
not to bite your head off

1112
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:49,200
after you have sex with them.

1113
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,060
Well, if I go down

1114
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,080
to X-Rated Place here

1115
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:51,860
and I pay my...

1116
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:52,900
As far as for massage,

1117
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:53,980
I surely don't want somebody

1118
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:54,920
to come out and hit me on the head

1119
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:55,760
with a bowling pin afterward.

1120
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,060
Well, that's probably

1121
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:57,840
not going to happen

1122
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,980
in this sector of the galaxy

1123
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,180
with being paranoid

1124
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:00,860
about a day.

1125
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:01,360
Are you nuts?

1126
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,800
Well, they had a big speed net

1127
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,500
going on over there

1128
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,260
on the east side of town.

1129
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:04,840
They did?

1130
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:05,380
Yeah.

1131
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,140
In Cleveland?

1132
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,200
That far north?

1133
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,740
They had a big speed net

1134
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,200
out on by the Kuiper Belt

1135
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,260
last week.

1136
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:13,120
Sheets going on everywhere.

1137
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:13,500
Well, I guess

1138
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,280
I've got to give you

1139
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,360
Yankees more credit.

1140
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,680
They wouldn't let you go

1141
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,360
more than 10%

1142
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,220
the speed of light.

1143
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:20,760
Bastards.

1144
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,620
Well, yeah, back then.

1145
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:22,620
Well, that's why

1146
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,200
the vice squad

1147
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:23,980
just cracked it down.

1148
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,020
We've got to cut out of here.

1149
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,460
You've got Einstein's

1150
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:28,360
secret fuzz buster ready, Chaz.

1151
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:28,840
That's right.

1152
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:32,720
We've got to cut out of here

1153
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,240
as much as I...

1154
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,420
Well, you know,

1155
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,820
just Merry Christmas, folks.

1156
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,000
We'll be here next week,

1157
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:38,800
Christmas Eve.

1158
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:39,960
So if you folks

1159
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,100
want to call in on Christmas

1160
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,640
with the real Christmas wish,

1161
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,920
you can feel free to do that

1162
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,980
because I'm going to be here

1163
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:47,140
whether I like it or not.

1164
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,820
It was a great wish.

1165
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,160
That was a great...

1166
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:51,780
I remember

1167
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:52,620
that on...

1168
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,300
Was it a song?

1169
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,800
Beware Satan's clog

1170
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:56,800
that was done by

1171
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,020
a nude on the moon.

1172
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,140
Till next week.

1173
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,760
Keep your back untied.

1174
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,640
Your hat in the saddle.

1175
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,800
Your butt in the...

1176
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,620
In your saddle.

1177
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,060
Sleep under your hat.

1178
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:11,660
It's a killer.

1179
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,420
It's a killer.

1180
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,820
It's a killer.

1181
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,720
Friends, you can contact

1182
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,660

That's right, friends.

is to send off

with that self-addressed

1191
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:40,680
hand-to-hand envelope.

We'll be back.

1207

1213
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,560
Hail Luciferina.

1214
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,160
Hail Luciferina

1215
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,260
and Bob Dabrina.

1216
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:24,100
I'm gonna go down there and have some of that Purina.

1217
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,060
Lamb and rice flavor.

1218
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:33,020
For older dogs.

1219
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,700
Good night, kids.

1220
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,700
Good night, Paul.

1221
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,300
Good night, Paul.

1222
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,660
Where's Chad?

1223
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:49,420
Paul, when are you gonna come back to Paul and me?

1224
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,300
I can't see him anymore.

1225
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,700
Paul, when are you gonna come back to us?

1226
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,840
He's in the car.

1227
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,740
Paul, when are you gonna move back in with Ma and me?

1228
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,860
You gonna be doing the squirrel supper, Paul?

1229
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,600
Paul, where'd you go?

1230
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,420
Conversation can serve no purpose anymore.

1231
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:12,780
Goodbye.

1232
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:15,580
Al?

1233
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:17,600
Al!

1234
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,240
You invited me to the squirrel supper.

1235
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:20,720
Al!

1236
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:22,320

Goodbye.

1240
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,660
Al?

1241
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,540

Goodbye.

1244
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,380

Come.

1246
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:36,780

1247
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:39,080
You invited me to the squirrel supper.

1248
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:39,540
Goodbye.

1249
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,300
Al?

1250
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:44,200
Come.

1251
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:44,700
Al!

1252
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:45,400
Al!

1253
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,180
Come.

1254
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:47,720
Al!

1255
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:48,420
Al!

1256
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:50,120
Come.

1257
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:50,640

1259
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,360
Come.

1260
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:53,620
Al!

1261
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,140
Al!

1262
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:54,140


1263
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,040
Goodbye.

1264
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:58,640
Goodbye.

1265
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:58,640


1266
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:58,680
Al!

1267
00:59:58,680 --> 00:59:58,680


1268
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,220
Al!

1269
00:59:59,440 --> 00:59:59,640
Come.

1270
00:59:59,640 --> 00:59:59,640


1271
00:59:59,640 --> 00:59:59,680
Come.

1272
00:59:59,680 --> 00:59:59,680


1273
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,540
You invited me to the squirrel supper.

1274
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:01,920
Al!

1275
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:03,760
Al!

1276
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,040
Goodbye.
