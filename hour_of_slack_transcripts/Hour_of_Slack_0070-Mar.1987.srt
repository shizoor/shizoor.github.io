13
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,280
They are Bob Dogs.

14
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,020
And here you can hear Bob coming, friends.

15
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,880
Oh, he is my load.

16
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,040
So when you say, next time you say,

17
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,920
Boy, I heard that Reverend saying on the radio,

18
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,560
he sure is a snotty guy.

19
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,180
This time you can mean it literally,

20
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,980
because though sick, though afflicted with a cold,

21
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,400
the show must go on.

22
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,820
And, you know, being sick didn't stop Tammy Baker.

23
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,640
As a matter of fact, yesterday in the,

24
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,540
now this was in the paper yesterday,

25
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,340
Tammy under treatment.

26
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,180
Tammy Baker, wife of TV preacher Jim Baker,

27
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,620
who I'm sure you all watch all the time,

28
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,860
said Friday that she has had a drug problem for 17 years

29
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,940
and has been undergoing detoxification

30
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,160
at, I believe, the Betty Ford rehab clinic for several weeks.

31
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,860
She and her husband,

32
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,020
said the disclosure was made during a TV taping

33
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,220
in Fort Mills, South Carolina,

34
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,980
to dispel rumors about their three-month absence from the tube.

35
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,420
Tammy Baker said her problem had gotten so bad,

36
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,580
her drug problem, friends,

37
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,500
had gotten so bad that she hyperventilated several times

38
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,540
while doing the show.

39
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,700
I kind of know how that is.

40
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,160
And sometimes couldn't see her husband's head.

41
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,380
I'm not alone.

42
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,020
And thought she saw cats sitting on the airplane wing

43
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,920
on the way to the Betty Ford Center for treatment.

44
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,080
And at the hospital, she saw demons coming at her.

45
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,760
Well, friends, I'm afraid to tell you,

46
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,780
these demons may have been for real.

47
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,760
But, you know, being sick never stopped Oral Roberts either,

48
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,160
another great sub, well, not exactly a subgenius preacher,

49
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,680
but a sub-something.

50
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,120
I mean, he was seeing 900-foot-tall Jesuses

51
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,680
and has died twice.

52
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,680
And you still haven't sent him any money.

53
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,580
And if you don't,

54
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,280
send money to K&O Ender and the Pledge Drive

55
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,540
next week, dear friends.

56
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,840
Your guru and mine, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

57
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,820
will die of acquired, well, AIDS.

58
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,260
So, I know that's sick, sick.

59
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,380
But, you know, like I say,

60
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,840
sickness has never stopped a subgenius preacher.

61
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,140
Cut the tongue off of one subgenius ranter, dear friends,

62
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,400
and ten more will grow in its place.

63
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,740
Right, right.

64
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,640
But you want to know, what you really want to know is

65
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:45,300
just exactly what is this church of the subgenius?

66
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,860
And that question, friends, is asked a thousand times a day,

67
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
every day, somewhere.

68
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,560
And it's a good question.

69
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,420
It's a good thing to ask,

70
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,980
because it's about the only pertinent question you can ask

71
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,960
in this day and age.

72
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,540
It's a million-legged church

73
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,460
crawling around inside your cranium.

74
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,280
But there's one point that it'll keep coming back to,

75
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,120
and that point, friends, is Bob.

76
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,320
Bob is, was, and ever shall be.

77
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,280
Bob is you.

78
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,080
Bob is me.

79
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,500
Bob is the commissure to the id,

80
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,240
the light that glows in the heart and mind

81
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,200
of every free-thinking subgenius.

82
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,540
And Bob is amazing.

83
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:29,860
A man.

84
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,980
A real man.

85
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,760
And it's Bob.

86
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,100
It always comes down to that,

87
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,360
because Bob is slack.

88
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,900
Slack, well, you know what slack is.

89
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,980
It's what you don't have,

90
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,300
because they took it away.

91
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,320
But you'll be taught how to get slack back on this program.

92
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,680
You'll be taught by somebody you can trust completely,

93
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,100
by J.R. Bob Dobbs himself.

94
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,320
And the fact that you've gotten this far,

95
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,540
listening this far into this show,

96
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,420
indicates that you have not been

97
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,880
put completely to sleep.

98
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,180
You haven't been totally taken in by them.

99
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:04,880
Not yet.

100
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,600
But they can still trick you.

101
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,360
Oh, as bait, they'll feed you too much

102
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,600
of the wrong kind of slack.

103
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,780
The false slack of the conspiracy.

104
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,120
You know about the conspiracy.

105
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,160
Them.

106
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:19,920
Them.

107
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,800
Not us, them.

108
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,960
It was they that took away your real slack.

109
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,580
But you're not one of them, and never were.

110
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,960
Not even when they made you want to be.

111
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,400
In fact, that's why they wanted your slack.

112
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:29,400


113
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:29,680
Never slack.

114
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,160
That's why you had slack in the first place.

115
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,480
And even though they managed to steal most of it,

116
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,000
they obviously haven't got it all,

117
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,260
and they haven't got Bob.

118
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,780
And as long as there's one free man among us,

119
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,080
their system cannot be complete,

120
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,880
because by nature it is a closed system.

121
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,300
And if we can keep their system incomplete,

122
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,600
it will close down of its own accord.

123
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,020
By their own law, dear friends,

124
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,700
their law,

125
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,960
their justice,

126
00:10:59,960 --> 00:10:59,960


127
00:10:59,960 --> 00:10:59,960


128
00:10:59,960 --> 00:10:59,960


129
00:10:59,960 --> 00:10:59,960


130
00:10:59,960 --> 00:10:59,960


131
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,220
And this is the power of normalcy.

132
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,160
They wanted you to at least want to be normal.

133
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,620
And you may look normal,

134
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,700
you may act normal,

135
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,280
but you aren't normal, are you?

136
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,500
You just aren't normal.

137
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,540
And it's the power of that abnormality that saves you.

138
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,040
Dear friend,

139
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,600
you know,

140
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,200
I was just reading

141
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,120
this news clipping

142
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,820
that came out in Science Frontiers last week.

143
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,780
Open your Science Frontiers booklet

144
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,160
to page 14 and a half,

145
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,660
which says that Neanderthal man may still survive in Asia.

146
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,700
You know all continents have their tales of wild men,

147
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,960
abominable snowmen,

148
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,080
sasquatches, and so forth.

149
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,560
But, um,

150
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:52,880
here, this description from General Mikhail Topilsky,

151
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,100
when he was in the Altai Islands,

152
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,380
in Inner Mongolia,

153
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,800
saw a creature emerging from a cave.

154
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,460
The eyes were dark,

155
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,660
and the teeth were large,

156
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,240
and even shaped like human teeth.

157
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,020
The forehead, though, was slanting,

158
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,400
and the eyebrows were very powerful.

159
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,340
The protruding jaw bones made the face resemble the Mongol type of face.

160
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,620
The nose was very flat.

161
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,080
The lower jaws were very massive.

162
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,760
And after reviewing mountains of evidence, friends,

163
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,100
it's obvious that these al-Mashti are very likely surviving Neanderthals.

164
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,150
They have the physical characteristics,

165
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,010
and so do I, dear friends, so do I,

166
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,430
and so do many of you.

167
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,190
And it's because you share the blood of the Yeti.

168
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,270
Yes, the Yeti.

169
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:38,950
You're not human.

170
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,130
Not completely.

171
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,230
The consp...

172
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,350
Oh, listen to that.

173
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,690
Isn't it good to know you're not hu...

174
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,190
And, you know, there's surviving Neanderthals in South America, too.

175
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:53,310
Colonel Fawcett standing as a geographer cannot be refuted

176
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,130
when he saw these sub-highlanders.

177
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,110
These hominoids, uh...

178
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,110
You know, in Brazil in 1914.

179
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,690
Because, see,

180
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,530
the conspiracy burns humans as fuel.

181
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,990
But subgeniuses aren't humans.

182
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,170
Nay, nay.

183
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,250
We gum up the works.

184
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,310
Now, if you're a human,

185
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,250
you've, uh, dear listener,

186
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,370
you've been listening to the show a bit too long.

187
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,410
Shut it off.

188
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,450
Turn down the radio,

189
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,670
because you don't want to hear the rest, believe me.

190
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,390
Now, the rest of you,

191
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:33,490
you may have heard the term subgenius sometime before,

192
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,770
but you may not be able to quite put your finger on it,

193
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,910
almost as if it were some dim racial memory,

194
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,650
some archetype from Neanderthal times,

195
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,170
and that may very well be the case.

196
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,610
The church wasn't founded until 1953,

197
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,350
the Church of the Subgenius, that is,

198
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,910
and it was 1979 before Dobbs created the Hour of Slack

199
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,170
as a vehicle to bring the teachings to the public.

200
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,070
But subgeniuses have always existed,

201
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,530
even before Dobbs.

202
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,730
In all the cradles of civilization,

203
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,330
Sumeria, Egypt, Atlantis,

204
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,530
clues have been found which prove the existence of the conspiracy

205
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,230
and of the subgeniuses who fought to subdue it.

206
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,630
The wisdom of those ancient subgeniuses was never lost.

207
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,150
Carried down by secret oral traditions,

208
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,330
it lies latent in many living people's minds.

209
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,490
Waiting only to be triggered by the abnormality revolution.

210
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,450
Perhaps even as you listen to my voice,

211
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:32,490
you can feel those ancestral powers and arcane memories

212
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,350
surging up from within your darkest brain gutters.

213
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,350
Ask yourself,

214
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,690
don't you feel different at this exact moment than you ever did before?

215
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,150
Isn't it because you feel some vague and momentous force

216
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,650
emanating from these very airwaves?

217
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,510
You didn't just wander across the dial

218
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,250
and happen to pick up this broadcast.

219
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,810
You were led to us,

220
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,910
and we to you by powers much greater than man

221
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,030
and yet seemingly more random than fate.

222
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,830
But the ways of the great manipulator in space, Jehovah One,

223
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,930
only appear random.

224
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,290
Yes, our paths crossed because it was planned,

225
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,250
plotted out eons ago by alien minds

226
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,590
more bizarre than your wildest nightmares.

227
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:17,530
As part of a work net,

228
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,490
a cosmic scheme woven into such a complex,

229
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,630
complex web that not just human history,

230
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,590
but the fabric of cause and effect themselves were disrupted.

231
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:31,430
Face it, the very fact of your ears moving across this radio dial

232
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,290
at this moment is inevitably and sub-atomically decreed.

233
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,330
You are locked into the machinations of a cosmic puppeteer

234
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,070
who works your strings so skillfully

235
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,750
you never knew they were there.

236
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,590
Until now.

237
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:19,830
It got tasty.

238
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:19,850
Dr. Shannon has fully reached the actual

239
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:19,990
stream,

240
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,330
states the moral promise.

241
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,030
The pieces of dead children.

242
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,570
You were able to...

243
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,790
go through time for 100 to 200 years,

244
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,390
and you look back on the 80s, and you say,

245
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,350
Bob, yes, yes, he was a very small birth then,

246
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,630
but he grew, and he overtook this entire Earth,

247
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,850
and now there's just a few pockets of the other type of religion it is to be.

248
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,270
If God is everything, Bob is everything else.

249
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,710
Bob isn't the answer,

250
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,050
but neither is anything else.

251
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,650
Well, Bob supersedes all gods.

252
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,110
I don't want to, you know, put...

253
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,170
He's not interested in other gods.

254
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,150
Why are you so nervous?

255
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,630
Except me. I can't stand being alone with myself.

256
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,530
Calm down there, half of you, Bob.

257
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,950
The gospel will save you from this insane world that we live in.

258
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,330
We live in a sick, sick society.

259
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,950
In this never-changing world in which we live in,

260
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,850
you ought to give it a try.

261
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,590
This is a crooked and perverse nation, my friend.

262
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:23,330
This caller is, I can tell, he's got the code of the Yeti

263
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,810
leaking out of his ears.

264
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,450
Whoa!

265
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,970
Establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility,

266
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,790
provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare,

267
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,850
ordain and establish this conflict recently.

268
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,910
It's so relative.

269
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,470
It's more relative than Einstein ever thought, dear friends.

270
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,290
I told you I was going to...

271
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:45,730
Meow.

272
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,070
Hello, you're on the air.

273
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,670
Could he be the one?

274
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:51,550
Maybe.

275
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,230
But will he be ours to control?

276
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,610
Will they be able to control you, friends?

277
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,670
Are you the one?

278
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,490
I guess not.

279
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,050
But let me tell you a little parable.

280
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,490
This is a parable told by J.R. Bob Dobbs in the olden days.

281
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,650
The music you're listening to, by the way,

282
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,590
was done largely by yours truly with the help of Walt Disney.

283
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,430
Oh, it feels so good.

284
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:30,330
And this is the story, dear friends,

285
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,510
of weirdmen and normalmen

286
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:41,170
told around campfires for aeons by good subgenius parents.

287
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:43,970
Well...

288
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,650
In...

289
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,970
In the times before the times of trouble,

290
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,250
before the years of P.E.,

291
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,670
there was a man named Normalman

292
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,830
and his brother, Weirdman.

293
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,310
Now, Normalman was a successful man.

294
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,850
He worked very hard to...

295
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,050
Not just to support his family,

296
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,750
in fact, not primarily for that,

297
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,590
but to advance his career.

298
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,370
He was a very popular fellow at the office,

299
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,930
but he worked late and worked very hard

300
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,970
so that he could own the many video decks

301
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,070
and CD players that he needed

302
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,730
in order to retain his status as Normalman.

303
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,050
But his brother, Weirdman,

304
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:35,370
was a slacker, one might say.

305
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:40,330
He would get out and drive around the city

306
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,130
pretending to look for a job,

307
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,510
but generally having fun

308
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,190
and getting into long, involved conversations

309
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,650
with other disaffected souls.

310
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:56,150
Yes, Weirdman was what Normalman considered a kook,

311
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,290
for he was completely obsessed

312
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,090
with strange scientific discoveries

313
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,430
and political viewpoints

314
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,350
never accepted in the mainstream.

315
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,030
And so, many times,

316
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,110
Weirdman, who made very little effort

317
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:12,590
to make any money,

318
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:16,450
had to go and borrow from Normalman.

319
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,490
But then, one day,

320
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,150
there was a terrible nuclear war.

321
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,890
And on that day,

322
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,770
why, it was Weirdman who was well prepared

323
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,590
and went deep into his fallout shelter

324
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,590
where he survived.

325
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:31,590
Normalman, however,

326
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,090
had to crawl through the rubble,

327
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,490
his hair blowing away in the wind,

328
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:41,430
vomiting every few steps, so to speak,

329
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,770
until he made it to the door of Weirdman's fallout shelter.

330
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,090
He banged upon the door, saying,

331
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,530
Oh, Weirdman, it is so ironic

332
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,070
that you were the one who actually was

333
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,390
the industrious, prepared one,

334
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,630
and I, in my smugness,

335
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:00,190
neglected to prepare for such a terrible emergency

336
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,370
which I thought my friends in the conspiracy

337
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,350
would never inflict on me.

338
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,730
Me having voted for them,

339
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,710
I thought that they would love me.

340
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,070
But here they have destroyed my city.

341
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,930
May I come into your fallout shelter?

342
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,510
Well, at this,

343
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,930
Weirdman opened the door

344
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,070
and machine-gunned Normalman

345
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,570
and dragged his body down into the fallout shelter

346
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,830
where he ate him.

347
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,850
However, this did Weirdman very little good,

348
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,170
because in the end,

349
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,130
a new gang of better equipped survivalists

350
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,710
came along and took his fallout shelter away

351
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,250
and ate him.

352
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,070
But, dear friends,

353
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,890
that is not the end of the story,

354
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:39,830
nor the moral,

355
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,570
for there was a third brother we haven't mentioned,

356
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,590
Bobman.

357
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,470
Why, when those nuclear explosions

358
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,130
were melting the eyeballs of all those around him,

359
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,390
Bobman was miraculously protected

360
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,250
in a force field-like bubble

361
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,110
and taken up into the special sex vessels

362
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,890
of the goddesses from Planet X,

363
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,150
the Exists,

364
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,690
where he was evolved into a great overman,

365
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,750
all because he carried a membership card.

366
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,630
He was a member of the subgenius,

367
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,670
as well as a sustaining membership for K.N.O.N.,

368
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:18,010
whereas Weirdman and Normalman

369
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,170
had neglected these so important things.

370
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,890
So, children,

371
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,210
I hope that this has been something

372
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,610
of an important

373
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,650
and a well-understood lesson to you.

374
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,170
And perhaps you will then understand

375
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,710
the importance

376
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,570
of this.

377
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,390
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

378
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,970
J.R. Bob Dobbs, dear friends,

379
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,550
the living slack master

380
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,790
of mystic sales training,

381
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,410
the bridge between Heaven and Earth

382
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,590
and Hell,

383
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,790
the wordless Bobhead,

384
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,470
the naked Dobbs,

385
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,090
all-knowing,

386
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,290
all-prevailing,

387
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,090
all-just,

388
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:03,910
all-true,

389
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:04,550
all-none,

390
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,070
all-one,

391
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,990
Dobbs is the one true way

392
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,050
by which we may finally achieve

393
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,430
that elusive slack

394
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,990
which has been denied us.

395
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,330
Science and religion

396
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,250
each prove totally different things,

397
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,930
yet they both appear to be true,

398
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,550
and so, by divine logic,

399
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,310
the answer must be Bob.

400
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,850
Ah, friends, friends, it's...

401
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:33,130
Oh, listen to that.

402
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,990
You see, I'm cured now.

403
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,910
You haven't heard me sneeze

404
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,950
or sniffle once this whole time.

405
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,050
It's because I have dominion

406
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,350
over the evil one,

407
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,150
and so too can you

408
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,310
if you will but call

409
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,130
the Willa Dobbs here

410
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:52,990
at 823-749-0828-9500

411
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,370
to find out what is going on.

412
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,970
This is an unusual night here

413
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:03,710
at KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas,

414
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,270
because we're solid live.

415
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,290
It's a challenge.

416
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,590
It's something that, uh,

417
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,130
well, some...

418
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,330
The musicians that I requested

419
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,110
come play on the show

420
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,830
thought it was too much of a challenge

421
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,750
and refused to take it on,

422
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,490
but, friends, sickness will never stop

423
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,730
a subgenius doctor.

424
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,930
Nay, nay, nay.

425
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,170
We will...

426
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,670
We will, uh...

427
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,770
We will overcome these things

428
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,130
because, as I say,

429
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,870
we have the power,

430
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,190
the power of that mighty,

431
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:37,590
mighty man.

432
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,350
Wait.

433
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,210
I think I hear him.

434
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,270
In the distance.

435
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,510
Yes, the power of Bob.

436
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,030
And once again, you're thinking,

437
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,790
oh, God, do we have to listen

438
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,730
to more cult preachings?

439
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:56,830
Is this like the Baha'is or someone

440
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,930
with their cosmic New Age

441
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,010
sweetness and light baloney?

442
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,470
Well, friends,

443
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,090
it ain't like that.

444
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,510
No, no, it's far worse.

445
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,450
A thousand times worse.

446
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,970
Bob doesn't want any part of the New Age

447
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,270
with its hallucinated love gods.

448
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,730
The New Age is already here

449
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,210
and it obviously, uh,

450
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,850
it's obviously worthless.

451
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,730
I'd rather use stronger language there,

452
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,530
but it's against the law on these stations.

453
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,290
But someday, friends, Bob will overcome.

454
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,730
Bob will, will overcome the,

455
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,850
the fools and the unbelievers.

456
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,810
Those who would, you know...

457
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:34,270
Oh.

458
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,830
If you only knew.

459
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,470
If you only knew what that mighty man...

460
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,270
Well, enough of that.

461
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,730
Enough of that.

462
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,010
I've got so many cassettes stacked up here.

463
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,370
I am hallucinating, friends.

464
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,090
You know, I haven't been reading

465
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,670
from the book of the subgenius.

466
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,190
No, no.

467
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,650
I've been preaching straight from the gut.

468
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,750
And, uh, you may say,

469
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,970
oh, yeah, Dr. H sounds like he's seeing things for sure.

470
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,750
He must be.

471
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,610
But, you know...

472
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:09,030
You don't have to have J.R. Bob Dobbs

473
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,910
to have a good time.

474
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,770
You don't need Bob.

475
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,850
Oh, some of you do.

476
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,010
Some of you would say so.

477
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,550
Some of you Bobbies out there would say,

478
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,410
oh, Reverend Stang, if I,

479
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,410
if I don't have Bob in my life,

480
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,890
how could I possibly be happy?

481
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,830
You don't have to have him, like,

482
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,450
breathing down the back of your neck

483
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,610
every minute of the day.

484
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,730
Bob is a short-duration personal savior,

485
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,090
if you don't mind.

486
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,970
And, uh, you know, he's, this is a,

487
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,070
this is a, uh,

488
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:40,330
a, uh, overworked world, dear friends.

489
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,770
This is a world where we've got

490
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,590
too much going on,

491
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,430
too much of the...

492
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,470
You know, that TV camera is driving me nuts.

493
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,990
There's a, there's a TV camera

494
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:54,230
hanging over the, my shoulder, dear friends.

495
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:58,210
And so, that booger's got me flustered a bit.

496
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,870
It's funny the difference between microphones

497
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,270
and TV lenses.

498
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,430
Tasty prairie squid spread.

499
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,870
Salted and unsalted varieties available

500
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,350
on the East Coast only.

501
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,550
The radioactive cloud is now over Little Rock.

502
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:35,710
This is WFMU-FM East Orange.

503
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,050
And this is Sister Chris.

504
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,230
And you just heard from a half hour

505
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,350
of the Church of the Subgenius tape.

506
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,030

than you can ever assimilate.

515
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,370
Dear friends,

516
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,750
are you under the power

517
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,450
of the clammy claw of Negi?

518
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:14,750
Have you ever seen a rope

519
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,130
around your neck being drawn tighter and tighter

520
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,830
by Jehovah-1 alien space god?

521
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,530
Either way, you need to practice

522
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,330
the bludgeon art of disconnection.

523
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,930
Sever that tie

524
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,410
to the six second maximum attention span

525
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,110
synchronized with conspiracy cues.

526
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,050
Scramble that signal.

527
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,030
Realize that slack can be found

528
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,010
in the six second random attention span

529
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,670
alternating with a non-pattern

530
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:40,090
of a googolplex lifetime attention span.

531
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,010
Get it?

532
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:41,970
Get out.

533
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:47,710
trance out, mutate that theory of relativity until you're practicing the law of irrelevancy.

534
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:55,990
The Bible heroes never had it so good. Syncopate that rhythm of life. Make fun by having it with,

535
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:01,970
or do I mean have fun by making it with, the zomboid normals. Of course, don't mix that

536
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:08,550
blessed Yeti gene code. Blast them wide open with the psychic weapon of spontaneity and hit

537
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:14,190
them with the soft spot of unexpected. Usually look at it in the sponge between their ears.

538
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:20,950
Force them to disconnect from their played out routines. Either way, they won't know how to react

539
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:26,830
and they'll stare at you and drool, or you may strike gold by tickling the funny femur of a latent

540
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:35,290
subgenius. Any way you slice it with wit, my friends, it all comes back to thinking on your feet. Shave those pigs.

541
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:46,130
This is Dennis from the smithereens. This is Joe Ely. Oh, this is Rusty Weary. Hello. Hi, we're two of the devil's fans.

Hello there. Um, this is Simon from the cure. Hello, Dallas, Texas. This is Jerry Dale McFadden.

545
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:08,530
and the people.

546
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:22,770
And other things. And, uh, as I promised, um, since I don't have the real live band, but I do have a band here that you won't hear on record for a long time yet.

547
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:32,930
This is an early, early, early unofficial pre-release of, um, well, just, just listen and try, try to guess here.

548
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:43,890
And praise Bob every chance you get. Praise or kill Bob.

549
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:44,270
Praise Bob.

550
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,270
Praise Bob.

551
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:53,510
Praise Bob.

552
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,670
Praise Bob.

553
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,590
Praise Bob.

554
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,770
Praise Bob.

555
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:55,710
Praise Bob.

556
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,570
Praise Bob.

557
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:48,910
Praise Bob.

558
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,430
Praise Bob.

559
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,430
Praise Bob.

560
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,210
Praise Bob.

561
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,310
Praise Bob.

562
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:17,470
MICHIGAN BRA Jahr.

563
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,950
Praise Bob.

564
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,950
Praise Bob.

565
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,550
Praise Bob.

566
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:40,730
Somewhere

567
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:43,210
There's a place for us

568
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,490
Somewhere

569
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:49,830
Somewhere

570
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:53,130
There will be a time for us

571
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,070
Somewhere

572
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:57,690
Somewhere

573
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:57,950
Somewhere

574
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:02,350
Hold my hand and I'll take you there

575
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,830
Sing, sing, sing

576
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,930
Sing a lullaby

577
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,810
Sing, sing, sing

578
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:40,010
Come able to hear

579
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:40,850
Sing, sing, sing

580
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,530
Sing, sing, sing

581
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,510
Sing, sing, sing

582
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:50,090
Now there is a way

583
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:50,190
Burn the world

584
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:50,750
Burn the world

585
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:55,210
Burn it now

586
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,470
Thank you.

587
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:35,470
Thank you.

588
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:58,530
Thank you.

589
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,650
Thank you.

590
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,650
Thank you.

591
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,690
Thank you.

592
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:58,350
Thank you.

593
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,510
Thank you.

594
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,850
Thank you.

595
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,050
Thank you.

596
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:09,090
Thank you.

597
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:37,650
Thank you.

598
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,030
Thank you.

599
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,950
Thank you.

600
00:44:58,310 --> 00:44:58,790
Thank you.

601
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:31,910
Or worse, that will be largely up to the Exists.

602
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:40,590
The Exists, dear friends, are a race of benevolent aliens somewhere between man and God.

603
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:45,310
Their technical and psychic powers, while no match for Yahweh's,

604
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:50,410
are yet nothing short of godlike to us roaches, the earth mammals.

605
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,830
They're bodiless, but they can take on whatever form they choose,

606
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:56,690
or they can be a million different things at once.

607
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:00,930
These benign space monsters have walked among us throughout history,

608
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:08,750
investigating and sometimes resisting the omnipervasive presence of Jehovah One and his minions,

609
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:15,970
the extinction of the dinosaurs, the rise and, quote, fall, unquote, of Atlantis shortly thereafter,

610
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:22,910
the erection of the pyramids, Stonehenge, and other monuments which no slopeheads alone could possibly build.

611
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,310
All these events and more are so inextricably interwoven

612
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:26,670
with the existence of the universe that they are so much more than just a matter of time.

613
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:32,390
It's the invisible background wars between the Exists, Jehovah One, and the Elder Gods

614
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:39,610
that all the ancient astronaut fossils in the world offer only the vaguest of clues.

615
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:44,130
The movie rights alone to this gut-wrenching history are worth millions.

616
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,910
It isn't what the Exists have done, though.

617
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:48,890
It's what they're about to do that's important.

618
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:55,870
On July 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m., dear friends, when we all have hangovers,

619
00:46:56,570 --> 00:47:01,410
Wotan's judgment will take place in the form of what the prescriptures call

620
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:03,990
the advent of the angelic host.

621
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:08,870
The Exists will descend with their scientifically magic implements,

622
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:12,550
their bestowals of technology that will be too much for us to handle.

623
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:18,170
In one instant, all the hangovers will disappear, along with all pollution and nuclear weapons.

624
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:22,910
But in return, the human race will have to take on living machinery,

625
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:25,750
live neck braces so complex,

626
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:32,450
that though they are peaceful, the end result will be the equivalent of letting toddlers play with a nuclear arsenal.

627
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:40,410
Bob, and not some conspiracy one-world government, must be there in a position of world leadership to explain

628
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:47,050
humanity's behavior to the Exists in ways they can understand, so that they don't put us out of our misery

629
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:50,950
with a snap of their cosmic finger like they did the dinosaurs.

630
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:55,490
The right people, us, must be the ones that the Exists make into

631
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:57,130
superhuman overmen.

632
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:01,710
And then, even then, things will be damn tough for the rest of this period,

633
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:07,070
which is called the time and half time in occult jargon.

634
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:32,970
The end result will be the end of the world.

635
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:33,010
The end result will be the end of the world.

636
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:33,810
The end result will be the end of the world.

637
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:34,130
The end result will be the end of the world.

638
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:34,950
The end result will be the end of the world.

639
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:40,410
Of course, dear friends, Bob may be able to avert the invasion before the Exists get here.

640
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:46,430
But only if you pledge enough money to K-N-O-N next week, during the pledge drive.

641
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:55,190
But even if that happens, the scales of the luck plane will require something else equally momentous to maintain the cosmic balance.

642
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:59,190
No matter what, something big, yes, BIG is on the way.

643
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:01,690
It may or may not be the end of the world.

644
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:04,370
Hopefully it'll only be the end of THEIR world.

645
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:06,190
But it will be the end of something.

646
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:10,230
Something that was so near and dear to us that we've taken it for granted.

647
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:13,210
And therefore, when it goes, we won't notice.

648
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:17,570
The word human will take on a whole new meaning.

649
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:20,930
And most yo-yos will never be the wiser.

650
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:23,550
Either way, the end will come and go.

651
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:25,170
And if it isn't cataclysmic, it will be the end of the world.

652
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:26,190
And it won't get airplay.

653
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:30,710
And if it is, we'll have all the wrong explanations for it.

654
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:32,990
Since no explanation could ever be the right one,

655
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,630
we'll be bemoaning the loss of things that didn't make any difference,

656
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:39,110
and never even notice what we really lost.

657
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:43,750
Because we won't be human enough afterwards to remember we ever had it.

658
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:46,810
Yes, all you deaf ears down there, heads up!

659
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:47,830
Look out below!

660
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:52,630
Oh, there'll be plenty of distractions to take our minds off the REAL problems

661
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:55,170
as the end times draw to their violent climax.

662
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:57,170
For instance, beware!

663
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:03,310
The fake God Junior, the anti-Bob, will come before long.

664
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:05,190
Bullets cannot stop him.

665
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:09,290
He's one of the deceptively human-looking advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures

666
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:10,870
from beneath the hollow Earth.

667
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:13,430
Parasites of the Elder Gods.

668
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:16,330
But most people will think he's the Second Coming.

669
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:21,750
And his alien hiney will be kissed all the way to world dictatorship and beyond.

670
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:25,090
And if the true Messiah were to show up at that time,

671
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:29,790
everyone would just know in the bottom of their core programming that he's the Antichrist.

672
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:32,650
Because you'll cuss and spit and take the Lord's name in vain,

673
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:38,110
and hang out with whores and bull-daggers and dope addicts and cops and other down-home sorts.

674
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:41,990
And when he's dead, and the real Antichrist has been unmasked as a fake,

675
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:46,290
they'll wail and gnash their teeth and all that, and still never admit what they did.

676
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:48,850
Warning! This is a warning!

677
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,790
Danger, danger, you poor devils!

678
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:54,310
Things are more mixed up than you would ever dream.

679
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:56,350
What was up is down.

680
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,390
The priorities are all screwy.

681
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:00,610
You're fretting if your hair looks okay,

682
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:05,550
while some new kind of bladder cancer is bursting out the front of your designer jeans.

683
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:07,990
Yes, this is all bad talk.

684
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:09,950
You won't listen to anything else.

685
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:14,970
You won't look at TV unless body parts or cars are jiggling or crashing on it.

686
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:18,510
You won't taste your food unless it has some nerve drug in it.

687
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:21,210
You haven't used your other senses since you were five,

688
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:23,830
and you sure as hell won't stop what you're doing.

689
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:31,190
Until someone much bigger, much stronger, and much, much more self-assured makes you stop.

690
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:33,090
And then you'll thank him for it.

691
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:37,090
And then just before you fry in a flash of radioactive hindsight,

692
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:41,030
you'll realize he stopped you from doing the wrong thing.

693
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:46,310
Good God! What in the name of sweet screaming Jesus is this world coming to?

694
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:48,570
People bitch, people gripe.

695
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:52,010
This is a sign of the end times. That's a sign of the end times.

696
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,270
When you should all be hollering,

697
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:55,810
it's all a sign of the end times.

698
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:28,490
There used to be more than one source for alternative rock and roll in Dallas, Fort Worth.

699
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:32,050
Now there is only one, the proud voice of the rockin' people.

700
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:38,950
KNON 90.9 FM Stereo in Dallas plays more alternative rock and roll music

701
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:41,930
than all the other radio stations in North Texas combined.

702
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:47,210
Monday night, Elmo, Latex, and Kelly bring you music from the hip.

703
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:51,330
Tuesday night, 7 till 9 PM, it's Tim Hibbs and Brave New Radio.

704
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:58,150
Tuesday night, late, 11 PM till midnight, Jeff Webb's Vital Hour puts the spotlight on a vital artist each week.

705
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:03,210
Wednesday night, 7 till 9 PM, Who Cares? with Charlie Dole Park and Al.

706
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:09,690
And Wednesday night, late, 11 PM till 2 AM, Mr. Jeff Liles brings it to you with Life is Hard.

707
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:15,150
Thursday night, 7 till 9 PM, Jeff Webb again with offbeat music.

708
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:20,350
Friday night, 7 till 9 PM, it's Ken Deak, Breeze Farley, and Paul Suffron,

709
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:22,270
bringing you music from the underground.

710
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:29,170
And Friday night, late, 1 till 4 AM, Anatomic and Oradry bring you radio lobotomy.

711
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:39,130
Then brand new Saturday afternoon, 2 till 5 PM, Rockstar George brings you a great show of interest to all young rockers.

712
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:44,430
Saturday night, 9 till midnight, Miss Shaggy herself brings you Pajama Party 3.

713
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:49,050
And then Saturday night, very late, from midnight till 2, Radio Freeboro.

714
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:54,930
And 2 till 4 AM, the only heavy metal show in the electroplex, Mr. Jerry Warden.

715
00:53:54,930 --> 00:54:02,330
All on KMON 90.9 FM Stereo, the home of alternative rock and roll.

716
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,630
If you didn't hear it here, it is where?

717
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:29,910
KMON 90.9 FM Stereo, the home of alternative rock and roll.

718
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:30,830
KMON 90.9 FM Stereo, the home of alternative rock and roll.

719
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:32,710
KMON 90.9 FM Stereo, the home of alternative rock and roll.

720
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:38,690
Repent, quit your job, and slack off, dear friends.

721
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:41,770
Let's face it, the end times are here.

722
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:44,090
The excess are coming.

723
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:47,130
The false prophets, the conspiracy,

724
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:51,930
will brown nose to their dinosaurian alien acids,

725
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:59,450
and this planet will be sold down the river just as sure as Lee Harvey Oswald's clone cashed the conspiracy's checks.

726
00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:04,370
We're one royal hair trigger from the wrath of Jehovah One.

727
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:10,210
His galactic finger is itchy, and he's not well pleased with what man hath wrought.

728
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:17,110
Repent then, and prepare for the age of tribulations, the time and halftime you think last winter was best.

729
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:19,590
Wait until the glaciers are at your driveway.

730
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:31,530
The earth shall shake, the sky shall fall, space junk, tornadoes, hail the size of Cadillacs, plutonium clouds the size of vampires, chromosome bending solar flares.

731
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:38,950
Orson Welles will get on the radio and say the Martians have landed, but this time he'll be telling the truth, and you won't believe him.

732
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:43,490
All photosynthesis in the seas will be stifled.

733
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:47,090
Ugly mutant lotus that carry DDT in their scythes.

734
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:47,650
Stings.

735
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:49,790
Famine even in California.

736
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:51,910
A dust bowl in Canada.

737
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:55,490
Microwave roach steaks for $5.99.

738
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:59,030
Drinking water you have to boil first and pay for.

739
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:00,690
Recombinant viruses.

740
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,050
Contagious cancers.

741
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:06,990
One day you'll go to the mirror like poor Bert did to pop a blemish,

742
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:11,710
and find your whole face cracking with each pinch like a rotten tomato.

743
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:14,130
Like something out of Poltergeist.

744
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,990
The plague, dear friends.

745
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:17,990
But these are only the natural things.

746
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:20,350
The acts of God or Satan.

747
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:24,350
They blanch in the face of man's deeds to come.

748
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:26,910
Man's self-dehumanization.

749
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:35,270
The government, my God, if we aren't careful the endarkenment of the next century will be marked by the rise of false over men.

750
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:37,410
Mean superior mutants.

751
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:38,270
Better than us.

752
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:40,070
Handsome like superheroes.

753
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,210
More muscular.

754
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:43,630
Brilliant like Shakespeare or Einstein.

755
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:45,030
But evil.

756
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:48,290
Of pink extraction rather than subgenius.

757
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:50,410
They can do everything better than we can.

758
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:58,690
Self-righteous, unclean, man-made supermen who will tread too far into the accursed forbidden sciences

759
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:09,050
and come back controlling time, but will be so hooked on it that they'll lead the stewing, broiling mass of humanity into a technological hell.

760
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:11,570
Time junkies, dear friends.

761
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:12,230
Lo!

762
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:17,990
A war with barbarian Martians over a worm we make nuclear beer with.

763
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:25,690
You must believe it all began in 1982 when all the planets, the Earth and the Sun lined up with the dog star Sirius, the Silver Star.

764
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:30,370
In 1998 it will draw the X's to us like flies to a dung dish.

765
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,650
Oh, they won't stay long.

766
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:35,630
They'll leave us after only two years, completely free to do as we please.

767
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:38,870
But their unnameable maggots will remain.

768
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:41,070
Diabolical caricatures.

769
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:42,070
Hideously silent.

770
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:42,730
Evasive.

771
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,310
But always with us.

772
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:48,910
We will be dogs to them in more ways than you can count.

773
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:50,790
Oh yes, it'll be bad.

774
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:53,550
Apocalypse is a mild term for it.

775
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:56,050
The Book of Revelation is an alien text.

776
00:57:56,370 --> 00:57:59,490
Those space monsters know what they're about to do to us.

777
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:01,050
They knew it 2,000 years ago.

778
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:09,990
But what they don't know any more than we do is what the prescriptures mean when they darkly refer to the rupture, the cosmic vortex calamity,

779
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,050
after the biblical day.

780
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:11,670
The biblical apocalypse.

781
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:14,630
And somehow a godzillion times worse.

782
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:15,750
Time intersection.

783
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:16,590
Omicron.

784
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:16,870
Epsilon.

785
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:19,010
The hallucinations are externalized.

786
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:19,970
Monsters from the id-

787
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:20,530
Don't laugh.

788
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:23,130
What do you think happened to the Elder Gods?

789
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:24,650
Yes, repent.

790
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:28,770
Repent and fornicate like your very life depended on it.

791
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:30,190
And it does.

792
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:35,030
Oh yes, dear friends.

793
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,450
Feels so good.

794
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:43,710
And there's the swinging love corpses come along to carry us out to the end.

795
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:46,390
Little, little bit more, uh, play.

796
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:48,030
Oh, what I'm just kidding about all that.

797
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:49,290
Don't forget what I was just saying.

798
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:55,070
It's just a bunch of, bunch of that silly subgenius, uh, uh, fake prophecy they get into.

799
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:56,270
Oh, don't worry.

800
00:58:56,430 --> 00:59:06,150
You won't be crawling to our P.O. box, uh, which number I'm about to give in 1998, begging for a membership at the last minute so you can get on board the escape saucers.

801
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:07,430
You won't be crawling.

802
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:14,290
You won't be crawling to P.O. box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214 looking for information.

803
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:16,090
No, no, no problem.

804
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:22,030
Well, listen, I want you all to hang on because of Ron Lindsey and Memory- down Memory Lane.

805
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:26,970
Hey, Ron, have you got a live, uh, you got some live music or-

806
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:31,030
Friends, you're gonna have to pray.

807
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:34,530
Pray for the, for the live music.

808
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:36,650
I thought I was gonna have a band in here.

809
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:37,410
And I don't.

810
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:38,870
I thought I was even gonna be healthy.

811
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:41,210
I ended up coming in with a horrible cold.

812
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:42,570
But I'm cured, friends!

813
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:44,590
Cured by the word of Bob!

814
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:47,390
Once again.

815
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:53,030
All right, we're gonna have to minister to Ron Lindsey here pretty soon.

816
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:59,470
Although I have a feeling, you know, once you sit down at the control booth, the power, the power just takes over.

817
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:05,470
And while you're fine until you get home and then you have a worse relapse than you ever dreamed.

818
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:07,890
Oh, praise Bob.

819
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:08,910
Or something.

820
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:13,950
Well, uh, dear friends, I'm gonna, I'm gonna let it get out here.

821
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:20,670
I need to find some sort of a, a, uh, oh, let's find some type here in the hour of slack box.

822
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:22,090
You want to hear the hour of slack box?

823
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:22,950
That's it.

824
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:23,830
That's the show.

825
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:28,050
Let's find some, uh, some suitable thing in here.

826
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:31,370
And we'll, we'll let Ron take over.

827
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:32,190
Praise Bob.

828
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:33,730
Help me some butter!

829
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:34,370
Oh, yeah.

830
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:35,450
Uh,

831
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:35,950
oh.

832
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:36,650


833
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:38,430
ah.

834
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:42,090
Oh,

835
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:42,910


836
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:44,590
What?

837
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:45,670
The.
