1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,860
Welcome to Difficult Listening Hour.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,840
SHOW ME, TELL ME, TELL ME!

3
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,600
And now, the subgenius.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,820
Oh, what?

5
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,480
Oh, God, it makes sense.

6
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,080
And it's so repulsive if...

7
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,580
Atomic batteries to power.

8
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,220
Reminds us of me.

9
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,280
You're ready to move us.

10
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,680
Ah, yes, dear friends.

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,400
Tonight's show would be Hour of Slack,

12
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,940
numbered FSC99,

13
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,780
but we're so far behind

14
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,060
and have been doing so many live devivals and things

15
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,580
that putting all that together

16
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:29,980
would be a waste of time.

17
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,420
It's going to have to be put off.

19
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,220
And so, to now,

20
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,040
to now, we're running Hour of Slack number 360,

21
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,540
the Pobucker special show

22
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,760
from around somewhere in 1991, I guess,

23
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,200
featuring the incredible prank call tapes

24
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,000
of Arnie and Barney to the late Benny.

25
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,960
I hear people talking bad about the way

26
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,900
they have to live here in this country.

27
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,640
Harping on the wars they fight,

28
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,620
laughing about the way things ought to be.

29
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,280
I don't mind them switching sides

30
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,100
and standing up for things they believe in.

31
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,980
When they're in the middle of the night,

32
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,300
they're running down a country man.

33
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,720
They're walking on the back and side of me.

34
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,200
Hello, I'm older.

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:39,960
Benny.

36
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,500
What?

37
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,860
I told you to quit bothering me.

38
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,860
Well, I want to ask you something.

39
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:43,320
What?

40
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,500
What's that big old green truck doing out there

41
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,460
in front of the showroom?

42
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,700
Well, right, that ain't none of your business either, is it?

43
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,960
You don't supposed to be parking on the street like that.

44
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,180
That ain't none of your business.

45
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,500
Don't worry about it, Captain.

46
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,100
Yeah, I'm older.

47
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,360
Benny, I'm going to tell the police

48
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,400
to have them move that old truck.

49
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,920
You tell them, and please do, will you?

50
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,180
Please, don't leave me.

51
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,160
How about the other...

52
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,000
Come see my new house this week, Ethan.

53
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,280
Ain't you got nothing else to do?

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,360
Come see my new house this week, Ethan.

55
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,300
Where's your new house at?

56
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,440
You lied to me the other day, too, about something.

57
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,100
What?

58
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,540
You said you had tomatoes out of your garden.

59
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
You ain't done it.

60
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,200
I have.

61
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,660
What'd you lie to me for?

62
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,580
This fruit stand's my garden.

63
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,640
Huh?

64
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
Fruit stand's my garden.

65
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,340
Well, you got one on me there, then.

66
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:28,980
Yeah, goodbye.

67
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:29,800
Benny?

68
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,400
How I'm older.

69
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,640
Benny, you said yesterday...

70
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,760
I asked you to go out there not to bother me.

71
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,900
I won't ask you something.

72
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,340
That's what you say every time you call.

73
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,700
You said yesterday...

74
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,220
No, it ain't none of your business.

75
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:41,920
It's both of us.

76
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,160
Well, Barney wanted me to keep an eye out for you.

77
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,420
What?

78
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,180
Barney was not just...

79
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,800
How I'm older.

80
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,120
Barney wanted me to look out...

81
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,000
Look, quit bothering me.

82
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,060
Listen, why don't you quit bothering me?

83
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,920
What are you going to eat today?

84
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,040
None of your business.

85
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,260
I saw you the other day out there across the hospital.

86
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,280
Cut the little cafe.

87
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,840
Yeah, well, why don't you let me know who you are and so forth?

88
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,180
You eat out there a lot.

89
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,300
None of your business.

90
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,800
Well, I saw you eating out there today.

91
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,520
Yeah.

92
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,920
I was just at the little cafe.

93
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,720
Listen, listen.

94
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,700
Now, why in the hell can't you leave me alone?

95
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,340
They got pretty good food in there.

96
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,580
I don't know.

97
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,760
Why don't you go try it?

98
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,700
Well, I've eaten in there a time or two, but it's been a long time ago.

99
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,400
Well, listen, quit bothering me, will you?

100
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,100
Benny?

101
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,920
I don't want to hear from you, and I don't give a damn about you.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,480
I want to tell you something.

103
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,160
What?

104
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:28,780
What?

105
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,220
I hope I can see you.

106
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,460
You shouldn't have been drinking a beer out there, Danny.

107
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,780
I hope I can see you.

108
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,920
You're not supposed to drink beer.

109
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,080
I drink beer when I get ready or anything else.

110
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,260
You don't want to drink beer.

111
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,980
I do whatever I damn please.

112
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,360
It's nobody's business of mine.

113
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,280
Boston.

114
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,720
Damn, the Boston, you too.

115
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,180
Well, I wouldn't want to see you get fired, Benny.

116
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,280
Tell me that I'm getting fired.

117
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,720
But Barney told me.

118
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,120
It ain't none of your business if I do.

119
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,060
I work when I please.

120
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,600
I don't have to work all the time.

121
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,120
Well, you drink beer every day at that.

122
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,140
No, hell no.

123
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,160
Well, you don't need to be drinking beer.

124
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,300
I don't need to be drinking beer.

125
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,680
I don't need to be drinking beer.

126
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't need to be drinking beer.

127
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,000


128
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,760
Oh, yes, dear friends.

129
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:16,620
Oh, I love to hear that recording of poor old Benny getting harassed by Arnie.

130
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,660
And we'll be hearing other excerpts from that famous tape.

131
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,120
Because tonight we're going to, on the hour of slack,

132
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,540
on this religious broadcast,

133
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,040
we'll be listening to some of the subgenius preaching

134
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,480
from the Subgenius World Convention in Chicago about three weeks ago.

135
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,840
But also tonight I thought we would indulge in a short study

136
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,740
in poebuckers through song and prank call.

137
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,760
The word poebucker may need some explaining to some of you people new.

138
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,540
To our religion.

139
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,640
A poebucker generally means a person with very low values.

140
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,580
Usually an ignorant type of person.

141
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,080
The common image is of a person in a pickup truck.

142
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:19,980
Or a person, the kind of person with a pickup truck up on blocks in their front yard for five years.

143
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:26,640
I mean, it doesn't always mean poor, but it just means trash.

144
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,760
Don't get me wrong.

145
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,040
I'm not saying anybody with a pickup truck.

146
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,620
You see, there's a lot of subgeniuses with pickup trucks.

147
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,000
There are many rich poebuckers for that matter.

148
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,180
A lot of subgeniuses are part poebucker.

149
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:48,100
I probably wouldn't talk the way I do if I wasn't that way somewhat myself, dear friends.

150
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,160
The term, actually, many people figured what it meant.

151
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,240
Oh, that means a subgenius who's poor in bucks.

152
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,240
It's not.

153
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,060
It's a term.

154
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:04,040
That's a corruption of an African language word, booker or bookra,

155
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,600
which meant boogeyman or demon.

156
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:17,160
And the African slaves brought to America, some of them called white people bookers or buckra.

157
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,080
And white trash, therefore, were called poor buckra or poebuckers,

158
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,640
which is how my dad's family used to pronounce it.

159
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,380
Mm-hmm.

160
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:37,440
And these famous telephone experiments would have to be a big part of any study of the rich texture of poebucker life.

161
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:47,020
The tapes of Arnie, his many calls to Benny, Benny Garrick, at Al White Motors.

162
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:55,800
Now, and Al White Motors is in Tallahoma, Tennessee, I believe, near Nashville.

163
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,080
And Benny was harassed by these calls for like three years.

164
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,580
And he recently died.

165
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,840
In fact, Benny died just in July.

166
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,880
We have a copy of his obituary from the newspaper.

167
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,720
Now, why would we know so much about the people on this prank call tape?

168
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,840
Well, we were that curious.

169
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,240
And one who was even more curious was your fellow subgenius minister.

170
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:37,200
And scientist, Reverend Lou Minotti, who recently moved to Nashville and discovered a lot about these prank calls.

171
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,820
For one thing, Arnie worked in the same building as Al White Motors.

172
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,660
In the Al White Motors building, he worked in the parts room.

173
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,340
And Benny worked in the showroom.

174
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,780
When Arnie was making these calls to Benny, he could see Benny.

175
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,620
And Benny knew.

176
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,800
He knew the person who was playing Arnie.

177
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,560
Arnie was one of several aliases.

178
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,320
Another one was Roscoe.

179
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,120
And the, it's just, I think we should get back into these tapes.

180
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,940
And I'll tell you a little bit more that's even more frightening about the incredible Arnie and Barney and Benny tapes.

181
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,680
After this message.

182
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,500
Friends between us.

183
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,900
This is not very far.

184
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,600
Oh Lord!

185
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,720
I'm giving my love to you.

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,760
Cause I only want to see you smile.

187
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,700
You've got nothing to lose but the failure to choose.

188
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,200
And you're turning into somebody you've been wanting.

189
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,760
Oh no!

190
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,040
You're a dog of bone.

191
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,600
Don't come thinking through the door.

192
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,780
You're one of the few us who's we will all let you go.

193
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,300
You're the big, the bold, the bold.

194
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:05,560
Oh!

195
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh!

196
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:14,280
Due to today's modern recording techniques, you may play these hits with true stereo reproduction.

197
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,240
Say hallelujah!

198
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,020
Seen it all on TV.

199
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,780
Lee Harvey got gunned down.

200
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,540
Murdered by Jack Ruby.

201
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,320
Ruby, the biggest sleaze in town.

202
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:36,860
He stuck that gun into his ribs and said, here's looking at you, kid.

203
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,900
Ruby killed Lee Harvey.

204
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,620
TV proved he did.

205
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,420
And the old lady was a friend of mine.

206
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,480
A very good friend.

207
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,520
Leave me alone.

208
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,040
How about it?

209
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,760
Danny?

210
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,240
Yeah?

211
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,260
Where's your car at?

212
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,180
None of your business.

213
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,860
You know it's raining this morning?

214
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,100
No, is it?

215
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,200
Sure is.

216
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,080
Well, I've been down.

217
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,920
I can't see that.

218
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,380
You can't see.

219
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,320
You have to tell me that.

220
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,020
I didn't know.

221
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,000
You knew it was raining.

222
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,060
No, I didn't know it.

223
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,100
Well, guess what happened?

224
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,660
Well, I don't care what happened.

225
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:12,920
What?

226
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,720
Mondale picked a woman for his running mate.

227
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,180
Who?

228
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,300
Mondale.

229
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,160
That's good.

230
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,640
He picked a woman for his running mate.

231
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,160
That's good.

232
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,100
Guess what else happened?

233
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:22,960
What?

234
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,380
The boss man went up on my house.

235
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,640
I'm going to have to move out.

236
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,400
Well, good.

237
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,660
I've been wondering.

238
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,120
Move out in the damn world.

239
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,940
I wondered if you could find me a place up there close to the fourth place I can rent.

240
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,960
Get out of the state.

241
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,820
Excuse me.

242
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,320
Goodbye.

243
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,040
Danny?

244
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,020
How about it?

245
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,640
Danny?

246
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,280
Why don't you leave me alone?

247
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:47,800
I'm busy.

248
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,660
Barnett said you used to have some rental money.

249
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,180
Leave me alone.

250
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:50,640
I'm busy.

251
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:50,920
Bye.

252
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,500
Bye.

253
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:58,620


254
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:58,860
Bye.

255
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,500
Bye.

256
00:11:59,500 --> 00:11:59,500


257
00:11:59,500 --> 00:11:59,500


258
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,160
Shoot up.

259
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,740
Kill them.

260
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,100
Bang.

261
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:01,880
Stab them.

262
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,280
Crush.

263
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,140
Slash.

264
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:03,600
Kill.

265
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,160
Eat.

266
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,700
Boil in oil with catapults.

267
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,440
Throwing rocks and grenades.

268
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,400
I say that I want to see knife cutting.

269
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,620
Slicing and chopping and cutting.

270
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,600
Blowing up.

271
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,000
Well, yeah.

272
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,940
You can kind of see it, man.

273
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,920
We're going to solve all these problems.

274
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,820
I say give our clubs and give our guns and give our knives and grenades.

275
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,520
Bazooka and tank anti-aircraft.

276
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,940
aircraft instructions. I say there's free instructions for everybody on karate,

277
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,900
sabotage, anarchism, everything there could be. I say there's free lessons from the time of year

278
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:41,580
two on how to do everything that is potentially to kill another person. There's no hope for

279
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:48,220
humanity anyway. I'm just going to watch the world end. We're going to make a million dollars.

280
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,000
I want to help! I want to help me!

281
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,840
Now what, Motors? Listen, buzzard breath, why don't you talk to me a minute? Why don't you go to hell?

282
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,720
What's my brother been telling me? Is that true? Well, listen, I don't even believe you got a brother.

283
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,980
You got... Well, he said he used to be lovers over here. Go ahead, go to hell.

284
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,660
Hello? Baby, what you talking about? What?

285
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,560
I work up next to the building for... Why don't you tell me you're on business?

286
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,920
Hey, Benny. What? Benny, I'm on the phone, too. I'm Arnie.

287
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,500
Well, I'm... I'm Arnie, too. I'm Arnie, Benny. Yeah.

288
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,620
We're all together. Good. Let's get together tonight, Benny. I can't. Why?

289
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,000
Because I said I can't. We'll have a good time. I'll do the cooking, Benny.

290
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,240
Yeah, you'll do what? I'll do the cooking.

291
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,940
I won't eat any of this. Oh, Benny, you'd like it if you ever got it.

292
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,240
You'll do it? Yeah.

293
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,500
Yeah. I wish you would do something.

294
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,300
You'll do something for me? What's that?

295
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,280
I wish you wouldn't worry my brother about his boy got killed over in Vietnam.

296
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,040
Well, I can't hear it, Benny. But he told me you aggravated him.

297
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,000
I wish you'd quit worrying me. We ain't trying to worry you.

298
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,520
Yes, you are, too. We won't be your friends.

299
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,780
Well, come on up down and meet me and let me see if I can be a friend to you.

300
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Well, I don't care to meet you, but Barney says he don't want nothing to do with you.

301
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,900
Well, I don't care. I don't want nothing to do with him, then.

302
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,620
Benny, you hit me in the head. You hit me in the head, Benny.

303
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,060
Well, you asked for it, didn't you? No, Benny, I was riding on my own business.

304
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,400
You told me you asked for it. You was asking my woman.

305
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,460
Oh, boo. Yeah, you was.

306
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,720
I know that's a lie.

307
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,480
But, Benny, it still hurts.

308
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,900
Well, I can't hit you.

309
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,160
Benny was bad after women back in them days.

310
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:35,980
I know it.

311
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,680
Back during Count Forrest's ducky.

312
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,580
Now, who are you?

313
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,280
Benny, you was like a little old rooster.

314
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,420
I asked you, who are you?

315
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,040
I'm Arnie.

316
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,700
I'm Barney.

317
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,240
Yeah?

318
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,720
I'm Arnie, and he's Barney.

319
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,500
Well, both of you.

320
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,360
And you're Benny.

321
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,460
Now, isn't that funny?

322
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,060
Isn't that funny?

323
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:53,440
Yeah.

324
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,160
I'm glad you get a kick out of that.

325
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,800
Oh, dear friends.

326
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,800
Just an amazing, unusually long segment there.

327
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,680
Although, after three years of calls like that,

328
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:16,120
Benny got to where he would get into long, sad discussions with Arnie.

329
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,920
Arnie started claiming to be Benny's son.

330
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,960
The bold surrealist, dear friends.

331
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,460
Arnie Swenson.

332
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,100
Praise Arnie Swenson.

333
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:37,620
Now, what makes the whole thing even more surreal is that everyone at Al White Motors

334
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,420
knew who was pestering Benny.

335
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,740
Everyone in town knew.

336
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,740
The DA knew.

337
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,760
The sheriff knew.

338
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,540
Everybody but Benny knew.

339
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,200
And people all over town served as Arnie's eyes.

340
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,100
They could follow.

341
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,480
They could.

342
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,140
Arnie could.

343
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,500
They could follow Benny around and know what he'd been doing at odd times of his life.

344
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,280
And just as Lois Lane never caught on about Clark Kent,

345
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,520
somehow Benny never made the connection.

346
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,880
Arnie did some spectacular things that aren't on tape.

347
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,680
At one point, he bought a broadcast microphone

348
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,720
and set Benny's radio, before he came into work,

349
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,760
to the frequency that that little mic would broadcast on.

350
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,960
And so when Benny sat down with his cup,

351
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,080
a cup of coffee and his cigarette,

352
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,740
to start the day,

353
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,380
he turned on the radio and there was Arnie going,

354
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,020
Benny!

355
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,940
Benny, how come you parked your green truck over there by the fire hydrant?

356
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,300
And Benny, Arnie could, as I said, could see Benny when this was going on.

357
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,240
And Benny, when he did that, just reached over and turned it off.

358
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:44,880
That was all.

359
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:50,040
He didn't express any surprise that Arnie had even invaded the airwaves.

360
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,740
Because at that point, friends,

361
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:52,960
uh,

362
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:52,960


363
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,160
let's see, uh,

364
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,400
there was this network of spies,

365
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,500
you see, who, for instance, uh,

366
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,240
Arnie would keep tabs on Benny's movement, it says here,

367
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,200
and would call him at the barber shop and the liquor store,

368
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,380
among other places.

369
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,420
Imagine, it would be as if,

370
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,180
well, as, as Lou explained to me,

371
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,600
this, this sort of like a crazed Andy of Mayberry scene.

372
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,220
It's like, what if Andy was secretly

373
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,660
tormenting Barney Fife?

374
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,420
And everyone in town knew about it.

375
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,480
Floyd knew about it.

376
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,280
Goober knew.

377
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,400
Everybody knew.

378
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,080
Everyone except Barney.

379
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,780
It was like everyone had an evil side.

380
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,000
Anyway, I got a letter from Lou,

381
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:42,380
who has some newly revealed background data pertinent to the Al White Motors saga.

382
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,400
And I know that many of my listeners wish they had this tape, but a lot of my listeners do have it.

383
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,200
It's, it was a pledge giveaway in years past, and I know that we're going to have to do it again.

384
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,200


385
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,200


386
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,740
We sent out dozens of them.

387
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,540
Uh, as Lou says here,

388
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:03,820
I have spoken to the individual at the firm who engaged in the protracted phone debate with Benny Garrick.

389
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,920
He actually spoke to Arnie.

390
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,580
I found him to be a warm-hearted, seemingly sincere soul,

391
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,600
who frankly spoke of his unique contribution to telephone research history.

392
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,440
Among the key findings,

393
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,780
Benny and Arnie were good friends before the calls commenced.

394
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,200
Before the calls commenced,

395
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,540
and even while the calls were going on,

396
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,920
Arnie and Benny used to go fishing together.

397
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,660
Arnie speaks favorably of Benny today in the wake of his passing,

398
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,760
though he does admit that Benny had a stubborn streak and disliked anyone getting the best of it.

399
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:43,420
Arnie would make his calls early in the morning when both began work at Al White Motors.

400
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,020
Arnie would usually knock off by late morning,

401
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:52,000
then immediately walk across the showroom and ask Benny who it was he'd been cussing out on the phone.

402
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,200
And he would say,

403
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,160
Can you imagine the gall to do that?

404
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,840
Approximately five hours of calls survive on tape.

405
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,120
We should be getting the complete series soon, but we won't play them all on this show.

406
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:13,800
Arnie reports that Garth Brooks, Clint Black, Chet Atkins, the governor of Tennessee, are among his fans.

407
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,500
Rumor has it that Senator Al Gore is a big Arnie fan as well.

408
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:25,440
And Clint Black tried to give a copy to George Bush several years ago.

409
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:34,800
Now imagine how much better the country would be now if those bold surrealists had indeed gotten through to them.

410
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,160
Dear friends.

411
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,960
A waitress asked me what we'd like to have.

412
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,220
And I said, I don't know really.

413
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,280
What would you suggest?

414
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,120
And she stood still.

415
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,100
She just kept staring at me.

416
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,700
And I started getting very nervous.

417
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:04,840
At the time, I had a beard and I lost a few pounds.

418
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:12,640
And I thought it would be very hard for anyone to recognize me.

419
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,180
This song is dedicated to Jesse Presley,

420
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,520
the aborted fetus twin brother of Elvis.

421
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,680
You can't arrest me, officer.

422
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,660
I'm not drunk.

423
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,700
I might be half-ass drunk though.

424
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,040
Whee!

425
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,080
The music is playing.

426
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,280
The music is playing.

427
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,180
The music is playing.

428
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,480
The music is playing.

429
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:39,800
The music is playing.

430
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,860
The music is playing.

431
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,900
The music is playing.

432
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,680
The music is playing.

433
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,480
Half-ass drunk.

434
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,320
Well, you know who you are.

435
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,800
When you gotta hang over,

436
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,440
and it's all hung over back,

437
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,460
so do your girlfriends carves.

438
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,540
Half-ass drunk.

439
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,180
Just you and me.

440
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,800
Sgt. Carter haircut, Gomer Pyle hookup, living off a LSD

441
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,160
Have a ass drunk, and I'm feeling blue

442
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,960
Well a flood come in and it washed away my den

443
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,020
And my water bill's still past due

444
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,340
Have a ass drunk

445
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,580
Called my boss, I ain't feeling quite right

446
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,500
Well it can't be Monday cause I don't remember Sunday

447
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,420
And my hands are sitting Saturday night

448
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,920
We love songs

449
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,520
Have a ass drunk

450
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,720
And I'm drunk yet

451
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,640
Well I used to have a job but I'm sick of getting robbed

452
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,680
So I finally do a band quit

453
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,040
Mama had a fit

454
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,560
Have a ass drunk

455
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,520
Now my head feels odd

456
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,360
Well baby needs food, but his daddy needs a lude

457
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,420
Well the baby better find himself a job

458
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,780
Have a ass drunk

459
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,380
Have a ass drunk

460
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,000
Have a ass drunk

461
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,700
Have a ass drunk

462
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:25,780
Have a ass drunk

463
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,200
Santa have a best thing to do

464
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,800
Sadly my house got broken so big

465
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,500
Santa rapper andRP-op

466
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,820
Have a ass drunk

467
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,820
I'm half-ass drunk and I'm having fun

468
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,740
Stopped on a hill cause I had to take a pill

469
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,720
But I couldn't quite find my tongue

470
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,800
Half-ass drunk, hell I can see

471
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,360
Well they said the light was red now a couple of folks

472
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:07,040
Well there was 22 mangled and there was one guy that was gimped up pretty good

473
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,820
He had to sort of walk like this for the rest of his life

474
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:14,120
And there was one guy, it was pretty neat, he was hurt pretty good I guess

475
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,900
They had like this machine that was like hooked up where he had this tube running up through his nose, you know

476
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,880
And that was the only way he could breathe

477
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,080
And well there was this one dude, it was like a blade he chopped straight down on his toes

478
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,060
And I heard he still couldn't walk

479
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,840
There was one guy, well this is what's weird

480
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,860
They found parts of him on the front of the car and other parts of him on the back of the same car

481
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:45,720
I mean it sort of defies the mind, doesn't it, how you could find pieces of the same person on the front and back of the same car

482
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,880
I mean it, I just don't understand, they ought to run some kind of scientific test

483
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,700
I don't even see how that could even happen

484
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,220
And a couple folks dead

485
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,700
Well it, well it sure looked green to me

486
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,260
Half-ass drunk

487
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,240
Hell I wish I was

488
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,360
Turned a brand new Trans Am into an old tin can

489
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,340
Trying to outrun the fuzz

490
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,460
Half-ass drunk

491
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,240
I'm a victim of lies

492
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,360
Well there's nothing wrong with me, your honor

493
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,700
I can see hell I got this

494
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,180
You damn de-dug your eyes

495
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,460
Half-ass drunk

496
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,200
Oh woe is me

497
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,020
Well I don't really pay, but it's steady every day

498
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,020
Breaking rocks till they're broke as me

499
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,480
Half-ass drunk

500
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,360
Hell I'm half-ass drunk

501
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,020
Lord I'm half-ass drunk

502
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,680
Just sorry, oh I'm half-ass drunk

503
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,200
Oh man, friends, that was Jane or Hypercleets

504
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:04,560
Doing half-ass drunk is part of our study of the world of the po-bucker

505
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,560
Here on the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack

506
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,640
Hello

507
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,840
Sherry?

508
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,160
Yeah

509
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,440
This is Tom

510
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:24,960
Listen, before it gets too late, I just thought I'd tell you to, uh, you know, not with anybody knowing

511
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,160
You sneak out

512
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,920
Sure

513
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,840
Who is that?

514
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,460
Sneak out your window tonight

515
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,620
When you ever call three o'clock?

516
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:35,820
Hello?

517
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,160
Hi, is, uh, Max in?

518
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,100
Uh, no, he's in bed, who is this?

519
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,740
This is Jerry Topher, uh, I'd like to talk with him for a minute, please

520
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,920
Oh, okay, just a minute

521
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,540
This is from another prank call tape called Calls to Okies

522
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,340
Yes, this is Max

523
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,120
Oh, hello?

524
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:03,820
Okay, Max, this is, uh, Jerry Topher, uh, HNA, uh, you're living over there on Westbrook, aren't you?

525
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,260
Yeah

526
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:11,020
Okay, uh, HNA, that's, uh, I know it's late, but I want to talk to you about your house a little bit

527
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,200
Okay

528
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,440
Yeah

529
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,020
So you're over there on Westbrook in that

530
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,480
Yeah

531
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,160
Well, that HNA is, is the Home Owners, uh, Neighborhood Association

532
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,320
Uh-huh

533
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,000
Okay, and we'd like to talk to you a little bit about your house, see?

534
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,580
Uh-huh

535
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,520
You know, there's little things like, uh, you know, parking a car on the street

536
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,200
Uh-huh

537
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,280
Uh, the lawn too long

538
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,200
Yeah

539
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,720
Uh, the trash can sitting out there, uh, you're gonna have to start picking them up, okay?

540
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:49,300
Well, I don't know, I back my trash cans up just when the drugs come along, I pick them up

541
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,340
Well, there's none of that except in that lawn, too

542
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,420
Uh-huh

543
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,980
Your lawn, it's, needs serious mowing, that's the problem, you know?

544
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,900
I think you got the wrong place

545
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,740
No, uh, you know, I just wanted to let you know that we want to have a nice atmosphere around here and you're gonna have to take better care of it

546
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:10,080
Well, I think you got the wrong place, cause my lawn doesn't, is not in bad shape

547
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:16,080
Well, you know, you just need to mow it a little bit more, you know, we're not too picky about it

548
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,940
Well, I keep my lawn mowed

549
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,640
Okay

550
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,180
I don't, you sure you got the right place?

551
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,580
Your Mac's so green, aren't you?

552
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:22,840
Right

553
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,040
Okay, 1214 Westbrook

554
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,520
1214 Westbrook

555
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,460
Well, you know, we don't want to, you know, you just

556
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,500
Where do you get a roof?

557
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,420
I'm right down here, about four doors down, they kinda elected me, uh, chairman of this here, so

558
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,160
Thought I'd give you a call and be real, you know, manly about it

559
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,700
1214 Westbrook

560
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,160
Cause, uh, it's getting out of hand, that Mac's

561
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,300
Well, what's, what's getting out of hand?

562
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:55,340
Well, you just need to take better care of your house and your, your things, you know, we got that

563
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,400
Stings

564
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,320
Huh?

565
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,720
It was stings

566
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,560
I didn't understand you

567
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:03,780
What'd you say?

568
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:09,060
I said you have to take better care of your, uh, possessions, you know, if you want to stay in this neighborhood

569
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,620
We'll blackball you, you never, you never get another house in this neighborhood again

570
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,660
So what, I don't, I thought my house looked as good as anybody else's on here

571
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,680
Well, you know, just

572
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,060
Consider this here a fair warning, we, we'll just, uh, give you a couple chances, you know, and then

573
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,640
Things don't work out, we'll make an arrangement for you, Mac's

574
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,360
Well, I own my home, I don't know how you made your name

575
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:43,220
Yeah, we, we ain't no small time organization, we take care of that

576
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:54,480
I don't wanna get into that, you know, that's, we don't even wanna talk about that, just take care of the lawn a little better, we'll check back with you and check the progress on that

577
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,680
What'd you say your name was?

578
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,100
My name's Jerry Tofer

579
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:00,740
Jerry?

580
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,360
Jerry Tofer

581
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,460
H-N-A, chairman

582
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,500
T-O, how do you spell it last name?

583
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,260
T-O-L-F-E-R

584
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:21,120
Now, we'll, we'll give you a call back here in about a month or so, and we'll, we'll talk to you later then

585
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,740
See you later, Mac's

586
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,280
Better beware, Mac's

587
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,620
I wanna tickle your love offerings

588
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,480
Sir?

589
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,960
I wanna tickle your love offerings

590
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,140
Hey, that's fantastic

591
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,880
Is it? I'm coming over too

592
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:35,600
Good!

593
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,440
I'm gonna bathe your entire family tonight

594
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,740
You're gonna what?

595
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,300
I'm gonna bathe your entire family tonight

596
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,140
How's that?

597
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,400
You know, in the tub with the sponges and the water

598
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,840
Well, you sound like just the right kind of guy

599
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,080
Hey, you betcha I'll do it too

600
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,020
You don't know us, we get drunk

601
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,500
We like to go canoeing and bathing

602
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,420
Well, I tell you what

603
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,900
I got a whole bunch of friends that do it exactly the same way

604
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,680
Well, maybe we can get together

605
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,480
Have one of them fleas he owes or something

606
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,980
Are you living in Cali-Paw?

607
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:12,720
Huh?

608
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,080
Are you living in Cali-Paw?

609
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,740
I could be

610
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,400
I wanna live in that canoe you got

611
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,180
Oh

612
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,200
Look pretty good

613
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,600
Cor barrier

614
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,560
Gotta put a, gotta anyhow

615
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,760
No African

616
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,220
I can't stand her

617
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,980
My girlfriend is a

618
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,140
What's up

619
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,580
¶¶

620
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:04,820
¶¶

621
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,520
¶¶

622
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,180
¶¶

623
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:32,500
¶¶

624
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,560
¶¶

625
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,240
Whoa, swinging love corpses.

626
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,880
They're live at the Chicago Subgenius Convention

627
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,860
with that lovely old hymn,

628
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,220
My Girlfriend is a Poe Bucker.

629
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,760
And we'll be playing more material from the subcon there.

630
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,040
You'll hear some Sister Mary Squared,

631
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,880
some Sister Velveteen Sly, actually.

632
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:19,020
I think we played most of Mary Squared's formal ranting,

633
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,020
but also some informal material

634
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,640
from the conspiracy panel discussion

635
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,460
with Mary Squared.

636
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,580
With G. Gordon Gordon

637
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:30,820
and those aforementioned lady preachers

638
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,200
and dominatrixes.

639
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,000
And, uh, yes.

640
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,880
Boy, we got a call.

641
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,500
We could tell a rumor on the air.

642
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,840
Ah, it would be so fun.

643
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,840
But I think we better be safe than sorry

644
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,220
because I would hate to have the Secret Service

645
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,260
call the station up and subpoena somebody,

646
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,240
make them go,

647
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,300
where'd you hear this?

648
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,360
You know, where was the leak?

649
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,780
Oh, well.

650
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,660
The eternal conundrum of Connie

651
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,160
as Cleavage Quinn.

652
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,400
Connie knows that a cucumber isn't better than a man

653
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,380
because cucumbers can't cry for clemency.

654
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,560
Oh, unbelievers,

655
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,140
that Connie can castrate and cripple.

656
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,580
Johnny comes and craters crash.

657
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,440
Crash.

658
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:24,460


659
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:24,460


660
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,100
And it's Kareem from Connie's

661
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,700
Connie's kiss cascades from her lips.

662
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,360
Lester Fern, leave a tip.

663
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,480
Yeah, Connie.

664
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,720
Can you confront the candle of Connie?

665
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,980
Now this chick, I'm a chick with a Y.

666
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:43,940
Of course.

667
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,160
This chick has to cruise.

668
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,260
But the chronicles of Connie will continue

669
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,480
as I keep on co-opting the conspiracy.

670
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,480
And cracking cliches.

671
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,960
Brian Connie, the ultimate con.

672
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,160
Praise Connie!

673
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:01,700
Hooray!

674
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,620
Hooray!

675
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:06,540
Hooray!

676
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:07,820
Hooray!

677
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,540
Oh, I love it!

678
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,460
I love all the Connie worshippers we have here.

679
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,340
Yes!

680
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,240
I don't know what Reverend Stang has been doing lately,

681
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,240
but I remember he used to talk about makeup of the church,

682
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,320
uh, being just, um,

683
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,460
Oh, I don't know.

684
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,840
A whole bunch of computer nerd types,

685
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,580
uh, people who just spend all their time indoors,

686
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,120
you know, never getting out of talking to women

687
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,140
or being friendly.

688
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,620
They just didn't know how to please the Connie.

689
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,460
And I'm so glad to see this new young crap of subgeniality.

690
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:45,380
Yes!

691
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,520
Wherever one or more are gathered together,

692
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,360
in the name of greed,

693
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,560
mean,

694
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,640
confusion,

695
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:57,820
control,

696
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,380
and censorship,

697
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,240
there is the conspiracy.

698
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,020
But I want to know,

699
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,440
all you out there,

700
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,900
after hearing all this stuff that should have got you riled up tonight,

701
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,820
how big is your hate on?

702
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,440
You know what's gonna happen?

703
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,340
In 30 years,

704
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,740
X day.

705
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,940
And our revenge will come on X day.

706
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,220
Our revenge will come because,

707
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,660
what's gonna happen to those pinks and those normals?

708
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,260
They're gonna go through the worst experience

709
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,860
of their entire lives.

710
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,420
They are going to be forced, all of a sudden,

711
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,220
to be obsessed with sex.

712
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,360
And enjoy it.

713
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,260
And Arabs are going to enjoy it.

714
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,120
But, you know what else they'll feel?

715
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,100
Because they're those pinks and those normals,

716
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,660
they will feel guilt.

717
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,540
They won't be able to help it.

718
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,460
You'll see those nice little ladies that you saw typing into Office.

719
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,260
They'll be like, ripping their clothes apart.

720
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:49,880
They can't help it.

721
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,160
They'll be like,

722
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,040
Oh my God!

723
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,740
I'm so horny!

724
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,960
This is so bad!

725
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,920
For weeks!

726
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:55,660
I must go.

727
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,260
I cannot.

728
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,780
For three!

729
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,940
And it'll seem like thousands of years!

730
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,440
That is what they will be doing on X day.

731
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,700
While we are up,

732
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:04,840
laughing,

733
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,460
Losing us-morty.

734
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,660
They will show up today.

735
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,700
Ah, yes dear friends.

736
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,160
Some, uh,

737
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,520
new prophecies about X day,

738
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,360
the end of the world,

739
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,920
as understood in our church.

740
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,140
The pinks will suddenly start having sex.

741
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:20,580
They'll be having fun,

742
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,000
but they'll feel so guilty,

743
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,160
it'll be like hell.

744
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,400
They'll be ravishing each other in those offices,

745
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,120
but they'll,

746
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,460
they'll hate it.

747
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,660
They won't be able to stop themselves,

748
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,400
but they'll hate it.

749
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,820
Speaking of X day,

750
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:40,100
Reverend Zaphod left a message on the church headquarters phone last night,

751
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,280
with the most outrageous request.

752
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,600
He said,

753
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,020
Can't you call Bob up and change the end of the world to,

754
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,760
like,

755
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,200
I mean,

756
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,920
you got it set up for 7 o'clock in the morning,

757
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,020
July 5th, 1998.

758
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,680
At 7 o'clock in the morning,

759
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,020
everybody's gonna be hung over.

760
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,920
It's gonna be horrible.

761
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,140
They're not gonna get up.

762
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,340
They'd rather burn with the pinks than get up in the morning,

763
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,040
get up that early in the morning.

764
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,300
So,

765
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,720
I'm sorry Reverend Zaphod,

766
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,480
but even if I did call Bob up about that,

767
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:13,460
somehow I don't think that the X's are going to change their schedule,

768
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,840
just because you don't wanna,

769
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,180
but the idea is you don't fall asleep the night before.

770
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,680
Okay?

771
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,820
You just stay up.

772
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,240
That way you don't have the hangover.

773
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,480
It'll,

774
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:23,920
of course,

775
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,720
sooner or later it's gonna catch up with you.

776
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,840
But,

777
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,080
you know,

778
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,240
I'm just sorry.

779
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:35,460
These godlike creatures from Planet X just are not gonna set their alarm clock.

780
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,120
They're not gonna be,

781
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,060
I mean,

782
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,180
you're just gonna have to put up with their wake up call.

783
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,000
All right?

784
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,380
I mean,

785
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,620
there's only so much that you can get for that 20 bucks.

786
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,040
I mean,

787
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,180
eternal salvation is a lot to ask right now.

788
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,180


789
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,180


790
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:48,300
I'm gonna be right there.

791
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,040
You oughta be satisfied with that.

792
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:50,960
Okay?

793
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,520
The difference is,

794
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,160
when a,

795
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,540
when a,

796
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,340
somebody in a,

797
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,020
when a pink,

798
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,460
a human sees something that shocks them,

799
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,540
they run away.

800
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,940
They don't like it.

801
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,100
When a subgenius sees something that shocks them,

802
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,740
that offends them,

803
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,740
they go,

804
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,240
what?

805
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:06,800
This is,

806
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,540
I'm shocked.

807
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,060
I'm offended.

808
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,640
I want to know more.

809
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,040
I want to know more.

810
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,540
If they still don't like it,

811
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,500
then they might lynch it.

812
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:17,780
But,

813
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,160
they're just gonna,

814
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,160


815
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,160


816
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,020
they're gonna lynch it.

817
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,500
But the,

818
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,000
but the,

819
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,840
that conspiracy,

820
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,880
that confederacy of dunces,

821
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,460
you know,

822
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,560
the horrifying thing is,

823
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,640
it's not that they're stupid.

824
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,640
The individual pink may be much more intelligent than a given subgenius,

825
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:33,900
because,

826
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,980
look at the word,

827
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,600
subgenius.

828
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,160
It's not the intelligence that counts,

829
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,120
it's what you do with it.

830
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:38,960
It's power,

831
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,980
common sense,

832
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,140
sense of humor,

833
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,500
and dollars and cents.

834
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,780
But yeah,

835
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,820
these pinks,

836
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,140
these,

837
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:48,140


838
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:48,140


839
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,300
these mindless bovine stereotypes,

840
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,420
and that's all they are,

841
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,700
they're walking stereotypes.

842
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:53,440
Come on.

843
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,480
Sometimes generic slurs do apply,

844
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,340
in the case of pinks.

845
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,040
This is Lee Edwards,

846
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,840
commonly known as the Christian con man,

847
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,020
because I have total confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ as my savior.

848
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,540
And now this,

849
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,920
this being my first album in Hawaii,

850
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,500
I want to dedicate this album new to you,

851
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,200
my loving wife,

852
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:22,000
for all the inspiration you have given me in life.

853
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,700
And they're choking on their captains on the squad.

854
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,040
Also happy to stretch Levi.

855
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,520
Etcetera.

856
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,740
I wonder,

857
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,420
wonder,

858
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,060
wonder,

859
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:34,700
wonder,

860
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,120
wonder,

861
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,920
wonder,

862
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,980
wonder,

863
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,120
wonder,

864
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,680
wonder,

865
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,100
wonder,

866
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:40,560
wonder,

867
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:40,720
wonder,

868
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:53,440
Squeeze your little finger, ease your little finger back.

869
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:59,600
You can change the world, whatever else is true.

870
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,640
You trust your little finger.

871
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:13,040
Just a single little finger can change the world.

872
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:21,640
Is that justice? Is that proper? I'm talking to you.

873
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:33,440
Life's so cruel. Why not end it all?

874
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,420
Oh, man.

875
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,940
Happy birthday.

876
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,620
Hey, G, thanks, man. I'm glad you went through all that trouble to write that for me.

877
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,000
Take a job!

878
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:47,400
And if you can't whoop it, go down.

879
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:47,840
Go down!

880
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,920
That's a lesser known slogan of Bob's.

881
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,920
No, go down is kind.

882
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,320
I just want to tell you, don't pay no attention to my brother.

883
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,620
I ain't no paying no attention to neither one of you.

884
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,540
He ain't got a good sense.

885
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,380
Yeah?

886
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,460
I don't want to pay no attention to him.

887
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,140
I wish y'all wouldn't be worrying me.

888
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:12,980
You can't mention my brother.

889
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,560
He's driving me crazy.

890
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,460
Oh, no!

891
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,020
Yeah, and I mean, now listen, I've been trying to be nice to you.

892
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,100
Oh, no!

893
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,040
He's driving me crazy since last week at Duke.

894
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,360
Well?

895
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,500
Don't call me no more, I said.

896
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,460
They're getting aggravated about it.

897
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,380
Don't pay no attention to my brother here.

898
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,080
Don't call me up there no more either.

899
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,300
They're getting peed off about it.

900
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:31,860
Who is?

901
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:32,980
The company.

902
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,000
Oh, is that right?

903
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:34,320
Yeah.

904
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,140
Well, they don't know who we are.

905
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,180
No, and I don't either.

906
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:38,800
Oh.

907
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,960
Well, I wish you wouldn't bring it up to my brother.

908
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,760
But his boy, he tears him all to pieces.

909
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,660
I ain't brought it up.

910
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,580
He starts crying.

911
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,680
I didn't bring it up.

912
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,660
He says you called.

913
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,280
I ain't done with it no more.

914
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,200
I ain't done brought it up to him.

915
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,520
Hell, you the one who's calling me.

916
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,060
He says you called him, but his brother's behind the...

917
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,900
Well, you know, the hour of slack really is made for those who tuned in by accident.

918
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:02,700
That's right.

919
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,280
Those who scanned the dial.

920
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,680
That's what the show is for.

921
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,960
Leave me alone, will you?

922
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:08,700
Leave me alone.

923
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,040
You've got a half-dreaded...

924
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:10,840
No, I haven't.

925
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,160
Don't call this number no more.

926
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,160
What's wrong with your car?

927
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,800
Now, I've noticed.

928
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,840
The authority told me you had some rental property.

929
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,660
Have you got anything else to do?

930
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,820
As long as I can sit and visualize world peace.

931
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,700
Boy, that's better than folk.

932
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,500
Boy, that's better.

933
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,700
Because it's magic.

934
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,400
And think of the ant.

935
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,760
Oh, the ones you poison and step on.

936
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,860
They have rights, too.

937
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,200
Think of the lice that inhabit people.

938
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,800
They have rights, too.

939
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,420
What about the bees?

940
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,260
What about the bees?

941
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,260
That's right.

942
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,140
Nature is a good thing.

943
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,140


944
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,140


945
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,140


946
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,140


947
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,140


948
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,140


949
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,140


950
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,140


951
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,140


952
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,740
Nature is an open ditch latrine in mid-summer.

953
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,900
Do not deny your evolutionary destiny.

954
00:42:53,340 --> 00:43:00,120
Which involves lots more sweating and being stinky and killing and stuff like that.

955
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,800
And frapping.

956
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,540
We try to keep the killing down and the frapping up.

957
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,040
That's right.

958
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,580
But realize if you can visualize the nuclear winter, you can save in your air conditioning

959
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:07,940
bills.

960
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,160
If you believe.

961
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,140
But only if you believe.

962
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,880
And nuclear winter sports.

963
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,380
The nuclear winter olympics.

964
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,700
If you believe in the winter, it's hot and it's cool.

965
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,820
He's going down the slope now.

966
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,200
Look, his hair blowing off in little tufts in the breeze.

967
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,820
Chunks of radiated flesh flying out.

968
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,660
It's so poetic.

969
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,100
Dangerous sex on skis.

970
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,460
Backwards.

971
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:37,960
But you see, the things like abortion and pro-life and contra-life, or whatever you

972
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,040
want to put it, those are all issues that have been designed to keep you busy.

973
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:42,120
And I think we need to do that.

974
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,120


975
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,120


976
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,120


977
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,120


978
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,120


979
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,120


980
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,120


981
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,760
To keep you stirred up.

982
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,880
To keep you worrying about this and keep you worrying about that.

983
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:52,640
The war on drugs has eroded your civil liberties to the point where they can kick your door

984
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,280
in any time they want to.

985
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,960
All they've got to do is say drugs and your wife is in jail.

986
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:58,840
You're in jail.

987
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,140
Your children are far back.

988
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,260
Your Cadillac's taken away.

989
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,320
Your Cadillac's taken away.

990
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,660
They can walk up to you in any airport in the United States of America and say, excuse

991
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,140
me, did you pay for that ticket in cash?

992
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,100
Yes, I did.

993
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,780
Can we see your wallet, please?

994
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:14,460
Here it is.

995
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,500
Sir, you have cash money on you.

996
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:21,720
We're going to have to confiscate it because you fit the profile of someone going somewhere

997
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,460
probably to buy drugs.

998
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:26,460
This exists right now.

999
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:34,040
The war on drugs is probably the single most divisive and single-minded effort to erode

1000
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:40,300
every little bit of freedom that we've managed to wring out of these sons of bitches in the

1001
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,120
last 200 years.

1002
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:48,400
We've spent 200 years trying to spread that we the people to include someone else besides

1003
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,340
landowning aristocracy.

1004
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:54,780
And now that we're finally beginning to do that, they're going over to the other end

1005
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,820
of the Constitution and gradually saying, you don't have the right to do this.

1006
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,700
You don't have the right to do that.

1007
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,060
Everything that is not forbidden is prescribed.

1008
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,300
And if you don't watch it, we're going to get you.

1009
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,760
And that's what you've got to remember.

1010
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,920
Nobody up there is a friend of yours.

1011
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,480
Nobody up there wants to see you have what you would call freedom.

1012
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:20,340
The whole purpose of this government in this country right now is to produce consumers

1013
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:27,140
and workers who will keep the cost of labor down, the profits high for the earning people.

1014
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,460
I'm not a communist or anything like that.

1015
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,360
I'm just simply saying that if you believe that any of these people that are running

1016
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:38,200
for office are going to do anything for you as a subgenius, if you believe any of these

1017
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,900
people who proclaim to be on the side of the people who are running for office are going

1018
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,800
to be on the side of liberty and freedom, give us what you want, then you have bought

1019
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,140
the conspiracy lie.

1020
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,080
Fascism back for the people!

1021
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:50,080
Fascism for the people!

1022
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,960
Subgenius Church is behind people's fascism!

1023
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,280
The individual fascism!

1024
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,780
Don't visualize world peace, visualize armed insurrection.

1025
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,340
Every dad a duche.

1026
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:04,440
That's right.

1027
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,700
Every mom an evita.

1028
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:10,160
So what are you guys going to do at this revival meeting?

1029
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:10,760
You're going to...

1030
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,060
Make fun of religion stuff, right?

1031
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,640
We never make fun of religion.

1032
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,140
Never make fun.

1033
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:15,860
Make money.

1034
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,720
You must understand we're making money off religion, but not fun off religion.

1035
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,340
No.

1036
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:19,760
No.

1037
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,480
No fun.

1038
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,220
No fun.

1039
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,580
We hope to erase the slack area in this part of the country.

1040
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,260
We are missionaries.

1041
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,120
This is hard work.

1042
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,760
It's brutal and gruesome work.

1043
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,540
And hopefully...

1044
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,100
I've loomed the position.

1045
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,020
Yes, sir.

1046
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,140
These are called cribbage crotch figurines and they're wanted in every home across America.

1047
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,760
Cribbage crotch figurines.

1048
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,580
That's right, young man, and you've won one.

1049
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,900
Oh, when do I get it?

1050
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,580
Well, as soon as you sign out the...

1051
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,100
The jewel form for the lettuce leaf kids.

1052
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:43,920
At Jewelco.

1053
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,360
At where?

1054
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:50,480
We have to put up with these guys because they know the right people.

1055
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,740
But you can trust me, Ivan Sting.

1056
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,460
Yes, you can trust me.

1057
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,500
I'm Dr. Ivan Sting.

1058
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,940
And I'm prepared to take your money and give you back your slack.

1059
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:07,320
And I'll be at the revival, the great subgenius revival on the 20th and the 21st at the Victoria

1060
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,000
Theatre.

1061
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,060
So you can believe in me.

1062
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,560
I'm Ivan Sting.

1063
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:10,560


1064
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:10,560


1065
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,680
I'm the man who's always saying, I never lie and I'm always right.

1066
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:18,580
It extends throughout the rules and has to do with the dying of Bolivians.

1067
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,340
It has to do with glass canes.

1068
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,760
It has to do with the Pummeling of Heavens.

1069
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,020
It has to do with Gilligan's Island.

1070
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,660
It has to do with...

1071
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,580
You go ahead, you son of a bitch.

1072
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,760
You're so sick minded.

1073
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,460
Why don't you meet me?

1074
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,980
I'm going to show you what sick human beings deserve in this world.

1075
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,780
Yeah, what do we deserve, my friend?

1076
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:38,960
We deserve your wife's swampy.

1077
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,480
Yeah, how would you like to be mutilated?

1078
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:40,560


1079
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:40,560


1080
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:40,560


1081
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:40,560


1082
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:40,560


1083
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,800
I don't believe you, you sleazy, slimy, dripping...

1084
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,240
Hold it down!

1085
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,240
I'm talking.

1086
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,380
Okay.

1087
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:52,640
I have gone low on you today.

1088
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,940
Do you think I don't know what the hell is going on?

1089
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:03,280
Do you think, for instance, that I don't know that Bill Broden is going out seeing Irene,

1090
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,640
Irene Hargreeves?

1091
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,080
Yeah.

1092
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,040
The Bolivians have been there?

1093
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,240
Sure I know it.

1094
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:09,860
Don't you?

1095
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:10,540
What is it?

1096
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:10,540


1097
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:10,540


1098
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:10,540


1099
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:10,540


1100
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:10,540


1101
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:10,540


1102
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:10,540


1103
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:10,540


1104
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:10,540


1105
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:10,540


1106
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:10,540


1107
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:10,540


1108
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:11,680
What the hell's the matter with you?

1109
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,780
Why you yell a rat bastard, you mother...

1110
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,340
You know, fire.

1111
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,640
You come once or twice a year.

1112
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,760
That don't cut no ass with me.

1113
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,320
See?

1114
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,880
My ass, I'll tell you.

1115
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,640
I'm gonna get on some asses today.

1116
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:29,580
You listen.

1117
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,800
I mean business.

1118
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,980
I'm putting it down, isn't I?

1119
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,660
There's no way it means that I ain't wanting any.

1120
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,440
No.

1121
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,180
Hell, father.

1122
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,640
Hell, father.

1123
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:42,920
All right.

1124
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,260
Okay.

1125
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,000
There's something else, too.

1126
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,340
I noticed last Sunday

1127
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:52,280
that one of you put a quarter

1128
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,280
in my offering plate, see?

1129
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,080
Yeah, Raymond Welch.

1130
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,320
You're the one.

1131
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,900
You put a quarter in there.

1132
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,740
You tight son of a...

1133
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,900
I see all that, see?

1134
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,780
I'm up here right and see it.

1135
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,560
Y'all don't...

1136
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,460
Even...

1137
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:11,660
I don't look or nothing.

1138
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,260
I can see it.

1139
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:13,500
See?

1140
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,380
Some of you are doing pretty good.

1141
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,360
And others, you ain't doing for...

1142
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,540
All right.

1143
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,520
I'm gonna maybe go to another church.

1144
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:24,400
I don't know.

1145
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,600
I don't give a...

1146
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,120
I've just about come to the end of the road.

1147
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:31,540
Here, I've just about lost patience with you people.

1148
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:36,120
You know we need a Sunday school space out there.

1149
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,480
You say, oh, amen.

1150
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,980
Praise the Lord.

1151
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:40,260
No.

1152
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:40,600
You know, I'm not gonna do all that

1153
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,780
when I'm saying something that you like.

1154
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,260
But when I'm trying to get something done,

1155
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,500
that's something else.

1156
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,160
You get your ass out to the mountains

1157
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,640
or someplace or hide in there

1158
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,700
and watch that damn tube.

1159
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,140
That's what you do.

1160
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,460
Listen, that ain't gonna get it.

1161
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,480
The horse and the horses,

1162
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,360
it ain't gonna do it.

1163
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,140
Uh-uh.

1164
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,940
Now listen, I tell you,

1165
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,960
this was determined today.

1166
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,460
I know...

1167
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:10,680
I know you're in doubt

1168
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:14,440
whether I will be your pastor or not.

1169
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,400
But I tell you, if so, fine.

1170
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,600
That's what I want to do.

1171
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,020
But if not, I'm done.

1172
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,720
In fact, my sermon is done.

1173
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,780
Don't give me no more.

1174
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,620
Brother Woodrow,

1175
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,340
lead us in the closing prayer.

1176
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,200
Whether you gonna do it or not,

1177
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,320
I'm assuming...

1178
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,520
You're dismissed.

1179
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,620
How come you hit my brother so hard back here

1180
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:45,540
to go to that old state?

1181
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:46,360
Well, I don't know.

1182
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,120
I told you to do it.

1183
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:48,640
I'm Arnie.

1184
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:49,460
You hit my brother.

1185
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,080
Oh, I did.

1186
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:50,760
Fair enough.

1187
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,000
Well, he said it deserved it.

1188
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,540
He said you knocked him loose in his shoestrings.

1189
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:56,280
I did.

1190
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,000
You hit him so hard.

1191
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:57,680
Well, that's good.

1192
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,200
I'll do it.

1193
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,520
I'm gonna hit him harder than that next time

1194
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,300
if I ever get a chance to.

1195
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,620
This is potentially five and a half hours of calls.

1196
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,220
This will test whether you're hardcore or not.

1197
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,300
Yeah, yeah.

1198
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,300
But I can truthfully say

1199
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,160
that these calls probably mean more to me

1200
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,560
than any other calls I've ever heard,

1201
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,900
including ones that I've been somewhat involved in.

1202
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,980
These are, I think, the great...

1203
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,580
In fact, speaking of folklore,

1204
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:22,540
he actually...

1205
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:23,900
Somebody tried to contact Arnie

1206
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,420
from the University of Virginia

1207
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,980
that was doing a folklore project.

1208
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,240
They wanted to talk to him.

1209
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,080
It's an example of southern folklore.

1210
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:31,780
Wow.

1211
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,760
Hey, so what is Arnie like?

1212
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Very interesting.

1213
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,020
He's kind of like a Mayberry character.

1214
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:39,800
He's alike.

1215
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:40,280
He's on something else.

1216
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:40,280


1217
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:40,280


1218
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,260
He's like a likable guy.

1219
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,820
In fact, the weekend that I called him,

1220
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,440
he was parking cars on his lawn for the county fair.

1221
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,540
He's just a working guy

1222
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,020
that works in the parts department.

1223
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,600
He was friends with Benny for years.

1224
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,500
He says that Benny was his friend.

1225
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,640
He was a good guy.

1226
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,260
Used to go fishing together.

1227
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,600
He was just like what you would call a poe-bucker,

1228
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,040
a bored poe-bucker

1229
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,140
who had been a prankster for years,

1230
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,000
but this was the first telephone prank he had engaged in.

1231
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,620
And he says he meant no malice from it.

1232
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,260
He meant no...

1233
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:10,440
He meant no harm.

1234
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:14,080
But interestingly, he told me why the calls ended.

1235
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,200
Benny got a brain aneurysm.

1236
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,440
He gets his own church out.

1237
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,840
Yeah, well, it's cold out here.

1238
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,380
Cold and lonely.

1239
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:30,040
Nobody can understand what's going on

1240
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,560
until the effects are turned down

1241
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,560
and your brain's turned up

1242
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,940
because it's 4.35 in the morning

1243
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,080
and the president's inside your head.

1244
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:37,960
I know.

1245
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:38,620
What happened?

1246
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,940
But it's so quiet here in the station.

1247
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,540
We're picking up dead vibrations.

1248
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,440
Here's to dead vibrations.

1249
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,360
Dear friends,

1250
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:57,860
so the KPFA show fades off into their dawn

1251
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,740
there in Berkeley, California.

1252
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,120
We don't have to worry about that dawn

1253
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,040
for it's the dawn of a new age here

1254
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,980
at the Dallas Subgenius.

1255
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,320
Hour of Slack.

1256
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:14,380
And dear friends, I feel that I should give you a chance

1257
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,760
to write for free information

1258
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,820
about the Church of the Subgenius.

1259
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,920
If this is the first time you've ever tuned in

1260
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,720
and listened to this show,

1261
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,740
well, there's a lot of other things involved

1262
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,540
in our faith here

1263
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,260
besides prank calls

1264
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:35,420
and seditious ranting about sexual freedom

1265
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,680
and how bad the normal people are.

1266
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,000
And you can get that free information,

1267
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,920
by dropping us a self-addressed stamped envelope.

1268
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,860
It would be the best thing you could,

1269
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,060
just send us a postcard.

1270
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:47,400
Shoot.

1271
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,860
You'll get a lot more with the self-addressed stamped envelope.

1272
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,240
And the place to send that is, of course,

1273
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,800
Bob at Post Office Box.

1274
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:07,300
807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1275
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,240
You know, my Sunday night just doesn't seem complete.

1276
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:10,240


1277
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,480
Unless I say that twice.

1278
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,620
That's Bob at Post Office Box.

1279
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:20,640
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1280
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,100
I am through.

1281
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,980
In fact, my sermon is through.

1282
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:34,420
Will, you wanna lead us in the closing head-launching?

1283
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:38,120
Well, are you gonna do it or what?

1284
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:38,780
Oh!

1285
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,520
Oh!

1286
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,280
Oh, one last thing.

1287
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,060
Enough!

1288
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:41,800
Oh yeah!

1289
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,380
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1290
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:44,700
Oh yeah!

1291
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:46,360
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1292
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,260
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1293
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,420
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1294
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,440
Hee hee hee hee hee hee!

1295
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,860
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1296
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,320
Come on baby, don't you be late.

1297
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,320
I want your old head, I want it tonight.

1298
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,580
Cut your old head off,

1299
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,880
a hot pass ain't it?

1300
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,360
Now have you know my wall,

1301
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,960
but a hot pass did, yeah!

1302
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,740
Come on baby, I want that head.

1303
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,880
Come on baby, you want that head.

1304
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:22,580
I want your old head to hang on my wall tonight.

1305
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:28,920
My sun!

1306
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,280
My sand!

1307
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,660
My surf!

1308
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,260
Oh!

1309
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,180
Oh!

1310
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:46,600
Go a first round!

1311
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,620

00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,440
Ah, ho!

1315
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,520
Hey!

1316
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:08,460
Bonus!

1317
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:08,560

1318
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:08,560


1319
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,000
Come on!

1320
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:27,740
That's a real broken man!

1321
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,360
Well, it's hard.

1322
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,080
Well, it's cool.

1323
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:54,560
Whoa.

1324
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:58,640
Before I go too much further into this tape, which ain't going to be far because we've

1325
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:03,800
only got about one minute left, I should mention that I don't know who sent us this tape.

1326
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,780
Boy, people send us such wonderful tapes and then they don't put their own name on it.

1327
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:14,360
This says, look out Miami and list the 10 zillion cuts of music and records that were

1328
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:14,680
on it.

1329
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:19,500
But I can't remember which envelope it came out of.

1330
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,020
If anybody knows, tell us.

1331
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,880
Let's have another drink.

1332
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,260
Oh, stop it.

1333
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,260
You're killing me.

1334
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:35,540
Gee, it makes me feel much better just talking to you.

1335
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,680
Anytime, baby.

1336
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,080
Every time.

1337
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:39,600
Whoa.

1338
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:40,460
Whoa.

1339
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,020
Whoa.

1340
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:41,980
Whoa.

1341
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:42,440
Whoa.

1342
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:42,460
Whoa.

1343
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:42,900
Whoa.

1344
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:43,600
Whoa.

1345
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,340
Whoa.

1346
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,100
I'll play it and tell you what it is later.

1347
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:27,940
I'll play it and tell you what it is later.

1348
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:30,680
Sing that Billy Sweet William now

1349
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,500
Married life done changed him somehow

1350
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,480
He's the man the town used to fear

1351
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,400
Now they all call him Sweet Papa Willie dear

1352
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,720
Stronger than Samson I declare

1353
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,640
Till the brown-skinned woman's bobbed his hair

1354
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:51,920
Excuse me

1355
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:02,520
No wearing out my twa-da-bee
