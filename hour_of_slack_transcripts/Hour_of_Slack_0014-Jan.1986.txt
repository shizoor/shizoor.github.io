Well, that about wraps it up for the American Music Party this week.
I'm Robert Wisdom, and you've been listening to the American Music Party,
blues from the 80s.
I'd like to leave you with these words from the immortal,
mad lad, Reuben T. Washington.
Good blues to you where I'll doggone you.
Yeah.
Oh, praise Bob, dear friends.
Yes, well, folks, I'm afraid you'll have to say goodnight to the good music
for a little while, for the next hour anyway.
Probably for a while, because Norm comes in after us,
and he hadn't been playing a whole lot of music.
This is the subgenius family hour tonight, folks.
Yes, tonight, as not promised, is the subgenius hour of slack sounding.
It's the sound effects special, The Kids Show,
starring Negative Land and that great adventure team,
Captain Sun, Sunson, and Daddy.
So, go wake up your kids.
Or you can tape this thing, but if you do, get it in stereo.
And use headphones.
This is the headphones show, the headphones show.
Before I go on, I hope these machines work.
Before I go on,
I must publicly thank the Smith Zombies.
There were a number of Smith Zombies in the industrial laboratory
all night tonight,
putting stamps on little pamphlets that are going to China this time.
Subgenius pamphlets.
We'll give our address at the end of the broadcast
where you can write for one of these
heartbreaking and blessing new pamphlets.
But, by the way, for those who've asked,
we've been getting letters from as far away as Nebraska,
seriously.
I don't know how they get this show up there,
but they do, somehow.
They've been wondering, where's Buck?
And Buck is not off the show, but he was off of this city,
if not this planet.
I don't think he wants to be a host, though.
He said he just mainly wanted to be a guest.
He has to go to work in the morning.
I'm sure he's tired of me and all my tape decks doing all the talking.
But, I've got seniority.
Hehehe.
And more tape decks.
And he does.
And, well, everybody in the Subgenius church is mad at me now,
so I had to get a new co-host for the show.
He's only six years old, so we had to change the format just a little.
Let's see if we can get cassette number two going here.
What's up, Sandy?
Tell them this is KNON 90.9 FM.
This is the new co-host.
This is KNON 90.9 FM.

This is Doug Smith, radio operator.
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.
I am Buck Nuggets!
No troubles.
Hey, man.
The corny.
Everything is perfect.




















And now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage to the moon.
Stop right there.
Intensifying our prospects' desires, that's when the wheels of action begin to move.
Sorry for jumping in, doctors. Go on.
Dr. Dobbs is known worldwide as a foremost spokesman for Christian and family values.
He's a plan to attend this rare personal appearance of Dr. Dobbs to second in the past four years.
Even if you never intend to write your name again, one sure way to impress folks is to stay a little bit over their heads.
Because it was better than looking stupid.
It's natural that we followed the circle around and around and around.
Helping to create a nice round world of confusion and misunderstanding.
Resist the temptation to feed your ego.
Well, we take our initiates and we string a little tendon between their heels and drag them three times around the radio station before beginning.
Then we dip them in the sacred waters of the sludge.
And what exactly does this do for them?
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned and prepares their mind for the slate-like impression, the imprinting of the true subgenius.
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour.
Hour of Slut.
Slut.

The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.
Every time you say, see, hear, or think...
That's your key phrase.
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.
Repent. Quit your job. Slack off.
Ah, yes, dear friends.
Well, for once, I took my own advice, which is rare for a subgenius preacher, especially me.
I did repent, quit my job, and slack off.
I actually did that this weekend.
As for not taking my own advice, usually, as Bob Dobbs himself said,
I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of man I'm preaching to.
This line from Prescriptures is, in fact, one of the foundation stones of the Church of the Subgenius.
Hypocrisy is the sandy beach upon which our church is built.
And other churches may be built upon a rock, steadfast and true,
but ours changes with the tides, scurrying in and out of holes like a crab,
occasionally pinching innocent bathers, and finally, in the end, getting skewered by kids with sticks.
But, uh, it's true.
Oh, sire, there is no more money?
Yeah, that's right.
Get some money!
I did repent, quit my job, and slack off.
I didn't really have a job to begin with before I quit it.
I quit before it started, and you can't beat that.
So I've been slacking off, and pretty soon I'm going to have to get a job.
One that doesn't last long, I hope.
I only last about as long as it takes to get a ten-minute film to the lab,
and then I just run out of gas until you put another quarter in.
So, uh, if you need, friends, uh,
a freelance film or videotape cutter,
a clay animator, weird comedy show producer, magazine editor, business writer, babysitter, baby sacrificer,
or a true, ordained mad prophet of the airwaves,
or, or just an all-around cool guy, friends,
just write me at the Church of the Subgenius or this affiliate station, which we own.
And, uh, no jobs on spec.
Um, my, my.
If, friends, if I don't get a job pretty soon,
uh, I'm going to have to start cashing in all those souls that are stacking up around the church headquarters.
We, we store the souls of those who send a dollar to the church in handsome blue cylinders in the tabernacle basement.
We keep these souls on ice until such time as they can be liberated from this earthly plane.
But if the church goes broke, friends, why, we have to cash in some of those souls, and one of them might be yours.
So,
neither will, you or us can get them back after that.
I don't know where they go after Bob sells them, and I don't ask.
So, you can tell by the way I'm talking that I'd be a dedicated worker in whatever job you want, might want to give me.
It's,
I love having a show.
It's great.
You can use your own religious broadcast for job hunting.
Oh, yes, but it's better than using the telephone, because I get to do all the talking.
Praise Bob.
Oh, yes, help me somebody.
Ain't got no leg, my legs are on fire.
Pull the lever down.
You go.

Well, friends, on with the show.
It's a good thing that this entire show is composed of one tape and one negative land record, because one of these tape decks does not work tonight.
Thank you.
Driven to the brink of false sanity by the conspiracy's false reality and the pressure of a crumbling world?
Then this may be for you.
Eternal Salvation.

Oh, Dr. Svoboda.
Let's do this.
My name is Reverend Ivan Stang.
I am the last sole survivor of the Battle of Dobstown, popularly called Bob's Last Stand.
I knowed J.R. Bob Dobbs for what he was, and I knowed the subgeniuses for what they was.
Turn that thing on.
Put on them headphones.
One hundred and eleven years ago, when I was 33 years old, right after the atomic wars,
my church was rubbed out by a band of wild pink boys.
Only ones left were my son and me.
My son, Captain Bob.
Captain, son, son, son.
Well, they say the monsters have come back to this, to the lost land of Palenka, dear.
Is the spaceship locked?
Oh, there it is.
Drop your life support system in there.
We won't be needing it.
It's too dangerous.
The show won't be in danger.
Unless the monsters get the tape.
Maybe we could stop the monsters.
You think we could use the show to stop the monsters?
Yeah.
If it sounded bad enough, even the monsters would flee.
And the land would again be safe.
For the free.
Friends, we're walking out of the laboratories.
Out of...
I don't want to go in any direction that ink will be coming from.
Uh-uh.
We've got to avoid ink.
And the Yaka Teasman.
We're going to have to fight a lot of monsters on this show tonight.
Right now, we're not live.
This is in the daytime.
And now that we're away from the encampment and the laboratories,
there are bones of creatures, Martian goats and things that have been killed by the Cyclops
and by other nefarious monsters around here.
What?
What could have done that?
Nothing could have been living in there.
Something could be living in there now.
It's a telephone.
Stick a torch.
Okay.
We're going to have to get out of here.

Come on.
Look!
Look!
Look at what's running out!
Crab creatures!
Grab a weapon!
Crab creatures are coming!
Hey!
Don't forget the show!
Come on!
Grab it!
You stopped them for a second.
They're still coming though.
We've got to do something else.
Turn on the radio!
Huh?
Turn on the radio!
Okay, that'll do it.
We'll turn on the radio.
I can't get it to come on.
You do it.
Okay.
Now, what's the button?
It's a button.






It's that one.
Which one?
Um, that one.
This one?
Yeah.
You got it!
Okay.
Got him?
Oh no, it only wounded him!
Here he comes!
Quick!
Quick, Grim!
Here!
I think I got him.
He's down.
He's still breathing though.
I hope this isn't an endangered species.













Let's keep throwing rocks at it!
Got him right in the hole.
Let's throw the show at it!
Ooh!
Ooh!
The show got something gross all over my hand!
Ooh!
Get away from it!
Get away from it!
It's gonna explode!
Okay, now.
Did you fix the show?
Let's go.

















Alright.
Listen, I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to do something.
Here's me array gun!
Oh, do I know what to...
The show needs new batteries!
Yeah.
Okay, look.
I brought some with me.
Let's kill it and try to get some new batteries.
Won't be any air for a while folks, so just hang on.
I see a gas mask.
Where?
A gas mask?
Maybe you should have a gas mask.

Maybe that was the rescue colony that came out here.
It might be a pink...
This pink sky here just...
I can't believe it.
It's like...
Remember Mars?
Ooh!
It's got a face, eyes, another eye, and a nose.
Yeah, that's not a gas mask.
That's a skull!
But of what?
Look under it.
Okay, stand back.
Because one of those ramphorhynchuses might be under me.
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay.

Okay, you guys ready?







I'm going to find the Gaius Gudus.
This is probably A.
I don't...
I don't want to find the Gaius Gudus.
Captain Zandy here has...
His face is scarred from an attack by a Gaius Gudus on the way into the laboratory earlier
today.
We're gonna need...
That's a good weapon right there.
The ground is littered with weapons and...
and bones from the many, many battles that have been...
What are they used for?
fought between the subgenius colonies and the creatures that live on this planet.
You know the amazing thing about this thing is... I heard something answer you.
God, your face looks cool with that scar. You look like the old G.I. Joes.
The old G.I. Joes, the tall ones, you know, about a foot long, they all had a scar in the same place.
Like every one of those guys had to go through this initiation rite where they were scarred so they'd all look alike.
Even the ones with beards.
Go down in there.
Yeah, you bet I still got this hook. This thing could save our lives.
Hey, this is a tree, isn't it?
Oh, it's got me! It's got me! What is it? What is it? Hook him! Hook him!
Oh, it's got me!
Oh, you got me!
You're gonna have to do the rest of the show yourself.
Here. Here.
Quick.
Quick, the show.
This is K-N-O-N 90.90.N.

And that's Texas.
Raise Bob!
This has been the Subgenius News Hour.
Brought to you in part by the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer Launcher Society, Dobbs Co.
Insects are around.
And Yucca Teesmovision.
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.
More.
More.
More.
More.

I'm going to get you a drink.
Oh, yes, dear friends.
Let your body be sucked out of your ears by the sound effects of Bob.
We're going to take you deeper and deeper inside yourself to find Bob.
Come with me.
That's right, inside.
Into your brain.



Into your consciousness.
It's slippery.
It's wet.
But we shall go deeper and deeper and deeper into the consciousness.
And let's bore down into the cranium.
Drill out and drill through the irrelevant thoughts of job and reality.
Rolling along the hollowed out inside of the skull.
Piercing the squamous epithelium.
Tickling past the supernumerary nipple.
Scraping along the edges of the birth canal.
Stretching the imagination gland until it pops.
And finally, bursting through the perineum.
Until finally getting into the bottom of the brain pan.
And tumbling down through the sinuses.
Down the esophagus.
And finally landing at the very soul.
Located in the foot gland.
At the very, the very lowest organ of your physical being.
Until finally an idea, an ultimate plan is born at the very bottom of your mind.
And soon you will be ready for...
Negative Land.
Yes folks, tonight, through the magic of Negative Land, we're going to try to make them famous for a change.
They're not a bunch of subgeniuses.
This band, quote band, unquote, was doing this long before they discovered Bob.
Negative Land from Concord, California.
And if you were ever into Frank Zappa, Captain Beefheart, or Wildman Fisher, or John Cage, or Johann Sebastian Bach, or any of those zany pop groups, you might enjoy this.
And if you can possibly wear headphones for it, or tape it for headphones later, you will be in for the shocks of your life.
I consider these guys...
There is no more money.
Time to quit the job.
Slack off.
Anyway, these guys I consider the most advanced.
Classical symphonic group of this century so far, aside from Doctors for Bob.
And, uh...
Well, they're my heroes.
And yet, and yet, they did sound for a enhanced our sound system.
That's sort of like...
Having Negative Land do sound for subgeniuses like having Federico Fellini set up lights for your Uncle Fred's home movies.
Or like having Michelangelo do Elvis Presley black velvet paintings.
It's like seeing Jesus.
Jesus posed for pie pads in the Yellow Pages.
You know, it just ain't right.
So, this is the subgenius sound effect show dedicated to Negative Land.
You've got to see this guy for what he is.
He's a maniac out to rule the world.
I guess I'm gonna have to start jamming mobile.
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Do you think I should start jamming, you guys?
All right, people.
It's almost time for us to be 10-8.
In just a few moments, we're gonna be 10-8.
And I'm going to tell you the story of 180 and the letter G.
All right, people.
It's almost time for us to be...
We're almost to that moment right now, people.
All right, people.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

I am a man
A man with one finger, a man with one finger on my hand.
I am a man, a man with one finger, but that doesn't count my ring finger, my middle finger, my index finger, or my thumb.
. . .
I am a man, a man with no fingers, a man with no fingers on my hand.
I am a man, a man with no fingers, but that doesn't count my pinky or my ring finger, my middle finger, my index finger, or my thumb.
. . .
Or my thumb.
. . .
Okay, we're ten-eight, and the number is 180, and the letter is G.
There's no other possibility.
And all you slimy fruitcakes in San Francisco are going to find out how to get to 180,
. . .
and the letter G.
. . .
I repeat, there is no other possibility.
There is no other possi- . . .
The number is 180, and the letter is G.
The first thing you have to do to get over to 180 and the letter G is to get into your vehicle and head east.
I repeat, you have to head east over the bridge.
But before you get onto the bridge, around one big turn, you'll come up to the place where the sex chemicals burned up.
I repeat, where the sex chemicals burned up.
. . .
And of course, you all must have heard about that on NewsHour.

News Center 4.
. . .
No, no, no, no.
. . .
On your way to 180 and the letter G.
. . .
And now, and now, and now we're on the bridge.
. . .
That's nothing very much.
. . .
But when you get on the other side of the bridge, on your way to 180 and the letter G, you'll notice two things.
. . .
First of all, it's very important that you turn on your AM radio.
. . .
Set it to 1010 on your dial.
. . .
. . .
. . .
And let the radio frequency energy from K101 overload your little tuner until it distorts very highly.
. . .
Now, right at the point of that extreme distortion is the big chair.
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
. . .
And then, by then, you'll be out of all that distortion.
. .
And you'll be looking east, toward the hills.
. . .





And if it's at night, you'll see the little red lights flashing on my favorite ham radio repeater's
. . .













station. That's WR6 automatic bowel movement.
And any of you who are into jamming, keep talking, keep jamming, because I'll be listening
on my scanner radio, and just maybe, you'll be on the new bowel movement.
You come up to the tunnel now. And now we're coming up to the tunnel. Up to the tunnel.
And then as you get into the tunnel, you'll start to sense something. And then about half
way through the tunnel, something will suddenly hit you. You won't sense it a lot until you
get almost through to the other side. You'll realize right then and there that you're entering
Contra Costa County. It's hard to explain. It's hard to explain. It's hard to explain.
It's hard to explain. But you feel a certain way when you get into Contra Costa County.
On your right, you'll see a little bit of a tunnel. And then you'll see a little bit of
aχre way to 180 and the letter G.
There is absolutely no other possibility.

The nuclear mg is above 50.

You'll just hear a lot of free water all the way down to Martinez.
When you're up to Martinez, you'll see a sign, a sign that says Gene.
And you're just going to go right on up there in your little vehicle.
And you're going to turn left onto Gene.
On the left-hand side of the street is the A&W Root Beer Place.
And on the right side is another place where you're going to go to your own restaurant.
It's safe muffins.
Now that you're on Gene, you're just going to keep right on going up Gene,
heading west on Gene.
All the way to the top of the hill.
Now that's where 180 is.
Right up there at the top.
And just before you get to the top of the hill,
you'll notice the green slime closing out from under the house.
Now 180 and the letter Gene.
And of course,
it had to be true.
You just got to go right back down to Safe Muffins
and shoplift.
I repeat, you're going to have to shoplift
the HR steam cleaning system
from Safe Muffins.
The only way you're going to be able to do it successfully
is to become invisible.
And then,
when you're totally invisible,
you'll just creep right on in to Safe Muffins.
And there you'll see it.
The HR steam cleaning system.
This is K-N-O-N 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.
...180 very quickly.
So you whisk your steam cleaning machine right back up Gene
all the way to 180.
You don't...
...right up to the front door.
And you push the button.

...
...
...
The door opens automatically.
...


...and the first thing you see is the orange carpet inside 180.
...
...and you'll see the dog juice.
...
...a horrible dog juice all over the orange carpet.
...and 180 in the letter G.
...
...you're just going to march right on into G there
...and with your HR steam cleaning system.
...go right all the way back to the kitchen.
...where the Mr. Coffee coffee maker has your hot water...
...your hot water ready to pour in your HR steam cleaning system.
...so you go in there and get your HR steam cleaner all fired up.
...and you bring it on out into the living room.
...and you take the steam cleaner out.



Take care of all the dog chews on the orange carpet.
Now 180 and the letter G.
I think I'd like to have a cigarette.
Where are my cigarettes, David?
They're on top of the refrigerator.
David, I'd like to know what you did with my cigarettes.
They're under the house.
My cigarettes are missing, David.
I'd like to smoke. What did you do with them?
They're in the toad cage.
David, I'd like to give you a cigarette.
I'd like to make a match.
I'd like to take one.
They're not there. Did you take one?
I'd like to take one.
I'd like to take one.
I'd like to take one.
I'd like to take one.
What did you do with my cigarettes?
I told you they're on top of the refrigerator.
I thought I'd put them in the refrigerator.
They're not there.
Will you please tell me if you need my cigarettes?
Maybe you left them in the car.
I didn't come home today.
You were the one who saw me taking my cigarettes.
You better tell me now or you're breathing in a man.
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I think I know where they are.
They're in back of the TV set where all the parakeet feathers are.
And as you're cleaning the orange carpet, there'll be a voice that says,
Fetch my cigarettes.
Another voice will say,
They're on top of the refrigerator.
They're on top of the refrigerator.
And then of course you've forgotten completely about the green slime.
And you'll realize it's the only way to get rid of the green slime is to go back down,
down the stairs, down to the basement of 180 and the letter G,
where you'll find a bottle of Formula 409.
You'll forget that 409.
You'll forget that 409.
And I'm gonna be real quick.
And go outside into the mailbox of 180 where the green slime and all the ants are
oozing out onto the sidewalk.
And you'll spray it with all your might as hard as you can on that goddamn green slime.
And then you'll have gotten all that horrible stuff.
We'll be a few toes.
We'll be a few toes.
And then you'll be saying,
Herbis.
Herbis.
Under the house.
Spray me with the 409.
Herbis.
That's what the toes are gonna say to you.
They won't crawl if they don't actually say that.
What you're a G.
Hawaii.
Ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha.
By then you'll realize that you're gonna have to take your HR steam cleaning system
back down to safe muffins.
And before you can do it, you'll of course have to become invisible.
And before you can do it, you'll of course have to become invisible.
Once again.
You'll take your HR steam cleaning system.
Which you should have lifted from safe muffins.
You'll look at the back end.
And it's the same old stew.
At some other numbers.
At some other letters.
At some other dimension.
We never scream.
We never return.
And it'll be time for you to head back to San Francisco.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't.
Because if you don't.
Don't do that.
You'll never leave Contra Costa County.
Stop that.
Put it away.
Don't get it on the tape recorder.
I can't hear.
Are you doing something?
Get it out of here.
Get back in your vehicle.
And you'll go in reverse.
In reverse gear.
Using your rear view mirror all the way back down the freeway past Pleasant Hill, Lafayette,
and Orinda.
Get it off.
Get, get, get.
You'll go back through the tunnel.
And you're gonna get back on the other side of the hill.








Through the tunnels.
All right.
You already said it.
I don't wanna hear about the tunnel anymore.
Right past the ham radio repeat.
And you'll whisk down that hill at 90 miles an hour.
I don't know.
You'll get into the appropriate lanes on your way from 180 in the letter G. Back to San
Francisco.
Back past K101 and the big chairs.
To Trinidad and Tobago.
Luckily it was St. for those of you since then that Gravecum River, so thank you

Are you or are you?
And you're on the bridge now heading west.
Into the fog, the high fog I repeat.
Fog never touches the ground in California.
It's always so damn high.
Stop.
And you get across51啊

and you look back to where the sex chemicals were made.
And finally you get back into your sewer pipe
and disappear down into the sewers of San Francisco.
And you know that you'll never ever want to come out to 180 in the letter G ever again.
We never ever could have been this bad, sweetheart.
And in that sorry situation, I think it's just about time we went 10-7.
I'm getting that feeling now.
Deep within those sewer pipes by now.
And never find your way out.
You'll never want to find your way out.
We're 10-7.
Oh, shut it up.
Out.
Shut it up. Stop everything.
Well, we stopped everything.
There is absolutely no other possibility.
That's all there is to it, folks.
That's what I've been playing there.
I can shut off now.
That was Negative Land, their third album.
A big 10-8 place.
And I'm going to read their address here in just a second
so you can send them $7.50 and buy that thing.
I know that probably some of my listeners are absolutely disgusted that they'd have to buy that thing.
I know that some of my listeners are absolutely disgusted that they'd have to listen to something as probably strange as all of this may sound.
But that's too bad, ain't it?
I quit my job.
What do I have to worry about?
Nothing.
Nothing.
It's freedom, baby.
Can you dig it?
So anyway, yes, that's Negative Land.
See, they distribute their own record.
You might be able to find it somewhere.
It's at Box 54.
Concord, California.

And I hope y'all are getting that in stereo because it's really a pretty amazing piece.
So if I can just cut myself loose from these other shows, it would be fun.
I'm not a rocker, I'm a rocker.
I can slaughter that cotta back, rock and logger.
Hey, doc, what's that song you're playing?
I like it.
Out, out, out.
Out!
I can shred and tear a cotta slaughter in a very cotta-cracker.
I can drag a cotta and a cracker into a cotta-cracker.
I can drag a cotta and a cracker into a cotta-cracker.
I can drag a cotta and a cracker into a cotta-cracker.
I can drag a cotta and a cracker into a cotta-cracker.
I mean, this is like it'd be fantastic.
Wow, define a cotta knockdown reggae mutton Department.

The Animal Crossing movie.
Parasite.

The dog got apart.
The dog chewed a Pearson's.
How's that?
What happened?
What the hell?
What happened?
Where are we?
A minute ago I was walking around in Glen Rose, Texas,
and now I'm on this planet.
Sandy, what happened?
You got captured by a monster and I accidentally hit you.
A monster?
Yeah, right up here.
It's dead, though.
What's the show doing here?
I don't remember anything.
You brought the show with you from the laboratory.
I'm going to have to think about this.
I don't understand.
Okay.
We're safe now.
Man, that was tough.
Too many monsters around here.
At least this old road is still here
that the space bulldozers built.
I wish the Transformers were around to help us.
Yeah, really.
Yeah.
I know.
Well, which way do you think we should go, Captain Sandy?
This.
Where'd the lost subgenius colony...
Where do you think they could have crashed?
I don't know.
Did you hear that?
What?
Weird sound.
Whatever it is, I'll stop it.
Oh, yeah?
I'll hear that in a minute.
Listen, I heard something.
I'm going.
God, look at those things.
God, they're unbelievable.
I can't even describe these monsters, folks.
Is he asleep?
Asleep?
I saw something run off the bushes.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.





I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, there could be something lurking in those boulders over there.
Yeah, so don't go peeking.
Oh, what is that?
Looks like the end of one of the space bulldozers.
Yeah.
The yellow and red thing.
Uh-huh.
The end of them.
But what did this to it?
What could have done this to a space bulldozer?
Look.
This looks like the Cyclops' head.
And a nose horn.
I think that's what it does.


The two ears.
Maybe the bulldozer had a crash into the cyclops and knocked his horn off.
If that's the case, he's going to be really mad.
And this is just his whole horn?
That's probably just the tip of it.
It's only about eight feet long.
The whole horn is twenty feet.
Then he must be giant-er than the sky.
No, well, his head touches those low clouds over there.
So I hope the show is ready to take that on.
That's the only thing.
If we can make the show sound bad enough, then even the king's cyclops will be driven
away and the land will be left in peace and harmony forever.
And Eternia will be ruled.
Eternia?
Yes.
Without He-Man.
Yeah.
Only soon the Transformers will rule Eternia.
No, the Transformers will.
I hope that the Autobots get back to Cybertron, their home.
Why?
And leave the Decepticons here on Earth to destroy us?
Yeah.
Why?
Do you want Earth destroyed?
You've got to see this guy for what he is.
He's a maniac out to rule the world.
What can I do to make you understand?

I love you.
Tune in for mind-melting extremist noise with the best in industrial experimental music
featuring such top-name group sales.
What planet are we on?
Oh, me too.
We aren't planning this.
This is, uh...
Oh, it's all planned.
Bob, look.
Go ahead and admit it.
See, look, look.
Page...
A plan and a conspiracy.
Look, I'm on page 16.
Open your dark mirror and conspiracy.
It says, Lady Calls Talks About Chili.
I mean, all this stuff is...
You can't fool these people.
Yeah, I'm tired of this script.
Let's go to this script here.
No, you can't just do my script.
My stuff's really funny.
Hey, look.
Prepare for the chrono-cataclysm of my hoarding food.
Gold guns, ammo, and gas.
Go on survival techniques and learn how to kill.
Of course, you don't want to kill with something you don't have.


I'm a genius believer, but...
God's judgment is going to come and fall again upon a godless, Christ-rejecting, blasphemous
society.
Well, if this sounds paranoid, you're right.
But I think I have good reason to be paranoid.
It's a strange world out there.
This is what life is like.
It's a strange world that's at a bottom line level.
And I'm not going to make you cut through a lot of other stuff to get through it.
Here's what it is.
There's no gimmick about that.
It's straight forward.
It's strong, and it's elemental.
We are heavy stuff.
Witchcraft.
Rude.
Devil worship.
A wild, gnawing, animal hunger will grow in you.
I love you.
His number is 600-3-score.
Everybody welcome.
One too stupid.
Three too stupid.

Four dumb.
Five, six idiotic.
Seven, eight seat me safe.
Eight, very stupid.
Very stupid.
Very stupid.
Very stupid.
I like Concord and 180G.
I like Pleasant Hill.
No other possibility.
Very stupid.
Very stupid.

That is no more money.
We gotta get some money.

You don't want the, the, the, ooh, that sounded pretty good.
Our ancestors used to do this, making stupid noises with rocks.
And one day they found out that certain types of rock, they were not really good at making

Zandy as subgeniuses, our ancestors were giant eight-foot tall yetis, abominable
snowmen and Bigfoot creatures created by the aliens who came to Earth after the
dot after they destroyed the dinosaurs.
Unfortunately these godlike super intelligent ancestors of ours were
smited by evil gods and turned into pathetic monkeys and humans and the
humans and the subgeniuses have always been a little different and always waged
this endless war over what's funny and what's not funny. What do you think about
that? What? What I just told you, the history of mankind. Yeah, I hear you a
club. What am I supposed to do with it?
What? What am I supposed to do with it?
Yeah, call...
Oh, me subgenius, me goon, go find human.
Ah, human!
That's just a rock.
Find human.
Subgenius.
The evolution.
Kill bug.
Kill human.
Where we find human, master?
I am a human.
What?
What?
My own son?
A human?
Yeah.
Shelby didn't tell me.
Oh.
This was a plant.
Or, it was a live plant. See here's the two eyes, the mouth, and here's the long nose.
The two horns.
And that was a plant?
Yeah, actually these are like leaves.
It looks like a mutated goat head skull.
And it had eyes.
It has eyes?
A plant with eyes?
Yeah.
Never heard of such thing, but that's real.
It's real, folks.
This is a real show, and we're really in a dangerous environment.
A hostile planet.
In another time.
Look it, this was a leg bone.
We're 225 years in the future from when you're hearing this.
This was a leg bone.
I wish She-Ra was here.
Yeah.
So I could kiss her.
Zandy?
Uh huh.
God, that's what I'm supposed to be thinking.
You're only six years old.
Look at this.
Hey, what is that thing?
Ooh, ooh, get it off.
Ooh, get it off me.
Ooh.
Gross.
That was, must be one of those them-a-pods.
We gotta find some us-a-pods.
As an antidote in case one of those them-a-pods bites us.
Yeah, because those antidotes can really help.
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that sound?
I heard gunshot.
An earth weapon.
Poof.
Look out, an egg.
Let's see.
An egg.
Do you think that's a Gaius Gudis egg?
Well, I'm sure a regular would think that.
So, so it'll die.
So it won't have any.
Well, if it doesn't explode, I'm gonna stand back.
Whoop.
Way to go.
Are you okay?
Dude, I didn't brush you off.
You got egg goop all over you.
I wonder what that thing was.
Look out, here comes its mother.
Grab a stick.
Grab anything.
It's got me.
Quick, quick, turn up the show.
Ah, ah, ah.
It's got me.






Oh, it's in here.
We made it.
Zandy, am I teaching you too much violence?
No.
Why would you teach me stuff like that?
Huh?
Why would you teach me stuff?
I don't know.
Like that.
Because, because that's what I got taught.
She's in the water.
Oh, she's in the water.
But it's so much fun.
Look, I'm going to grab the other one.
Oh, listen to that beautiful noise, friends.
That's some more negative land capping off the Captain Sun Sun Sun and Daddy show.
Boy, there's going to be a real crowd in here.
Norm's got a whole bunch of guardians of the airwaves here ready to destroy any of the evil callers that call in.
And my time is slowly beginning to run out.
I've got another five minutes here.
I guess you've got another five minutes of slack, friends.
But at least you get that much.
At least listen to that slack skipping by, going just right out of your reach.
I see a new house.
I smell gasoline.
Where's the lighter?
Yes, friends.
So send for that negative land record.
And, of course, as we come down upon the beautiful closing music of the Hour of Slack show,
this is Reverend Ivan Stang starting to sign off.
Friends, I want you to send your love offerings our way.
Bob loves you.
And send those, well, every kind of thing you can scrape out of your drawers.
Because we need those donations to keep the home for slackless children afloat.
Keep the church open.
Keep the new pamphlets going out.
You members out there, probably in about a week and a half,
you'll be getting the new...
Subgenius pamphlet number two.
I'll be interested to see whether people like it better or worse than the old original first pamphlet.
Nothing could beat that original slack of that first subgenius pamphlet.
You can get that pamphlet, friends.
We can't tell you how much money to send because you're supposed to send that money to the station.
But we'll be reading that address of the subgenius church where you can write for information on just what the heck is going on here.
And that is the church.
Of the subgenius.
P.O. Box 140306.
Dallas, Texas 75214.
Once again, that's Bob at P.O. Box 1403...
No, not...
140306.
Box 140306.
Dallas, Texas 75214.
And dear friends, our show is slowly starting to run out.
But, Norm, before you take over the airwaves...
Take it over!
I want to let Pastor Naked's song, Drinking Bud Watching Bob, play.
Because we keep getting requests for that.
Drinking Bud Wiser!
Is that how it goes?
Yes, that's right.
Drinking Bud Watching Bob.
By Pastor Buck Naked.
Coming up...
This is stirring music.
I thought it was sting music.
Stirring sting.
Sting sting music.
I like the lyrics.
Here we go, friends.
Pastor Buck Naked.
Buck Naked and the Jaybirds.

A few days this last week has brought the passing of another, I don't know if he's a minister or not, an evangelist of sorts, Mr. Herbert W. Armstrong.

I feel that I should look at Bob's you

Garner Ted has his own church in Tyler.
Yeah, right.
But Garner Ted was thrown out of...
I mean, that's pretty bad when you've got to throw your own son out of your church twice.
What I'm worried about is my own son throwing me out of my church.
Twice.
So what is going to happen?
I don't know. I need a job.
Why don't you...
I do. I really do.
