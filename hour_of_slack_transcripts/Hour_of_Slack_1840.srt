1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,840
Oh, let go! Oh, he's got my leg! Oh, my leg! Help! Don't save me!

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,780
Call the dogs up, they're biting me! I give up!

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,780
The Self-Genius Power of Squash!

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,260
That was a couple of years ago. I went back to reform school and watched my chance.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,860
And this time I finally escaped.

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:23,940
Escape.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,920
Of Spitfire Hijinks, says the Dobstown Mirror.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:41,740
Most religions, most of their rules are such that if you follow them, things are supposed to be nice or better, as well as correct.

9
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,420
The Church of the Subgenius has rules that if you follow them, have similar outcomes, sometimes.

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,780
And other times make things very much not nice or not better.

11
00:00:53,860 --> 00:01:01,520
Which makes ours, a mail-order mind-control cult, more like life than a description or a hallucination of life.

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,880
One such rule? Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

13
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,720
Try it and see.

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,680
Go ahead, kid. What's the matter? Scared? Afraid your mom will find out?

15
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,680
Anyway, we'll be hearing the first live hour of slack from 24X Day on Friday.

16
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,700
July 2nd.

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:34,040
I'm not going to play the first 26 minutes of Dr. Howell and me talking because it was recorded only on my phone and my location recorder.

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:43,040
Which also picked up drunken audience chatter and just sounded too much like the situation actually sounded.

19
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:49,360
The last 40 minutes got recorded off the line mic board mix, which was salvageable.

20
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,820
Just for contrast, the first minute or so of this is from my ambient...

21
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,760
...recording, so then the rest is from the board.

22
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,320
I don't mean the board audience, I mean the mix board.

23
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,880
The old animated cartoons were the MTV videos of their time.

24
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:12,920
Where they build a cartoon around a popular song, like happy harmonies, merry melodies, silly symphonies, and so forth.

25
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,660
The song, just about seven minutes long, perfect for a cartoon.

26
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,560
Those were the days.

27
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,220
You're just following in those footsteps.

28
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,040
Yeah, them was the days back then.

29
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,920
Uh-oh, we're doing it again, Dr. Howell.

30
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,680
It's another one of those hours of slack where we're talking about old cartoons.

31
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:43,060
We try to talk about the future, but we also draw from the endless will of the past to illustrate our examples.

32
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,760
Well, the only problem is that not everybody remembers the same cartoons that we saw.

33
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,400
And then they're illegal now.

34
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,060
Some are.

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,360
I heard that they made the Warner Brothers cartoons non-violent somehow.

36
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,440
But not the special collections.

37
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,060
Anything that's chopped up for TV.

38
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,560
Spielberg also messed everything up with his idea of Warner Brothers cartoons.

39
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,680
That just makes the banned ones more popular on YouTube.

40
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:23,440
I was thinking how awful it was that in the 70s that Ron Miller of the Disney organization...

41
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:31,760
a former football player took all the Donald Duck cartoons and so on and put thumping disco music to them.

42
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,000
And then released them.

43
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:43,500
And they used to show these ads again and again with Donald Duck's fanny boinging to electro disco music.

44
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,100
Or goofy or something like that.

45
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:53,740
Um, strange laps somewhere along the line made that decision.

46
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,800
Holy cow, we're gonna have a pyramid of drunkenness here.

47
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,420
He's warmed up too much.

48
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,640
Thank you, I'm sorry.

49
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,220
I'll pour another one down in just a momentito.

50
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,800
That's, that's, thank you, hunch peas.

51
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
Thank you so much.

52
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,220
The hunch peas.

53
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,940
Of Notre Dame.

54
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,000
God, what a butt kisser. God.

55
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,080
Who?

56
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,140
The hunchback of Notre Dame?

57
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,600
The hunch peas.

58
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,600
Oh, the hunch peas.

59
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,580
Oh, I'm just giving him crap.

60
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,860
It's all about ball busting with these, these old military guys, you know.

61
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,280
Well, as long as it's affectionate.

62
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:40,060
You see, when your, when your default way is to run everybody down and insult them, there comes a time something is not right and then suddenly you snap and get irritated.

63
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,660
Like Mr. Spock saying, I never did appreciate those comments you made about my ears.

64
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,520
I didn't like it then and I don't like it now.

65
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,840
Well, geez, Mr. Spock.

66
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,440
Ease up or, you know, whatever.

67
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,560
Uh.

68
00:04:53,580 --> 00:05:02,440
Too much is, I'm, I hate to say it, is in every instance is not always better than, than not enough.

69
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,720
Except to provoke a change.

70
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,680
Well, you know, the original quote was too much is always better than not enough but it's almost as bad.

71
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,400
But that just didn't have the same ring.

72
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,820
It didn't go over with the college kids nearly as well.

73
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,160
No, because they wanted all.

74
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,460
They wanted an excuse to hurt themselves with beer, which is exactly what I'm a little worried about.

75
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:30,760
When I saw the fifty cases of Orange Blossom back in the day IPA.

76
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,520
It's great, but fifty cases.

77
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,980
Take one down and pass it around.

78
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,040
There's forty-nine cases of beer on the floor.

79
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,840
Yeah, Onan already suggested that.

80
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,300
Yeah, well, Onan's not coming, right?

81
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:44,700
No.

82
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,820
No, he couldn't.

83
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,120
He actually had to work.

84
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,440
Oh, yes, work.

85
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,200
The workaday world must go on.

86
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,440
Whether capitalism or capitalism.

87
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,820
Work!

88
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,620
Maynard G. Krebs knew that terror.

89
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:08,260
But you're about to know a new terror as taught by Father Joe Mama, Papa Joe for short, in his miraculously preserved first sermon from 24X Day, Gird Your Very Self.

90
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,220
Hello, dear friends, and welcome.

91
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:19,440
The sermon tonight is entitled The Secret of Sisyphus.

92
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,360
You remember Sisyphus?

93
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:22,820
Don't you?

94
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:35,520
He was the ancient Greek king who defied the gods and was condemned in Hades to roll the large boulder up the hill to the very top, only to have it roll back down over and over again.

95
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,660
How does one motivate themselves to do this over and over throughout all eternity?

96
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,540
It's a dilemma many subgenies face in their day-to-day jobs, working for the Khan.

97
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,340
How can we continue to fight our way through the world?

98
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:52,340


99
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,400
We work day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year.

100
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:04,860
We try desperately to empty that in-basket, only to have it refilled just as quickly as it is cleared.

101
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,400
What did we do to deserve such punishment?

102
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,420
Nothing. Nothing at all.

103
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,180
And what can we do to end this hell on earth?

104
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,560
Nothing. Nothing at all.

105
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:29,860
But there is a secret to withstand the despair that this punishment tries so desperately to impose on us, dear friends.

106
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,640
A well-guarded secret that allows us to fight on despite any and all odds.

107
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:48,720
But to reveal it, we must go forward in time, over 2,000 years, to 1861, during the American Civil War.

108
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,740
The bloodiest war in American history.

109
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,720
650,000 casualties.

110
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:01,600
One of the earliest battles was the Battle of Lexington, Missouri, or as the natives called it during wintertime, Misery.

111
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,020
The Yankees had attacked the city and were dominating the battlefield.

112
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,560
During the day, the Union and Southern forces would meet on the battlefield and kill one another.

113
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,980
During the night, they would meet on the campgrounds and play each other at poker.

114
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,820
They weren't friends, they were frenemies.

115
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,980
And who doesn't like beating their adversary at cards and taking their money?

116
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,000
The daily fighting was brutal.

117
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:38,780
At one point, the Yankees took over the Confederate field hospital, the old Anderson House, which had been converted to a three-story warehouse for the wounded.

118
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:46,460
Many rebels were trapped on the upper floor, and the two sides traded gunfire up and down the large central stairwell.

119
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,220
Finally, the Yankees offered a truce of sorts.

120
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,720
Any conclusion?

121
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,140
The Confederate who could survive a jump from the third floor and could crawl back to his unit would be allowed to do so.

122
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:03,880
Several accepted and survived, so the Union changed the rules just a little bit.

123
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:11,680
They set out bayonets pointing upward at the bottom of the drop and took wages on how many would impale themselves.

124
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,240
Many did.

125
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,200
But even more gruesome was the fighting that occurred out on the river bluffs.

126
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:29,600
The Yanks held the high ground, forcing the rebels to push up the hill under withering gunfire, only to be repulsed and forced back down time after time.

127
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,840
Then the South tried something different.

128
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,240
Why not provide some portable protection?

129
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:45,260
They took some of the bales of crops from the surrounding farmland and started rolling them up the hill like a rotating rock.

130
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,420
It stopped the bullets, and the Yankees started to worry.

131
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,520
Then they came up with another idea of their own.

132
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,600
They heated their bullets and fired those at the bales.

133
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,060
And sure enough, it worked for a while.

134
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,620
It set the bales on fire.

135
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,180
And yet, the rebels kept coming.

136
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,400
Even when the smoldering and often burning bales made it so much more difficult, they continued to fight.

137
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,900
And when the battle was over, the rebels had won, despite overwhelming odds.

138
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,980
Lexington was safe.

139
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,480
At least for a little while.

140
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,000
And the South thanked God for their miraculous victory.

141
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,500
But was it really divine intervention that provided their victory that day?

142
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,240
Or was there another forgotten factor?

143
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,480
A secret to their success?

144
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,860
And what the Hades does this have to do with Bob?

145
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,240
Well, for that answer, dear friends, I'd like to reveal to you an often overlooked little detail about this battle.

146
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,060
That crop that the bales were made out of, it was a common cash crop back then.

147
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,600
Not cotton, but hemp.

148
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:58,400
A plant used to make rope and other fibrous products.

149
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,620
It is the older equivalent of cannabis.

150
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,560
And Havafrop Zipulops, the sacred subgenius herb from Bob's Piper.

151
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,780
The more those bales burned, the more inspired those rebels became.

152
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,600
And as to the Sisyphus is concerned, well, what kind of fumes do you think he's breathing?

153
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:23,240
With all those drug users and dealers burning in hell along with their residual THC and hidden bodily stashes,

154
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,860
who is to say how much of that skunk-like smell in hell is sulfur and how much of it is weed?

155
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,800
This is not only the secret of Sisyphus and the Battle of Lexington.

156
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,480
It is the prime ingredient to subgenius resistance.

157
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,960
Do I hear a praise Bob?

158
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,480
Praise Bob!

159
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,300
We will never give up, never surrender, no matter what the odds.

160
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,980
Because we are the modern day rebels.

161
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,040
Only we are not fighting for slavery.

162
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,440
We are fighting against slavery.

163
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:59,080
We are fighting the same slavery the conspiracy created when they traded the subjugation of one race by another,

164
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:06,660
using whips and chains, with the modern subjugation of all races, using time cards and security cameras.

165
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,560
They replaced the overseer's whipping with the modern manager's tongue lashings.

166
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,580
No, you can call it slavery light if you like.

167
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,520
All the oppression, but only one third of the actual effort.

168
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,160
The 24 hour bondage has been replaced with a 40 hour work week.

169
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,120
But don't expect any gratitude from us.

170
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,480
We all know they only did it to make us more interchangeable and expendable.

171
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:42,200
It was a cost cutting measure, because like everything else, even slaves are cheaper to rent than to own.

172
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,580
There is also a color.

173
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,340
There is a color difference to the modern warfare.

174
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,540
It is no longer the blue against the gray.

175
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,120
It is a battle betwixt the pinks and the grays.

176
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:03,180
And come X-Day, the burning bullets of the pinks will be no match for the titanium plating of the gray saucer ships.

177
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,580
Nor will they be capable of outrunning the laser cannons of the X's star fleet.

178
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:14,040
So embrace the struggle leading to X-Day, dear friends.

179
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,140
The fierce fighting that shall occur no matter how bleak it may appear.

180
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,200
Remember our history and fight on.

181
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:29,000
Remember the secret of Sisyphus and the secret of the South Booth's amazing battle.

182
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,060
If you can't beat them, joint them.

183
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,740
And don't worry, be frappy.

184
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,460
Here it is the winner Bob, praise Bob.

185
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,480
Amen.

186
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,920
We're broadcasting live on Freethink Radio.

187
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,060
Freethink Radio has all the subgenius shows.

188
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,280
Put your hands on the radio and maybe it will stop that annoying humming.

189
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,100
They do replay almost all the...

190
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:12,100
You know, it's good to where I hate to say it, but the number of subgenius shows is too damn high.

191
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,100
It's like the number of subgenius Facebook pages.

192
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,480
Too damn high.

193
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,700
I can't begin to follow them all.

194
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,560
It's ridiculous.

195
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:27,940
Well, a lot of applicants aren't bothering to fill out the subgenius questionnaire quiz.

196
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,280
And I think they should at least make a stab at it.

197
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,460
We discontinued the questionnaire because...

198
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:35,840
You did?

199
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,100
Yeah, people were spending so much time filling them out and I wasn't doing anything with them.

200
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
I felt bad about it.

201
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,940
Well, if they put anything, admit them.

202
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,560
But if they just, you know, refuse to cooperate, do you really want them hanging around?

203
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,880
They're too snarky for their own good.

204
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,340
I still have them all.

205
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,540
I have them in a big paper sack that's rotting away.

206
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,260
Don't hold them back.

207
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,060
Put them in a paper sack.

208
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,060
In the shed, the Dobbs shed.

209
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,020
Right.

210
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,420
I'm too bad about that unfortunate fire that...

211
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,680
Well, we shouldn't have been using pure oxygen to, you know, to fill the place.

212
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,720
Like the Hindenburg.

213
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,580
There went all those types.

214
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,980
No, actually, it's got...

215
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,880
The Dobbs...

216
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,660
There is a Dobbs shed...

217
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,220
Dobbs shed.

218
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,800
Near my house.

219
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,140
Lined with fossil rocks.

220
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,120
Don't go near that old shed, kid.

221
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,620
Yeah.

222
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,000
It's got $3,000 worth of insulation.

223
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,640
It's got a lot of insulation sprayed in it and two air conditioners that are both running

224
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:46,140
full speed right now to preserve the ancient rotting documents on paper.

225
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,100
And 8 millimeter, 35 millimeter film, 16 millimeter film, Betamax VHS.

226
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,220
Wow, this place sounds great.

227
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,820
Sounds great.

228
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,580
The zines and mail art of the 80s and 90s.

229
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:04,280
Well, the ones that the squirrels didn't pee on in my Cleveland garage.

230
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,560
Still continuing, the zine world is flourishing.

231
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:14,840
And Onan is inheriting that shed because he's qualified.

232
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:21,820
He recently gave the world's biggest Buckminster Fuller archive to a university.

233
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,720
He had acquired that much Buckminster Fuller.

234
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,700
He says his was...

235
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,580
There's probably another guy that would say his was bigger, but, you know, it's all about size.

236
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,420
Like the pink Canucks.

237
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,960
Oh, they're Marshall McLuhan.

238
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,860
But Onan was so big, he gave it away for free to some university in Portland.

239
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,740
It's probably been burned down by now.

240
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,840
Well, you don't know.

241
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,840
He left Portland.

242
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,200
He lived too near downtown and it was just downright dangerous.

243
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,220
He got tired of the ruckus, so he actually left for that reason.

244
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:59,900
I've turned into a fad of ruffian violence with the excuse of wokeism.

245
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,120
It's just out of control.

246
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,420
You see these...

247
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:11,260
These youngsters don't remember the 20th century and the cultural revolution in China and its revolutionary excesses.

248
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:16,120
Because all revolutions of every kind ultimately have excesses.

249
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,180
The pendulum swings back and forth in the human way.

250
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:27,880
And for a while, the extreme is an intensity which can be unpleasant for those who are on the other end of it.

251
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,740
That stuff scares me because that really did happen in China.

252
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,000
The most ignorant...

253
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,100
And Cambodia.

254
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:42,240
The most ignorant people who outnumbered the intelligentsia and professionals and shopkeepers...

255
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,860
Exactly.

256
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:53,820
...who took power and wrecked the lives of anyone who could read or speak a foreign language, wore glasses.

257
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,120
I know people who went through that as teenagers.

258
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,720
Or tried to preserve art from earlier non-Marxist leaders.

259
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,580
We have all those Leninist eras.

260
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:08,180
Well, I worry about the damn Trumpy QAnons doing the same thing.

261
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:15,320
Other people worry about the Antifa army which, as far as I can tell, exists only in Portland and Seattle.

262
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,700
The trick is not to get around between those two stones.

263
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,320
I do not have their P.O. box.

264
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,440
But they are real in those two places.

265
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,680
Antifa just means you oppose fascism.

266
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,620
If you want to see where they are, go to Arlington National Cemetery.

267
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:40,620
Sure, we're all anti-fob, but in a sense, I mean, it's people who'll say, yeah, man, I'm anti-fob, fuck you, dude, oppressor.

268
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:55,720
And then they'll topple a statue of somebody who is a hero to the gay community or crash, burn down a courthouse where all kinds of human rights things were done for the first time because they have no idea about their own goddamn history.

269
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,260
They destroyed a statue of Frederick Douglass.

270
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:58,900
Why?

271
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,280
Well, they, I don't know why.

272
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:11,700
In San Francisco, they took red spray paint and spray painted in the face of the statues in the park of Don Quixote, Sancho, Panza, and Cervantes.

273
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,880
And Cervantes was himself enslaved for a while.

274
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:24,600
But I guess they didn't like it because they thought these were conquistadors who oppressed the First Nations people and had never read Don Quixote.

275
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,820
As opposed to satirical novel characters.

276
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,700
Good God.

277
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,720
Next thing you know, they'll be tearing down pictures of Bob.

278
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,540
Oh, yeah.

279
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,560
And saying he's against the somebodies or something.

280
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,580
Or maybe he is.

281
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,300
They like to get right up against all of them real close and kind of cut off.

282
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:41,960
They have plans.

283
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,160
They'll tame Bob by taking shears and snipping the pipe, and then Bob will be harmless.

284
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,380
Have you ever noticed that when you digitally remove Bob's pipe, he looks just like some doofus?

285
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,960
He's got to have the pipe.

286
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,820
Oh, yeah.

287
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

288
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,760
But what's this?

289
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:10,420
From the Cult of Zere, a strange document with the curious title Wizard Bong.

290
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,300
Here, I think I'll read it.

291
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,580
Is existence incorrect?

292
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:23,780
While there is much to investigate, what we don't understand increases exponentially with each passing year.

293
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,880
Recently, for instance, Wizard Bong is known...

294
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:35,220
...to be Wizard Bong and potentially other things and or everything that is not Wizard Bong,

295
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,680
while also remaining everything that is Wizard Bong all the while.

296
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,580
And also not Wizard Bong?

297
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,720
You read that correctly, we think.

298
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:58,220
And tell you what, containing all possibilities, including the possibility of one's own absence without undergoing some form of severe existential crisis,

299
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,800
indicates a bold emotional fortitude.

300
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:07,820
This damn thing proverbially eats its own stomach, so to speak.

301
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,340
How the hell can a Bong do that stuff?

302
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:18,000
A Bong that is and isn't a Bong and also is and isn't everything else.

303
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:24,840
Strive to achieve, reach, fail, breathe, take a nap.

304
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,200
Be at the coffee shop in three hours and look for a good reason to do so.

305
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,960
Look for a man wearing pants.

306
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,940
Oh my goodness!

307
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,640
Wom smot hem enon she daftod.

308
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,720
It's fine really, fine.

309
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,320
It didn't have to happen this way, but now that it has, let's not cry about it.

310
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,060
Stop muttering. It'll be okay.

311
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,580
Wizard Bong, fine.

312
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,900
The proof is in the park.

313
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,480
Highly illogical research indicates the promising possibility.

314
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,900
We are engaged in irrevocable congress.

315
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,020
With lost truths.

316
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,140
Where does the pork factor in, for example?

317
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,160
Still a mystery, embarrassingly, but we'll find out.

318
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,300
Where exactly are we now?

319
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,840
Climb beyond your expectations.

320
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,460
Whet your appetite.

321
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,180
Wrestle alligators.

322
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,700
There are mysterious underpinnings to the reality we view daily through a lens darkly.

323
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:26,160
Wizard Bong, you are where you said you were, aren't you?

324
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,040
Were you lying?

325
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,820
This is the sixth heading.

326
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,480
Illumination decrypt mismatch error.

327
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:41,480
Unfortunately, you can't read the sixth heading until you've read and memorized the entire website.

328
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:48,760
Once you have undergone this strenuous exercise, the actual paragraph should be quite easy to read behind this one.

329
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,120
In other words, this is not the actual paragraph.

330
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,160
Wouldn't you like to finally, truly know?

331
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,740
Exactly.

332
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:05,440
And that's Wizard Bong from Cult of Zere, which I think Onan found on a website.

333
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,560
Cult of Zere is basically our friend Molg.

334
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,060
Molg also lives in Portland.

335
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,280
Hot, hot, hot.

336
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,380
Well, here's some, we got a little bit of mail.

337
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,460
Oh boy, mail call.

338
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,120
Yeah.

339
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,360
Well, let's see what's in Bob's bottomless mail bag this time, Stang.

340
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,940
Someone, Sigma Star Spawn.

341
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,840
Cute.

342
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:43,700
Just sent a short, it was a quote he found in the Dobbs Town Mirror.

343
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,780
Lay it on me.

344
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,340
If there is a God, he is a machine that converts prayer into irony.

345
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,760
And the letter writer said, I wish I had written that.

346
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,480
And I wrote back and I said, so do I, but Onan wrote that.

347
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,900
Onan actually has been sort of like my co-speechwriter for a long time.

348
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,360
He's coming up with good stuff.

349
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,420
And I hope we're all familiar with the Dobbs Town Mirror, that wonderful subgenius newspaper.

350
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,320
I gave him a plug in the nanoheliograph.

351
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,620
Well, I don't know why this is in here.

352
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:23,360
This was, this is, it says, after track 10.

353
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:29,080
This 1830th hour of slack is a good rerun from 2008.

354
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:36,940
And everything about X Day still applies in 2021, except the main party is being held in Land O' Lakes, Florida,

355
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:41,200
at the nudist resort of Reverend Xanthea Octo-Shroom and her dad.

356
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,380
Boy, what a, this is, what an improvement this is.

357
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,700
But most subgeniuses.

358
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,080
It's certainly more comfortable.

359
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,840
Probably won't be nude.

360
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,560
Most of our skin is generally unkissed by the sun's rays and will likely stay that way.

361
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,980
All information can be had.

362
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,840
Who is saying this?

363
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:16,180
Dr. Howell and I will be there and a whole bunch of young, much younger subgeniuses, including ringleaders Argus Fox, Reverend E.

364
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,180
The rising generation.

365
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,220
We depend on them to perpetuate our legacy.

366
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,500
Yeah, and to haul our luggage.

367
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:31,080
When the torch falls from our faltering fingers, there are brawny hands to grasp it and hold it high.

368
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,320
Oh, and then there's a sad thing about Reverend Rock Roswell.

369
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,640
Oh, yeah, I saw that.

370
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,140
Yeah.

371
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,520
He was only 60.

372
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,340
That is really too bad.

373
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,340
He had a lot of trouble with health and insurance.

374
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,320
You know, Dr. Evermore died also in 2020.

375
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,140
Oh, the list goes on and on.

376
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,100
Reverend Crash.

377
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:53,980
Yeah.

378
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,620
Heathen, of course.

379
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,080
Heathen, yes.

380
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:57,480
Yeah.

381
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,160
I really, really miss, really terrible about Heathen.

382
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,660
On the other hand, I think Heathen died in his sleep of a heart attack, which is not a bad way to go.

383
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,240
Yes.

384
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,940
You know, you just wake up on the escape vessels and go, whoa.

385
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,120
You wake up dead, yeah.

386
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,300
And, of course, Jay Lynch and Skip Williams and Jim Carrey.

387
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:25,340
Those are interesting cases because when Jay Lynch died, Skip Williams and couldn't stand to go on living.

388
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:37,360
Yes, but there are the survivors, the hearty survivors of this terrible time.

389
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,360
And that just shows that somebody always survives and you always think it's going to be you.

390
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,420
And who knows?

391
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,360
It might be.

392
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,800
It's a lottery.

393
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,960
A luck of the draw.

394
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,300
You might be allowed to be aboard the Ark.

395
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:59,300
Although I saw that Noah's Ark movie and I wondered where they were coming from with that.

396
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,000
The bad guy stows away aboard the Ark and starts eating endangered species and so forth.

397
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,220
Where did that come from?

398
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:12,300
And long-suffering Mrs. Noah played by Jennifer Connelly, you know.

399
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,840
What a performance.

400
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,700
That must have been a forgettable movie.

401
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:17,780
Yeah.

402
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,360
I think it was a good movie or maybe it was late at night.

403
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,360
I saw it but I don't remember any of it.

404
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:21,400
Yeah.

405
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,520
It starts with the Anarchy.

406
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,640
No, no, no, not the Anarchy.

407
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,740
What are the angelic beings who had sex with the daughters of men?

408
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,460
The Seraphim.

409
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,080
Yes.

410
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:38,940
Only in this movie they're like the pile of rocks monster from Galaxy Quest.

411
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,180
They're these big tumbling balancing boulders stumbling around.

412
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,760
How are they going to have sex with anybody?

413
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,320
I don't know.

414
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:47,320


415
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:47,320


416
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:47,320


417
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:47,340


418
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:47,340


419
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:47,340


420
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:47,340


421
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:47,340


422
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:47,340


423
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:47,340


424
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:47,340


425
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:47,340


426
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,200
They're not going to have sex with anybody.

427
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,200


428
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,200


429
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,200


430
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,740
Anyway, that's Hollywood.

431
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,800
What can you say?

432
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:58,380
Speaking of Noah's Ark movies, I found a list of movies that had been filmed in the town

433
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,640
I live in, Glen Rose.

434
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,360
And of all things, besides Dinosaur Valley Girls, was Noah's Ark.

435
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,380
I have that one.

436
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,560
Had been partly shot there.

437
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,520
Well they have the Noah's Ark attraction, don't they?

438
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,120
I understand.

439
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:24,900
We have a wildlife safari park there, and you can film giraffes and zebras walking two by two if you're desperate.

440
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,500
But it turned out it wasn't the big budget Noah's Ark.

441
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,160
It was the Michael York Noah's Ark.

442
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,980
Oh, no.

443
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,900
Yeah, a Christian-made Noah's Ark, real, real low budget.

444
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,440
So that explains why they had to go to the safari park in Texas.

445
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,180
To film the zebras walking two by two.

446
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:57,500
Well, I read that one Noah's Ark from some Christian Noah's Ark park got washed away by severe floods, which seemed so appropriate.

447
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,620
No, it wasn't.

448
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,000
It had severe water damage, the one in Kentucky.

449
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,160
I guess so.

450
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:08,420
The giant building shaped like Noah's Ark leaked and flooded.

451
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:14,900
And the water poured in, and they didn't read their Bible closely enough.

452
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:23,880
That's all so silly, friends, because Noah's Ark actually sank at the area known as Stang Ranch in Glen Rose, Texas today.

453
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,960
It's not on Mount Ararat or anywhere.

454
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,940
Now, I can show you the wreckage.

455
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,460
There's very little left.

456
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,420
A few boards, basically.

457
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:36,600
Well, it was made so many cubits long and deep out of shittim wood.

458
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:45,100
The prehistoric subgeniuses jumped off the boat, and as it sank, a lot of critters went down.

459
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:51,920
But they have some of these parks with Jesus riding a triceratops and so forth.

460
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,940
I mean, they really go off the deep end.

461
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,120
Hal, I can't wait to get you to the Creation Evidence Museum in Glen Rose.

462
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:58,980
I cannot wait.

463
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:12,300
Well, the most amazing one is in, is it in, no, it must be in Virginia, because I told Doug about it, and then he went there, which is the Republican Dinosaur Park where the South wins the Civil War.

464
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,020
Because dinosaurs eat Lincoln and U.S. Grand.

465
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,580
And they have all these dioramas of dinosaurs munching the Union Army and so forth.

466
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:31,140
Well, I told Doug about that, and then he went to his Virginia Military Academy reunion, and he took time to drive over to the park.

467
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,180
And he got there when it wasn't open, but he talked to the guy, and the guy let him get in and shoot pictures.

468
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,140
So he has a slideshow of it now.

469
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,960
Great, great bad dinosaur parks.

470
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:44,640
Yes.

471
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,560
There's quite a few of them.

472
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,500
There's one in Glen Rose, a dinosaur world.

473
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,680
There's one, same as the one, same chain as the one here.

474
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,320
And there's one in Cave City, Kentucky also.

475
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,880
There still are a lot of them.

476
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,760
Many have fallen by the wayside.

477
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:05,420
Flintstone Village is in ruins, a sad state compared to where it used to be.

478
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,020
I wondered about that.

479
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:14,620
But the thing is, what a great film project it would be to start at one end of the country and then drive to every tacky dinosaur park.

480
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,980
But there is.

481
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:25,300
You know, have a giant road trip and, you know, make commentary on it, show clips from dinosaur movies.

482
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,920
Couldn't it be entertaining?

483
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,180
That would be fun to do.

484
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:38,500
A lot of gift shops of various places veer into dinosaur park territory.

485
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:44,620
But mainly you've got to have the big shapeless concrete dinosaurs, somewhat weathered with pieces of real life.

486
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,120
And then you've got the rebar sticking out for the pathetic nature of it all.

487
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,720
I'm lucky enough to live in a town that's famous for dinosaur tracks.

488
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,560
And that's their claim to fame.

489
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,220
Dinosaur capital of Texas.

490
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,960
Dinosaur tracks give you therapy.

491
00:31:59,500 --> 00:31:59,980
Yeah.

492
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,960
And there's lots of really boring Cretaceous marine fossils.

493
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,520
But you don't like those, huh?

494
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,800
Oh, I love them.

495
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,100
My house is full of them.

496
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,460
I had to move most of them back outside.

497
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,220
I've lined my yard with them.

498
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,520
But they're.

499
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,740
They're all fossilized things that are still around today.

500
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,220
Snails, oysters, clams.

501
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,900
Not the same ones.

502
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,100
Not not Mosasaurs, but I didn't find any of those.

503
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:33,420
Well, we have Varanid lizards today and Mosasaurs are just those big monitors that went back to the ocean and became aquatic.

504
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,540
There was a fairly new one found called Dallasaurus.

505
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:39,740
Interesting.

506
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,980
About a three foot long Mosasaurus.

507
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,900
There's also Arizonasaurus.

508
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,600
Which is.

509
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:53,320
A fin backed Arcosaurian reptile, which is not a dinosaur, but more of a Crurotarsal.

510
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,420
And then there was the Moronodon, the fattest, stupidest of all dinosaurs.

511
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:06,240
So bloated that its belly had to be covered with thick scales to prevent harm from dragging over the rocks.

512
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:14,040
And the Blundersaurus, whose constant tripping caused the indentation of the ventral surface, which has puzzled.

513
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,160
So many scientists.

514
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:25,620
But yeah, I'm lucky to live in a town that has more dinosaur statues, good, bad and indifferent than most small towns.

515
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,820
Sounds pretty good to me.

516
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,860
Yeah, some of them are really great.

517
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:36,000
There's a miniature golf course with the worst dinosaur, the worst Brachiosaurus ever.

518
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,100
It's hard to do it right.

519
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:43,180
And I have the full collection on my phone.

520
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,020
If anybody really needs it.

521
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:44,740
Everybody wants to see it.

522
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:53,400
I was just in Chicago O'Hare Airport on the way here, and I usually try to find the giant Brachiosaurus that they have there.

523
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,780
I'm going from the Field Museum.

524
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,360
I'm not sure it's there anymore.

525
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,980
Anyway, I had trouble walking.

526
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,760
I couldn't get there.

527
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:04,940
But when you're there, you're standing by its legs and they're like the immense tree trunk.

528
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,420
Background music by Fid Shirley sucks.

529
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,460
And its head is touching the very top of the concourse.

530
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,000
He is.

531
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,000


532
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,000


533
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,000


534
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,000


535
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:20,940
And down by its toes, there's a little shop that sells plastic dinosaurs and other sacred objects.

536
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:23,720
Background music by Fid Shirley sucks.

537
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,560
I saw what looked like a giant wishbone in the Dallas DFW airport.

538
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,860
For years, they said, you see, dinosaurs didn't have a wishbone.

539
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,320
But now we know they did.

540
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,200
A furcula, as it is called.

541
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,160
This would have been Godzilla's wishbone.

542
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:42,660
So I'm wondering, maybe it was a work of art made to look like a fossil wishbone of a giant creature.

543
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,860
Background music by Fid Shirley sucks. Boy, if you crack that one.

544
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,000
Background music by Fid Shirley sucks. Boy, if you crack that one.

545
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,020
And then get the big piece, I wonder what kind of wish you get.

546
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,280
Do you think Superman could make a guitar pick out of Godzilla's breastbone?

547
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,760
Godzilla's what?

548
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,260
Like Superman, could he like...

549
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,060
The microphone piece!

550
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:59,300
Could he like fight Superman, Godzilla, and then Superman wins?

551
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,860
Well, the important pick, of course...

552
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,880
And then Superman makes a pick out of Godzilla's breastbone.

553
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,420
Whose sound could melt a heart of stone.

554
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,400
Then there's the pick of destiny.

555
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,240
The chip off of Satan's horn.

556
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,000
Maybe that's what it is. Maybe that's what the pick of destiny is.

557
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,640
It was the pick of destiny!

558
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,340
My wife knew every single Tenacious D song by heart.

559
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:34,080
Well, they're good songs, especially that whole thing about challenging Satan to the rock-off.

560
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,240
It's a great sustained sequence.

561
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,960
One should generally not do that.

562
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,380
Don't challenge demons to do things.

563
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,300
Life is better without that.

564
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,260
You know, when Voltaire was dying...

565
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,700
And of course, Voltaire thought he was dying for the last 20 or 30 years of his life.

566
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:59,260
But at one point he was really dying, and he was the big freethinker in France.

567
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,620
So a priest went there hoping to get a deathbed confession, you know, a conversion.

568
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,820
And so he finally came back to the church, and he was shouting,

569
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,340
Renounce Satan! Renounce Satan!

570
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,660
And Voltaire was saying, really, at a time like this, do we want to make enemies?

571
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,280
Ha ha ha ha ha.

572
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,360
And so he went to the church.

573
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:52,600
And he was like,

574
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:01,240
Oh, my God.

575
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,240


576
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,240
And he was like,

577
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:12,240


578
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:12,320
But he was like,

579
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,320


580
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,320


581
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,320


582
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,240
I suppose it needed to see if Farley was okay.

583
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,820
Gastropoda worry a lot, their concerns must feel late.

584
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,760
Their expiratory organs are known to emit an assertive bouquet.

585
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,020
I told them to clap and gesticulate.

586
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,820
Voulez-vous, voulez-vous, voulez-vous entrer?

587
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,140
The gastropod he mounted Farley's face in.

588
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,440
And sucked his eyeballs.

589
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,220
Extremely tencomious sheets of mucus like monocle falls.

590
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,920
His throbbing ganglion suggested pleasure through a bloody mass.

591
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,840
A mass of pus-covered gauze.

592
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,560
Thank you, sir, for getting me into the oxygen test.

593
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:26,800
Love should pay, and Farley claims his oxygen test.

594
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,420
The flange should dave, and Farley claims his oxygen test.

595
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,040
Oxygen test.

596
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,920
The Rudy Schwartz Project.

597
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,460
Farley Granger's oxygen tent.

598
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,200
From the album adjacent to the latex gerbil.

599
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,060
That's its title, not its location.

600
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,180
Probably.

601
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,520
Maybe both.

602
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,640
Now back to 24X Day with special guest Dr. Howland Owl.

603
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:04,080
Well, I, Dr. Howl, I'm an old fart.

604
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,100
And I think that as old farts, we should let the young farts.

605
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,900
Well, let them step up here and grab the. . .

606
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,320
The microphone.

607
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,840
I'm not stopping anybody.

608
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,120
Well, you see, they're closing in on the songs.

609
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,520
Who's going to fight the next war?

610
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,780
All right.

611
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,800
Let them come, I say.

612
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,680
Because, after all, you've got to feed the monster.

613
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,520
Content is what it's all about.

614
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,480
Hours and hours of tape.

615
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:37,820
More and more content that can be edited and spliced and sent to the ears of the awaiting faithful.

616
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,880
Right.

617
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,640
Nobody comes to listen to us here.

618
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,340
Because I know it's all going to be on an hour of slack.

619
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,360
So I'm going to need that.

620
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,760
Yeah, plenty more where that comes from.

621
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,760
Well, you don't know.

622
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,420
The meteor could fall tomorrow.

623
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,240
Or the exorcists could come a few days early.

624
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:56,380
You know, what to them is our foolish, sidereal idea of time.

625
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,440
Just if you hit it broadly, that's the best one could expect.

626
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,020
Well, an hour of slack is still an hour.

627
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,740
And still slackful.

628
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,620
An hour of slack production, or as I call it. . .

629
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,480
Squeezing out a Glen Rose steamer from the house of Blivitts.

630
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,160
Okay.

631
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,040
If that's your concept of artistic creation.

632
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,420
Well, I have to do most of them at home.

633
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,860
And I do have to squeeze them out.

634
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,980
Well, sometimes it may flow, and other times it may be a harder effort.

635
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,160
I'm going to now read the last two rant notes that I had for an hour of slack.

636
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,020
Please do so.

637
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,140
It's only two post-it notes.

638
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,580
One says,

639
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,040
Brave New 1984.

640
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,380
Yeah.

641
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:47,520
Which I feel like that phrase entered my head, and I thought, that's what we have here.

642
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,280
A hedonistic, authoritarian state.

643
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,240
It's authoritarian, but they keep the . . .

644
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:06,700
There's a lot of bread and circuses, and legalized marijuana, and drugs, and TV, and internet to keep everybody, you know . . .

645
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,980
Keep them docile.

646
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,440
Keep them at home, basically.

647
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,120
Keep them in line on the slaughterhouse ramp.

648
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,680
Yeah. Brave New 1984.

649
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:18,160
Hey, I'll pay extra for Room 101. I've heard they've got VR.

650
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,040
That's for sure.

651
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,580
Worst case I've ever seen.

652
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,980
The other little note I had was . . .

653
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,400
It says,

654
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:32,100
Guns don't kill people. Cops kill people.

655
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,960
But, I have to attribute that to Tommy Chong.

656
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:43,560
Who said it in a really terrible movie they did called Still Smokin'.

657
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,520
It was like a comeback movie.

658
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,500
I liked Up and Smoke.

659
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,020
And it just . . . it didn't cut it.

660
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:58,560
Now, did we hang out with him in Amsterdam, or was that . . . we met John Sinclair.

661
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,440
Did we meet Tommy Chong?

662
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,700
We didn't meet Tommy Chong.

663
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,260
Oh, we didn't.

664
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,140
You're imagining that.

665
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,700
Alright, I'm trying to get it all straight.

666
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,940
You're thinking of . . .

667
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:07,980
Harry.

668
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,200
Okay.

669
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:09,780
Really?

670
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,000
Yeah, the pot-smoking, the pot-inventing guy.

671
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:13,760
Okay.

672
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:14,940
And John Sinclair.

673
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,880
You're forgetting that we did that radio thing.

674
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:24,120
You know, we got just a little bit of time on his microphone, but . . .

675
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,240
You sure that didn't happen?

676
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,180
John Sinclair, yeah.

677
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,480
Okay, John Sinclair.

678
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,480
Yeah, not Tommy Chong.

679
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,340
Alright, yeah.

680
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,000
Or either that, or we did do something with Tommy Chong, but he had a better prop.

681
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:36,920
Even . . .

682
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,640
I think it was a little bit more fun than Xavier Hollander's dad, or husband had.

683
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:47,840
Well, I gave all of mine to Xavier Hollander and her man friend, because everybody kept

684
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,240
saying, oh, you can't go through customs with it.

685
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,140
They'll search you.

686
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:51,620
Yeah.

687
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,780
They know what it's been.

688
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,300
You know, you're going to be gone over with every inch of your life.

689
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:59,180
And so, I gave all the marijuana samples away.

690
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,440
I went through, and the guy's reading a magazine.

691
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,580
He just waves me through.

692
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,260
And he has joints in his pocket that he forgot to take out.

693
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,080
And he gets waved through.

694
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,140
So, once again, that slackful look is . . .

695
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:16,460
Actually, we had a whole bag of tulips that we didn't understand we were not supposed

696
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,720
to take out of Holland.

697
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,260
And we did anyway.

698
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,580
It could have been a bag of hats.

699
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:28,140
I did see a little dog suddenly following these two cops at customs.

700
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,020
Marijuana sniffing mongrel?

701
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,520
Suddenly sit down next to her, the bag of a nice young couple.

702
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,120
Uh-oh.

703
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,220
A nice young couple.

704
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,760
And this little dog just sat right down next to their bag.

705
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,720
And wags his tail.

706
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,040
And the cops said, sir, you have to come with us.

707
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:43,940
Horrible.

708
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,580
Please come with us right now.

709
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,320
I demand to speak to my ambassador.

710
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,700
So, yeah, we thought that you could smoke pot anywhere in Holland.

711
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,000
But no, actually, it's only in those clubs.

712
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,000
We got in trouble for it.

713
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,480
They flew into Holland.

714
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,920
They almost kicked us out of the hotel.

715
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,240
We really didn't know.

716
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,100
Ah.

717
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,080
Ah, the labor and stolen.

718
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,860
Heck, it's got looser laws in Colorado now.

719
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,580
Well, it's hard to keep up.

720
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,520
But at any rate, it's mostly legal now.

721
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:20,160
And going to the marijuana store is one of my usual chores.

722
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,040
Well, I live in Texas.

723
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,860
And it's still the way it used to be.

724
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:25,400
In Texas.

725
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,820
And probably cheaper that way.

726
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:28,560
Oh, well.

727
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:29,080
Maybe.

728
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,060
That's the way.

729
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,260
I mean, I always liked the underground economy.

730
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,080
Except, you know, I'm not a big fan of the underground economy.

731
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,080


732
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,080


733
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,080


734
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,080


735
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,080


736
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,080


737
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,080


738
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,080


739
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:34,080


740
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:39,060
Except that you have to go to the seller's house and pretend you're his friend and sit

741
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:43,000
there for hours and hours and listen to his music and listen to his talk.

742
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,840
And then finally, he drags out the cigar box or whatever it is.

743
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,960
And then, often, if somebody else comes, then you are free to go.

744
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,480
But otherwise, you're really glad you've got your dope.

745
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,780
But you can't get out of there.

746
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,480
And you're expected to smoke it there, too, with Mr. McBoring.

747
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:02,500
Anyway.

748
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:02,940
Yeah.

749
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,380
I know the feeling.

750
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,100
I sure do.

751
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,280
Luckily, that doesn't happen to us much anymore.

752
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,980
You call this girl, meet her at the supermarket parking lot.

753
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:14,800
Exchange.

754
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:20,480
Give her a few items.

755
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,520
Get your fake frop.

756
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,840
It's just plain marijuana.

757
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,340
Fake frop.

758
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,360
How come it used to be...

759
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,920
I hear this a lot from my friends.

760
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:32,920


761
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,600
My roommate, Mr. Mavridis.

762
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,040
How come it used to be so much better?

763
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,540
And you pay all this money for artisanal strains of marijuana.

764
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,960
And it's like, eh, it's barely there.

765
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,880
Rather smoke it than not.

766
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:50,180
But, well, I used to get this great dope that a guy grew.

767
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,500
And he left it for free in a paper bag in his garage.

768
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,600
And you could just come in and scoop it up.

769
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,060
And it was psychedelic.

770
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,160
You'd be tripping on it.

771
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:58,800
Really.

772
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:01,620
That's Paul?

773
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:02,920
Well, he's a guy.

774
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,440
What do you mean?

775
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,040
Was that Paul's memory of things?

776
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,260
No, that's my memory.

777
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:07,440
Oh.

778
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:13,840
But Paul was saying that the old stuff was so much better than the new stuff.

779
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,160
What?

780
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,020
That's what he's saying.

781
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,600
It could vary in quality.

782
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:19,740
Quality may vary.

783
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,620
There was no board of judges elevating this strain or that or giving it a funny name.

784
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,060
Yeah, I love the names.

785
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,340
It's all the same.

786
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,240
It all gets you high.

787
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,460
Purple push, gangster, strawberry.

788
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,400
The name, you know, the outer spiel that goes with it.

789
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,680
It's like wine snob.

790
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,060
And they all know it.

791
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:45,240
So, if you order dope, the dope guy comes to your house and then he says, well, this

792
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,460
is a very mellow strain.

793
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,320
And you'll notice elements of it.

794
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,820
This is more of a body high.

795
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:51,480
Yeah.

796
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,760
Whereas this one's more mental.

797
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,220
This is kind of a more buzzy.

798
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,240
The guy who bicycles over there is an expert.

799
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,400
A gourmand.

800
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,980
There's such a bunch of hooey.

801
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:02,220
Yeah.

802
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,920
Well, maybe so or maybe no.

803
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,700
On the inevitable thought has occurred to me that the reason it was so good back then

804
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,520
is that when you're young, you can consume anything.

805
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,120
Right.

806
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:19,180
When you're old, maybe those receptors are somewhat worn down.

807
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:25,580
Think of all the crap that kids eat and they can do it, but have an adult try it, you know,

808
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:31,760
end up in a world of hurt or maybe just a continent of hurt or a city of hurt or something.

809
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,080
But, well, if you ask me, I would quote Dave Gardner talking about something else.

810
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,220
Even the worst was wonderful.

811
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,360
Absolutely.

812
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,760
I would not deny it.

813
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,960
Not for a moment.

814
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,160
No, we cannot repent of such notable wonders and undertakings.

815
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:01,620
Oh, here's an interesting, this is a love comic about little monkey boy in Spilling His Gut.

816
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:01,740
Oh, here's an interesting, this is a love comic about little monkey boy in Spilling His Gut.

817
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:08,760
And it stars Mr. Chanto, who's fairly normal looking with a turtleneck,

818
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:15,120
and monkey boy who looks kind of short and sad and monkeyish.

819
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,340
How do you like my new shirt, Mr. Chanto?

820
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,060
Maybe now Mary will go out with me.

821
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,400
Silly monkey boy, appearances don't matter.

822
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,420
It's what's inside that counts.

823
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,500
Hmm.

824
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,900
Later he meets Mary.

825
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,040
Hi, Mary.

826
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:31,720
Hi, Mary.

827
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:32,980
Hello, little monkey boy.

828
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:38,640
I was wondering, he pulls out a knife, would you go out with me?

829
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,700
And he slices his belly open and his guts fall out.

830
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:47,600
With entrails like that, I'd go to the moon with you, little monkey boy.

831
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:51,600
And monkey boy dies thinking, I'm so happy.

832
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,960
And stink lines rise from his guts.

833
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:01,220
This is all from Swank by Greg Petix and Reverend Chris Smyth.

834
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:02,060
Scylla.

835
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,820
Here's one that is a haunted trucker story.

836
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,880
Route 666.

837
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,240
Chicken spooks haunt this rig.

838
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,020
Phantom beaks peck at my neck.

839
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:24,300
Cow specters hammer down blame, mooing accusal from the back.

840
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,160
Vegetarian when I was alive, hauling meat to make ends meet.

841
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:34,040
Tortured by the guilt until I jackknifed off Route 666.

842
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:39,160
And it shows this great big rig going off a bridge over a bridge.

843
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:42,920
Sam's Choice Meats, it says on the side.

844
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:50,180
I'm a trucker ghost, my handle long forgotten, chained to this damn stretch of road.

845
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,300
I never stop for gas.

846
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,580
My tank's full of hellfire.

847
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,520
I never stop for food.

848
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,100
My stomach's in a drainage ditch.

849
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,460
Outside of St. John.

850
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:07,340
Eighteen wheels of apparitions weighing on the sleeping brows of a continent.

851
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:12,180
Barreling down Moonlit River, a midnight blacktop.

852
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,460
Triple nickels on the dime.

853
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:20,040
Boy, that should be a country western song.

854
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,520
And that's it from Swank, a comics collection.

855
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:31,640
Originally published in the Arizona Daily Wildcat.

856
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:43,120
And you can find this by sending free comics to, got your pencil ready?

857
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:52,020
3333 Southeast Cesar E. Chavez Boulevard, number 5.

858
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,820
Portland, Oregon.

859
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:55,740
Poor things.

860
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,380
97202.

861
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:03,240
Or email is swankboy at yahoo.com.

862
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,460
All yours, dear friends.

863
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,860
Okay, Dr. Howell, I think there's no audience.

864
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,400
One other thing, totally irrelevant, but I meant to say it before.

865
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:24,500
In that vampire show, What We Do in the Shadows, I thought I saw Paul Rubens in there as a vampire.

866
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,140
Did I?

867
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,660
Was he in there?

868
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,480
That was a good episode.

869
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:37,060
Yeah, when they go to these other vampires' house and he's there with these really obnoxious ones, including a rapping one.

870
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,660
He's there.

871
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,460
Actually, I can see that easily.

872
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,400
He does have kind of a Bela Lugosi look.

873
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,420
Yeah, the art direction of that show is just wonderful.

874
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,860
You've seen the movie, right?

875
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,560
Which one?

876
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,480
What We Do in the Shadows.

877
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:56,560
No, I've not seen that.

878
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,260
How about the movie?

879
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,020
No.

880
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,000
Oh, at least watch the movie.

881
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,340
The movie is groovy.

882
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,680
It's got a different cast than the...

883
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,720
The list of things that I must see...

884
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,500
Now, sit right down and watch...

885
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:08,600
Too damn high.

886
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:16,760
Yeah, well, every now and then something comes out that's really exceptional and encouraging and has great art direction.

887
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:17,700
Oh, I know.

888
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,020
There's a lot of them.

889
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:19,260
Yeah.

890
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:19,800
Tons of them.

891
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,940
Can't keep up with them.

892
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:23,080
And they get plowed under.

893
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,460
But, yeah.

894
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:29,280
The same people from New Zealand who made the movie have made the show.

895
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,660
And the show has a different bunch of vampire roommates.

896
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:38,160
But it's the same conceit of there's a camera crew in there and they're promised not to be eaten by the vampires.

897
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:50,400
They can film their roommate interactions which are full of conflict because some are thousands of years old, some are hundreds of years old, some are ten years old, some were just made vampires.

898
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,440
And the human stooges who do all the work, you know, with pathetic...

899
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:54,440


900
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:54,440


901
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:54,440


902
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:54,440


903
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:54,440


904
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:54,440


905
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:54,440


906
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:54,440


907
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,120
They have a very pathetic hope that they'll be made into vampires.

908
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,360
They have the different type of vampires.

909
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,560
They have not vampires.

910
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,320
They have certain blood but they steal your emotions.

911
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,760
Oh, that's the best one.

912
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:16,420
In the show there's a guy who's an energy vampire who's like this bald businessman type who talks at you and he sucks all your energy away and he even sucks the energy from the vampires.

913
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,160
Nobody likes him.

914
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,700
He tells these terrible jokes and laughs in an insincere way and people are slumping over

915
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,420
and fighting over them.

916
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:27,020
falling over, their energy getting sucked up.

917
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,460
That sounds kind of John Shirley-like.

918
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,740
It sounds like the kind of thing he'd come up with.

919
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,220
Well, it's pretty good.

920
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,820
I was visiting my friend in New York,

921
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:38,580
and she showed me a bunch of those episodes,

922
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,660
which I can't watch because I don't have cable and so forth.

923
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,720
But I watched a bunch of them.

924
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,500
I don't have cable.

925
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,860
But the movie, read the movie.

926
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,560
You'd be amused by it.

927
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,520
It's lots of fun. It's well-developed.

928
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,860
See, they have a hypnotic power,

929
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,500
so they can have the cops over to their house,

930
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,160
and the cops don't notice all the dead bodies on the floor.

931
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,000
And the cops are there to answer a complaint.

932
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,720
It's supposed to be Orange Officer.

933
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,220
Oh, okay.

934
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,420
And the werewolves are in it, too.

935
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,120
A subgenius got away with the crime.

936
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:18,820
He was caught red-handed, or orange-handed.

937
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,780
He was spraying orange Dobbs heads in public.

938
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,300
And the cops said, what's going on here?

939
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:29,080
And our friend, who was an older guy, kind of a peas-like guy,

940
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,240
he goes, oh, it's supposed to be Orange Officer.

941
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,760
He hadn't planned to say that.

942
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:35,180
It just came out of his mouth.

943
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,080
And the cops went, okay.

944
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,080
It was like, these aren't the droids you're looking for.

945
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,240
It worked.

946
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,680
It's supposed to be just distraction.

947
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:45,720
Well, if it's supposed to be, I guess you're all right.

948
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,100
You're not seeing this.

949
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,320
You're seeing that.

950
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,760
Magician trick, you know.

951
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:52,380
Distraction.

952
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,440
These aren't the drugs you're looking for.

953
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,580
I'm looking for drugs.

954
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,360
But they are the drugs you want.

955
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:03,940
Will drugs turn you on?

956
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:07,680
This orange blossom is a wonderful drug.

957
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:11,000
I just had a whole can of it.

958
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,900
It's 6.4% alcohol.

959
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,360
But the rest is healthful water.

960
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,240
So it's good for you, kids.

961
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,540
I've had can after can.

962
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,160
Back in the day, IPA.

963
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,460
Believe me.

964
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,500
I know my IPA.

965
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:26,180
Because I'm Reverend Ivan Stang from the Church of the Subgenius.

966
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:32,560
And Blossom Special Back in the Day IPA is one of my very favorites.

967
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,900
It's almost as good as Back in the Day.

968
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,480
Hey, it is Back in the Day.

969
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,060
Amen, brother.

970
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,880
In the future, they're not going to be any day.

971
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,540
So this is Back in the Day.

972
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:50,740
In Brave New 1984, there ain't going to be no more Back in the Day.

973
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,360
Because it's all been the same.

974
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,280
The whole time.

975
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:01,020
The people my sister is in prison with,

976
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:10,440
many of them seem to think that this country has always been English people,

977
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:16,540
English-speaking, mostly white people with cars in suburbs.

978
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:20,380
And I see something like a Robin Hood movie.

979
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,420
They go, well, why didn't he just...

980
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,000
Why didn't he just get a gun and shoot him?

981
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:30,660
Well, he did in that Kevin Costner one where they bring in gunpowder and start blowing up the sheriff.

982
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,460
The less said, the better.

983
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,380
Yeah, right.

984
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,060
That wasn't a great Kevin Costner movie.

985
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:35,760
No, it was not.

986
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,820
I, on the other hand, happen to really like Waterworld.

987
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,620
Many people hate it, but I thought it was pretty fun.

988
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,060
Did you ever see Richard Lester's Robin and Marion?

989
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,920
Yeah, I did a long, long time ago.

990
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:52,420
Not bad.

991
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:55,200
And I remember it being good, but that's all I remember.

992
00:56:55,500 --> 00:57:00,280
The thing is, many have argued that that part of the Robin Hood legend

993
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,020
is put in later as anti-Catholic feeling.

994
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:09,420
A nun bleeds Robin to death because of the traitorous papacy and so forth.

995
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,660
But bleeding was how they tended to you in those days.

996
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,460
It let some of that bad blood out.

997
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:19,720
They just let a little too much out from Mr. Hood.

998
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:21,900
What is Robin Hood?

999
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,440
What's that music?

1000
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,680
Why, it sounds like Rimsky-Korsakov.

1001
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:31,700
Yes, the now politically incorrect Arabian Nights fantasy.

1002
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,560
No, that's from Universal Monsters.

1003
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,820
It's colonialist.

1004
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:41,140
It's the, well, it's, I believe it's...

1005
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:41,720
Could it be The Mummy?

1006
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,260
The Mummy?

1007
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,040
The Mummy has Swan Lake at the beginning, period.

1008
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:49,780
No other movie, music in it.

1009
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:50,800
Like Dracula.

1010
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:51,820
It starts with...

1011
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,260
Swan Lake, no other music.

1012
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,620
But Swan Lake, yes.

1013
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,240
So it's not Rimsky-Korsakov.

1014
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,120
I don't know why.

1015
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,440
That's from a Universal Monster movie, an early one.

1016
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:06,520
I think it's The Mummy.

1017
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:12,160
They do that when they show the pyramids and so on at the beginning of The Mummy.

1018
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,520
No, the titles.

1019
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:14,660
Exactly.

1020
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,780
The titles among some miniature pyramids that they rigged up for the titles.

1021
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,880
And the Rockwell has Swan Lake.

1022
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,720
Also, Renfield is heading off over the Borgo Pass and they play it.

1023
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,480
But after that, not a note of music in the whole movie.

1024
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:36,900
Now you know it's an hour of slack because it's going on for another half hour talking about old Universal Monsters.

1025
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,580
Oh, we haven't begun to get started, friends.

1026
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:45,520
We haven't discussed such movies as Earthworm Tractors or Shhh! The Octopus.

1027
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,240
Ever seen Shhh! The Octopus?

1028
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:49,140
No.

1029
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:49,760
No.

1030
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:52,440
I did see Ticks, though, after Last Ex Day.

1031
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,060
You told me about Ticks.

1032
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,200
Oh, I told you about Ticks.

1033
00:58:54,260 --> 00:59:03,840
Yes, you see marijuana growers in the woods are using too much fertilizer, creating giant ticks that attack teenagers, naturally, since everything attacks teenagers.

1034
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,900
Hey, there's a band coming.

1035
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,160
Let's get out of here, Dr. Howell.

1036
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,040
Got it.

1037
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:12,500
I'm going to take this undrunk can of beer and change it into a drunk can of beer.

1038
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:13,160
There you go.

1039
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,540
Or maybe I'll be the drunk.

1040
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,020
So, Bill, another iteration of the...

1041
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,280
...soie de cent hour of slack.

1042
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,260
We've got a million of them.

1043
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,820
Gags, stories, and reminisces about old movies that no one is interested in.

1044
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:34,700
But you never know whether we might strike a spark in such a fashion.

1045
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:38,840
So somebody else get up here and start a yakking and palaverin.

1046
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,140
We need a lot of clabber.

1047
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:46,760
And after so many beers, I can't blab such blibber blubber.

1048
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,780
My tongue isn't made out of rubber.

1049
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,220
Yes, I'll take that one and this one.

1050
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:53,940
Subgenius.com.

1051
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,460
That's subgenius.com.

1052
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:59,060
Everything you want to know is there, but you will have to truly look.

1053
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,540
Thanks for listening and looking.
