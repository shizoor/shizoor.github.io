1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
I stand here a victim of the influence of Immanuel Bobstein, guilty on all counts.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,660
I'm glad I was caught. I was mentally deranged. Now I am cured.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,920
I ask only for you to accept my love of the subgenius power of Slack.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,520
Bob's balls melted my garter.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,760
Ah yes, dear friends.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:37,960
This is the 1,704th hour of Slack, and this episode is part two of our ongoing tribute to the late subgenius giant, Dr. Katahdin Leguim.

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:45,340
We'll start with a great sermon about the Church of the Subgenius in general, and on the Butthurt subgenius specifically,

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,000
delivered by Leguim at the blistering hot X-Day drill of 2012.

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,020
Before the musicians get up here to make really horrible music,

10
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:07,100
I would like to first introduce to you the former CEO of the Subgenius Foundation,

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:16,840
your overlord and leader, Dr. Katahdin Leguim.

12
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,460
Shut the fuck up or you'll get more Elvis.

13
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,380
The Third Reich lasted 12 years.

14
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,600
X-Day drills have lasted 16 years.

15
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,680
Suck it, Hitler. We win.

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,160
And here we are at X-Day 15,

17
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,660
which in typical retarded,

18
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,240
subgenius fashion is our 17th X-Day drill,

19
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,400
and, well, hopefully our last.

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,460
In that same retarded, subgenius fashion,

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,420
the pinks are supposed to fry on X-Day.

22
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,800
And fuck me running instead, here we are frying instead.

23
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,280
While they sit in air-conditioned cracker boxes

24
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,500
in the Bronx and LA and London and Krakow,

25
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,740
thinking how special and awesome they are,

26
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,760
and how smart they are,

27
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,380
these pinks would never fall for the idea

28
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,740
that a bunch of wackos hold the key to their salvation,

29
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,760
because they'd never believe that some insane Armageddon

30
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,640
might wipe them from the face of the earth.

31
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,120
But even if we didn't hold that key,

32
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,020
their safety is an illusion.

33
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,740
When Vesuvius wiped them off,

34
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,780
and wiped out Pompeii,

35
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,140
those ancient wops learned that lesson.

36
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,100
When a tsunami and an earthquake wiped out half of Japan,

37
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,360
the Japanese learned that lesson.

38
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,360
When a tornado wiped out a whole Missouri town,

39
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,440
they learned that lesson,

40
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,500
and that wasn't even the worst one in history.

41
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,580
Mmm, all this disaster talk makes me feel fuzzy.

42
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,240
I remember when Hurricane Katrina hit.

43
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,320
I saw the footage of all those bodies floating in the water,

44
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,980
and I remembered some pink asked,

45
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,420
why would God do this to them?

46
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,820
And my reply to that idiot was,

47
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,380
because God likes alligators too.

48
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,980
Yes, brothers and sisters, Jehovah One loves crows,

49
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,660
and vultures, and worms, and jackals.

50
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,700
Funny thing though,

51
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,080
if you kill all the bugs,

52
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,760
the birds die,

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,640
and then the plants die,

54
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,160
and then the humans die.

55
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,440
If you kill all the plants,

56
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,040
the animals starve,

57
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,480
the humans die.

58
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,800
But humans,

59
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,140
they have no natural enemies,

60
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,700
other than us.

61
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,340
They have no natural enemies.

62
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,360
If the humans die,

63
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,360
everything else gets a free lunch.

64
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,560
And what better metaphor for slack,

65
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,920
than a free lunch?

66
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,540
We all got slack from free lunches here just this weekend.

67
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,500
Just this week.

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Sure, lots of subgenius, including me,

69
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,240
revel in the notion

70
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,600
of wiping the stain of humanity

71
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,320
from the face of this planet.

72
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,060
But that's not really what it's all about.

73
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,480
Vengeance is just a free lunch.

74
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,520
It's how we will get slack

75
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,640
from giving slack to the earth.

76
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,900
To give the animals their free lunch.

77
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,020
To achieve this goal,

78
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,280
we must prepare.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,920
We must load our knives

80
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,120
and sharpen our guns.

81
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,500
Many subgeniuses have said,

82
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,480
Dr. Legume, he's a bully.

83
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,660
He's an asshole.

84
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,640
He's vicious and heartless and cold blooded.

85
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,980
He hurts people,

86
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,980
and he's power mad.

87
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,040
Power mad.

88
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,840
Well, it's true.

89
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,260
I'm mad, and I has power.

90
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,620
I has amazing power.

91
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,720
I can make people forget what they say,

92
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,100
and make them remember things that never happened.

93
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,040
People cancel their vacation plans

94
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,780
when I snap my fingers.

95
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,980
I am made of living fire.

96
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,560
I am destroying the church of the subgenius

97
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,640
single-handedly.

98
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,040
I am a flame warrior.

99
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,480
I'm a bully, an asshole.

100
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,640
I am the ban instigator watchdog.

101
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,160
I rape you in your constitutional rights.

102
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,880
When I drop the N-word,

103
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,140
it breaks.

104
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,100
I'm the big cheese, motherfuckers.

105
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,340
I'm the humongous.

106
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,560
I wipes my arse from Genesee to Revolu.

107
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,360
I can wash brains.

108
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,860
I'm the puppet master.

109
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,500
I'm a rat bastard.

110
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,160
My sundial says it's hammer time.

111
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,620
I'm the man who's the best.

112
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:19,620


113
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:19,620


114
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:19,620


115
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,060
Pisces tits bounce at my command.

116
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:23,900
Bounce.

117
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,660
I ain't lyin'.

118
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,100
I ain't lyin'.

119
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,480
I cut the cheese, and I cut the mustard.

120
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,880
I cut the bologna.

121
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,820
You gotta stand on the moon to see my male pattern baldness.

122
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,040
I have 17 balls.

123
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,500
I was born in the heart of an H-bomb,

124
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,080
and I dropped the F-bomb.

125
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,260
I sleep in the middle of the highway.

126
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,980
I drink gasoline with a hand grenade chaser.

127
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,260
I die for fun.

128
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,640
I'm a rat soup-eatin' motherfucker.

129
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,780
My dick has racing stripes.

130
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,660
I banned all your friends.

131
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,480
I am the big boss of this area.

132
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,700
I'm the organ grinder,

133
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,280
and Stang's my dancing monkey.

134
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,460
I am the king

135
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,340
of butthurt.

136
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,880
And that having been said,

137
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,660
we come to the subject of today's sermon.

138
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,140
The butthurt of the subgenus.

139
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,000
The bearer of this card

140
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,940
is a righteous and ordained overman uberwoman,

141
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,840
and is entitled to all privileges usually granted a holy person.

142
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,780
Sounds like a pretty sweet deal,

143
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,120
until you really think about it.

144
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,800
You see, with that privilege also comes the burden

145
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,460
usually granted to a holy person.

146
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,620
That burden may very well be the scorn

147
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,540
of those who think you're full of shit.

148
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,380
That burden may very well be getting the shit

149
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,660
kicked out of you by rival cultists,

150
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,940
or turned away by your own family and friends.

151
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,200
Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King,

152
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,460
Osama Bin Laden, all holy men.

153
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,860
And what did they get?

154
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,280
Shot the fuck up is what?

155
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,960
John the Baptist?

156
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,520
Beheaded!

157
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,380
The Catholic Church alone

158
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,200
has over 10,000 martyred saints,

159
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,120
many of whom were executed in colorful,

160
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,400
creative, and no doubt hilariously entertaining ways.

161
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,300
The founder of the Mormons, Joseph Smith,

162
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,700
and his brother Hiram,

163
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,420
were killed by a mob.

164
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,600
And as much as we'd all like to,

165
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,440
let's not forget America's most popular holy man,

166
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,980
Jesus H. Christ.

167
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,100
Dragged through the streets, beaten, tortured, stabbed,

168
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,300
and nailed to a cross.

169
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,800
As a final example,

170
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,860
I offer you all the big kahuna himself,

171
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,060
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

172
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,360
Your subgenius minister's card reads as follows.

173
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,960
The bearer of this card is a righteous and ordained

174
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,180
overman uberwoman,

175
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,260
and is entitled to all privileges,

176
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,000
usually granted a holy person.

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,580
In the subgenius church,

178
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,760
you are promised eternal salvation

179
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,280
or triple your money back.

180
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,160
You're promised a package of cool propaganda,

181
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,980
and that's it.

182
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,620
The rest of what you get are all privileges, not rights.

183
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,680
The church in no way, shape, or form promises you

184
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,800
that the foundation proper will support or endorse

185
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,260
any of your wacky schemes or ideas,

186
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,700
art projects, drug addiction,

187
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,620
and or alcoholism or lifestyle choice.

188
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,100
You're not promised a say in how the church is run.

189
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,300
You're not promised admittance to the X Day event.

190
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,340
You're not promised membership in any of the online groups.

191
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,460
You're not promised the respect for your opinions from anyone.

192
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,200
And you're especially not promised that everyone will be nice to you.

193
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,960
I'm a big fan of the Who.

194
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,680
But just because I bought all their albums

195
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,740
doesn't mean that I can go over to Roger Daltrey's house,

196
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,200
sleep on his couch, fuck his groupies,

197
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,720
and tell him how to put on a rock and roll show.

198
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,880
All Dobbs ever asked you for was 35 bucks,

199
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,520
and most of you paid even less than that.

200
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,220
You got what you paid for,

201
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,660
and anything beyond that is a privilege granted by the church.

202
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,460
And the benevolence of Dobbs' fellow servants.

203
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,020
We serve Dobbs.

204
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,480
We are not your parents.

205
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,840
Those of us who are perceived as members of some higher echelon

206
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,500
have attained our status because we work hard.

207
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,940
We fix problems.

208
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,040
We give.

209
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,600
We gave our money as a tithe to Bob.

210
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,040
We give our effort.

211
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,020
We give our sweat.

212
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,320
We fix problems.

213
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,000
We create the mythos, the art, the music, the videos.

214
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,460
We provide ideas.

215
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,480
We work hard to bring them to fruition.

216
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,800
As opposed to those who just sit and stare

217
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,400
and demand to be spoon-fed the slack they feel entitled to.

218
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,740
When I joined this church,

219
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,560
I got a membership pack and a minister's card.

220
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,160
That's what I paid for.

221
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,360
There was no X Day.

222
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,080
There was no Facebook or Yahoo groups.

223
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,740
And devivals were few and far between.

224
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,240
The only subgeni I personally knew

225
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,440
were the ones I indoctrinated.

226
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,200
If you wanted to correspond with another subgenius,

227
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,060
you mailed them a letter.

228
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,360
You sent them smoke signals.

229
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,640
A lot of us still do.

230
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,320
All of the facets of the present subgenius church,

231
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,660
the present community, the events and friends that you have made

232
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,800
from attending them, these did not just happen.

233
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,960
These assets were built by the heroes of the subgenius church.

234
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,460
The saints, the doctors, who all understand

235
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,640
that slack is returned tenfold

236
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,540
only to those willing to give all the slack they have.

237
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,760
People like Stang, Princess Wee,

238
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,720
Susie the Floozy, Papa Joe Mama,

239
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,240
G. Gordon Gordon, Nikki Death Chick,

240
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,600
Pisces and Suds, Reverend Pockets, Two Beans,

241
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,800
even sweet little Pantiera,

242
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,660
pitch in to make X Day and the subgenius church

243
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,280
the best church ever,

244
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,060
as do many others who I regretfully don't take the time to name here.

245
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,780
Many of you like to sit and just dig on the happenings.

246
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,160
And you know what? That's fucking awesome too.

247
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,800
We get our measure of slack by doing this for our friends.

248
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,220
But to bitch and complain that you're not provided

249
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,280
the slack you feel you're entitled to,

250
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,400
or worse, taking it from someone who does deserve it

251
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,460
when you have put no slack of your own into the great slack pot,

252
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,200
that is the very definition of asshat.

253
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,680
That makes you an ungrateful slack vampire.

254
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,980
If you lose your shit and start raving like a deluded idiot

255
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,100
just because mean old bully Dr. Legume was rude to you,

256
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,520
and pointed out your obvious asshattery on the internet,

257
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,440
then you might as well just burn your card right fucking now,

258
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,360
because while Bob loves you, the rest of us think you're an asshole.

259
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,360
You don't need the subgenius church, you need a mother.

260
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,160
And if you see me as a mother figure, your father was a fag.

261
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,360
We don't owe you our support, endorsement, or our fellowship.

262
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,080
We will not sit idly by while you publicly attempt to buttfuck us.

263
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,900
You got your minister's card, you can go be a subgenius by your goddamn self

264
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,400
somewhere far from mean people who won't stroke your dick.

265
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,940
Membership has its privileges, but like I preached to you today,

266
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,260
it also has its burdens.

267
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,840
And a few as a subgenius would rather add to that burden

268
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,280
than to generate slack, then my message to you,

269
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,340
Mr. or Mrs. Butthurt Sack,

270
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,340
as a subgenius, is as follows.

271
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,220
Go fuck yourself, you worthless candy-ass cunt.

272
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:54,460
You're not sitting in the irradiated wreckage of your flood-ravaged town.

273
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,960
You're not picking through your tornado-blasted possessions

274
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,840
looking for your dead child.

275
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,280
You're not some fossilized guinea, frozen in perpetual pants-shitting terror

276
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,320
inside a 2,000-year-old lava rock.

277
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,320
Puzzling evidence that you're not a child,

278
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,140
but a child that's shot Dobbs in the head.

279
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,220
Consider yourself lucky if a little butt hurt is your heaviest burden.

280
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:19,860
Praise Bob.

281
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,660
Praise Bob!

282
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,520
Everyone give a hand for Dr. Legume!

283
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,660
Dr. Legume at the 2012 X-Day Drill.

284
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:43,960
Unfortunately, the broadcast radio audience had to hear a very heavily censored version.

285
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:50,280
As always, the uncut version is on subgenius.com in the radio podcast section.

286
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,040
The cackling woman heard in the background, incidentally, was Princess We Are Doe.

287
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,840
Incidentally, along with this show, number 1704,

288
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,060
I've assembled a third Legume tribute show that has so much cussin'

289
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,260
that there's no point in ruining it for broadcast.

290
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:16,020
So it's one of those internet-only shows, number 1704.5XXX,

291
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,800
available only on subgenius.com in the radio section.

292
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:30,000
But now, let's go all the way back over 22 years to 1996.

293
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,060
I'm gonna play this tape of an amazing,

294
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,680
a beautiful witnessing,

295
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,280
and some witlessnessing,

296
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:47,140
done as Dr. Legume guested on the Prozac Free Health Show there in beautiful Pennsylvania.

297
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,420
I think you're going to, uh,

298
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,640
I think you're gonna like this one, friends.

299
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,020
And praise Bob.

300
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,620
Hmm, brothers and sisters,

301
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,320
we had us a phone call here at the station

302
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,020
from some, some lukewarm Christian

303
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,060
who, who, who, who, who,

304
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,680
who, who, who, who, who believes that we're taking the Lord's name in vain.

305
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,940
He thinks we're blaspheming here.

306
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,940
Why, that silly fallback.

307
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,660
That silly fallback thinks he can, he can just call up here and argue

308
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,040
the, the, the, the points of our true version of Christianity,

309
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,280
the only true faith.

310
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,040
Say it, brother.

311
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,980
Oh, yeah.

312
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,020
Well, I challenge you, brother, to call back at 821-3456.

313
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,200
If you have some problem with our blaspheming,

314
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,520
you call back, brother.

315
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,380
I will go nose to nose with you live on the radio.

316
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,120
And, as it says in Ezekiel,

317
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,040
I will let the wild animals of the whole earth gorge themselves with you.

318
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,400
I will strew your flesh in the mountains

319
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,800
and fill the valleys with your carcass.

320
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,920
I will drain the land with your flowing blood up to the mountains.

321
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,360
Your choice is simple.

322
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,600
Join us and live in peace

323
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,160
or pursue your present course and face obliteration.

324
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,660
Yes, brothers and sisters, it's come down to this.

325
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,000
Fisticuffs of the religious sort.

326
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,520
Yes, let's get ready.

327
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,580
Yes, friends, right here on our phone line A,

328
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,140
on the other side of the world,

329
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,480
a man not quite satisfied with what we have to say about our Lord Jesus Christ.

330
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,400
And right here in the studio, the one, the only, millions killed,

331
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,120
millions more knocked out,

332
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,800
the Reverend Dr. Cajun Legume.

333
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,420
Here it comes.

334
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,840
Are you ready for the fight to end all fights?

335
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,360
Are you there, brother?

336
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,420
Excuse me?

337
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,420
Are you there, brother?

338
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,420
Hello.

339
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,100
Hello.

340
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:25,780
Yes?

341
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,460
Yes, I believe you have something you'd like to say about Jesus tonight.

342
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,940
Well, Jesus, first of all,

343
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,800
he plays a very important role in my life.

344
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,680
And let me tell you something.

345
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,300
Jesus is so important to me that I gave my life to Jesus.

346
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,700
What does that mean to you, son?

347
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,820
Doesn't mean a damn thing to me, brother.

348
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,360
Why not?

349
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,100
Why should I care what you do with your life?

350
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,960
You know what?

351
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,520
That attitude doesn't get you anywhere in life.

352
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,220
Yeah, at least I'm not a crackpot sitting at home on the radio

353
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,660
trying to call up here and give honest,

354
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,760
decent preachers a load of crap.

355
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,520
I just don't understand you, brothers,

356
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,200
if that's what I can call you.

357
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,020
All right, I can't take this.

358
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,080
You're playing me live on the radio.

359
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,640
I don't want this.

360
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,040
Oh, what's the matter, brother?

361
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,900
Isn't your faith in Jesus strong enough to keep you going?

362
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,120
It's there. It's there.

363
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,880
Are you afraid?

364
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,180
Are you one of these Christian apologists

365
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,180
who are afraid to tell everybody and defend their Jesus?

366
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,940
Let me tell you something about Jesus.

367
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,480
Don't even do that about Jesus.

368
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,620
I don't even want to say anything negative about Jesus.

369
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,240
What do you know of Jesus, you talking monkey?

370
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:33,980
Jesus?

371
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,980
Jesus saved me.

372
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,400
To the point where I was down in the dregs of society,

373
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,360
hanging out with people like you.

374
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,760
Brother, you couldn't hang around with people like me.

375
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,000
Excuse me?

376
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,720
You couldn't hang around with people like me.

377
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,940
Oh, well, excuse me.

378
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,820
Well, come now. Come on.

379
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,600
Just testify to me.

380
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,340
Tell me what I'm doing here that's so bad.

381
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,320
The blasphemous way you do Jesus,

382
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,900
that's what you're doing so bad.

383
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,840
The blasphemous way I do Jesus?

384
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,800
You're doing Jesus right now.

385
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,960
That's right. I'm doing Jesus right now.

386
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,680
This is incredible.

387
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,940
This is absolutely insane.

388
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,100
No more insane than you and your Jesus.

389
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,260
Your Jesus is just your invisible friend.

390
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,820
You grew up and gave him a name.

391
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,820
Your Jesus isn't the true Jesus.

392
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,280
Hmm. I'm sorry, friend.

393
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,820
Sorry I can't help you. I must sign off.

394
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,680
You're a coward.

395
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,260
Coward.

396
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,360
Oh, yes.

397
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,240
Oh, brothers.

398
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,220
Could you believe the audacity of people who would actually call up here?

399
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,340
No, he can't help us.

400
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,660
He cannot help us.

401
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,460
Brother Lagoum, he cannot help us because we help ourselves.

402
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,600
Yes, we do.

403
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,080
With the strength of the Lord, we help ourselves.

404
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,460
We don't need no namby-pamby church to tell us what to do.

405
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,600
We know the Lord.

406
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,900
We fight with the Lord.

407
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,160
We drink with the Lord.

408
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,500
We are the Lord.

409
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,240
Yes, friend.

410
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:58,960
Right here.

411
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,540
Come in and kiss the feet of God, my friend.

412
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,480
Phone number 821-3456.

413
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:12,680
This is by doubt, by any definition, by any scoring method, this is an undoubted knockout of unbelievable intensity.

414
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:25,120
Yes, the Reverend Dr. Cato Lagoon once again, once again, converting souls, saving the sinners, saving them from themselves, saving them from us, because I don't have to prep with that guy no longer.

415
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,280
91.7.

416
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,940
caus variety.

417
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,980
A conclusion continues in part 2 of the bitte .

418
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,940
WAYSU關 Monk

419
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,160
My God, my God!

420
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:41,540
It's

421
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:56,280
83, gimmicky!

422
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,900
We've come here because because you both believe there's a conspiracy some kind of

423
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:32,900
organization working against. Of course the word entheo from enthusiasm entheo means God in you.

424
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:38,180
Of course God gets in us by his word. We were fathered by the sperm of God's word the seed of

425
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:44,800
God's word. We became a child of God born again through this incorruptible seed. Of course faith

426
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,680
comes by hearing and really hearing what you've been hearing. Through his names his identifiable

427
00:23:52,900 --> 00:24:04,360
he had not revealed himself up to this time. You see Dr. Lagoon, you see Dr. Lagoon this is the kind of preaching our friend the caller listens to. The kind of preaching that makes no sense.

428
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:16,640
Hey that's right brother. Not even once in our broadcast have we asked anybody for money. But I guess that's what makes a true Christian. His willingness to part with both his mind and his soul.

429
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,800
Yes. We will not ask you to part with your money. But we will not deny it either because

430
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:31,340
thy who tide unto the Lord shall be as though is the Lord. Jesus has revealed himself to be.

431
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:41,400
from under the hem of his mighty raincoat. Be a man, brother. Amen. Do we have any Christians out there in the audience tonight who

432
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,760
don't agree with us? Do we have any faltions Christians out there. As it appears to get down into your spirit.

433
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,200
who think that we're blaspheming cause they don't agree with us?

434
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,880
and then they대�ce

435
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,100
Are there any out there who wish to kill us for our sin?

436
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,580
Hello?

437
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,840
WMUH, you're speaking with Jesus.

438
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,800
Greater glory.

439
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,000
Glory to God.

440
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,340
Speaking of God who's in you.

441
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,060
He's in you.

442
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,760
He's really in you.

443
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,000
You may not be able to feel it slowly.

444
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,800
Moving.

445
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,400
He's always kind of moving.

446
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,280
Oh, Father, let us pray.

447
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:38,200
Father Jesus, we pray that you will speak your word to these lukewarm Christians who are out there in the radio audience tonight.

448
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:45,800
And I'd like you to put a little special anointing upon all the colored people because they have a hell of a time.

449
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,800
And I'd like to thank you, God, for guns.

450
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,600
We may.

451
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,960
Protect ourselves from the infidels.

452
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:01,220
Now, if the Hittites had had firearms, the Bible would have been an entirely different book.

453
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,940
And we preach that book, that book which never was but should have been.

454
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,080
Oh, yes, brother.

455
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,320
Oh, yes.

456
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,420
If only the Israelites had been given guns.

457
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:18,420
If only God and his wisdom had given automatic weapons to the Israelites then instead of now.

458
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,840
If only the Canaanites had nuclear technology.

459
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,980
Oh, yes, brothers.

460
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,300
Oh, yes, sisters.

461
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,700
When there's a storm.

462
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,260
Oh, it would have been beautiful.

463
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,100
But the Lord had a different plan.

464
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,280
A plan of strife.

465
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,100
It's easy to fly.

466
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,060
A plan of hardship.

467
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,700
A plan of sorrow.

468
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,820
A plan stained red with blood.

469
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,720
And you don't know how to use the blood of the infidels.

470
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,040
The blood of the sinners.

471
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,580
The blood of the pious.

472
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,500
The blood of the lukewarm.

473
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,900
The blood of the homosexuals and the homo sapiens alike.

474
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,040
The monkey boys.

475
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:54,960
Yes.

476
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,700
Those who'd walk on all fours.

477
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,740
What is the law?

478
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,240
The law is not to walk on all fours.

479
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,580
But yet you would dare.

480
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,540
In some weird sexual perverseness to get down upon all fours and disgrace our Lord.

481
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,460
What is the law?

482
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,860
Not to endlessly expose the law.

483
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,740
What is the law?

484
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,360
Are we not men?

485
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,500
What is the...

486
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,880
Oh, brothers and sisters.

487
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,860
Oh, brothers and sisters.

488
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:22,860


489
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,120
We just had a visitor here in the studio.

490
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,820
From that earnest young Christian who was talking to us on the phone earlier.

491
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,700
He came and gave me his much-worn copy of the New Testicle.

492
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,700
I mean the New Testament.

493
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:34,860
It's...

494
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,480
He said that I need it more than him.

495
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,100
And I really do, brothers and sisters.

496
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,500
Because I was just in the john and they were running a little short on paper in there.

497
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,160
And not only that, but sometimes when I run out of Marlboros, I like to roll my own cigarettes.

498
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,680
And these little thin crispy rice papers are just New Testament.

499
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,500
Oh, yeah.

500
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,360
They just work like a charm.

501
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,260
I'm so happy that we could PO a few people out there tonight.

502
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:06,540
I'm so happy that somewhere there's an angry Christian listening to this.

503
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,640
An angry false Christian.

504
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,440
The ones who think they know Jesus.

505
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,820
The ones who weren't the money-grubbing Jesus.

506
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,300
Oh, brothers and sisters.

507
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,660
I'm so glad that that earnest young man came in here to see us.

508
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:22,660


509
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:22,660


510
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:22,660


511
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:22,660


512
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:22,660


513
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:22,660


514
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:22,660


515
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:22,660


516
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:22,660


517
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:22,660


518
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,260
I'm so glad that he set me straight.

519
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,520
He's right.

520
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,340
He's right.

521
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,460
I do need to...

522
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,820
I do need to relieve the burden of my sins and my wallet.

523
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,900
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.

524
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,980
And in that spirit, I've got a small public service announcement for you.

525
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,280
From Exodus, you shall not permit the female sorcerer to live.

526
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,660
And I guess that means anyone who will turn a trick.

527
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,220
Whoever curses his mother or father shall be put to death.

528
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,600
Anyone who has sexual relations with an animal must be put to death.

529
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,000
Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall be put to death.

530
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,680
One who blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be put to death.

531
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:14,480
Now, I wouldn't go and tell any of you to go out there and put the Lord's enemies to death.

532
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,600
I wouldn't tell you to go out and kill any of the infidels.

533
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,680
But rest assured, if God were here in this studio,

534
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,200
I would be there to help you.

535
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,440
He would.

536
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,320
Can I get an amen?

537
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,320
Amen!

538
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,000
Can I get a hallelujah?

539
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,540
Hallelujah!

540
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,780
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.

541
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,180
What I am going to say will shock you.

542
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,200
It will disturb your sleep.

543
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,680
It will make you worry for your loved ones.

544
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,600
It will give you nightmares of disaster, plague, and horrible death.

545
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,260
It will make you rethink the priorities of your life.

546
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,720
It will change the way you look at yourself and the world.

547
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,200
There is a killer loose in the last hour.

548
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,360
And the killer cuts down all that he touches.

549
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,460
If he touches you, you will die.

550
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,720
If he touches your child, your child will die.

551
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,060
His victims die a slow, horrible death.

552
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,780
They waste away.

553
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,720
They drown in their own bodily fluids.

554
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,780
They lose control of their bowels.

555
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,860
They lose their memories.

556
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,840
They become demented.

557
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,640
They die in agony.

558
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,540
There is nothing that can be done to save them.

559
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,680
That killer's name is Jesus Christ.

560
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,480
The false Jesus.

561
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,840
When he starts to kill you, it is said that you are a heathen.

562
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,460
An insensate meat puppet with no soul.

563
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,460
An occupant on an earth ship heading headlong into Armageddon.

564
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:48,840
This killer and his cult of followers first emerged on the American scene almost 500 years ago.

565
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,620
Rising like an angel.

566
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:59,380
An angel of gritting death out of the oozing rivers of bodily fluids that spilled like fetid waterfalls into the streets of our beloved America.

567
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:06,340
From the sick and sleazy pleasure houses of the killer Jesus and his twisted Christian cult.

568
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:16,260
Yet despite this heinous assault on all of the good and pure and virtuous traditions that made America a shining beacon of freedom to all of the world.

569
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,840
The authorities have done nothing to stop this terror.

570
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,700
For washing over this great land like a sea of evil blood.

571
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,460
In fact, the leaders that you elected are aiding and abetting their cause.

572
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,080
Claiming these evil false Christians have the same rights as regular people.

573
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:43,000
Our elected officials are daring to let these freaks and perverts hide behind the protection of the Constitution of the United States.

574
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,700
Most of the government's efforts have been directed towards protecting the freedom of religion.

575
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:53,440
Of this cult of immoral and unscrupulous sex-madding fiends.

576
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,460
Rather than toward the total annihilation that these scum deserve.

577
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,320
The government withholds vital information about this false Christ which could save millions of lives.

578
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,900
By their acts of commission and omission they have become in effect the protectors and guardians of this cult of death.

579
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,480
And its blond haired blue eyed leader, Jesus Christ.

580
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,580
And as such they may well become your murderers.

581
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,780
Or your child's murderers.

582
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:31,500
It has been speculated that between 80 and 90% of children that disappear from our homes due to kidnapping.

583
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:37,420
Are converted to this false Christian faith by means of drugs, torture and starvation.

584
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:43,640
These children are smuggled out of the country and sent to one of the cult's overseas slave labor camps.

585
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,600
Cruel sweatshops.

586
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,100
Where children are forced to spend 16 hours a day making fake miracle trinkets.

587
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,500
Which their false prophet leader, Jesus, peddles to his followers.

588
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,740
Making over 17 billion dollars in 1993.

589
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:05,440
Many of the children are sent to Thailand to stock the false Christ's many brothels.

590
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,200
Some are sent to one of the 13 Christ town training centers to be indoctrinated.

591
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,000
To learn the dark secrets of their cult.

592
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,160
And to work in the jungle laboratories manufacturing crack.

593
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:26,480
How many innocent people must die so that the sick sex games of these pervert false Christians can continue.

594
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:33,660
How long must we wait before the police and the military take matters into their own hands and stop this madness.

595
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,560
What can you do to save your family and your country from this deadly menace?

596
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,420
There's a lot you can do.

597
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,980
If you live in a rural area or small town.

598
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,600
That has preserved traditional American values.

599
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,740
Stay there.

600
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,940
Watch your family for signs of disobedience or strange behavior.

601
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,080
Stay away from the television.

602
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,560
It has become infested with subliminal messages that lure you and your loved ones into the cult.

603
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,880
Do not go to airports alone.

604
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,040
If you must, however, be sure not to drink anything.

605
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,660
Bring bottled water.

606
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:13,560
Many airport water supplies are tainted by the Christian's evil hallucinogenic crack.

607
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:20,020
Teams of Christians work at every airport in America waiting for the drug to take effect.

608
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:26,220
Loading their helpless victims into waiting planes while airport officials and the FAA do nothing.

609
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,560
Make your children stay at home after school.

610
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,560
If they try to sneak out, beat them severely.

611
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:38,400
This is very important as this blood cult of evil targets places where teens congregate.

612
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,080
Shopping malls are among the best recruiting grounds for young people to be lured into.

613
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:53,180
And that's where Hour of Slack number 546 from 1996 comes to the end of site one of that cassette tape.

614
00:34:53,400 --> 00:35:02,120
By the way, almost all of the Hours of Slack from number one to 700 or something are on Reverend David Bauchner's archive,

615
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,700
which you can find via the radio section of subgenius.com.

616
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,000
Hundreds of hours of Slack.

617
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,020
Reverend Steve Sinek has been copying the very oldest from my cassette master,

618
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,260
so the stash of ancient shows is now almost complete.

619
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:27,660
But now back to Dr. Legume with Dr. Howell and me at the Ex Day Drill of 2013.

620
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,620
All that stuff.

621
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:35,800
Well, I kind of envision subgenius heaven as being a place with lots of broken glass.

622
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,760
Well, you keep going on about this broken glass thing.

623
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,980
Didn't you have a subgenius?

624
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,560
There was a sermon that went on for hours and hours about the planet of broken glass.

625
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,800
That is true.

626
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:50,840
Years ago, which I've completely forgotten every detail about except that phrase.

627
00:35:51,240 --> 00:36:01,080
Well, both heaven, subgenius heaven and hell and the escape vessels and all that could be broken glass if you really wanted it to be.

628
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,460
Well, sure.

629
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,600
Well, go for it.

630
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,560
Or railroad spikes.

631
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,960
Go for it, Katahdin.

632
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,720
Yeah.

633
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,960
Well, I guess I could just tell about the planet of broken glass.

634
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:10,960


635
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,760
And you could just fill in the noun of your choice or your necro-destination or whatever.

636
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,860
But the planet of broken glass was made entirely of broken glass.

637
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:23,580
Yes.

638
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,880
And everyone on the planet weighed 500 pounds.

639
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:28,780
Oh, my God.

640
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,400
It's a big one.

641
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,820
And they would walk around all day on broken glass.

642
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:40,140
And every day at 4 o'clock for an hour, it would rain alcohol.

643
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,280
Oh, the Goldilocks Zone, they call them.

644
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,120
Yes.

645
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:44,320
Oh, yeah.

646
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,820
That's a happy place.

647
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:57,240
And not only would they have to cut themselves coming into contact with everything, but the people of the planet of broken glass can never die.

648
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:07,780
Even if they cut off a section of their foot and dropped it on the ground, they would feel that pain.

649
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,120
And that foot would have just lay there in the broken glass.

650
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,800
And that foot would have just lay there in the broken glass in pain forever.

651
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,800
Throbbing.

652
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:25,360
And even as the course of time wears you down to just one little sliver of meat left, all of those previous slivers of meat on all those little jagged pieces of glass are going to be there suffering for you.

653
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:25,940
Quivering.

654
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:30,080
And at 4 o'clock when it rains, it's just unspeakable.

655
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,000
Oh, and there's nothing to eat on the planet of broken glass except each other.

656
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,440
And broken glass.

657
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,660
And broken glass.

658
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,100
You know, a lot of people don't eat broken glass.

659
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,100


660
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,860
A lot of my carnival friends do eat broken glass.

661
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,080
And apparently you can eat broken glass.

662
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,220
The glass from like the light tubes.

663
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,000
Yeah, you can.

664
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:48,560
The fluorescent lights.

665
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,120
They eat light bulbs and stuff.

666
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,740
Does the planet of broken glass have any bananas on it at all?

667
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,060
There...

668
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:59,220
Because that's what you eat before you eat the glass and after you eat the glass.

669
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,100
Maybe if they're bananas made out of glass, they got broken.

670
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,180
There are bananas, but they are made out of broken glass.

671
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,820
And they got broken too, so.

672
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,700
To those wacky subgeniuses.

673
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,100
None of them are real.

674
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:15,920
Now let's go to the very most recent recordings of Dr. Legume at X-Day, this time from 2017's

675
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,940
20X Day Drill.

676
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:26,320
Here, we hear the mischievous doctor co-spouting with the newer, younger subgenius radio doctors,

677
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,080
Reverend Argus Fox and Reverend Pease.

678
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,680
Well, Pease isn't younger.

679
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,780
Younger than me, but not much.

680
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:40,080
This is an example of Legume at his interpersonal body.

681
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:55,580
Well, I mean...

682
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,860
Sem optimal of A.

683
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,060
I'd also love to work out like his mass присout...

684
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,060


685
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,060


686
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,060


687
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,060


688
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,400
DNA. You went right for the semen

689
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,260
peas. You know, there's DNA

690
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,880
in things other than semen.

691
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,140
I mean, maybe that's not from, you know,

692
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,420
the crimes you've committed.

693
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,260
But they have it in hair and everything now,

694
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,920
man. It's the new improved

695
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,300
DNA. It's not that old light DNA.

696
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,900
This DNA is

697
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,840
DNA classic.

698
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,620
DNA now with more nickel.

699
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,980
Even animals have DNA now, bees.

700
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,200
It's not just your parents' DNA

701
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,000
anymore. Well, but

702
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,980
still, DNA encompasses what

703
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,320
two aspects of the human body.

704
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,180
DNA

705
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,260
is mingled and exchanged

706
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,000
via what two

707
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,740
I mean,

708
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,160
I drank a bucket of DNA,

709
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,140
but it was like skin cells

710
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,300
and stem cells and blood.

711
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,240
Is it closer by the bucket

712
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,580
or by the glass?

713
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,800
If you add ice to it and put it in the blender, it makes

714
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,360
awesome fucking Bloody Mary.

715
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,980
I'm doubtful of that.

716
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,400
Dr. Mr. Sister's not here. We didn't get to have

717
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:07,640
our

718
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:07,900
our

719
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,540
Toilet, our human DNA Bloody Mary bar

720
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,460
then. He was here briefly, but

721
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,260
there was very briefly. There was

722
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,260
no Bloody Mary. Tell us more about your

723
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,860
buckets of semen fantasy.

724
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,660
No, I mean,

725
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,120
you really, I mean, you got right through the

726
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,440
semen, man. What's the deal?

727
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,280
It was kind of like those sensory deprivation

728
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,140
pods that you float in saltwater,

729
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,200
but he just closes the door in the bathtub

730
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,380
and throws it in his own chest.

731
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,360
Straw man thing in reverse on me.

732
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,420
I'm not having any. I just want to know

733
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,140
about the semen.

734
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,780
I mean, come on, man.

735
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:43,420
I want to know where it is that this comes from, man, so that we can talk you through this.

736
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,760
Well, it started with Argus' story about being chewy.

737
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:49,360
We need to establish a safe place for you where you can just be comfortable and be yourself,

738
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,620
and nobody will ever challenge you on your tastes and semen.

739
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,160
Well, we've all seen it.

740
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:56,840
That's not true.

741
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,040
Well, we have to establish a safe space for you, Pease.

742
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,260
I mean, if not, you're going to have to come up here and put up with all of our macroaggression.

743
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,940
You have jumped to a lot of conclusions.

744
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:11,380
Please bring your buckets of DNA to the main stage by 7 p.m.

745
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:16,980
You know, I mean, sometimes that look in the ugly mirror.

746
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,460
Let me know when you're done going on about the 15 minutes about my fascination with sperm by telling me about it.

747
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,260
Let me know when you're done.

748
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,560
Well, my fascination is with sperm.

749
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,560
My fascination is with your fascination for sperm.

750
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,460
Hey, you know what Pease has in common with that bird?

751
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,640
They both swallow.

752
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,800
Reverend Pease here seems to think that DNA only exists in sperm.

753
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,540
Can you throw the line again one more time?

754
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,940
How do magnets work?

755
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,940
How do magnets work?

756
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,240
Ask Lagoon.

757
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,420
He seems full of knowledge.

758
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,960
How do magnets work, Dr. Lagoon?

759
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,480
Hey, Bucket of Semen boy, tell me more about the Lord Jesus Christ.

760
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,820
I would know nothing about him.

761
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,860
Did the Lord Jesus Christ have anything to do with it?

762
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,000
I mean, did the Padre, like, take you out in the back of the woodshed behind the Catholic church

763
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,400
and be like, I need you to clean out the church's semen bucket?

764
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,560
Does everybody else know you left the church?

765
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:03,900
Does everybody else know you left the church?

766
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,840
Does everybody else know you left the church?

767
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:05,920
Does everybody else know you left the church?

768
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,200
I thought that was something between the two of us.

769
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:08,940
You know, yeah.

770
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,400
He used to be my priest.

771
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,220
I left the church after I heard the police sirens.

772
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:14,620
Father Lagoon.

773
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,940
Oh, you want to see ventriloquism subgenius style?

774
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:18,960
Oh, yes, please.

775
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,160
I would like you to open to a page in this book.

776
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,100
Do not involve me in your shit, Lagoon.

777
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,300
I would like you to open to a page in this book and read me a paragraph.

778
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,480
I shall not.

779
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:28,780
Any paragraph.

780
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,720
I choose not to participate.

781
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,060
Come on, Pease.

782
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,840
Be a sport.

783
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,400
Nope.

784
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:33,760
A paragraph.

785
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,320
You're assuming he can read.

786
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:35,840
That's right.

787
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,120
Thank you for shaming me with my illiteracy on the air.

788
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,540
You know, I appreciate it.

789
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:47,520
Like a voracious swarm of piranhas, the scarlet little monsters converged on Whitey and tore him apart.

790
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,660
As the blood filled the water, other things were attracted.

791
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:58,640
There were glimpses of fenced, serpentine backs and vast, amorphous shadows beneath the churning waves.

792
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:02,620
To those who watched, the eternal light above them seemed deceptive.

793
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,740
Subjectively, they were aware of the dark unknown.

794
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,860
Whose hand is up his ass right now and making him do this?

795
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:10,280
Right?

796
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,520
Whose hand is up his ass right now and making him move around like this?

797
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,180
My hand.

798
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,660
Watch me drink a glass of water.

799
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,400
It's really great.

800
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,520
Let's do it again.

801
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,980
For my next drink.

802
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,340
It's really irritating.

803
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,080
I don't need your pity claps, you bastards.

804
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:28,300
One time, I was in a room with a guy and a preacher.

805
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,640
And the guy was drinking a beer and talking to the preacher.

806
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,320
And they were all being real polite and stuff.

807
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,680
But when the preacher started going on.

808
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,240
About Jesus.

809
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,740
I started doing that ventriloquism trick.

810
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,440
Where I start following everything he says.

811
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,100
Just like.

812
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:42,740
Exactly.

813
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,420
Like Ernie is doing right now.

814
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,180
And I pissed that guy so off.

815
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,880
He pissed him off so much.

816
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,020
He picked up a beer bottle.

817
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,900
And was about to hit me in the head with it.

818
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,620
And I said, Jesus would forgive me for that.

819
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,120
And I forgive you.

820
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:57,960
Woody.

821
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,280
Do you think he would?

822
00:43:59,480 --> 00:43:59,780
I forget.

823
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,060
He who is without sin.

824
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,300
I think Jesus would be like, hey bro.

825
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,660
You just hit my bro with the head in the bottle.

826
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,400
You got to leave the party.

827
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:07,940
I'm sorry.

828
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,740
A really great fun thing to do.

829
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:15,040
Is to piss off a Christian enough to where they're about to smack you.

830
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,300
And then forgive them.

831
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,740
Oh man, that burns their wire.

832
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,220
That seems like a lot of work for very little payoff.

833
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,500
Oh, it's a hoot.

834
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,160
Your parents said the same thing.

835
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,300
That's what they called him.

836
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,000
Little payoff.

837
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,180
They used him for the rent the first month.

838
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,560
One day, P's will find your way.

839
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,080
Real parents.

840
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:36,720
They got me back.

841
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,800
He had his first job at three months old on the internet.

842
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,260
P's is the human version of the movie Homeward Bound.

843
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,320
He's just looking to get home.

844
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,360
But he's going to get there to find out that his dog parents have already gone.

845
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,380
Did you bring me any candy?

846
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,680
Who brought who candy?

847
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,580
Animal brought candy for everyone.

848
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,420
In a van?

849
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,420
In a van.

850
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,760
A van full of candy.

851
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,120
It's down by the river right now.

852
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,240
A candy van.

853
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,280
I brought puppies.

854
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,460
Too many puppies.

855
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,980
You brought puppies?

856
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,200
Eating chocolate.

857
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,880
Oh, wait a minute.

858
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,820
You weren't at...

859
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,340
Were you at the saucer site yesterday?

860
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,720
When they were supposed to land?

861
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,040
And now she has puppies.

862
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,180
Hmm.

863
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,000
Too many conspiracies are afoot today.

864
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,860
One X day, someone gets a robot alien radio clone baby.

865
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,600
Another X day comes and a female subgenius has puppies.

866
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:33,000
You know, one thing we learned on the Thursday in urine podcast is that it's always good to have somebody eating something in the background right on mic.

867
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,480
Mmm.

868
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:34,860
Mmm.

869
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:35,680
Mmm.

870
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:36,540
Mmm.

871
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,100
Delicious.

872
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:38,720
Oh.

873
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,240
Mmm.

874
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:46,140
That was the late Dr. LeGuime with Reverend Fox and Reverend Susie the Floozy at Tarzan's

875
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:52,640
radio station in front of a live audience at Wisteria Event Center where we hold these

876
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,980
X day drills.

877
00:45:54,460 --> 00:46:02,380
We'll close with this surreal stretch of ESO Swamp Radio from November 2011, shortly after

878
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,460
Dr. LeGuime had gotten out of the hospital.

879
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,320
He was in the hospital for diverticulitis.

880
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:16,340
Other voices are the host, the late Chaz Smith, the early Lunsum Cowboy Dave, and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

881
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:21,140
This segment was titled, LeGuime's Blowhole.

882
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,400
So, Dr. LeGuime, you've been in the hospital.

883
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:34,340
There was some sort of horrible conspiracy implantation place where they stick the medicine in you.

884
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:34,440
I think my doctor is back in the hospital today.

885
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,760
I'm a little evil troll living in my gut.

886
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,360
Yeah, they made him drink the radioactive sperm.

887
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:40,480
Two gallons of it.

888
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,160
Did you have to go to the, what do they call it, the scan?

889
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,480
The, where they put you in there and your MRI?

890
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,580
It turns you into an egg.

891
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,580
It actually turns you into an egg.

892
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,940
It turns you completely into an egg.

893
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,320
It fertilizes you.

894
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,120
Like a poultry ovum.

895
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:53,720
Really?

896
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:53,960
Yeah.

897
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:54,700
Wow, man.

898
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:54,900
Right.

899
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:56,880
Well, his brains are already scrambled.

900
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:56,880


901
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:56,900
So that's what he's got.

902
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,500
He's got something growing in him now.

903
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:03,600
It's because it's going to slowly devour him from within.

904
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,360
We've always had this.

905
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:04,420
We've always had this.

906
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:08,660
I understood that Dr. Legume was himself the larval form of something greater.

907
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,780
The cocoon itself is actually made of something greater.

908
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:15,080
Like an ugly caterpillar will later turn into a beautiful butterfly.

909
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:25,100
Dr. Legume may well turn into a giant 900-foot-tall robot with a clear glass case around a tiny little legume brain.

910
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,900
There's that thread once again.

911
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,520
It controls Dreadnought.

912
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,480
The glass-eyed thread.

913
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,900
You remember that future, don't you?

914
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:33,380
You really don't know what's coming.

915
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:33,680
No.

916
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,040
You don't want to go in that door.

917
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,780
You don't know what the future holds, my friend.

918
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,360
No.

919
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:37,740
You...

920
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:40,420
Do you want to go through that door without guidance?

921
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,800
Do you want to go through that door alone?

922
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,640
You just...

923
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,900
It might be a drop-off, a mighty drop-off into nothingness.

924
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,300
Oh, no.

925
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:46,340
Oh, no.

926
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:49,760
Or it could be the door into the treasure trove of the gods.

927
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,580
Don't you want to go through that door with Bob at your side, my friend?

928
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,280
They might replace your whole body.

929
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,160
You don't want that.

930
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,320
No, no.

931
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,780
You must accept the Bob with your entire...

932
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,560
I'll never understand clowns either.

933
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,400
The evil is the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to

934
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:04,620
bring the crown to the God of the Fire.

935
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:08,120
The evil clown, though, has become a stereotype in the priests.

936
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,780
He's quite an icon of the nation.

937
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,960
In fact, I think I Want You, Uncle Sam should be a crying clown with sharp credit cards

938
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:16,320
everywhere.

939
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
He brings back memories of war cards.

940
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,360
I thought she said plowds that time.

941
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,360
It's clowns.

942
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,120
Oh, plows.

943
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,100
I thought it was, like, snowplows.

944
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,320
They're raining snow, so you know plows.

945
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:34,360
What is with you guys in this closet?

946
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,560
It's a death cult, man.

947
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,860
It's like a death cult.

948
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,200
We would like a crazy French woman to come in and pop, pop, pop.

949
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:45,200
It's Claudine Lachey recordings and 44 Magnum revolvers.

950
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,420
That's because Stan didn't hear Hell Hole.

951
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,340
Well, yeah.

952
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:50,700
Really?

953
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,560
You didn't hear Hell Hole?

954
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,920
No, I'm sorry, Matt.

955
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,300
I guess I'm just not in with the in crowd lately.

956
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,740
We have to play Hell Hole then.

957
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:03,880
This is all 10 Claudine Lachey songs that we collected.

958
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,940
They're played at the same time.

959
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:09,240
This is 12-tone berserk old panty underhose.

960
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,100
This is like, you know.

961
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,120
And that's kind of how it goes, but the ending is really good.

962
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,260
How it goes.

963
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,200
You know, like it goes.

964
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:20,760
Yeah.

965
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,680
You can kind of whistle that tune, right?

966
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:25,200
Could you cop all those changes, Mr. Smarty-ass?

967
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,120
Here's the last minute.

968
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:31,920
Stravinsky, man.

969
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:33,520
Night of Spring.

970
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,900
Good night.

971
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,700
Good night.

972
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,420
Good night.

973
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,680
Good night.

974
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,300
Good night.

975
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:57,720
Good night.

976
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:57,840
Good night.

977
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,200
Good night.

978
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,240
사람이

979
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,160
with happiness

980
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,040
and

981
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,940
That's genius, man.

982
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:07,720
That's genius.

983
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,640
You can get grants for writing that kind of stuff, you know.

984
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,280
It is a deconditioning agent.

985
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:20,720
If you listen to the MKUltra tapes and gone very much into what they do at Fort Meade and stuff with a lot of the subjects,

986
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,340
this will actually reprogram and recondition a subject.

987
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,840
Like, we're not talking about math.

988
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,180
Fort Meade?

989
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:27,920
Yeah.

990
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,360
How much did I charge for that there?

991
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,280
Oh, I think it's like $175 just to get there.

992
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:36,320
How many months did you spend writing that composition?

993
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:40,020
Oh, it's been something I've been working on my entire life.

994
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:40,480
Yeah.

995
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:41,480
I can tell.

996
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,580
And I'm damn near 12.

997
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,480
I can tell.

998
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:44,740
It's like one of those whale songs.

999
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,280
It's the song of his life.

1000
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,460
Well, that should get you on a 10-year track.

1001
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:51,840
Well, I'm also a 12-year-old whale, and that is the song of my life.

1002
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:00,460
So you're saying that you have been tortured and harassed and spied upon and stalked by kind of a willowy, wispy French woman with a luger?

1003
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:01,540
That was post-war.

1004
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,260
That was post-war.

1005
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,000
Go past Lilith.

1006
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:07,500
Mostly I've been chased down by boatloads of Japanese men with harpoons.

1007
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:12,960
I thought you were going to say Japanese women and mean Korean women at the spa.

1008
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:15,080
Of course not.

1009
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:18,180
No, you've been taking that stuff again.

1010
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:21,100
That stuff again.

1011
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,800
You know what it is, don't you?

1012
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,220
I'm a sperm whale.

1013
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,640
Yes, you are a sperm whale.

1014
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,800
You know what it is, don't you?

1015
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,460
Look at that fish sperm whale.

1016
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,480
I'm a sperm whale.

1017
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,520
Look at that man.

1018
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,460
I'm not a human.

1019
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,300
I'm a sperm whale.

1020
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,840
I am a sperm whale.

1021
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,380
That blowhole is smooth.

1022
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,360
And it's just the right size.

1023
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:45,640
I think I know what we could take all of his fat to make little candies.

1024
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,440
There's just a couple of little bristly hairs around the edge of it.

1025
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,340
Oh, yeah.

1026
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,040
Oh, look at the hairs on his chest.

1027
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,600
I have never seen such a hairy whale.

1028
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:51,960
She blows.

1029
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,940
You wouldn't use the blowhole of a male whale.

1030
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,920
Nothing queer about old duckling.

1031
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,600
Call me the Gourmet.

1032
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:05,380
Yes, there was me, I, and Moby Stick.

1033
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,000
Lost as we were on the...

1034
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,420
He's right there.

1035
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,420
No, but put it out.

1036
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,760
It's a couple minutes till.

1037
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,960
That's as out as...

1038
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,620
Put the bat outside.

1039
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,320
My God, man.

1040
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,940
Put the outside where it belongs.

1041
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:29,880
Peel private bat off of your face and quit letting it make love to your throat and put it out.

1042
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:30,800
It is not.

1043
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,440
Put the bat out.

1044
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,020
Put it out in the hallway or someplace.

1045
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:33,960
It's bat cave.

1046
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,120
In the bat room or whatever.

1047
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,700
It is an operation.

1048
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,020
We should let it loose here.

1049
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,620
Maybe it could eat some of my blowhole lice.

1050
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,540
Those, uh...

1051
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:44,660
I'm not sure if you're on the right track.

1052
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:51,040
You know, Doctor, like you, in some countries, blowhole lice are considered a delicacy and are baked with chocolate.

1053
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,380
Covered with chocolate after they're baking.

1054
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,840
They feed them milk and water.

1055
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,860
That is a country where the bats walk like men.

1056
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:01,420
They want the nits to be extra large so that they can...

1057
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,460
They make their way into their bodies as well.

1058
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,700
...where the bats walk like men.

1059
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:09,680
Sometimes the bats, the meaning is diffused.

1060
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,120
The radar becomes confused.

1061
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:17,880
The sonar bounces off other caves and confuses and afflicts them.

1062
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,040
They fly.

1063
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:24,160
They flutter this way and that way, banging into the walls until all of them are dead.

1064
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:27,580
What is wrong with this picture?

1065
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,240
Why has nature and man forsaken us?

1066
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:31,400
Why has nature and man forsaken us?

1067
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:33,700
Why has nature and man forsaken us?

1068
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,860
Well, that's very po-poetic of you.

1069
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,680
Very, very po-poetic.

1070
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:38,120
Dave.

1071
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,700
But what does it mean?

1072
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:40,780
It means that...

1073
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,100
What...

1074
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:41,960
Shouldn't this...

1075
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,320
How does this help us?

1076
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,400
How does this bring any...

1077
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,600
The animals have lost their reason.

1078
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:47,520
...meaning into our lives?

1079
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:47,980
The animals have lost their reason.

1080
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,560
The people have lost their reason.

1081
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:52,360
Because is that not finally what we...

1082
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,180
Lagumes blowhole knows.

1083
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:53,920
...need, meaning?

1084
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,400
You have to ask Lagumes blowhole.

1085
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,000
Ask...

1086
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,940
That's just blowhole.

1087
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:00,160
...the blue pill and come down my blowhole.

1088
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,160
This week on Ask Lagoon's Blowhole.

1089
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:06,200
Lagoon, I mean Lagoon's Blowhole.

1090
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,580
The answer, my friend, is blowing out his hole.

1091
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:11,960
Who is responsible for the crash of Flight 103?

1092
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,060
The answer is blowing out his hole.

1093
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,460
Well, that wasn't a very, very, very cogent answer.

1094
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:24,660
For someone as wise and beyond his ears as yourselves.

1095
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,480
Each and every one of you have a responsibility to answer now.

1096
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:32,900
Now, please, please, please.

1097
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,300
Please, blowhole, tell us.

1098
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,680
Blowhole, tell us.

1099
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:42,480
Speak, oh magic blowhole.

1100
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,720
He sits in the middle of my back playing the flute.

1101
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,960
The blowhole flute.

1102
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,360
The blowhole will not speak to us, has it forsaken us?

1103
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:53,340
The blowhole flute is one of the strangest instruments.

1104
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,280
The blowhole is a false prophet.

1105
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,460
You are fools to follow the blowhole.

1106
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,140
He lies, he lies.

1107
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,780
Come with me and I will show you lies which you will call truth.

1108
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,620
He is an infidel, he is a wacky, he is lies.

1109
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,480
He is a mentirass.

1110
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,060
Abandon the shot hole and go to the blowhole.

1111
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,280
As we see the denizens making their way towards the blowhole,

1112
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:21,780
the last alarm has been sounded and there's the evacuator.

1113
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,600
It looks like the helicopter is coming down now,

1114
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,860
but they're still marching on.

1115
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:27,460
They're not stopping like little lambs, like tiny little lambs.

1116
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,460
The last remnants of the human race.

1117
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:28,460


1118
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:28,460


1119
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:28,460


1120
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:28,460


1121
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,160
The human race descended down into the vast blowhole

1122
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:39,780
of the huge slumbering legume beast that the earth had become.

1123
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,280
It's a hoax, my friend.

1124
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:49,780
Floating in space, beached against Jupiter.

1125
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,920
The great creature knew the end had come.

1126
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,460
The distance of glistening off the rise of the sun.

1127
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,240
The

1128
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:19,260
He was attended by hegemonistic momentators, doctors and scientists,

1129
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:24,120
specialists of all ages, specialists of all degree and kind,

1130
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,360
who surrounded the blowhole and flicked at it with little scrapbooks,

1131
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,460
and little pieces of tin cards.

1132
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:39,080
The least of specials existed only for the sole purpose of cleaving the edges of the blowhole.

1133
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,860
Down in the...

1134
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:50,160
I'll pay tribute to the mighty blowhole of Claudine Léger.

1135
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:56,420
I licked Claudine's blowhole.

1136
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,260
I had a t-shirt like that for my...

1137
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:58,960
I went on vacation.

1138
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,940
You got a I Licked Claudine's Blowhole t-shirt, man?

1139
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,320
You never...

1140
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,240
Oh, man, I wish you had not only shown it to...

1141
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,340
You gotta get a lap dance to get it.

1142
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,660
You have to get...

1143
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:08,820
If they give it to you with the lap dance.

1144
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,360
Is she still doing lap dances?

1145
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,360
I thought she was getting...

1146
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,100
She's kind of falling down in the arches.

1147
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,000
How much the whales do the lap dance.

1148
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,580
Ah, I see why your legs look so paralyzed and stiff.

1149
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:18,540
Or is that just...

1150
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:22,800
As they loll upon the beach before they die...

1151
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:26,760
Around the world, whales are beaching and dying.

1152
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,000
The viruses are everywhere.

1153
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:36,560
Committing suicides so that their great intelligence will no longer be exposed to the poisoning...

1154
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,060
Soon, that smelly fat will cover the beaches.

1155
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,840
...of the seas that covered the planet.

1156
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,200
The flotsam and Jetsam will blow everywhere.

1157
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,100
Legumes...

1158
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,000
And huge, huge bones will bleach in the sunlight.

1159
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:49,220
Whale.

1160
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:50,500
Whales.

1161
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,940
Hey, please, could you pass me the quill?

1162
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,040
Have you seen the white whale?

1163
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,760
Yes, friends, you have just heard...

1164
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,160
A listener's choice by Farrell Edmonds...

1165
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,380
Till next week.

1166
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,000
...Hillen, Ivory Stinks, Charles Smiths...

1167
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,320
Keep your head on tight.

1168
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:04,520
...and there's a sparse and colored...

1169
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,200
You're back to the wind and you're sacking the saddle.

1170
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:06,880
...and Katatis Lediv.

1171
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:12,960
Starring in the original part written for herself, Katat and Legume portrayed the angry blowhole.

1172
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:17,460
The beautiful young Claudine Lange was portrayed by Chaz Smith.

1173
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:23,520
The elderly Luger-wielding Claudine was played by the Reverend Ivan Stagg.

1174
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,720
Playing himself and performing...

1175
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:29,120
Performing as usual, I'm your host and moderator, Snatch Weasel.

1176
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,840
Have a pleasant evening and ride up...

1177
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,040
...somewhere over the rainbow.

1178
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,580
Skies of blue.

1179
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:50,960
This has been Dr. Legume tribute number two on Hour of Slack from the Church of the Sepgenius.

1180
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,340
There will be more.

1181
00:58:52,340 --> 00:59:03,820
