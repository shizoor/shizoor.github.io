You can call me Bob.
I like you, Danny.
I'll be in the back.
Where's it that you're from?
Cleveland.
Cleveland.
Cleveland.
Like Erie.
Erie.
Well, that doesn't explain why you've come all the way out here.
All the way out here to hell.
You're just as likely to find your own grave.
On July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m., when we all have hangovers,
Wotan's judgment will take place in the form of what the prescriptors call
the Advent.
Advent of the angelic host.
And if you let Bob do your thinking for you,
you won't have to worry about nothing come July 4th, 1998.
Ha, ha, ha.
When Bob comes down in his giant mothership,
looking kind of like a big pillbox,
Bob will be landing and you can climb right in because he's going to know.
He's going to have your name on a computer printout.
Yes, sir, dear friends.
And that's CRT tube available.
Right there at his fingertips.
He can call your name up and he'll know exactly what you've done for him.
He'll know exactly how much donations you've taken in.
He'll know exactly how much money you've given to the church.
Besides his own exaggerated human nature and the powers granted him by Jehovah One,
Bob also benefits.
From being the chosen broker on earth for superior beings from the furthest reaches of known space.
The so-called men from Planet X or exists for they are nothing like men.
Bob has a covenant with these angelic beings, a cosmic contract, a deal.
On July 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.
The exists shall make.
A mass landing on this planet.
The children of Bob shall be rewarded at this fortold rupture.
This day of judgment when all those who paid their church dues will be lifted up in power and glory to gain new homes and bodies aboard the pleasure saucers of the sex goddesses.
All the while watching the hapless pinks twitch and bleat and wail in the death throes of.
Their world.
And we faithful shall be transfigured into new enlightened beings.
Superior mutants called over men and uber women.
Who will start a new Jerusalem in the promised land of dimension X.
Asgard.
The zone of eternal slack and cytor spasmic ooze squirt.
Behold my servant shall prosper.
He got exalted and laid.
Lifted up on the pile.
Shall be very high.
He who knew it of the fools who prophesied for him.
Shall be made over man.
Many will be astonished at him for his appearance is so mild.
Beyond the human semblance.
That his form is beyond that of a sinful man.
We can't do much about those evil gods from the other side of the cosmos.
Who fly through the air and through the nebulous darkness of space.
Space my friends.
The infinite inky clouds of nebulae.
They fly on their membranous leathery wings holding in their coiling tentacles.
Shiny steel cylinders each one containing what was once a human soul.
What was once a member of the church of the subgenius.
But enough of this.
You don't want to hear about this.
I must and yet I cannot.
I'll tell you what you'll be wishing it was that kind of aim.
At least you'll be wishing.
You'll be glad to have them on your side.
Because at least I have them on my head.
At least there's two arms and two legs.
It could be worse.
It could be much worse.
It's looking for us.
It's an eyeball.
It's looking for an answer.
That's how the aliens see us.
Well you want some aliens to see you.
If you're right with them.
If you've paid dues.
If you've done your incantation.
If you've sacrificed your chickens and children.
Bob is looking for you and more importantly Connie will be looking for you on July 5th.
At Brushwood.
Bob and Connie.
Bob and Connie want you and they will get you come X-Day.
Which is almost here and may in fact already be gone for some listeners.
Sorry too late.
You could have but you didn't.
Because we're preparing to leave the planet or at least throw a big naughty company party.
This is Hour of Slack number 1209 from the Church of the Subgenius and is a Best of X-Day special.
An X-Day B.O. if you will.
What we just heard was ESO Swamp Radio from Chaz Smith from WCSB Cleveland some years back.
Dr. Hal Robbins narrating the subgenius video Arise with music by BK Jones.
Dr. Philodrummon on the road and getting the date wrong for the end of the world.
And clips from Deadman, Jay Turney, Lee Murr and the Time Travelers.
Speaking of which, that's us friends.
I say this here to ensure disbelief but the fact is every year we return here from the subgenius.
To the subgenius future trying to make sure that X-Day happens right and that it's only the final days for some people.
Final days.
Caraportation.
These people have come from the future to visit us.
Using the Earth Union's time machine, we've been sent back here to warn you all.
We wish to change incidents that are about to take place here.
Things that have caused catastrophe in the 23rd century.
We came here to warn you all about your country's gloomy future.
Because in the century that we come from, there's no longer a Japan.
Why? How could that possibly be? And why? What's the reason for it?
You want to make an omelet, you gotta break some eggs.
See that the humans remain entertained until the end.
The Book of Revelations tells us to watch for the seven signs of evil.
By the way.
Sign of evil number four.
We're continuing our sign of evil countdown.
Here's Vanessa with...
How are things going here? Doesn't look so hot.
We'll be broadcasting in a few minutes. The mobile unit is also getting ready.
Good. Keep it up. The world's depending on us.
Okay.
The one question that I heard asked more than any other.
The question is, man going to destroy himself?
Are we coming to the end of the world?
Oh, God, no. Is today the fifth?
What?
What?
The aliens are here!
Is God outraged with all of this?
I don't know.
He hears the rattling sabers and sees the spewing rockets.
He sees the atomic bombs that are buried beneath the Sandia Mountains
close to Albuquerque, New Mexico with enough detonating force
and destructive force to completely destroy the entire world.
He sees the lethal snouts of atomic submarines that plow their way
through the waves of the mighty oceans,
levetians of the deep that could completely destroy them.
He sees the
He sees the mighty Saturn missile belching its black smoke and flame of fire,
taking its cargo of flesh to the moon.
He sees it.
He also knows that madmen, in spite of their front of civilization and intellectualism and getting along and peaceful coexistence,
that have but one desire, and that's to destroy and take over this entire world.
Well, he sees this.
He knows this.
They are friendly people and are by far more advanced spiritually and physically than the people of this planet.
At the present time, they are observing us.
They wish to help us to help ourselves to attain a higher spiritual state.
They wish to help us to have a higher understanding of life and its meaning.
What do you think about Bob?
Who's Bob?
Alright, well, what do you think about the UFOs which are presently going to,
which are presently in formation to blitz the Earth and put particle beams through the head of everyone that doesn't know Bob?
You're out of your mind.
Spacecraft entered the moon's gravitational field in the sixth century.
The Earth's first segment of the flight.
The gravity of the moon is one sixth of that on Earth.
The orbit around the moon was flown 66 miles above the moon's surface at 6,000 miles an hour.
At ten after nine, the beeping began.
Went down to the reserve fence, watched through binoculars, and we did see this thing.
Now, it's about the size of the moon with a small crescent at the bottom.
It's well lit like starlight.
The top is a dark gray mass.
It came down through the trees, whatever it was.
Have you ever heard of one?
Have you ever been in one?
Have you ever seen one?
Have you by television ever seen one?
If you haven't, it's the greatest sight this side of heaven.
People from this Earth have already seen some of their spacecraft,
which they call flying saucers.
And other flying objects which they cannot describe.
These objects are real and are spacecrafts.
The astronauts return to Earth on the sixth day of the week.
Yeah, I'm reading here on the internet where you think the world's going to end your life here through 2007.
Well, brother, I'll tell you what the Bible says.
No man knows what hour our Lord doth come.
So you've got a heck of a...
email going on here.
I hope God forgives you for trying to predict when He's coming back in Jesus Christ.
But I hope you find Him in the end and get your heart right and your soul straightened out
and ask Jesus Christ into your life and your heart and ask Him to forgive you of your sins
and you repent because you're doing some blasphemy against God because there's no way you know that.
But I feel for you, buddy, and I just pray that you get to know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.
God bless.
This is me, Bernard.
I just wanted to call.
You know, as I speak, you know, the UFOs are appearing outside the window again today, the fifth of July.
And you know, sometimes when they do appear, like, other lights start flashing on and off of them, like these newly, like this newly built house,
like these newly built houses right next by this house here.


that I'm living in.
Sometimes the lights flash on and off
when they appear or don't appear.
The UFOs have come back.
They're outside my window as I speak.
I can see them.
I hope it means that X-Day is coming.
Meanwhile, far below the Earth's surface...
I don't know why you don't sign up here.
Well, I've tried. I've tried everything.
They won't listen to me up here.
I've sent my prophets Ezekiel, Hezekiah.
You know what a good apocalypse costs.
I know, Dad.
You tried that earthquake in Los Angeles last year.
Oh, no, no. Don't blame me for that.
That was San Andreas' fault.
That shows the endless connection
how one crime succeeds another,
for he says the land is full of bloody crimes
and the city is full of violence.
Therefore, God says,
I will bring the basis,
the worst of heathen Gentile people,
and they are going to conquer you
and drive you out and move into your houses
and your holy places will be defiled.
Destruction comes, God says.
Oh, good God, we're doomed.
No!
We're out of donuts!
One could go on and on with reports of this nature.
Week after week, we get letters to our office
and it'll say, Brother Smith, it saved my life.
You don't realize where I was headed.
A farmer.
A farmer.

I was wakened one morning
and the clock struck one, two, three, seven,
twelve, thirteen, fourteen.
His wife said, Honey, wake up.
He said, What time is it?
She said, I don't know,
but it's later than it's ever been before.
It's funny because it's true.
World leaders are indeed pessimistic.
They should be.
I heard Stang on the radio
said we'd better get cracking.
X-Day Zoomer.
Post, Goody am Logy.
and get to work right now.
Sometimes, I'm frustrated,
and I'm really frustrated.
Would this empire fell from his own hel rear,
If it should still existed,
We would still be a motley gang.
I'm happy you're having fun.

In five weeks.
Because Bob sealed their doom.
Five weeks.
You screwed up and carried the thumb again, Bimbo Breath.
Look at the calendar.
You got four weeks.
What?
No, actually, it's three weeks.
No, two.
Friends, that was Reverend Susie the Floozy singing.
Yes, singing.
What lungs.
Before that, we heard lots more of Susie's audio collage editing work
and sandwiched between those,
Reverend Stevie Hambone's UFO interview
and two actual phone messages left on my answer machine.
Some just aren't joiners, friends, I guess.
Of course, you don't have to join us and become a subgenius minister.
The average subgenius who doesn't exist never does.
But we had to.
Leave him and all the others behind.
Because they did not have faith in their hearts.
No, they chose to follow their minds instead.
To follow so-called common sense.
Yes, dear friends.
Well, I guess it's common indeed.
Some may call it quite common.
I hated to concur with you there, Monthers,
but I could see that the sides of your heads, your flanks, as we call them,
were starting to radiate.
Ah.
Ah, my old flanks.
Start doing that.
I could smell.
You know, when I get feeling the power in the slack
and the smoke in this fine, fine crack.
Yes, at quadruple X day,
the crowds, the masses will all rise up,
raise their hands up and sing,
all flesh is like grass.
They shall raise their feet.
That's what they're singing there in German.
All flesh is tastier than grass.
And that lemon grass can be...
...used with practically any...
...vegetable fruit, fowl, or...
...fules, fuels, fuels.
And a new barb odor will rise up.
And a new, newbite reporter...
...will sing behind him and...
...stand all as flesh as is the grass.
Froppet, froppet, froppet, froppet, froppet, froppet.
I gotta tell ya,
man, I love church.
I just love church.
Church.

Are you a loner kind?
Not join her all the way?
Two subgenies are alike, if they are then one must die.
We shall have paradise, subgenie of the world, unite!
Alien sex every night, subgenie of the world, subgenie of the world, subgenie of the world, unite!
That's great, it starts with a handshake. Exits UFO's outer space. J.R. Dobbs is not afraid.

Pinks serve their own needs.
Yetis serve your own needs.

Uh oh, oh no.

Save yourself, serve yourself.
Pinks serve their own need.
Yetis serve your own need.

Pleasure shifts are on their way.
Quit your job.
Keep your slack.
Jared Ops has got your back.
Hail Connie.
Hail Bob.
On your knees, self-righteous flock
Give it up, give it in
Find yourself your Yeti kit
New religion, radio, help
Hope gonna blow
Pay to find out what you know
Pass the pipe, take a trick
I'm telling you this is no joke
Spirits see, steer clear
A turn a minute, turn a minute, turn a minute lies
Offer me solutions and you offer me alternatives
And I decline
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
It's the end of the world as we know it
And Bob feels fine
It's the end of the world
It's the end of the world

And please don't forget to wear all the special equipment we've given you
and quote as many of the silly science fiction phrases like proton pack, nuclear device,
weekend whacker, and all of the other things that we've been telling you as you board the ships.
If it makes you feel better.
Also remember, after boarding the ships, there's a brief moment of unconsciousness called the swoon,
followed by some indigenous music played by aborigines.
On a didgeridoo.
And there's the smell of acrid fires burning.
As the temple of truth goes up all poo-poo.
A friendly reminder again.
Sack after sack of delicious coffee beans will be ground for your delectation and enjoyment.
And for some of you, your bodies will be ground and made part of that sample sumptuous ritual.
Yes, there will be that communication of communion.
We call it the mingling.
Welcome to your source.
I am pleasure.
CV 456,154.
Sexual gratification and desire for film will begin in a moment.
First, we invite you to look out your window.
Say goodbye to the pinks who were left behind.
Now unzip your pants.
Just sit back.
And relax.
Feel better.
Feel better.
Then Connie shall be teleporting over shortly to congratulate you on your success as a subgenius.
The option to copulate with Isaac can be taken advantage of.
And I have taken the liberty of preparing a warning frock.
The time is 8A on July 5th.
I shall leave now.
Press the blue button.
Should you need me, goodbye.
The Special Saucer, your special saucer created by Reverend Heart Ignition.
Before that, Dr. Hal and Lonesome Cowboy Dave recorded at a future or past X-Day.
It's a moot point.
Before that, the end of the world as we know it take off was by the great Saint N and Hell in a Handbasket.
Before that, the subgenius anthem by the Mondo Retardo Band recorded at 8X Day.
The Love Church was collaged by Norrell Preff of NorrellPreff.com.
And before that, Chaz Smith and Dave and me on WCSB Cleveland's Swamp Radio.
And Ford Johnson as the Walking Dead.
Yes, on that fateful day, friends, some of us will be taken up, some will just be taken,
and some left behind with no radio stations from which to blabber,
but only little blabbers.
All because of their doubts.
I am unable to continue blindly working on a project of such phenomenal destructive potential.
Accordingly, there is only one course of action open to me.
Zach Hobson, July 5th.
One, there has been a malfunction in Project Flashlight with devastating results.
Two, it seems...
Two, it seems...
Two, it seems...
The only person left on it.
Well, you know, many people are going to be dreadfully, dreadfully out of juice
when the Planet X approaches.
Supposedly there are 12 years of extremely large sunspots.
A cycle like we've never seen before in solar activity,
which will cause many, many, many people to fail to reproduce.
There will be a darthening, if you will, of sexual prowess and even a deepening of lackage.
And let's...
children, that's going to be the first
sign there's going to be less and less children
because there's going to be less and less
sperm and eggs to go around. Is it any wonder
that they're low on liquid after all those
years in the crematorium?
Yes, especially with the sun
spots the way they are nowadays,
Grandma. I remember
when we used to get up and beat the jackal
like a hound. Remember those days?
Those days, of course, of course.
Sometimes it was at night, but
the angels would come, and then
we'd all dance,
and was that a dream?
No, I remember those dreamy angels.
Maybe that was a dream.
I don't know.
I think it was
sun spots
in your head.
Sun spots.
I think that was ah Oooh
The Maid of horror
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
The Maid of horror
Is she out?
Oh, yeah
I guess so.
Yeah?
She said oh thelast time.

Fossils in the mud

People standing and sleeping bags
Golden, golden
Ten hours of me sleeping less

Connie's honey sitting by my side
We're gonna take that fine
Well, I can do it all the next day
Fossils in the mud
We'll get him up on his knee
Party till the morning

Out in the reeks
Geeks, freaks and loonies
If you ain't coming
Get money
We'll get him, saucer him
Since 7 a.m.

It's why the earth would cost a star again
Golden, golden

We're getting off this burned-down sphere
Or else we do this all again next year
Get him up on his knee
Fossils in the mud
Party till the morning
Then we're done, we're done
Get him up on his knee
Fossils in the mud
We're getting off this burned-down sphere
Fossils in the mud
Fossils in the mud
Then we're done
We're getting off this burned-down sphere
Fossils in the mud
Get him up!
We're getting off this burned-down sphere

Seriously
Before that, Princess Wheein lonesome cowboy Dave and a clip from the quiet earth.
Now, the bullfrogs of Brushwood recorded at the site of 9X Day by Reverend Rosnah.
Recently, a group of big wives asked this simple question.
What kind of food do you buy?
An overwhelming majority of wives said they preferred to buy small children packed in glass.
And by a ratio of more than 8 to 1, they insisted on prepared babies packed in glass.
Here are the three reasons mentioned most frequently.
First, you can heat, serve, and store leftover portions
of prepared food.
You can store prepared babies in the same glass container.
And third, glass lets you see sterilized children before you buy it.
You fool! You idiot! You fool! You idiot!
No! Don't! Don't!
The secret of X Day.
The secret of X Day.
Am I evil?
I don't know, my son.
All my life I've been a little man.
A happy little fellow.
But in the dressing room...
I, uh, I don't understand.
Did you ever hear of X Day?
No.
You mean...
Yes, yes!
A chance to grow to normal size!
Please, please, please let him do it!
Just what does this X Day look like?
Uh, uh...
A rag.
I had grown! I had grown!
I was growing!
You've grown, but not so much that I can't handle you.
I was not...
Normal! Normal!
You look good to me.
I do?
Well, I always did go for big men.
Big?
Yeah.
I was vaguely disturbed.
No! Please, don't!
What's the matter, baby?
I... I... I... I...
It seems to me you're growing bigger.
Bigger?
Yeah. Yeah.
I thought at first I was seeing things, but...
Now I know it's true.
You've grown bigger.
Don't...
I'm afraid of you, John.
Don't...
Don't...









You're too big now.
I mean, don't get big luck!
I mean...
Oh, stop! Stop that screaming!
You want to waste the whole street up!
I mean, don't!
No!
You're hurting me!
Help!
Help!
No!
Yes!
Yes!
I'd grown at least six inches.
Now I was a freak again!
All my life I was a little man.
I wanted to know what it was...
What it was like to be a big man.
Now I am big.
Too big.
Too big!
Like the swing of a pendulum!
The secret of X-Day.
Russian and Cuban trawlers, undoubtedly surveillance vessels, have been circling the area.
And Soviet aircraft have repeatedly been warned away.
Pippi, what's the matter with you?
What's the matter with me?
Nothing.
We're just in the middle of some big time international incident like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
Figured that out for yourself, did you, Hip?
Something is going on!
Come on, come on.
Pippi, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Everything is.
Every day is X-Day when you have a gun!
You know, you've got to educate them.
If you have a gun, you can make your own reality.
Probe into their lives and really inspect them.
And so let's go into their own reality.
Armed and humorous.
People, yeah, we march into the future.
A hundred years from now.
But we have safe guns.
We have to sell them all kinds of important things later.
The guns laugh instead of making shot sounds.
Yes.
And the bullets, when they hit you, they tickle you.
They've gone to figure out what they want, what they like, what they don't like.
It's going to be a wonderful future.
This is random nonsense.
Church reform the next hundred years.
Take it!
Okay, church reform.
We're okay.
What are we going to do for the next 100 years?
I mean, how are you going to keep people down?
You are on the board.
You, for 250, you have...
Once again, the gay Paris.
Recently.
Well, gay.
Well, gay.
Gay is the underlying word here, I think, I'm sure.
How do you keep them busy?
How do you keep them gay when they're down on the farm?
How do you keep them on the farm when they're gay?
That's right.
Well, how can you improve upon a church that has done so much for so little?
For so few.
Look at the numbers.
Never have so few probably...
And the output.
Just output.
...by so much...
Well, if you look around, almost every member of the church of the subgenius is in this
radio studio right now.
Right now.
I mean, it's like...
I mean, there's an atom bomb to go off right now.
Not that there should be.
There were a couple of subgeniuses...
Clam Chow.
...in the Al Qaeda here.
Otherwise, I'd be asking a free speech.
Or FBI.
All of the world is screwed.
That's right.
The church is screwed.
CIA.
If the bastion of free speech gets nuked right now by Al Qaeda...
This is the Vatican.
...there's about three or four major religions...
That's right.
That's right.
Alternative religion is going down.
This is the Vatican of alternative religion right now as we see it.
Well, at least...
That's right.
...they're going down if Al Qaeda gets their way.

The church of the subgenius goes down.
Civilization goes...
Safety.
It's off.
It's smoking.
You're a stupid boy.
Stupid.
I would say it was the edict of the mountain.
Well, four cents.
You owe me four cents.
I own the rights to the word stupid.
There's no trust with these darn parents.
Every time you use the word stupid...
This is it.
...you owe me four cents.
Four cents.
This will decide the fate of the world.
Stupid.
What?
Accusations against...
Stupid.
I own the rights to the word stupid.
The fate of the entire universe is about to be discussed now.
I've got trademark rights on that.
So I get...
Every time anybody uses it in print or verbally, I get four cents.
Leave alone.
So...
Is it broken?
Rototill, all of reality.
I listened to our guest call.
She was around here screaming.
Then, if it's not broken, I think we should use the bathroom now.
Reverend Stang, Rototill, all of reality.
He's going...
If it is...
If it's not broken, I say we go in there and fix the damn thing.
Fix it.
Fix it.
Fix the hell out of it.
Fix the freaking hell out of it.
Broke or unbroke.
You get a brisker.
There you are.
There you are.
You have to come to the $25 million.
I'm going to go to the bathroom.



Just fix it.
Just fix it.
Tamper.
That's our motto.
Tamper.
If you don't work, you gotta fix it.
I don't contest.
Simper tamper.
Simper tamper.
That was from the subgenius retreat recorded at KPFA Berkeley a few years back with an
all-star cast including Dr. Howe, Puzzling Evidence, Philo Drummond, Bishop Joey, Michael
Pepe, yours truly, Reverend Stang, and host, Don Joyce of Negative Land.
Before that, the abyss of Norel Pref and also Lemur.
Now, from 13 years ago, some classic ESO swamp radio from producer Chaz Smith and the
whole ESO band in the old WCSB studio recorded before our first X Day drill in 1996.
These phobias can be conquered if...
No, but those insects were there the night Harry put over the energy.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Their energy.
Look!
His energy.

You are a Qurich
You are a Mise
That decision is yours to decide.
Who's now the best at pipe� 앥
In Brushwood, New York, on July 5th through 7th this year and every year from now till X-Day.
That's right, Ivan. That's right.
Remember to call for free information about the amazing X-Day drill.
Yes, it's like the legendary Dockstock Gathering.
That's right, Ivan. That's right, Ivan.
Oh, you'll see the most hated preachers of the subgenius church.
You'll camp out on a lovely, fully developed campground surrounded by...
Geeks you'd rather not ever spend much time with.
But by God, you'll know more about the church of the subgenius mother.
Because, friends, you will have practiced for that fatal day, that glorious day, X-Day.
Yes, only two years from now, in 1998, the sex goddesses from Planet X shall come.
And rupture up the news paying fully Dobbs-approved subgenius ministers.
That's right.
Call 4,000 of us and destroy the rest of the planet.
That's right, Ivan.
Well, not destroy it, but turn it back into the stinking swamp that it was before the filthy humans came along and muddied everything up.
But, friends, you can come along and muddy everything up.
You can wallow in the filth.
You can dance all night.
You can pull your clothes off and county law doesn't care.
Because we are having the first X-Day drill this July 5th through 7th.
Sunday.
Sunday.
Sunday.
Sunday.
Sunday.

You'll see the pill.
You'll see the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.
It lives.
It bleeds for you if you don't vomit your money back.
Friends, you will see things you wouldn't dare believe.
Things you never wanted to believe and things you'll wish you never saw.
That's right, Ivan.
Yetis will be copulating in the bushes.
Oh, dude.
The blackness monster will rise up from the little pond.
But, Ivan.
The...
The crazed pagan drummers will drum all night long and keep you from sleeping.
Mosquitoes the size of dobson flies will devour you.
But you won't care.
You won't care because you spent your money and came to the X-Day drill.
July 5th through 7th in Brushwood, New York.
Brushwood, New York.
Only three hours from Cleveland.
And, friends, you can call for information.
216-
Yelp.
Yelp.
60338.
I'll give that number again.
Write that number down.
It's the free information divival hotline of the Church of the Subgenius here in Cleveland.
12060338.
That's 12060338.
What do those numbers add up to?
Aha!
Now you know the secret.
Now you know what we're really trying to tell you about.
The froth.
Yes, the froth.
There's no end to it.
That's right, Ivan.
Buckets of froth.
Back tubs full of froth.
Three months tired.
That's right, Ivan.
Of froth.
A different nature.
We're home to the Romanian ocean full of flow.
We're home to the Romanian ocean full of flow.
Ancient Tibetan herbs.

Scrolling right up under your feet.
You won't be able to sleep.
There'll be so much froth growing at high speed underneath your sleeping bag tossing you around.
It's like a giant funhouse.
Yes, it's insane.
It's crazy.
But ain't it always been the crazy people that were able to party like they do now?
Yes, sir, E-Bob.
Yes, sir, ma'am, sir, lady.
You will finally learn what it's like to be a subgenius.
We're home to the Romanian ocean full of froth.
We're home to the Romanian ocean full of flow.



That's right, Ivan Stang of the Church of Subgenius and...
Oh, did I say that?
Well, then, pick up on it, man.
It's said that the end of the world shall come in a great flash.
I sure hope so.
So long, man.

Well, that's why we're here today.



Some people might go and the other ones might last.
Will you be the one who goes?
Where will you be on next day, brother?
Where is your ex?
Where will you be on next day, brother?
Will you be in the sausage?
Will you be in the sausage with ba-ba-ba-ba-ba?
There's still lots of room.
Oh, will you be down in the...
You can hang up on anything you want...
Will you be burning?
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Do you have that little cover on?


Well, it seems perfect pleasure.
Perfect pay.
Which will it be?
It's up to you to choose.
Bob gives you free will.
But you can't feel anything until you sign on the dotted line.
And X Day is coming, so you better move fast because where will you be on X Day?
I've got plenty of time to spend my $30 on that Bob ministership.
I've got plenty of time.
It's two more years for X Day.
Why am I in any kind of hurry?
Well, there couldn't possibly have been some kind of a misprint in the book of the subgenius.
I mean, just because that first edition from McGraw-Hill actually did say that X Day was on July 5th, 1996.
Well, they changed it after that.
I'm sure that, I mean, it looked like a mistake.
I probably was a mistake.
I don't think I really have to spend that $30 quite yet.
Because that probably was just, it's probably not.
I bet the world's going to end this year, 1996.
Probably not.
I could probably afford to take that risk.
I mean, I've got that $30.
That's not a problem.
But there's this Hootie and the Blowfish CD I wanted to get.
And, well, you know, I wanted to go to this movie about water spouts.
And, well, I just, you know, I mean, Bob will wait on me.
I mean, Bob's a patient man.
He ain't a rat, poor God.
Now, I heard Bob loved these subgeniuses, even if they never spent any money.
A patient man?
A patient man?
Man, he ain't no patient.
Bob is the doctor.
He ain't no patient man.
Bob is the surgeon who will excise the filthy, rotting tumor that is America.
That is modern America today.
Yes, my fellow rebellious citizens.
And untaxed payers.
And militia members.
All the citizens of courts.
We must come together.
We must come together.
Quick, they're coming.
They're trying to stop me from speaking.
All of us religious nuts.
And crazy, bright-winged maniacs.
We must band together against the man.
Because, oh, wait, they're coming.
I've got to get my message out.
The last true hope is 5560338.
Call 55603.
Here they come.
Come on.
I see you.
Come on.
Let's go.
Come on.
I see you.
I'm going to tell you it's going to be.
I'm going to give your love to me.
No, no.
No, no, no, no.
You'll have to laugh more than one day.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.


I love the town I play in
I love the town I play in
Hey!
Gotta coat the snake for a necktie
Got me a church by the roadside
Made out of rattlesnake hide
Bob is gonna ask you
Who do you love?
Bob is gonna ask you
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Oh, who do you love?
Oh, who do you love?
Oh, I tried to
Drop it, but
Your lover man
Got me around
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
love is real and not paid away.
Love is real and not paid away.
Love is real and not paid away.
Love is real and not paid away.
Love is real and not paid away.
Love is real and not paid away.
Love is real and not paid away.
Anyway, friends, the human race is obviously, let's face it, a parasitic fungus,
an infestation much like fleas, and the host is soon to be dipped, as Carter was saying.
The warranty on this planet is about to run out, but J.R. Boggoss is the extended service policy.
For all you know, he may already be world overlord.
In fact, if what Bob said is true, then you might already be world overlord.
So we must ask ourselves, why don't we have Halloween every day already?
Why not the bottomless bowl of ice cream?
Why not the dishwashing machine that really does the dishes?
You alone can make this happen.
Bob is not the answer, and neither is anything else.
Praise Bob!
You must learn to think for yourself, but only Bob can show you how.
So stop asking what's in Bob's pipe.
Throw yourself into his pipe and let him make an ash of you.
For the nameless mission!
This is all for the nameless mission, friends.
This church is a religion that doesn't bullshit you that it's not bullshit.
Therefore, it's the one true religion.
Now, no matter how stupid we must look or even be, we must continue for Bob!
You too can be a part of this last-minute effort at changing all Earth history retroactively.
Do you have what it takes?
Then Bob will take it, my friend.
You will go down Bob's pipe one way or another.
You must be saved, even if it kills you.
So put your frock where your mouth is, my friend.
Repent! Quit your job! Slack off!
The world ends tomorrow and you may die!
Now, did you hear that?
The world ends tomorrow!
Not the next day!
Not in 1998!
Tomorrow!
The world ends tomorrow and you may die!
Have you been living every day as if it was the last day of your life?
Or else as if you have all the time in the world?
Because it's one and or the other.
Bob has made it quite plain
that we had better cover our own asses just in case.
And build our own ships.
We can't wait for the aliens.
We have to build our own ships.
And in the meantime we might as well clean up the one that we're already on.
People ask me, they say,
Reverend Stang, come on, tell me the truth.
What do you really believe in?
What do you truly, really believe in?
I believe in that!
I believe in that!
That face!
That face will always be there!
And it will always be laughing.
And not necessarily with us.
If you want a picture of the future,
imagine a pipe smoking in a human face forever.
The only thing that never fails is failure.
The only thing that never works is perfection.
And therefore,
Fuck them if they can't take a joke!
Join the Church of the Subgenius, my friend!
It's a no-brainer.
Praise Onam for so many of the one-liners.
Why, he's mad!
Look in his eyes!
Why, the man's gone crazy!
Crazy for Bob, friends!
I've got Bob on the Brain, B.O.B.
The sermon was from Baltimore D Bible 2008.
The crazy laugh from Dwight Frye in Dracula.
The background music behind me right now is the amino acids of TheAminoAcids.com
who will be playing and premiering their feature film at 12X Day this July 4th.
This is the Church of the Subgenius Radio Ministry,
the hour of slack number 1209 from June 2009,
last days of man on earth.
Remember, if you have questions about anything,
Google Subgenius or go to Subgenius.com for answers and some solutions creating chaos with madness.
Pop culture.
Madness.
The meaning of life is sex.
It's money.
It's power.
Fall in love with power.
What just happened in Kansas.
We have real problems.
Ratings on restaurants.
People can't figure these things out on their own.
Give me that little twinkle way down deep inside.
Way down deep inside.
Deep inside.
Beginning to make sense.
Madness now.
Christians, Christians, they offer no hope.
All they offer is despair because it's in their benefit to have you dependent on them.
To have you fail.
To implement despair.
Get a job?
You talk about a message of hopelessness that's so vile.
It's so hopeless.
Christians, Christians,
Everywhere you turn, there's hope.
They give you this message of just total despair.
Your life is not going to amount to anything without the heavy hand of God.
Go and live on welfare for good.
I'm getting high every day, hanging out at the beach.
That was a subgenius.
You know, subgenius.
Subgenius.
Subgenius.
Subgenius.

Normal.
What is wrong with you that you would buy into this lie, this concept they call America?
This is on minimum wage?
Snatch.
Snatch.
Snatch.
Their mama is on crack.
Subgenius.
