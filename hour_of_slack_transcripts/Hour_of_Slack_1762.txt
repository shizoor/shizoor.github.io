The radio, remember? Make it work.
The hour of slug!
So you did bust it.
Stations aren't strong enough in the daytime. Tonight it'll work.
Tonight it's better.
Can't you smell it?
From PR News in Washington, I'm the easiest of them all.
The Russians stole emails and then stole PR News to try to impact Washington.
The Trump sun cast a shadow.
Shadow over British Prime Minister Theresa May.
She's pursuing an inadequate approach to PR News.
Washington.
Trump repeated.
U.S. stocks up, up, down for 25, 91, 7, 17, 19.
Earlier this year, three PR News were killed in a park.
It's an unprecedented loss.
The Federal Reserve is projecting next week over the next two years.
The government of Kenya says,
This is defective PR News in Washington.
Oh, yes, dear friends, and thank you, Lee Murr,
and welcome to Hour of Slug number 1762.
It's January, the year the conspiracy calls 2020,
and we left Cleveland and the radio station for good last October.
And while we're at it, we're going to talk about the conspiracy.
We've done a few live shows with Dave here at Stang Ranch.
I've managed to make the recordings from the X-Day drill, 22 X-Day drill,
last all the way from July to now,
and we're only just now getting to the tragic recording from 7 a.m. July 5th.
For friends, that is the day that we expected the men and sex goddesses
from Planet X to arrive on Earth,
rupture us up to our own private custody,
power justice for failings,
and make us British Bratz under thoseゲ relic mmz
The
Nature left in King George the fourth.
Facebook, more interesting. I guess anybody can spend that $3.05. Anyway, it was all a moot point
since 2019 obviously wasn't 1998 or 8661 after all. So yep, once again, we got up at 6 a.m. for
nothing, as you'll be hearing, as we are made to feel dumb and dumber like a bunch of regular
dumpsters. Dumpster. Dumpster. Dumpster. Dumpster. Dumpster. Dumpster. I'm still waking up. Me too.
I've had a cup of coffee, but it hadn't run through me yet. One more. One more 7 a.m. Dr. Drummond and
Princess Wee. Just one more. That's all we have to do. We won't have to do it again.
after this, I'm sure. Got my boarding ticket. Boarding pass. Oh yeah, yeah. Oh right, right, right.
There's, I've got to make sure I have the extra. Oh, I'm glad she mentioned that. There's green
tickets. Yeah, you got your green ticket, right? I have my boarding pass. Everybody have their green ticket? I have mine. That's really important.
Okay. We have to go. Where's Dr. Philo Drummond? Dr. Drummond. Dr. Drummond. Dr. Drummond.
Dr. Drummond. Dr. Howell. Dr. Drummond. There he is. Sit in here. Put your butt in here. No. No. Oh, the pain. Pain. Pain. Pain. Pain. Pain. Misery and pain. Misery and pain? Misery and pain.
I have my boarding pass.
I have my boarding pass.
I have everything else we need. I have my boarding pass worn over my heart. Hey!
There's some other stuff we need. What? The other tickets. The red tickets. The red tickets? Yeah,
you didn't... Yeah, I didn't tell you about the red tickets. No, you didn't tell me about the red tickets.
They're supposed to be in the car here. You didn't tell me about the red tickets. I know. I don't know anything about the red tickets.
Don't worry, don't worry. Everything's fine. Don't panic.
Now they're not in here. If somebody took the red tickets or misplaced them, we could be in real big trouble. Uh-oh.
Could they have fallen down between the seats?
Between my seat and the console?
Just go on down there. We'll figure it out. Okay, I can't.
There's an open door in the car that I guess Philo... Well, where's Philo?
He's getting coffee. He's gonna walk down there. So he's gonna walk?
I hope so. Hope he still can. Coral Scudder.
So does he know we're leaving? Who cares? Don't worry about Philo.
But I do, I do worry about Philo.
I'll let you decide where to pull over here. I usually go down that circle at the end.
Okay. Okay. Oh, here we go. There's Reverend Fanboy maybe. Woohoo!
This is gonna be real hard to get out. I'm just gonna stay right here.
Now, where's the other tickets? That's the big question.
I think you're funning me about my tickets. No, I'm not funning you about them.
Seriously, there's some... There's red tickets that we're gonna need. Those green tickets are a ruse.
Oh no!
There's nothing else. Right down here.
It was like a folded up envelope. An envelope?
Yeah, it's a big envelope with a head. That's not an envelope.
No. Let me look under this. Oh yeah! Here it is. Here it is. Oh, thank God.
Here you go, baby. Oh, Jesus. Oh, what a relief.
Now, why is Susie... I had no idea what that envelope was.
I know, I know. You weren't supposed to know. Nobody was supposed to know.
You can't walk the car.
Okay.
Another hard, hard walk to the stone circle at Wisteria.
Poor old...
These poor old bones are gonna make this long.
I'm gonna make this long walk one more time.
I'm trying to remember what kind of... What was that great rant I came up with?
Photograph.
Poor old Reverend Stang. Hobbling out here one more time.
One last 7 a.m. This will be the last time I have to get up this early. God damn it.
Well, which one are you? You're new.
Yeah, I'm Dr. Overlord Destructotron. Showtully, whichever way you want to call me.
People send things like that to me every X-Day.
Huh. Okay. Well, welcome.
Thanks.
I'm the Pope of Plur.
I'm glad you made it.
Yeah, thank you. I'm glad, too.
And, uh...
Hi!
I'm technically a Wisterian.
Oh.
But I'm bringing the subgenius later today.
Oh, okay. Okay. Well, you made a wise move just in case.
Yeah.
You know, I just...
I already sent him a message. If I don't pick you up, world ended. Sorry.
Yeah. Well, yeah. There you go.
Poor old Philodrumon. Hobbling down the road for yet another 7 a.m.
Not a fit hour for man nor beast.
Grumbling and muttering.
Where's that...
Where's that music coming from?
He has speakers on his hips.
That's pretty...
That's great.
That's atmospheric, yeah. So that's a pretty good base for tiny little things like that.
For their bows.
Oh, wow. The countdown... the countdown device. That's nice to have.
6 minutes and 33 seconds.
And how many subgeniuses are here this year?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
Whoa, that's a record.
Record low.
11 subgeniuses waiting for the saucers. Hmm. What does that say? What does that tell you?
11 suckers.
Well, at least we got...
We got a lot of subgeniuses.

Nice background music for it.
We're ready, Bob. Or, uh, Exus. Or, I mean, uh...
We thought a ship was coming, but it turned out to be a meteor storm.
An asteroid headed to destroy Earth. Another killer asteroid.
In a race with the Exus.
Yes.
Who will get here first, the asteroid or the Exus?
If it's another meteor storm, I do have this.
Right.
Reverend Feitsitaj here, friends, has the Ex Day Abort Key.
You don't see one of these every day.
So you might want to get a good, close look at it.
And memorize it.
And hope, pray, we don't need it.
Well, don't pray.
That's always a bad idea.
Yeah, never pray. You never know who's listening.
Yeah.
You got your own soundtrack with you. You sound like a Vangelis soundtrack.
This is different. This is real different with that lively music.
Yeah?
Yeah, it makes me feel hopeful.
We've got about five minutes now?
Yeah.
Wow. Oh, my God.
Geez, we've been slacking.
Last five minutes on it.
Uh...
Yeah.
Princess Wee, what was that rant that I came up with last night?
I don't know.
I had this great...
My brain was scoured.
You said it was really good.
It was. It was hilarious. I was in hysterics.
Wow.
Last night.
Well...
It was great. It was really novel.
Yeah, it was a whole new thing for 7 a.m.
Hi, Reverend Fanboy.
Nice to see you.
Glad you made it. Just in time.
I can't believe I made it either. But...
I'm here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was a stressful music.
Look.
Yes, how will it end?
It's okay. It's all right. Everything's okay. You're among friends.
The music is coming out of Reverend Fightsy Taj's gut.
I'm staying until I come by later. I have glue if you want to put that thing back on.
No, it's a...
What, the fright wig on my recorder?
Oh, no. I thought that was your penis that you were holding in your hand. I'm sorry.
They're cheaper now. It's twice the price.
Which... Which... What do you mean?
Which...
Which penis?
Yeah. I got... It could be any.
It's the one that, you know, that sheds and falls off every once in a while.
Which one of those do you mean?
Yeah.
I've lost count.
The music is really...
Dramatic.
Tomorrow will be yet a new wonderful day for the subgenius.
Subgeniuses.
Not... Why tomorrow? Why today?
And...
If in some...
Horrible twist of fate it turns out this isn't 1998 after all,
we must remember the words of the great Professor Chaz Smith.
Build your own ship.
That was what it was. It was some rant about build your own ship and...
Yeah, we had to clean up the spaceship.
And the ship were already on and...
Oh, no. We knew that that comes after.
Okay.
But there won't be an after.
That was perfect.
We don't have to worry about after 7 a.m.
No. We won't have to worry about breakfast or going back to bed or
any of those things that we wonder and worry about every day.
Oh, Susie, you made it. Oh, good.
It's like, oh, wow.
If we don't get off...
You've got your... Now...
That's for you.
Does everyone have their green ticket?
No.
Yes.
You were handing out green tickets, right?
Yes, yes.
Yeah, I've got my green ticket. It's somewhere.
You don't have...
And your membership card.
I've got extra tickets.
Everybody...
Oh, all right.
Crimson Icula says...
Oh, yeah. Make sure you get that green ticket.
Green ticket.
Green ticket.
Green ticket.
Green ticket.
Green ticket.
Green ticket.
Green ticket.
Green ticket.
Green ticket.
Green ticket.
Green ticket.
Green ticket.
I believe I can still get a lease.
Yeah, you'll probably need to make an appearance at the charity workshop.
Oh, if you were in that look...
Maybe we could put a sign in.
Kids andле
Good stuff already goes your way.
Get a credit card, ao
Well, we have a watch, two diaries to go

Rhodey and abolish the production of the dubbing?



I think I should go buy the très petite one.
Thank you again, the tobita...
That was grilled well on the pot...

But I order you a jackpot, which is внr!

One of the first original X-Day hymns in years.
The title is Pillow Princess

Reverend Neil Formey.
Neil B. Formey, to be more exact.
So, Neil before Reverend Neil B. Formey
and the Mixolydian Illiterati Experience.
But now, back to the tragic events
of 7 a.m. July 5th
at Wisteria Campground and Events Center.
As we tune in, it is mere seconds
before the fateful countdown.
Have your tickets.
Here you go.
Oh, wow.
Where'd you get the pubic hair on your recorder?
Yeah, you're not the only one
who's asked about my pubic hair this morning.
Nice merkin, huh?
Yeah.
I'm proud to be a merkin.
We're all merkins here, I think.
Morrison.
No British or Canadian subgeniuses
showed up this time.
Well, what time is it?
What time is it?

second count. Shut up! Start talking!
And
yes, we need to focus on
the most lofty
thoughts one can
have. You don't want to be trapped
in your little mud world
of need and sex
and hunger and tiredness
and arthritis
and allergies and
pain.
The pain of
a hundred thousand
pains is about to
lift away.
Nine, eight,
seven, six,
five, four,
three, two,
one.
Fuck them if they can't take a
shot!
Everybody's always looking up.
You never
know.
Oh, that'd be awesome.
Yeah, where else are they going?
I may...
Maybe we should...
No, we've done that before.
Perhaps...
Maybe they're running
a little late.
No, no.
The clocks are right.
We're not sure about the
calendars or the astronomy.
Are they on like
sidereal savings time?
I don't know.
I think they are.
Maybe we may have...
Are the tickets any good?
This is where we get to dress
staying like a deer.
I brought a cleaning kit with
over the elbow gloves and a big
sack for the guts.
Who needs gloves?
It's fun when you do this.
Wait a minute.
You had told me there was some
other...
Something I had to remember.
What was it?
Something about...
Are you hoping Stang will remember this?
Wait a minute.
What was this thing...
The gut sack.
What was this all about?
I had the important tickets.
Your tool.
Oh, it's got your tool in there.
Green means go.
Green means go.
Green means go and I have green.
Yeah.
Well, you gave me this package
yesterday and said it was really important.
Ah, shit!
Oh, fuck.
Not again, Susie.
Red means real.
Red means real.
Green means go.
Susie!
Go to the bathroom.
No way.
No way.
You mean these tickets aren't even worth scalping?
What?
These tickets aren't even worth scalping?
God damn it.
Damn it.
How much did you guys pay for those green tickets?
I hope it wasn't much.
I mean, I only paid like $2 for my tickets.
Oh, the things I had to pay.
I'll give you a second.
Anybody want a red ticket?
Apparently, we've got all these red tickets here.
Oh, way to go, Susie.
It's just great.
You didn't have the tentacle hacker for us, did you?
You were the one that told me.
I held on to the red ticket.
I didn't tell you anything.
I have my boarding pass.
We got fucked and you weren't here to wipe us off.
I'd say I was sorry, but I'm not.
He always...
He'll have what perfect timing.
Reverend Angry Larry comes down at 7.05 a.m. on July 5th.
If I would have been here, I would have been here on time.
You mean this paper is nothing but paper?
I had to drop Reverend Lucy off at the toilet.
And then I raced here.
Are you calling her a toilet?
No.
Oh, here's your red ticket anyway.
That was the one we were supposed to have.
Only Susie got mixed up between, you know, yes and no.
Right and wrong.
Left and right.
Up and down.
Left and right.
That never happens to me.
This is righty, this is lefty.
Are you going to tell me my tits are wrong?
Yes, actually, that's right and that's left.
Not in the mirror it's not.
Not what the tattoo says.
Well, hell.
Once again...
Time to celebrate.
For...
Come to think of it, I guess, Susie,
it's the 24th time I've said, well, hell,
at about 7.01.
My water broke, put it in my butt.
Oh, we're recording at the premiere.
Oh, again.
It happened again, Susie.
This is just paper?
How can it be just paper?
Yeah, hang on to your green ticket, Susie.
You're welcome.
God, thanks a lot.
We had this one chance.
One chance.
No, wait a minute.
One chance.
What is it?
I did tell you green meant goat, didn't I?
Yeah.
Run, Bucker.
Oh, my bad.
My bad.
I'm such a consummate toady.
I just took the blame.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's all her fault.
Once again, Susie fucked up.
It's all her fault.
She's the goat.
She's always ready to take it.
Yep.
Thank you so much for...
Bend over, say ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Why did I keep this just in case?
Well, we better hang on to those red tickets for next, what, 86-61?
Is that...
Hmm.
It seems like it didn't take as long this year.
What, to be disappointed?
Yeah.
No, you're right.
It does.
It seems like usually it goes on and on and on.
It's the countdown clock I've ever seen.
Oh, right.
It's only 365 days, 23 hours, 55 minutes and 654321 seconds to 23X day.
So, Reverend Stang, you need to be...
Are we going to let the Discordians be right?
Once more, the pinks got off, but not us.
What?
Once more, the pinks got off, but not us.
I don't know that any pinks got off.
They got off the hook, didn't they?
They're not burning.
I don't smell it.
Well, they got off the hook one more year.
But so did we, if you think about it.
Did Bob ever say where Planet X is or if we were actually supposed to go there?
There's certain things that were left kind of open and vague, like exactly where are
the saucers going?
We get saucers.
We know that.
Right.
Maybe there's like a Parkinson's.
Maybe we can say that we're supposed to meet him at or something.
That issue has been raised before.
Every goddamn issue has been raised.
Every possibility.
Maybe they went to the original landing site in Brentwood.
Okay, Stang, we figured out a problem.
No, no.
It was never geocentric.
You could be anywhere you had your membership card in your pocket.
Maybe we're on the wrong Earth.
I do still think that.
I still have my membership card.
Oh, that whole, yeah, now that rant is starting to come back to me, but it sounds stupid now.
It was like, we're on a spaceship.
We have to clean up the spaceship we're on.
And we did that rant in 1998, 99.
It sounded so brilliant last night.
Yeah, well, that was last night.
In the cold, harsh light of day.
Oh, my God.
They call us a gut bag.
Oh, that's no.
No, no, they call you a gut bag.
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, I, you weren't, I didn't, that slipped of the tongue.
I'm going into the six knuckle for that one.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.
Who's next?
So, the gathered subgeniuses now have these long plastic arm gloves for.
It's a cleaning kit.
We're going to clean you.
Okay.
It's a cleaning kit for, I think these are for large animals.
Yeah, it's for pulling a stillborn calf out of a cow.
I've seen my brother do that, actually.
I've seen my brother with his arm all the way up an unculate.
Did you notice this?
Oh, that's for me, is it?
That's for you.
That's the pressure.
That's the cartoon for me.
So, you guys are all gloving up for me, right?
From that cartoon, the medical experiment.
What?
Look.
I'm not Bob.
I didn't take the memo.
I'm not the exus.
You guys know that.
We've been through this.
I've been dunked already.
Wow.
That's very clingy.
I've been lynched two or three times.
Show the camera your cleaning kit label.
Your arm will end up your ass all the way to the elbow.
Cleaning out my inner bowel won't change the fate of the earth, I'm pretty sure.

No, but it could be amusing.
Yeah, right.
It might make you feel better.







You feel better.
Come next.
Just keep looking.
It's up there somewhere.
Dig a little deeper.
Yeah, yeah.
It's Philo.
Philo's the one that knows Bob.
Just keep looking.
I know he's up there.
You're the one that handed me that memo.
He was, it started, it was his fault.
It really was.
You would have said so right in that movie.
I didn't realize you could do that.
If you come off.
Ouch.
Let's make dinner.
Who's ready for breakfast?
I'm ready.










Mealtime is just a minute away.
Where's that big old hog we're going to slaughter for bacon?
I need a, I'll just rub its ass and throw it on the fire and go to town.
Or go to bed.
Turn over and go back to bed.
Who wants to go to bed now?
I drank all that coffee for nothing.
Murdered it again.
I ain't telling them I pulled this out.
I'm going to come with it.
Say what?
I ain't telling them I pulled my hands out.
The world ain't going to come with it.
Yeah.
That's what, that extra detritus up there.
Well, thank you all for having the faith, suckers, to get up in the morning and, six
in the morning and come down here.
To be disappointed by man yet again, Reverend Stang.
Well, it just.
Tell my mom I do have faith.
See?
What?
I got to hand it to you.
That's a good balloon.
He's got a faith that's strong.
Strong enough to fit on.
Yeah.
As long as I've got a face, you've got a place.
There but.
There.
Well, that's the safest sex of all.
No, that's okay.
My turn.
Turn your head and cough.
Yeah.
It's so sad.
It's 7.05.
5 a.m.
And now it's July 5th.
And the subgenius has turned to plastic covered safe sex.
We are a little gutsy.
We're supposed to have those full body condoms.
Well, they did that.
That was, um.
Yeah, but it's not big enough.
The naked, the naked gun.
Yeah.
The smell of fear.
Hmm.
Smells like fear in here.
I think they'll never.
Smells like disappointment.
I lose my touch.
Smells like anguish.






And hopelessness.
Oh, it smells like teen spirit.
I don't even smell a froth.
I got it on top of my head.
Clamished with some little plastic widget-y thing.
Well, the excess didn't come.
Instead I had to like line up like a fucking goat.
Where's the booze and heroin?
They're on the sauce.
And antidepressants.
Time to go down.
We have to go on harder and harder drugs.
Every year you fail us, Tang.
We don't have anything left.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry.











Actually you're right.
We need something stronger than roofies.
Because the ones I took 20 minutes ago aren't working at all.
I'm just kidding.
I didn't really take them 20 minutes ago.
My God.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah.
You're talking about Peter Sellers, yeah?
Hmm?
Anything stronger now we got to grind up Keith Richards.
You have a nice one.
Well, there is that.
You have a nice one.

I'm going to go with the one that's a little bit more.




I've got a little bit of lunk left over from legume and chas.
We do have little scrapings from legumes' lungs that help us forget.
It would probably give us whatever he had.
Got a little bit of chas lunk.
No.
Some heathen lunk.
No.
No.
Those guys are already there.
They're on the saucers.
Dr. Dart.
Dr. Dart.
Well, he didn't frog.
I don't care for his lunk.
Lunk.
Lung junk.
It's the stuff they scrape out of subgenius lungs when you die.
It's pretty strong stuff.
Come on.
Blow on it, girl.
Susie, come on now.
You can blow better than that.
Well, that's what everyone's heard.
That's what I read on that bathroom wall.
Okay.
If the new Bobby here is going to show up and go, mm, good job.
For a good time called WREK Atlanta.
That's for that five packers.
Bob's Slut Time Funhouse.
Yeah.
Four and out.
You guys are just trying to make me feel jealous.
I did have.
I did have.
Look, okay.
Here's the Church of the Subgenius, friends.
This is what we're reduced to.
Reduced to?
Fake dicks made of blown up camel delivering hands.
We are ascendant.






Not even realistic dicks.
Let's be gone.
Let's leave.
Let me to your tranny, man.
It's okay, Tori.
You didn't miss a thing.
Oh, I was here.
Oh, were you?
She was here.
Yep.
She was here.
Yeah, I was the only one that wasn't.
Once again, you didn't miss anything.
Sorry.
Tori was the only one they took.
They just sent her back.
They didn't kill her.
They didn't kill her.
Stank fucked us all.
Again.
I wish.
I don't remember that.
Wouldn't that be nice?
Wouldn't that be fun?
Right?
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.

I was hoping.
I feel just as fucked as anybody.
Possibly more.
Why, Lo?
Come here, Stan.
Bob couldn't have let us.
Could a preacher be wrong or lie?
A preacher can't.
Would a salesman lie or be wrong?
Well, that's different.
That's different.
I remember those days.
I feel like a teenager again.
It's been a long time.






Bob said, why tell the mundane truth when a creative lie is so much more entertaining?
Yeah, well, what's the creative lie?
Because I'm really tired of the mundane truth.
Yeah.
We've been getting that up the butt for a long time now.
Well, it was funny 25 years ago.
Just grab your ankles and learn to enjoy the ride.
Bag bomb.
I'd have to be getting retreaded every month.
I know.

I'm getting retreaded every month, too.

Okay, time for breakfast, everyone.
It's cool, man.
Is there a pancake breakfast somewhere?
What was that old song?
Welcome to the camp.
I'm glad that you all heeded Bob's call.
My name is Ivan and I own the Trademarks all.
If you want to copy Bob, you'll have to cut my balls.
So, pull down your panties and cut my balls.







If you want your pants in, pull out your wallet.
You cannot escape Bob's thrall, ban...
We're not going to take it.
Duh!
Nobody...
What are you going to do with this chorus, you know?
We're not going to take it.
I've given you the opening, okay?
We're not going to take it.
Okay.
Okay.
Stank's been raped and dumped and flumped and everything.

Okay, now we can have breakfast, right?
Scrambled eggs, hard-boiled eggs, toast.
Scrambled eggs is a working word for yesterday until he came up with three syllables.
Scrambled eggs.
Continental breakfast.
A little bowl of cornflakes in a box that you pour milk into the box.
With the wine from Mr. Sister?
Yeah, right.
That's what we get for 7 a.m.
We all stayed up.
So we get a little cardboard box full of cornflakes.
You rip the box open and pour in Mr. Sister's hot wine.
From leftover from yesterday.
Hot wine.
That's it.
You've got the Kool-Aid.
That's the problem.
Hot wine.
You've got to put a newspaper in there.
Oh, I remember years when we had the tub of Kool-Aid.
Poor old Friday Jones stirring that tub of Kool-Aid.
That great big bin.
Waiting for us to show up.
Yeah, that's exactly.
That's me.
There you go.
It's a time lapse.
It's X day.
The church of the subgenius slowly just...
It wilts away.
Tentacles all sagging.
All deflated.
Kiss me, Mr. Kool-Aid.
It's only time every 7.15 I get to have some kind of sex with Susie.
Through plastic.
Some kind of sex.
Yeah, some kind of.
Some horrible.
Some kind of sex.
That's the closest.
Some kind of sex.
That's the closest we get to the escape vessels.
Passenger.
Plastic tentacles.
Oh.
Wait, look.
We're all in this together, folks.
I'm.

Unfortunately.
Yeah.
To shake hands with the exit.
Yeah.
To where they are.
All of us reaching up.
Reaching up to the sky.
Yeah.
Why everybody say up?
Everybody looks up.
All the way up to Uranus.
How do we know they're not going to come out from underground like the Martians?
The Spielberg War of the world.
Flying saucers.
And flying saucers don't fly through the ground.
That's like totally.
People don't even think about it.
Those are digging saucers.
That's like ducks flying.
You know.
Crawling under the ground.
They don't talk about digging saucers.
Yeah.
They fly through the hollow earth and then come up through the ground.
So complicated, though.
Yeah, it should be simple.
Yeah.
What the lasers are for.
But we're the ones that are simple.
Like that fellow.
That fellow is simple.
He is a simple fellow of unassuming mean.
Which one?
The one with the hat with the cup on his hat.
All those guys.
Everybody who got up at 7am.
Or the one with the duck on his head.
Or the one with the pipes up his, you know.
You know.
Hey.
You know.
Fundaments.
The one with the glow sticks.
There's a slowly deflighting air mattress waiting for us, dear.
Oh, is that what you're going to escape on?
Yeah, that's our flying carpet.
A deflated air mattress.
With a leak.
Deflate your mouth.
Oh, that's a good one.
Yeah.
I don't even remember what that's like anymore.
There.
So many, so many X days.
Next year, Adwisteria.
More tickets?
Well, we remember the red tickets.
No, no.
Forget the green tickets.
It was the red tickets.
You reckon that'll do it?
We didn't have enough?
I mean, you know, I'll sell you more tickets right now.
Anybody.
Five dollars a ticket.
Right now.
Oh, great.
Now the scalpers come out.
Oh, we have to unite us as drugs.
That'll work.
Okay.
Yeah, no.
Yeah, hey.
Things are, it's not all bad.
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.
Where's that heroin and roofies?
I want to just.
Stark and a reversal.
I just want to go home and get my finger licked by my dog.
Potatoes.
Potatoes.
What a bitch.
I guess he had the right idea.
Well, let's shuffle on away, dear.
Once again, another X day.
This just looks like the scene in that movie.
There's Princess Weave smiling, looking beautiful.
Me in this stupid shirt.
Reverend Bunny made.
Everybody sadly trudging away.
I'm on the road.
Film seven.
You made a shit hole out of heaven.
I think it's all insanity.
It's just a stark fist of reality.
Yeah.
Nice.
Stark fist of reality.
Yeah.
You were full of songs yesterday.
Really?
I was full of something yesterday.
I think it was frat, but.
Princess Weave and I have certainly been filking lately.
Yeah.
Yeah.
When is that performance going to take place?
Huh?
When is that performance going to take place?
What, Buddy?
Yes.
No, next year.
Oh.
Buddy.
Yeah.
It's not ready to be launched.
No.
We have to train the orchestra.
Going to launch Buddy?
I think I did.
Rock opera.
Pop, pop, pop.
Pop rock opera.
Pop rock opera?
Rock, rock dog opera.









Pop rock opera.
Yeah.
F-rock, rock, rock, rock.
Rock opera.
F-rock, rock, rock, rock.

Oh, there you go.
Okay.
F-rock, rock opera.
Phantom of the F-rock opera.
There's a new, our new Hollywood movie.
Phantom of the F-rock opera.
Oh, come on, oh no, we'll just trudge back to the car.
Another July Fifth, trudging back to the van.
and...
Ugh.
Phooey.
Another two hours of show
where we bitch and gripe and whine
and come up with excuses.
Excuses.
Excuses.
Excuses.
That's life!
That's life!
That's what all the people say.
You're riding high in April,
shot down in May.
But I know I'm gonna change that tune.
When I'm back on top,
back on top in June,
I said that's life!
That's life!
And as funny as it sounds,
it may seem,
some people get their kicks
stomping on a dream.
But I don't let it,
let it get me down.
Cause this fine old world,
it keeps spinning around.
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet,
a pawn and a king.
I've been up and down and over,
and out.
And I know one thing.
Each time I find myself
flat on my face,
I pick myself up and get back in the race.
That's life!
That's life!
I tell you, I can't deny it.
I thought of quitting, baby.
But my heart just ain't gonna buy it.
I thought of quitting, baby. But my heart just ain't gonna buy it.
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try,
I'd jump right on a big bird,
and then I'd fly.
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet,
a pawn and a king.
I've been up and down and over, and out.
And I know one thing.
Each time I find myself
playing,
flat on my face,
I just pick myself up and get back in the race.
That's life!
That's life!
That's life!
And I can't deny it.
Many times,
I thought of cutting out, but my heart won't buy it.
But if there's nothing shaking, come this here July.
I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball.
And I'm...
My, my...
My...
And this is
Subgenius Radio ministry hour of slack
at Stately Fossil House on
lovely Stang Ranch in bucolic Glen Rose, Texas. P.O. Box 807-76043. And it just now suddenly
occurred to me that this month, so-called January of so-called 2020, is in fact the 40th anniversary
of the public outreach of the Church of the Subgenius. Bob was immaculated by Jehovah One
in 1953, and that's when the church really began, but it was kept pretty much undercover until Bob
authorized Dr. Philo Drummond and myself to publish Subgenius Pamphlet Number One,
which we picked up from the printer on January 2nd of 1980. 40 damn years! And you can hear it
in my voice. A good thing they made that movie when they did. Incidentally, I believe they've
got a distribution deal now, so soon we'll be seeing...
J.R. Bob Dobson, the Church of the Subgenius, on screens everywhere, or at least somewhere.
It's really good, too. Anyway, yep, 40 years! Hell, I've stood there waiting for the saucers at 7 a.m.
24 July 5th. The late Dr. Dark was with me for 22 of them. Dr. Howell and Reverend Susie the Fluesy
were there for most of them. And Dr. Howell's still...
there in this tinny, heavily filtered recording with Philo Drummond and the mysterious reverend
known as X from July 3rd, although they sound more like it's July 5th at about 8 a.m.
Back to Centerville, Ohio, where the tall corn grows. Birthplace of Brick Burnside.
All-American Goofy.
Notional Pre-Record Radio. Please pledge.
Pledge your break now.
Just one dollar. One dollar, you can make a difference in this child's life.
Yes, little Timmy Pibber, age 19, has never owned a set of electric trains. But you can make up this difference.
Your contribution will be...
immeasurable help in changing his life from one who never enjoyed this pleasure of childhood to one more adjusted and able to face a brighter tomorrow because of his knowledge of, nay, obsession with switches, track coupling controls, and rolling stock.
Yes, rolling stock.
Then there's his stamp collection, but I won't go on.
It's important to have a...
hobby. Join a church group. Help others.
Don't just sit at home twiddling your thumbs.
I tried, Hob.
Come hear the music play.
Hobbies just didn't seem to work for me.
You know, there was this time I took up knife throwing, and...
At Hobby Empire, you can make an entire castle out of old popsicle sticks.
It's easy and fun.
We'll take up all your spare time.
Give you that...
and a strange feeling of pride.
But luckily, the prosecuting attorney wasn't mad at me for impaling his wife.
Having a machine gun in your backyard is no crime, at least not today.
And so I think none of us were surprised when the favorable verdict was reached in that case.
Four dead...
in one little town.
Also an ornamental pond.
Full of goldfish.
Although it does tend to attract Brer Raccoon and his minions.
In addition to a water feature, your backyard retreat can...
Have come.
...be graced by a miniature Greek temple.
Temple.
Yes, it'll hardly cost you anything. Just leave it to me.
And we'll have it all there, all set up and in the ground before St. Swithin's.
Day.
I won't remember.
You're the guy, you're the guy, you're the guy that, uh, took my Wanda.
Well, I just want to thank you for that.
I'll wander as I wander.
I don't think you wandered his little sister.
Uh, a fish.
I was dead.
And, and what are you up to, Philo?
Are you, uh, know any good ones?
Uh, of course, uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
We all grew up with...
Music.
To soothe the savage beast.
Wrestling Women Versus the Aztec Mummy.
A K. Gordon Murray production.
Ting-Kong. Watch it again.
There is, uh...
You'll see some Murray.
There is a shape-shifting Aztec mummy involved in this motion picture.
And our...
Well-endowed female, uh, wrestlers, the luchadores, uh, take on, uh, the mummy and not only that,
uh, a robot and other antagonists which, uh, make life a challenge for them in historic
old Mexico.
In addition, the mummy is able to change its molecular structure and can even appear as
a tarantula or, and other unlikely products of metamorphosis.
Oh, your imagination.
No, it's all in the movie.
In the Wrestling Women Versus the Aztec Mummy.
Wow.
A K. Gordon Murray production.
I bet you've seen it, Philo.
Haven't you seen that one?
You've seen that one?
Yeah, I've got a copy of that one.
He's got it.
He's got that movie.
It's easy.
It's the movie I'm talking about.
I'm sort of a movie collector and I like weird, obscure stuff.
He actually has a copy of Wrestling Women Versus the Aztec Mummy.
It's in my left eyebrow now.
Hmm.
Now, it's been stored in nano-modules in your cellular structure.
Uh-huh.






That's right.
You can do this too at home in your spare time.
Have your eyeball outfitted as a projector.
And then you can serve projectile outfitters?
In the new miracle of the screen, SenseAround, Todd AO, CinemaScope, VistaVision.
There's nothing else out there.
Now in the splendor of giant Panimation.
Dynimation 90.
The new Panimation.

The new miracle of the screen.
Don't open the door.
Regiscope.
Don't christen the baby.
Don't go in the basement.
Don't do anything.
No.
You've got to do something.
If you can only do one thing to do, one thing today, you should do it.
And if you can't do one thing today, well then you're pretty damn lazy.
That's what I gotta say.
You just not.
You gotta.
Nonsense.
There's always something you can do.
And just think of the physical accomplishment that you will feel.
Yes, you will beam with pride.
Your chest will swell and expand as you consider how you made a difference this one day of
day.
Of light will fill your head as you remember you've been spread.
A corona of light.
That all the doctors this world's ever known.
Heroes.
Halo will play over your brow.
When?
When this procedure has been completed.
Somebody.
Who is that?
Do you see that mixer in front of you?
I do.
Some of those.
Those are the ones.
Yeah.
Let's see it.
There.
That one.
That was the one I think.
So you're cutting down the.
So.
Yeah.
Echo.
Say something.
Echo.
No.
You're great.
You're fine there.
Echo.
Echo.
Yes.
That.
That.



That reverberation was an Ivanstang artifact.
He just left it there cause he's so deaf he didn't hear himself...
Right, but we heard it.
So it was like turning it up.
Yeah.
We're always too loud he's never loud enough.
Said the deaf man.
To Evanstang?
Then he said, I can't get no poontang.
What's that joke?
Oh, yeah.
How come farts stink?
How come?
So deaf people can enjoy them too?
Yeah.
I thought I was sad because I had no feet.
Then I met a man who had no frop.
Oh, that's terrible.
I thought I was sad because I had no feet.
Until I met a man that had no body.
Nobody.
Well, he should have been sad.
Everybody needs to have somebody.
And there's nothing attached to me.
Yeah.
I'm just a discorporated entity.
As free as a discorporated entity can be.
I can do it.
Do it to me.
I don't exist in reality.
There's no body.
Attached to me.
No equations apply to me.
So you really just want to keep on doing nonstop show 24 hours a day?
No, I'm about ready to hang it up for today.
Stang has abandoned his post.
Stang's abandoned his post.
He's no longer radio show, Carson's radio show host.
Longer than an hour, less than a show.
And then Stang said,
Yes, Stang did that.
And Stang said,
And then Stang said this.
And Stang said that.
And the waters he called rain.
And then he parted the sea.
And the land he called the driveway.
And all the Hebrews stepped forth.
And they came out burning.
And it was hotter and hotter and hotter.
And I reached out.
And as I reached out, the flames shattered.
And I was falling.
I was falling into the void.
Into the void.
Into the void.
Well, do you have a history of this in your family?
Void where prohibited.
Officer, I was just doing what the sign said.
The sign said void where prohibited.
Well, if you voided something,
you should have voided it where they are less uninhibited.
But I'm a inhibited man.
I'm a inhibited man.
I'm Bob.
Let Bob be praised.
And good night.
Oh, and now that the red broadcast light is off,
the big membership pack is $35 plus postage.
And no, it's not just a bunch of stickers.
Just reading the first few booklets will take you weeks.
And you might not ever finish reading them.
Because for some people, they just keep going on and on,
changing each time you pick it up.
And of course, there are also stickers and decoder pins and posters
and extremely official looking, densely torrid documents,
frameable documents.
And you really do become an ordained minister
who can perform marriages and have a funny special title
and name of your own choosing.
And you get access to the secrets.
And...
And I'll be able to see you next X Day, 23 X Day,
this June 30th through July 5th,
again at Wisteria in Southern Ohio.
See the events section in subgenius.com for details
and lots of photo essays on the old school X Day drills
before cell phones,
when a lot of the ladies and gents were younger and cuter
and would take off all their clothes.
For some reason, once everybody had a phone camera,
and their grannies all got on the internet too,
well, you don't see as much nakedity
as we did back around the turn of the century.
Heck, at Starwood Festival,
which still follows X Day in the same place,
I've had to step over couples copulating in the dark
just outside the crazed ritual caveman bonfire
drumming and dancing circle.
Ah, them was the days.
Back before all this internet hooves,
we were in the end of privacy.
Oh, well.
Hurry up, X Day.
We want to get off.
And now back to these Captain Beefheart instrumentals.
Praise beef.
