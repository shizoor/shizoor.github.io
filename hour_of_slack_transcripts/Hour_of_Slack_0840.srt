1
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,220
Welcome to Vox System. How may I help you?

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,260
It's almost certain that our networks of warning stations would detect incoming bombers or missiles

3
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,400
in time for you to reach shelter or at least take cover.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,080
You may receive warning of an attack by radio, television, or through the outdoor warning system in your community.

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,500
It's important that you learn to recognize the attack warning signal and not confuse it with any other.

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,040
In most places, the standard attack warning signal is a mob or a series of...

7
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,580
Oh, don't cry. Okay, don't cry. Ah!

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,840
Either of these signals means that an actual enemy attack has been detected

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,380
and you should take protective action immediately.

10
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,820
Can you tell me what's happening here?

11
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,340
Well, my sources are no longer fully annotated and my information is somewhat anecdotal,

12
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,020
but I believe what was once one race is now two.

13
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,600
One above and one below.

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,480
Two distinct species that have evolved.

15
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,860
And how do those below survive?

16
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,020
That is the real question, isn't it?

17
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,720
I don't believe it.

18
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,340
Well, if you don't like the answers, you should avoid asking the questions.

19
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,060
Well, welcome to the hour of slack.

20
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,900
Brady, Bob, Gold, and Connie drag.

21
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,740
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack.

22
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,380
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

23
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,960
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,600
La, la, la, hour of slack.

25
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,140
Hey, what's going on?

26
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,600
Along with Bob, the pursuit of slack, and a conspiracy of pinks,

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,800
the subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse.

28
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,180
According to church doctrine, on July 5th, 1998,

29
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,380
when the television signal of Amos and Andy reaches the men from Planet X,

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,920
the aliens will unleash their wrath upon the Earth.

31
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,200
And the men from Planet X are going to come down and take over Earth.

32
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,300
They're going to...

33
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,780
They will put us out of our misery unless Bob can explain to them

34
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,740
in ways that they can understand that there is something on Earth worth saving.

35
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,400
And only the subgenii, the dues-paying, book-buying,

36
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,400
receipt-in-the-pocket, paid in full to the church subgenii,

37
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,420
have the tiniest prayer.

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,240
The rest of them?

39
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,000
It's a tough world, Jack.

40
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,660
That's right, friends.

41
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,340
A red-letter day.

42
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,700
Yes, a red-letter day.

43
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,460
Andy, what?

44
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,540
July 5th, year 2001.

45
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,600
What a delightful day.

46
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,580
Gigantic flying saucers come down out of the blue sky

47
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,400
to pick up the happy-go-lucky subgeniuses

48
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,920
and their pets.

49
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,360
Bluebirds.

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,560
And all their worldly goods.

51
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:29,980
And swallows.

52
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,660
Because, friends, you can take it with you when you're a subgenius, sure.

53
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,580
A throne of gold can be yours.

54
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,880
You can take off and get it on with...

55
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,980
And Dave here, who will be your driver throughout Earth's space.

56
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,260
Step in. Step in, please.

57
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,340
Stand clear of the closing door.

58
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,420
Step in, please.

59
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,780
Stand clear of the closing door.

60
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,040
Red line, please, only.

61
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,540
Blue line to the left.

62
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,660
Red line to the right.

63
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,980
Welcome, and we'll be embarking for, well,

64
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,680
wherever these escape vessels escape to.

65
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,900
No one's ever asked, and we're not telling.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,640
What's going to happen to your children?

67
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,120
What's going to happen to your children?

68
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,520
What's going to happen to you when this society we've created,

69
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,200
when this society we've created,

70
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,080
air conditions,

71
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,680
air conditions,

72
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,560
station wagons with wooden sides,

73
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,220
station wagons with wooden sides,

74
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,900
horses, indeed,

75
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,660
a retired actor, indeed,

76
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,380
orange hail,

77
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,000
orange hail,

78
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,500
what happens when that collapses?

79
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,820
What happens when your diary was a damn well?

80
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,880
What happens when your diary was a damn well?

81
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,580
That's when the man from Planet X-9,

82
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,560
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius jerk.

83
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,240
Save the members of the subgenius jerk.

84
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,840
But until that day,

85
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,960
the power and wisdom of Bob can help us break their mind control

86
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,000
by activating that mutant gland that we all have within us.

87
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,460
But one thing is for sure,

88
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,500
and if you let Bob do your thinking for you,

89
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,440
you won't have to worry about nothing come July 4th, 1998.

90
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,780
Ha ha ha ha!

91
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,020
When Bob comes down in his giant mothership,

92
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,800
looking kind of like a big pillbox,

93
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,660
Bob will be landing and you can climb right in

94
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,960
because he's going to know.

95
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,840
He's going to have your name on a computer printout.

96
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,840
Yes, sir, dear friends,

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,740
and that CRT tube available right there at his fingertips.

98
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,640
He can call your name up and he'll know exactly what you do.

99
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,360
He'll know exactly what you've done for him.

100
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,120
He'll know exactly how much donations you've taken in.

101
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,820
He'll know exactly how much money you've given to the church.

102
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,220
And he said,

103
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,360
yea, the head of the prophet,

104
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,920
Bob shall never bleed.

105
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,080
Ha ha ha ha!

106
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,460
Ha ha ha ha!

107
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,480
Hoo-rah!

108
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,220
Hoo-rah!

109
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,120
Oh!

110
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,740
They are friendly people.

111
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,380
And...

112
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:03,740
they are by far more advanced spiritually and physically

113
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,580
than the people of this planet.

114
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,540
At the present time, they are observing us.

115
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,660
They wish to help us to help ourselves

116
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:23,800
to attain a higher understanding of life and its meaning.

117
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,620
What do you think?

118
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,280
What do you think about Bob?

119
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,820
Who's Bob?

120
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,460
All right, well, what do you think about the UFOs

121
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,020
which are presently going to...

122
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,920
which are presently in formation to blitz the Earth

123
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,920
and put particle beams through the head of everyone that doesn't know Bob?

124
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,440
You're out of your mind.

125
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,960
Spacecraft entered the Moon's gravitational field

126
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,360
in the sixth segment of the flight.

127
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,260
The gravity of the Moon is one-sixth.

128
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,800
The Earth is one-tenth of the Earth's gravity.

129
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,380
The orbit around the Moon was flown 66 miles above the Moon's surface

130
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,360
at 6,000 miles an hour.

131
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,480
At ten after nine, the beeping began.

132
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,800
We went down to the reserve fence,

133
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,460
watched through binoculars,

134
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,740
and we did see this thing.

135
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,540
Now, it's about the size of the Moon,

136
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,040
with a small crescent at the bottom

137
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,960
that's well-lit like starlight.

138
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,060
The top is a dark gray mass.

139
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,420
It came down through the trees, whatever it was.

140
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,880
Have you ever heard of one?

141
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,280
Have you ever been in one?

142
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,240
Have you ever seen one?

143
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,900
Have you, by television, ever seen one?

144
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,740
If you haven't, it's the greatest sight this side of heaven.

145
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,440
People from this Earth have already seen some of their spacecraft,

146
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,720
which they call flying saucers,

147
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,540
and other flying objects which they cannot describe.

148
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,960
These objects are real, and are spacecraft.

149
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,960
The astronauts returned to Earth on the sixth day of the week.

150
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,280
Friends and neighbors of planet Earth,

151
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,960
I come to you from a long, long ways off.

152
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,160
I come from a planet that is similar to yours.

153
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,920
Your many fears, tensions, and frustrations are no longer ours.

154
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,100
I hate them with all my heart.

155
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,880
They're inhuman.

156
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,040
They're inhuman.

157
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,700
They're inhuman to be destroyed.

158
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,900
What is your objective?

159
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,880
You are not ready, but we will still save you.

160
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,480
I'll be right here.

161
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:43,880
I was first contacted by a being from the planet Mars.

162
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:51,880
Now, this man was invisible to me, except that he did cast a shadow in the moonlight.

163
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:58,960
By 1998, every normal, mediocrity, pink boy, admin,

164
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,860
Trekkie, and hippie is going to be trying to get on board with the good ship dogs.

165
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,140
Or they're going to fry along with everybody else when those aliens get here.

166
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,620
Of course, such a prophecy immediately arises our cynicism.

167
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,860
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999?

168
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,480
Perhaps.

169
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,560
Or is it just another of those prognostications which have haunted man through the ages?

170
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:33,220
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom could generally be dismissed out of hand, but for

171
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,280
the fact that many of Nostradamus's other prophecies have already been fulfilled.

172
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,660
But the old ones are coming back.

173
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm going to let them through.

174
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,560
And Sam's old and old birdies?

175
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:49,840
Yes.

176
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:49,840


177
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,400
And Baa-ood.

178
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,200
The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout.

179
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,440
There are people in them, and many of them have already landed on this earth.

180
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:12,140
Oh, give me back my lost freedom.

181
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,200
Oh, ye alien stick men.

182
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,300
Oh, give me back my gone cat.

183
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,820
Oh, great daddy-o from outer space.

184
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,700
Oh, give me warning.

185
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
Oh, space creatures.

186
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,620
Give me the signal.

187
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,760
Oh, hideous alien monster creatures from the beyond world.

188
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,560
Not just for Bob, Walt, and all the...

189
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,380
Don't worry, you're safe.

190
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,920
I control them.

191
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:11,620
Without that control, they would exhaust the food supply in a matter of months.

192
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,580
Food supply?

193
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,400
They're human beings.

194
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,280
Who are you to question me?

195
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,680
Eight hundred thousand years ...

196
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,780
... of evolution.

197
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,060
This is a perversion of every natural law!

198
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,480
F Sikh!

199
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,120
How are you?

200
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,920
Let's have something to eat.

201
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:43,580
We've got shameful efren Mit-ange.

202
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:49,140
I'm tired of the feeling of the slug's tooth.

203
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,260
What's wrong with you?

204
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,320
Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low

205
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,800
I leaned back on my radio

206
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,180
Some cat was laying down some rock and roll at a solar cell

207
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,200
Then the loud sound that seemed to fight

208
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,940
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of ice

209
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,480
That were no DJ, that was hazy cosmitice

210
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,420
There's a starman waiting in the sky

211
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,420
He'd like to come and meet us, but he thinks he'd blow our minds

212
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:42,220
There's a starman waiting in the sky

213
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,920
He's told us not to blow it, cause he knows it's all worthwhile

214
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
He told us not to blow it, cause he knows it's all worthwhile

215
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:47,920


216
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,940
Let the children lose it, let the children use it

217
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,320
Let all the children boo get

218
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,600
I'm the urban spaceman, baby, I've got speed

219
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,920
I've got everything I need

220
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,240
I'm the urban spaceman, baby, I can fly

221
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,620
I'm a supersonic guy

222
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,180
I don't need pleasure, I don't feel pain

223
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:42,420
If you were to knock me down, I'd just get up again

224
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,580
I'm the urban spaceman, baby, I can fly

225
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,900
I'm the urban spaceman, baby, I'm making out

226
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,680
I'm all about

227
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,340
I wake up every morning with a smile upon my face

228
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:14,480
My natural exudate spills out all over the place

229
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm the urban spaceman, I'm intelligent and clean

230
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,380
Know what I mean

231
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,060
I'm the urban spaceman, as a lover second to none

232
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,980
It's a lot of fun

233
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,440
I never let my friends down

234
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,520
I've never made a boo

235
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,700
I'm a glossy magazine

236
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,920
A map put in the tube

237
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,560
I'm the urban spaceman, baby

238
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,320
Here comes the twist

239
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,240
I don't exist

240
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:35,420
I don't shine, I'm what you think I'm supposed to be

241
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:35,420


242
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:35,420


243
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:35,420


244
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,520
I don't want to break the law

245
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:37,540
諸 några слов harmonici

246
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:37,540


247
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,120
Bad choices to make

248
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,120


249
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,120


250
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,520
Social Astro

251
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,980
There's no way

252
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,620
People talking

253
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,280
Hindi

254
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,620
I'm a lady

255
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,460
What you gonna do when you feel your lady rolling?

256
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,480
How you gonna feel when you see your lady strolling?

257
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,200
On the deck of a starship with her head hooked into a drum

258
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
And I'm on hijack

259
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,580
I gotta get back and head to the things that matter

260
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:26,120
America hates the crazies and you got to let go, you know

261
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,760
You got to let go, you know

262
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,020
You got to let go, you know

263
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,440
Or else you stay

264
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,700
Or else you stay

265
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,500
Oh, I'm a lady

266
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,740
What you gonna do when you feel your lady rolling?

267
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,940
I'm a lady

268
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,420
What you gonna do when you feel your lady rolling?

269
00:16:52,420 --> 00:17:04,140
On the deck of a starship with her head hooked into a drum

270
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,140


271
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,200
I gotta get back and head to the things that matter

272
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,500
America hates the crazies and you got to let go, you know

273
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,860
You got to let go, you know

274
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,340
You got to let go, you know

275
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,900
You got to let go, you know

276
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,840
You got to let go, you know

277
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,480
You got to let go, you know

278
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,540
You got to let go, you know

279
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,220
You got to let go, you know

00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,220
You got to let go, you know

283
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,220


284
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,220


285
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,920
What you gonna do about this?

286
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,240
They are already here only to be recognized

287
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,640
These noble people could not come up to anybody on the street and say,

288
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,420
I'm from Venus

289
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,480
They would lose that nobility

290
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,280
There would be an ego speaking out and saying,

291
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,140
Look I'm from Venus

292
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,380
Now, what you going to do about this?

293
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,800
No, they're humble people

294
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,840
And they'll wait until in your own eyes you'll recognize who they are

295
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,460
They're you friends

296
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,700
Oh yes, dear friends

297
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,440
Well, I guess we oughta get to the traditional part real quick

298
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,720
quick. Jay, get it out of the way.

299
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,400
Link tentacles

300
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,300
and for just a solemn

301
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,320
moment of sacred...

302
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,120
Praise Bob!

303
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,000
Praise Bob! Praise

304
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,200
God! God!

305
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,360
God Bob!

306
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,640
Friends,

307
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,400
praise Bob, you get what you pay for.

308
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,200
I don't care

309
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,460
about the unsaved. I don't

310
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,540
care about those who never sent their $30

311
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,140
to Bob. I'm preaching to the

312
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,120
dues-paying subgeniuses. Yes, this

313
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,940
time, I'm preaching

314
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:16,940
to the choir.

315
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,180
Normally, we do it the other way

316
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,180
around. We're not like those other churches

317
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,220
that only preach to the choir. We like

318
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,840
to go right down into the

319
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,980
dens of iniquity like this club

320
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,140
where they sell drugs

321
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,220
like beer and liquor

322
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,960
and stuff. And Batman

323
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,820
Bob is the

324
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,140
only one whose instructions you

325
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,580
should always follow.

326
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,800
Question of course,

327
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,560
me or else.

328
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,160
See

329
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,700
the fire sweeping

330
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,940
our

331
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,640
very streets today

332
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,180
Burned

333
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,560
like a red coal

334
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,480
carpet, mad

335
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,940
bull has lost its way

336
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,480
No

337
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,000
children

338
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,120
can

339
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,540
be

340
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:13,540


341
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,620
It's just a shot away

342
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,820
It's just a shot away

343
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,720
Born

344
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,320
children

345
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,900
It's just a shot away

346
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,320
It's just a shot away

347
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:23,780
Shot away

348
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,860
Shot away

349
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,560
Shot away

350
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,420
Shot away

351
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,600
It's things falling apart.

352
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,540
It's fat ladies in double-knit jumpsuits beating their kids in Krogers.

353
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,820
20th century traditions.

354
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,120
It's the old

355
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,120


356
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,120


357
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,120


358
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,120


359
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,120


360
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,120


361
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,120


362
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,120


363
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,120


364
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,120


365
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,740
traditions. It's all the things that got us where we are now.

366
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,180
It's Christ without a penis.

367
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:55,000
The end of the world can easily become your personal stepping stone to prosperity.

368
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,240
But any case, yeah, look, look.

369
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,900
But it's just a conspiracy.

370
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,560
Did you know that jalopy comes from jalopies?

371
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,460
But the conspiracy will fall.

372
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,840
Will fall come X day.

373
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,100
Which might or might not be this jalopy.

374
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,080
July 5th.

375
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,840
At this point we have come.

376
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:21,140
I think Bob has taught us that the conspiracy has even fooled us with dates.

377
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,320
And 1998 hasn't happened yet.

378
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,880
But Bob's prophecy will come true sometime.

379
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,560
We will barbecue George W. Bush.

380
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,240
And Bob will supervise the teaming of the shrewds.

381
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,600
George Bush could avoid that.

382
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,540
And turn him over the grill.

383
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,900
George could avoid that fate.

384
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:47,680
But were he to submit his $30 membership love offering to Bob.

385
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,180
And become a minister.

386
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,600
And obtain slack.

387
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,180
And see the error of his ways.

388
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,680
Repent. Quit his job.

389
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,980
And if George Bush would just slack off in the middle of the night.

390
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Even with his wife watching him slacking off.

391
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,540
He would be free.

392
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,600
He'd be free.

393
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,720
He would no longer be pea shy.

394
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,860
Because X day is now.

395
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,880
My friend.

396
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,840
X day is now.

397
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,940
And will you be ready to meet Bob?

398
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,520
Will you be with Bob?

399
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,840
Or will you be down on the earth with George Bush.

400
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:28,100
Suffering the punishments that the sub-demuses will lash out upon the unforgiven.

401
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,480
And the blemished.

402
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,820
I can smell the foam all the way here in Toxic City man.

403
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,040
I hate them normal peoples.

404
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,220
Oh.

405
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,260
I can smell them burning.

406
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,320
I can smell them burning.

407
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:41,660
It's gonna be a great barbecue.

408
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,060
Bob will burn away that heat.

409
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,420
He'll burn away the radiation.

410
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,780
He'll burn away the fire.

411
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,680
It's sound.

412
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,180
And they will dance around the fire.

413
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,080
His children will.

414
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,140
Ah. Smell that barbecue.

415
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,700
Yeah. In Papua New Guinea we used to call it long pig dinner.

416
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,700
When we used to barbecue our enemies.

417
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,400
Well friends.

418
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,480
Not every sub-genius is vengeful like that.

419
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,320
Would you be.

420
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,560
Would you be.

421
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,460
Ask yourself friend.

422
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,900
If you were suddenly given for thirty dollars.

423
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,400
The magical power of being able to have instant and uh.

424
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,660
Uh.

425
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:18,860
Uh.

426
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:27,840
Unjudged ability to punish all that you ever wanted to punish for any sin they ever did to you.

427
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,640
Well make your eyes water just thinking about that.

428
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,340
You're going to have to pinch your sphincter.

429
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,560
All the punishment and vengeance you could made out just by your.

430
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,180
Or would you do that.

431
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:37,640
Would you.

432
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,440
Would you nurse your old grudges.

433
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:39,840
And.

434
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,180
And.

435
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,640
And.

436
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,540
And linger upon the disgusting filthy past.

437
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:43,880
I remember.

438
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,160
Or would you.

439
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,040
Or would you plow ahead into the future.

440
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,340
Uh.

441
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,060
The future.

442
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,820
You know thinking of tomorrow.

443
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,400
Not the sins of yesterday.

444
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,020
Tomorrow.

445
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,800
Well I.

446
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:53,980
Tomorrow.

447
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:53,980


448
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,220
Yesterday.

449
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,060
For a moomoo maybe.

450
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:55,800
And uh.

451
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,160
A lot of lay.

452
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,000
You know flowers around your neck.

453
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,420
You know.

454
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,140
And paddling your own canoe.

455
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,220
Softly.

456
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:02,640
Softly.

457
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,380
Through the distance.

458
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:03,740
You know.

459
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,840
As if nothing mattered.

460
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,660
With the starfish bumbling under your knees.

461
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,460
And the swords.

462
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,160
Attacking.

463
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,340
You could have that very slack in that canoe.

464
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,700
On X day.

465
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,960
Or you could have the slack of uh.

466
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:17,880
Of uh.

467
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,600
Sending killer robo beasts after.

468
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,520
Your hated fifth grade teacher.

469
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,320
Or some.

470
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,300
Girl.

471
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,560
That jilted you.

472
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,540
Or some boy that treated you wrong.

473
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,280
Like a dog.

474
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,580
Like a dirty dog.

475
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,840
Or define the future in the palm of other people's hands.

476
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,540
Or smell their feet and know their distant past.

477
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,840
Or to be able to walk in two directions at the same time.

478
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,200
All these are gifts which you do not take lightly.

479
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:43,960
Well the.

480
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,280
Those children of Bob who have uh.

481
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,480
Signed up and will enjoy these uh.

482
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:50,800
This.

483
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,460
This amazing rupture.

484
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,100
Yes.

485
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,220
The believers shall be ruptured.

486
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,600
And it's so inexpensive.

487
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,360
Only thirty dollars uh.

488
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,900
Love offering.

489
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,140
You should uh.

490
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,220
You know what you should do Stan.

491
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,520
You should tell them that this year for a limited time only since it is the only time.

492
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:07,520


493
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:07,520


494
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,900
It is the.

495
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,380
I told you.

496
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:09,380


497
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:09,680
Well.

498
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,400
You don't know.

499
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,800
That's Bob's point.

500
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,520
We don't know it.

501
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,000
But the X day could come like a thief in the night.

502
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,920
It could come right now.

503
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,000
Right now.

504
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,680
Are you ready?

505
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,540
Just like that slide pedal.

506
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,460
Are you ready?

507
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:21,900
Did you?

508
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,160
Or you been putting it off?

509
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,380
We go oh I'll get around to that collection plate come Sunday.

510
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:28,920
Oh yeah.

511
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,740
Oh yeah.

512
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,940
I'll be good come.

513
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,060
Or bad or whatever.

514
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,300
I'll get slack on Sunday.

515
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,360
In the meantime I'm just gonna be a slave to the conspiracy.

516
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,500
Friendship.

517
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:37,500


518
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:37,500


519
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:37,660
I'm ready.

520
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:41,540
Are you one of those people who like to place sardines in the collection plate?

521
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,420
Are you one of those people who like to chew the nighties of the undulating ladies hidden

522
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,640
downstairs below the church?

523
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,700
If you are one of these people you'd better look out because right over your shoulder

524
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,840
is the smiling smiling face.

525
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,380
J.

526
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,600
Kitty's growing babe.

527
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,160
Oh.

528
00:24:59,260 --> 00:24:59,400
Oh.

529
00:24:59,420 --> 00:24:59,820
Oh.

530
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,560
Oh.

531
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,860
I don't understand how you can sit there and speak so coldly about this.

532
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:05,920
I'm sorry.

533
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,480
I'm sorry.

534
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:07,480


535
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:07,800
Are you?

536
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:12,420
Have you not considered the human cost of what it is you're doing?

537
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,960
We all pay a price.

538
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,220
Oh don't grit.

539
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,600
Okay great.

540
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,720
Don't grit.

541
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,380
It's disgusting the way you treat humans.

542
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,600
Take me off to space.

543
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,320
Take me off to space.

544
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:37,280
Come on down you saucerman and take me off to space.

545
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,460
Take me off to space.

546
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:37,460


547
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:37,460


548
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:37,460


549
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:47,040
Take me off to space, take me off to space Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

550
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:56,340
Stick needles in my belly, take samples of my skin I don't care as long as I can live with saucer man

551
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:05,680
I know that you don't take requests but I'm a special case Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

552
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:15,100
Take me off to space, take me off to space Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

553
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:33,720
Hey cow mutilators, let me join your crew Give me an eye, you bet your life I'll cut up cows for you

554
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,660
I don't care if you're somebody special Take me off to space, take me off, take me off to space

555
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:35,660


556
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,520
Kind of ghastly fatto Fraude

557
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,200
Without a face

558
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,860
So come on down you saucermans

559
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,680
And take me off to space

560
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,260
Oh!

561
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,440
TAKE ME OFF TO SPaaaaaaace

562
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,720
TAKE ME OFF TO SPaaaaaaaaace

563
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,060
Come on down you saucermans

564
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,900
And take me off to space

565
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,340
Take me off to space

566
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,580
TAKE ME OFF TO SPaaaaCance

567
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,400
TAKE ME OFF TO SPaaaa Birru

568
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,580
Come down, you tiny robots with your little nipper claws.

569
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,160
You pale and bug-eyed aliens with white and clammy paws.

570
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,520
Life is just a sucker's dream and death is a disgrace.

571
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,100
So come on down, you saucer men, and take me off to space.

572
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,520
Oh, take me off to space.

573
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,460
Take me off to space.

574
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,920
Come on down, you saucer men, and take me off to space.

575
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,120
Take me off to space.

576
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,940
Space.

577
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,360
Take me off to space.

578
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,820
Come on down, you saucer men, and take me off to space.

579
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,280
Woo!

580
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,080
Yeah!

581
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,000
Oh, yes, dear friends.

582
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:55,820
Take me off to space by Nenslow, accompanied by Donna Cossie, Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger, and Jay Povten.

583
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,100
We've also heard lots of bits and pieces from the old media barrage.

584
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,640
Barrage number five now being remixed.

585
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:11,860
An ESO swamp radio with lonesome cowboy Dave and Professor Chaz on WCSB in Cleveland.

586
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:17,060
Friends, the titles of tonight's show were by the El Queso All-Stars,

587
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,480
and the music in the background right now is Lambre Systems.

588
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:27,020
Now, what we've been hearing a lot of this show and more shows,

589
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,380
is some new collages done by...

590
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,440
Paternostril.

591
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:37,680
Yes, Paternostril did that thing that started with David Bowie's Starman,

592
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,040
and Bonzo Dog, Doo-Dah Bands, Urban Spaceman,

593
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,020
even a little bit of Jefferson Starship,

594
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,260
and some bits from Rainbow Bridge,

595
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:52,000
and from yours truly preaching at the Austin D-Vival in 1997.

596
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,560
Friends, and more coming up, like huge escape vessels.

597
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,020
But that's for people who have cool red suits,

598
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,420
and they're not just going to be wearing them.

599
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:01,820
Yeah, so I...

600
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,620
Well, everybody's got a cool red suit, man.

601
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,900
No, no, I don't have a cool red suit.

602
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,680
Oh, man, you've got a cool red suit, and you don't know it's staying.

603
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,740
You've got a pair of snappy, cool red shoes.

604
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,280
It's all in your mindle case.

605
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,760
It's all in your staircase of your mind.

606
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,220
It's in your mindle brock.

607
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,940
Your DNA is like a glass-cleaning chamber that tells you this stuff is true,

608
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,020
and you can do it.

609
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,920
All you've got to do is just, like, cross your eyes,

610
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,040
and think fond thoughts about your own self,

611
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,900
your own personal body, and your belongings,

612
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,140
and suddenly you'll be that red suit, man.

613
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,020
Click your heels.

614
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,020
Heels together three times.

615
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,320
Well, if you want to, you know.

616
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,640
You can do all that stuff.

617
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,420
You can wave your hands around, I suppose.

618
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:37,940
I don't know.

619
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,320
It's said to really work.

620
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,360
You've heard of Norman Vincent Peale, haven't you?

621
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:49,120
Well, Dave, the point of this whole philosophical stance that we've been taking

622
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,300
is that none of that stuff works.

623
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,400
Only Bob can provide magic.

624
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,700
And instant power, success, and sales riches.

625
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,500
There you go.

626
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,500
Sex at the races.

627
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,620
Come on, man.

628
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,820
Pick up on it.

629
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,260
This is the last chance.

630
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,360
It's the last month for this planet, this world, this Earth, this dirtball,

631
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:13,320
this planet of the clocks, this gray, gray, old,

632
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:19,260
old, limp ball of schmata of a planet,

633
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,720
which once was Mars,

634
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,560
fooled and tricked into becoming a so-called Earth.

635
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,880
Yes, the ruse will end on it.

636
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,380
Next day, the secret will be revealed.

637
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,080
Earth.

638
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,760
Earth.

639
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,180
Back to Mars.

640
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,240
We must get the...

641
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,080
Take me home, my darling.

642
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,060
You feel...

643
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,940
Oh, yeah, I know how these people are thinking.

644
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,860
They'll go, oh, listen to those coops on the radio.

645
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,700
Those people are crazy.

646
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,260
What kind of crazy people believe in flying saucers

647
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,740
or invisible monsters in the clouds

648
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,460
that will do wishes for them if they pray enough?

649
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,400
What kind of an idiot would believe...

650
00:30:59,400 --> 00:30:59,820
What kind of an idiot would believe...

651
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,960
...in sending money to a preacher

652
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,020
and thinking that some magic was going to happen?

653
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,380
What kind of a nut would go into a special building

654
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,420
and wear a special suit and sing many songs

655
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,380
and listen to some crazy preacher?

656
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,400
What kind of a fool would do that?

657
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
That's what we was wondering ourselves.

658
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,420
And so, when Bob came along and sold us his church,

659
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,780
well, we bought it.

660
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,320
Bob sold it.

661
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,720
I smoked it.

662
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,120
That settles it.

663
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,480
You're full, Mom.

664
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,680
So you're Billy the Kid, huh?

665
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,900
That's a God-man-bear witness.

666
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,840
Hubert, how many times have I told you to quit playing gunslinger?

667
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,500
Who's Hubert?

668
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,480
That's Billy the Kid, Ma.

669
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,600
Oh, no.

670
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,300
I'm forgetting the names now.

671
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,020
Click, click, checker, checker.

672
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:53,860
Squick, squick.

673
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,460
Yee-haw!

674
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,880
Where are we, Bob?

675
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,300
The code is broken.

676
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,160
Trouble?

677
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:58,820
Big.

678
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:58,940
Big.

679
00:31:59,060 --> 00:31:59,620
Security.

680
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,000
I have the lid on tight.

681
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,640
Well, take it off for me.

682
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,900
The message is, Mars needs women.

683
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,340
Mars needs?

684
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,540
It's a gag.

685
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,620
It's a prank.

686
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,260
It's a fake.

687
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,980
I don't think so, sir.

688
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:22,140
But let's leave things of this world behind

689
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,700
and walk now down the path of Bob

690
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,660
for this brief minute of slack

691
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,800
from the Church of the Subterranean.

692
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,220
Genius.

693
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:29,240


694
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,800
Bob is coming, friend,

695
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,080
and you can take that literally,

696
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,040
because death for a subgenius hero

697
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,200
is merely a transfer over to the pleasure dimensions.

698
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,220
Now, unfortunately, many of us aren't heroes.

699
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,580
There's no water in hell, friends.

700
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,200
There's fire, and you can't get a drink,

701
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,920
and you can't put out that fire.

702
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,880
And you have many, many lives in hell.

703
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,280
It's reincarnation, just like here on Earth,

704
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,520
because Earth, you know, is just the top floor of hell.

705
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,260
That's right.

706
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,220
You're in hell.

707
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:58,880
Hell, right now.

708
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,020
You are in hell now.

709
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,040
Of course, this is the part of hell

710
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,580
where you don't even know you're in hell,

711
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,920
and when the demons mention it,

712
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,180
you think they're kidding.

713
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,000
Well, you'll find out.

714
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,860
Hell is real,

715
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,200
and there's no water down there, friend.

716
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,140
They don't even have rock and roll in some parts of hell,

717
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,280
and you can never win.

718
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,520
It's like a computer.

719
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,640
By definition, it cannot lose.

720
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,060
You can score real high,

721
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,840
but sooner or later, it's gonna get you,

722
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,200
because they creep up on you,

723
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,980
and that's the way it is here on Earth.

724
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,260
They creep up on you,

725
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,680
and try to get you all mixed up about heaven and hell.

726
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,280
Bob is coming, my friend,

727
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,460
but when he's finished with that,

728
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,620
he's gonna be mad.

729
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,260
Let there be slack.

730
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,980
You know, some people say church is subgenius,

731
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,200
so they get involved in it,

732
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,780
and they say, after about six or seven,

733
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,740
they get real involved.

734
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,540
They jump into the Internet intercourse of the church,

735
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,140
and so forth,

736
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,300
and after about six months,

737
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:52,720
they're going,

738
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,880
God, this is worse than high school.

739
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,860
The popular ones pick on the,

740
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,380
wimps even worse than in real life.

741
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,600
Yes, friend, it is like the high school from hell.

742
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,660

755
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,080
I'm gonna get a lay

756
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,220
And a fire around my neck

757
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,080
Because she ever cares

758
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,040
Oh hell what the heck

759
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,580
I'm packing my duds

760
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,280
High from hell

761
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:56,380
Oh hell what the heck

762
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:00,620
Oh hell what the heck

763
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,000
With a lot of love

764
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,860
We work for one year for you pigs

765
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,980
And you wanna break our walls down

766
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,740
And you wanna destroy it

767
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,880
Well you go to hell

768
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,680
If there's a holocaust or a cataclysm

769
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,700
There's a cataclysm now

770
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,560
Tell me how to make a light bulb

771
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,480
Tell me anything

772
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,720
The sun is supposedly going out of the galaxy

773
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,140
We're all revolving

774
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,740
This system is revolving around the 29th degree of Taurus

775
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,680
And the eye of the bull

776
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,780
And that's why the space brothers are here

777
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,340
To get earth all in line

778
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,760
Are they gonna come and actually tell us or help us

779
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:56,960
Yeah

780
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,900
Then what do you do with the situation

781
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,100
Because of the atomic explosions

782
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,100
We're becoming farther and farther off our axis

783
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,820
Is that a good thing or is that a bad thing

784
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,420
It's a bad thing

785
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,580
We have just discovered

786
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,560
An important note from space

787
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,320
The Martians plan to throw a dance

788
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,800
For all the human race

789
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,620
To protect it

790
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:47,840
That the humanity

791
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,280
With all of their items

792
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,580
Has shown were good

793
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:48,580


794
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,340
As long as no one seasoning

795
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,920
For many months

796
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,180
We headed up a few miles

797
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:52,180


798
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:52,480
In order to consume

799
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:52,480


800
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,440
You have to break this

801
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:55,440


802
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,040
bardzo

803
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,940
Here's a proclaim

804
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:56,940


805
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:56,840
HyOKa

806
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:04,680
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

807
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,420
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

808
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,740
That's what they are now.

809
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,580
Blank, empty space.

810
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:36,080
I know he's sitting in there in the control room now, listening to everything I say, but I really don't care.

811
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,680
We're not going to tell you what to do.

812
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,640
We're not going to. We won't do it.

813
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,340
We will not tell you what to do. That's what the conspiracy does.

814
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,640
You have to decide.

815
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,440
The conspiracy will tell you what to do.

816
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,040
Bob won't tell you. We won't tell you what to do because we only tell you how to think.

817
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,560
And you will pay to know what you really think.

818
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:05,960
You can learn to think for yourself, but only Bob Dobbs can show you how.

819
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:51,320
You can learn to think for yourself, but only Bob Dobbs can show you how.

820
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:22,120
You can learn to think for yourself, but only Bob Dobbs can show you how.

821
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:53,420
You can learn to think for yourself, but only Bob Dobbs can show you how.

822
00:41:53,440 --> 00:42:19,700
You can learn to think for yourself, but only Bob Dobbs can show you how.

823
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:53,420
You can learn to think for yourself, but only Bob Dobbs can show you how.

824
00:42:53,440 --> 00:43:12,020
You can learn to think for yourself, but only Bob Dobbs can show you how.

825
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:29,020
You can learn to think for yourself, but only Bob Dobbs can show you how.

826
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:23,420
You can learn to think for yourself, but only Bob Dobbs can show you how.

827
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,140
Locking up his phone, all the noise

828
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,100
Get your groove on, you're in control

829
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,720
You're getting in touch with the devil

830
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,840
I'm cutting in hard with all your might

831
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,600
Living it up all through the night

832
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,960
Get your groove on

833
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,000
Satan Disco Tech

834
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,740
Get your groove on

835
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,460
Get your groove on

836
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,800
Satan Disco Tech

837
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,200
Get your groove on

838
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,120
Get your groove on

839
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,060
Get your groove on

840
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:47,880
Get your groove on

841
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,740
And the things that you've been through

842
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:54,560
All the dreams will tell you so

843
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,380
The problems that you've been through

844
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,840
All the news of that day

845
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,000
And when you say

846
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,540
It's your day

847
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:10,100
And when you say

848
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,460
And when you say

849
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,060
It's your day

850
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,400
And when you say

851
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,940
And when you say

852
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:20,720
It's your day

853
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:20,720


854
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:24,200
And when you say

855
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,080
It's your day

856
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,400
And when you say

857
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,060
It's your day

858
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,340
And when you say

859
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:30,340


860
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,440
And when you say

861
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:31,880
It's your day

862
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,760
And when you say

863
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:33,900
It's your day

864
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:33,900


865
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:33,900


866
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:33,900


867
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:34,500
It's your day

868
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,200
Satan and Hell in a Handbasket, friends.

869
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,700
Before that, a collage by Pater Nostril.

870
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,000
Number two there was some preaching

871
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,020
from the Austin DeVival.

872
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,260
The cramps doing Aloha from Hell, Rainbow Bridge.

873
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,460
The Martian Hop by The Galaxy.

874
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:53,440
And lots of Mothers of Invention.

875
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,760
Friends, coming up, a collage by The Bishop.

876
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,700
But now, let's listen to Dr. Philodrumon

877
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,140
as he awaits that thing.

878
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,200
The creature will emerge from

879
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,360
the horror

880
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,700
and the suffering

881
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,720
that he experiences

882
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,540
in just the sheer existence

883
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,860
in this horrible world

884
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,660
in which the suffering

885
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:20,820
and the suffering

886
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,320
souls in agony

887
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,960
feed off of the horror

888
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,620
and the pain

889
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,720
of every living creature around them.

890
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,860
It's so bad.

891
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,740
People hate it.

892
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,960
They thought about making a law

893
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,040
against this world

894
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,780
but they didn't know how to get to it.

895
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,640
And now here you are

896
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,240
through the scientific

897
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,080
advancement of negative heart.

898
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,700
You can now see

899
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,320
this hideous creature.

900
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,180
Oh my God, he's coming closer.

901
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:49,800
Oh!

902
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,280
Oh no!

903
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:53,680
Friends, you can escape

904
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,340
this dreadful fate

905
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,460
if you get off

906
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,720
with the Church of the Subgenius

907
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,520
the next day.

908
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,820
Otherwise you'll be stuck here with Dave.

909
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,820
What strange new events

910
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:07,960
will they see?

911
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,180
As usual,

912
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,660
nothing is planned.

913
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,620
Actually, there is a

914
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,500
Subgenius Special Olympics

915
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,240
that should be very special.

916
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:20,540
Special?

917
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,860
Some sort of a superhero's ball

918
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,280
which, you know,

919
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,460
pathetic half-super-villains

920
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,800
would probably be more like it.

921
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,680
And friends,

922
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,700
some permutation of...

923
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,660
What is happening

924
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,440
on Saturday night, Chaz?

925
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,620
People with slippers.

926
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:40,740
Whatever it is, it's going to be ugly!

927
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,160
That's all I can say, man.

928
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,740
Actually, there's not...

929
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,400
There are a bunch of outlaws and I'm the ugliest

930
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,900
son of a bitch of the bunch.

931
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,280
You're going to stare me down?

932
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:51,700
But you aren't oblong

933
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,100
and you don't have flippers

934
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,460
and so you might as well

935
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,320
kiss yourself on the beauty mark

936
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,940
and give yourself a pootie haircut.

937
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,260
When you're with those people, man,

938
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,660
you know you're riding tough.

939
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,180
They can't even fit on them big-ass Harleys.

940
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,160
They have to load them on with a crane.

941
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,480
Man, and when they come into a bar,

942
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,600
everybody runs.

943
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:13,600
Yeah.

944
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,260
And you're having a special Olympics

945
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,400
for them at X-Day?

946
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,980
Where's the thing that's in before it starts?

947
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,140
Well, actually, if you're a fundamentalist subgenius,

948
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,860
you don't believe that anything will happen

949
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,320
after 7 a.m. July 5th

950
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,180
and all our plans for the weekend

951
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,140
are sort of hypocritical

952
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,560
to even make.

953
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,760
But, you know, no matter what,

954
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,880
we're going to be hypocritical

955
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,460
because we're subgeniuses

956
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,520
and we're religious nuts.

957
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:43,480
Those two things just kind of go hand-in-hand,

958
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,000
don't they?

959
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,800
Praise Bob. Hail Connie.

960
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:48,620
Yes, sir.

961
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,420
You can sit around and just...

962
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,580
Live a double standard out there

963
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,800
in subgenius land, X-Day, Brushwood,

964
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:56,920
Sherman, New York,

965
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,200
July 5th, 1998.

966
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,360
That's this year. Did you know that?

967
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,020
That's what you didn't know.

968
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,040
It's less than a month away.

969
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,100
Less than a month away.

970
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,500
You can munch your own friend's leg

971
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,200
in a fantasy about starving

972
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,640
in the high Himalayas.

973
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,760
But you could also just have

974
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,580
your idea of a party,

975
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,120
whatever.

976
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,700
That might be.

977
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,340
And I think you know

978
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,580
what that might be, don't you?

979
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,600
You know.

980
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,140
Provided you know

981
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,020
who you are.

982
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,580
Girls just want to have fun,

983
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,280
don't they?

984
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,540
Some of them just want to have fudge.

985
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,140
That's when it gets really weird.

986
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,380
And there's a hot tub out there,

987
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,420
but let's...

988
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,160
Well, there'll be some manhunters there,

989
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,360
no doubt about it.

990
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:48,740
You think?

991
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,560
Yeah, well, I know, you know,

992
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,580
definitely Evangela's gonna come after Dave.

993
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,660
She's made many pronouncements

994
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,900
about that on this show.

995
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,500
She's coming at you with a lasso, man.

996
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,740
She's gonna rope you down.

997
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,060
Sadie Hawkins Day.

998
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,220
Subgenius Sadie Hawkins, right?

999
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,260
Now, there we go.

1000
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,180
It's a possibility.

1001
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,520
But not a probability, friends.

1002
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,420
The subgeniuses would all

1003
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,940
probably choose Bob.

1004
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,120
Upcoming, a fine piece

1005
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,540
of the bishop.

1006
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:24,920
Uh, fighting terrorism, friends,

1007
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,580
with his question of belief.

1008
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,320
In fact, this mix is so powerful

1009
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,360
that all subgenius families

1010
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,260
should gather around and listen

1011
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,460
with their children

1012
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:36,600
because it's a message

1013
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,640
that the kids need to hear.

1014
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,940
The following program is intended

1015
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,400
for mature audiences.

1016
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:44,720
You need a Holy Ghost enema.

1017
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,600
You need a Holy Ghost enema.

1018
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,620
You need a Holy Ghost enema.

1019
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,300
Write up your...

1020
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:50,860
Where is....

1021
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:51,360
...where is the?

1022
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:51,360


1023
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,700
You need a Holy Ghost enema.

1024
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,600
You need a Holy Ghost enema.

1025
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,260
Write up your...

1026
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:58,520
... encontra?

1027
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,580
Why can't you just accept the facts?

1028
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,340
I screamed at God

1029
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,820
at the top of my lungs

1030
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:05,680
cuz that's how much I believe in him.

1031
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,100
You need a Holy Ghost enema.

1032
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,100
You need a Holy Ghost enema.

1033
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,340
I screamed at God

1034
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,820
at the top of my lungs

1035
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,700
cuz that's how much I believe in him.

1036
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,100
You need a Holy Ghost enema.

1037
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,100
You need a Holy Ghost enema.

1038
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,500
I screamed at God...

1039
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,400
I screamed at God.

1040
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,840
I screamed at God at the top of my lungs.

1041
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:24,600
Believe it.

1042
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,360
I screamed at God.

1043
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,400
I screamed at God.

1044
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,800
I screamed at God at the top of my lungs.

1045
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,480
Believe it or not.

1046
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,100
Praise Bob, friends.

1047
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,660
God's the problem here.

1048
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,680
God's the problem here.

1049
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,720
Believe it or not.

1050
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:46,600
We love the idea of everybody else burning in hell forever.

1051
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,520
God, we're coming for you.

1052
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:52,920
You hear me?

1053
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:53,720
Groovy.

1054
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,020
Get on with it.

1055
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,380
We'll be right back.

1056
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,020
We'll be right back.

1057
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,740
Why can't you just accept the fact?

1058
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:59,700
We love the idea of everybody else burning in hell forever.

1059
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,760
Look out.

1060
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,280
God is right behind you.

1061
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,080
Stop it.

1062
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:06,480
Stop this.

1063
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,600
This video is bizarre.

1064
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,080
Look out.

1065
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,660
God is right behind you.

1066
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,980
Burning in hell forever.

1067
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,040
Don't come here with that posh talk.

1068
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,640
Why can't you just accept the fact?

1069
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,140
What indeed is the point?

1070
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,100
Believe it or not, friends.

1071
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:20,100
You need a holy ghost.

1072
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,560
You need a holy ghost.

1073
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,900
I say we all grand long it.

1074
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,020
You need a holy ghost.

1075
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:24,920
Woo.

1076
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,620
I've done it, brother.

1077
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,020
You need a holy ghost.

1078
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,120
What indeed is the point?

1079
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,020
You need a holy ghost.

1080
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:38,160
If I can't be myself with the father, then I'm going to stop preaching this gospel.

1081
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,240
Oh, don't stop mixing that gospel, Bishop.

1082
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,560
The bishop, friends.

1083
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,840
A question of belief.

1084
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:50,060
And now I want you to lean back.

1085
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,000
Lay down and unbuckle.

1086
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:58,380
I must spread wide for the final ride.

1087
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,460
Because the X's are coming, friends.

1088
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,520
And you are too.

1089
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,100
They didn't take us seriously last time.

1090
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,260
Hell, half of you didn't take us seriously.

1091
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,540
Didn't take Dobbs' prophecy seriously.

1092
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,300
But this time we've learned our lesson.

1093
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:16,960
We can't rely on invisible monsters from outer space.

1094
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:18,960
We can't even rely on Bob.

1095
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:29,220
We have to learn how to escape Earth without being dependent on the conspiracy or any extraterrestrials or salesmen.

1096
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:35,340
Sure, send in your 30 bucks, but build your own ship.

1097
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,700
You may not have to.

1098
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,240
It will just recover your ass.

1099
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,460
Build your own ship.

1100
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:48,420
Even better, go buy hangar 18 or area 51 or Cape Canaveral or studio 54.

1101
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:49,660
And steal.

1102
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,500
Your own ship.

1103
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,720
Ah, yes.

1104
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,460
Extract your own fuel.

1105
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:03,780
And while you're at it, friends, let's swap the deck on the spaceship that we're already stuck together on.

1106
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,840
We're already riding on the spaceship.

1107
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,580
And it's in bad shape.

1108
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,600
And it's high time we cleaned it up.

1109
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,560
Earth, we must get off.

1110
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,960
Whether we leave it or leave it a cinder.

1111
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,800
Whether we blow it off.

1112
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:20,740
We blow it up.

1113
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,360
Just don't blow it.

1114
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:22,800
Friends.

1115
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:24,100
But.

1116
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:24,800


1117
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:29,560
But.

1118
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,060
But.

1119
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:30,680
But.

1120
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,140
Are we going to be on for the rest of the night.

1121
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:39,540
No.

1122
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,180
Going to be on for.

1123
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,820
No, I'm sorry.

1124
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:43,820
Evermore.

1125
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,300
We're not.

1126
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:47,260
There's gonna be a rap home and.

1127
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,000
Well, I'm gonna have to say again.

1128
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:50,080
Her pills for your beating.

1129
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,080
WCSB forever.

1130
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,000
I'm sorry about this, folks.

1131
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:55,520
I'm asleep.

1132
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,060
It's just the way life is sometimes.

1133
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,100
But anyway.

1134
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:00,660
Say goodbye.

1135
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:07,200
What is the, somebody called earlier, what is the new sacred post office box?

1136
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,300
I'm glad you asked that, friends.

1137
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:19,700
The new improved sacred post office box, Church of the Subgenius, is where to write to Bob and get your pre-registrations for X day in.

1138
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,320
That's got that pencil ready.

1139
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:31,760
Post office box 204-206 Austin, Texas.

1140
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:38,640
And that zip code is 78720.

1141
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:47,480
Once again, that's P.O. Box 204-206 Austin, Texas.

1142
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,680
Post office box 78720.

1143
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,600
Post office box 78720.

1144
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:52,440
Praise Bob.

1145
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,500
Till next week.

1146
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:54,420
Help me, somebody.

1147
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,780
Keep your head on tight.

1148
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,560
You're back to the wind and you're sacking the saddle.

1149
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,600
We'll see y'all.

1150
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:04,440
We'll see y'all.

1151
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:04,980
We'll see y'all.

1152
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:13,860
Yes, dear friends.

1153
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:18,540
This is your host and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stank.

1154
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,680
And it's X day.

1155
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,240
X day coming up.

1156
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:27,700
But we've had a screw up on our catalog, our online catalog that I need to tell you about.

1157
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:37,120
Because, in fact, if you ordered anything between May 20th and May 30th, you still have your money.

1158
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:44,380
And I didn't get your order for Knife and Ivans, this section of the Subgenius website.

1159
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:49,240
If you ordered membership or books or ministership or t-shirts,

1160
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,280
you're cool.

1161
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,540
That's no problem.

1162
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,340
But if you ordered the CDs or the videos, those go to me.

1163
00:57:55,580 --> 00:58:01,660
And if you sent me a letter begging me to give you reasons to not kill yourself,

1164
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,200
man, I'm sorry.

1165
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,360
You're going to have to send it again if it's not too late.

1166
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:14,400
But you'd be a dumbass to be a subgenius and kill yourself before X day, though, my friends.

1167
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,220
You'd be a dumbass not to if you're a human.

1168
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,460
Because X day.

1169
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:19,480
We have to fight now, sir.

1170
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:20,420
Annihilate.

1171
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:20,980
Hell.

1172
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:21,740
Hell.

1173
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:22,340
Hell.

1174
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,480
All right.

1175
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,700
It's X day, friends.

1176
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:25,880
X day is coming quick.

1177
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:30,940
You'd better get that information from the Church of the Subgenius if you want to survive

1178
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,580
X day.

1179
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,660
Or if you just want to go to the big party in Freshwood, New York.

1180
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,620
Or hell, have your own party, friends.

1181
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,180
We don't care.

1182
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,260
The X's are going to pick you up no matter where you are.

1183
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,360
If you're a news band subgenius member.

1184
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,660
So, friends, check that catalog.

1185
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,320
The Subgenius website.

1186
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,280
www.subgenius.com.

1187
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:49,680
Or, if you're a subgenius member, check that catalog.

1188
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,240
Or write to the sacred P.O.

1189
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:52,980
Box number at the end of this broadcast.

1190
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:59,300
And, friends, now we're going to go back into the X day's past, which then tell us about

1191
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:00,940
X day's future.

1192
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,560
Because the previous X days, I guess, were all X day drills.

1193
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:11,740
What we will experience from now on had better be the real thing, friends.

1194
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,120
Or else, well, I guess Bob just slacked off.

1195
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:19,140
And maybe that's what happened to K'nivin Ivan's.

1196
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:19,660
I don't know.

1197
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:19,660


1198
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:19,660


1199
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:25,120
But, friends, if you ordered a membership, a book, or a T-shirt, or a Bob Mug, everything

1200
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:25,660
is cool.

1201
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:27,320
Those go through Cafe Press.

1202
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,140
But I stank.

1203
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,300
Sell the video and audios.

1204
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,960
Because I'll be damned, friends.

1205
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:39,320
I'll be damned if a pink in a suit gets one dime for subgenius talent and work.

1206
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:43,240
Even if my bank account suffers, too.

1207
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,580
And is damned.

1208
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,840
Because, my friend, I am that ornery.

1209
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:48,800
I'm that ornery.

1210
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:49,640
Because I'm K'nivin.

1211
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:49,640


1212
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,320
But motherfuckers keepin' up the F-I-B.

1213
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,440
The faith in Bob.

1214
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:54,080
Praise Bob.

1215
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:54,780
Help me, somebody.

1216
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,800
This background music is by Lamprey Systems.

1217
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:25,540
So, fuck out.

1218
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:29,000
Because he knows it's all worthwhile, he told me.

1219
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,200
That the children use it.

1220
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:33,520
That the children use it.

1221
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,460
But all the children do.

1222
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:47,380
And I say, as long as you're alive,

1223
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,840
shout, make noise, or whatever.

1224
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,540
Raise bombs.

1225
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,720
You shut up like hell!

1226
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,080
You have your answer.

1227
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:04,800
Now go.
