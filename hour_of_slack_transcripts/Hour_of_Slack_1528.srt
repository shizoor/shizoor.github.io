1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,060
You may think your husband has never killed a man, but you're wrong.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,360
And before I take him in to face the charges, he'll try to kill me.

3
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,700
Our lives last.

4
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:53,080
No one can Smart!

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,780
That's your answer there, okay?

6
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,400
There's three stooges singing a bunch of nonsense songs.

7
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,420
It's as good as anything.

8
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,540
Can I give you one more morsel of food for thought?

9
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,860
Yes, let's have a delicious dripping morsel.

10
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,860
One more.

11
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,340
Is it possible that Bob is some sort of gigantic super being

12
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,840
and we are just a mold of dust on his necktie?

13
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,800
And we are no more than a crumb in his beard,

14
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,700
which he yet has neglected to swallow.

15
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,700
When he finds it to flick down his wide-open gorge,

16
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,760
then the rest of his feast we will follow.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,700
Wait, Bob, you're blowing my mind, man.

18
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,740
We are but Dottel from his pie.

19
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,440
Did you see that movie, Guardians of the Galaxy?

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,800
I have seen parts of it.

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,100
Well, at one point they go to a place

22
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,640
which is inside the giant star-spanning head

23
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,720
of an extinct alien superorganism.

24
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,860
Well, that could be like Bob's head right there.

25
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,560
That could be.

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,200
It's just an old one that's all used up.

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,360
But the one that we have now,

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:58,680
that's just an old one.

29
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,320
That's a fine one that's still in good order.

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,980
Yeah, for all we know,

31
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,880
maybe Bob is a raccoon who carries a machine gun

32
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,360
or an alien tree.

33
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,520
Well, that's possible, but a remote possibility.

34
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,780
It's highly likely.

35
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,060
In the course of convulsive things,

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,260
who could think of anything more spasmatic?

37
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,940
Because we don't represent Bob as a rackety-coon child

38
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,520
in this here universe.

39
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,480
It's like a bad signal.

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,340
No, no.

41
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,320
Bob might be a rackety-coon to somewhere else

42
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,240
in some other universe, but not here.

43
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,600
No, Bob is a regular-looking guy,

44
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,380
regular clothes, regular features.

45
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,380
He's a salesman.

46
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,220
He can sell you things

47
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,260
more than any spavined, stuttering raccoon ever could.

48
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,420
I am Groot.

49
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,400
Well, that's what I call my...

50
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,900
We have one more caller here on the air.

51
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,440
All right, here comes...

52
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,620
Don't turn that caller to the cold and damp.

53
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,320
Let's see what he's got to say.

54
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,720
What do you know about Lab 9,

55
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,200
which was an organization...

56
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,820
set up in the early 1970s

57
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,320
around the concept of the ancient Egyptian gods,

58
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,840
the ancient Egyptian nine creator gods

59
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,780
called the Aeneid?

60
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,080
Called the what?

61
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,140
The Aeneid.

62
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,540
Huh?

63
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,600
That's not right.

64
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,220
There's nine ancient Egyptian creator gods

65
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,160
That's actually a Greek word.

66
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,260
The Aeneid is a poem by Virgil.

67
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,100
Publius Virgilius Melo.

68
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,980
He's talking about...

69
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
You ever heard the term Enneagram?

70
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,660
Oh, Eneid.

71
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,300
E-N-E-I-D.

72
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,760
E-N-E-A-D.

73
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,220
What?

74
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,700
What's that mean?

75
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,440
That's the Greek name for it.

76
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,700
I thought you meant the Aeneid.

77
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,780
Or Aeneid.

78
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,780
I know Enneagram.

79
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,260
Not Virgil Gompers who lives down my street,

80
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,560
but just the guy Virgil.

81
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,520
No, Publius Virgilius Melo.

82
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,880
By the way, how is Mrs. Gompers, Dave?

83
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,060
What about Samuel L.?

84
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,400
Let's bother after all the recent operations

85
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,460
on the top of my head.

86
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,840
Timio Bricos et Dona Ferentem.

87
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,860
Which you claim to have won.

88
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,180
He is her suffering.

89
00:03:59,340 --> 00:03:59,660
Yeah.

90
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,940
And he's instead caused her

91
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,720
unbeknown troubles daily

92
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,980
on a regular basis.

93
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,000
He's so good to me.

94
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,680
Arm of Arunque Cano, everybody.

95
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,100
Read your Aeneid.

96
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,480
I just read Dryden's translation

97
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,500
for the first time.

98
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,320
It's pretty good.

99
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,740
If you like those rhyming

100
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,160
17th century couplets.

101
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,100
And I just love them.

102
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,680
So...

103
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,800
So why don't you just drop

104
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,600
them panties, boy?

105
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,640
Well, I...

106
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,140
You see there's this belt here.

107
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,220
It's hard to get loose.

108
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,460
And I've got these suspenders also.

109
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,340
You better pray good.

110
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,320
You're not publicly undressing

111
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,300
in front of an invisible radio.

112
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,920
On a costume,

113
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,140
if I am,

114
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,240
to public bathing.

115
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,520
Let me get these things off here.

116
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,420
But wait a minute.

117
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,920
This is not yet X-Day.

118
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,520
I must restrain myself

119
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,160
in variants.

120
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,380
Well...

121
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,120
Yes, please restrain yourself.

122
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,220
Yeah, you will be baptized

123
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,520
in nymphs,

124
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,580
nerds,

125
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,220
and noids.

126
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,180
And the ones that get

127
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,360
away will be gulped

128
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,220
down old

129
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,480
sequoias' beaks.

130
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,280
So all will be

131
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,900
accounted for.

132
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,220
Old sequoias' gullet.

133
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,660
All will be revealed.

134
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,420
All the answers.

135
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,760
All the questions

136
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,240
will be answered.

137
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,660
But of course,

138
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,560
what if there's a

139
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,500
howling hurricane?

140
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,780
Then what are we going to do

141
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,440
with the bobs?

142
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,240
If the rain is

143
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,900
pelting down,

144
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,760
we're going to have to

145
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,720
bob everybody with

146
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,880
a teaspoon of water

147
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,420
in the slack shack.

148
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,000
You're scuffling around

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,800
in the rain.

150
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,820
Like a pagan ghost.

151
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,360
Baptism by hurricane

152
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,840
is much more authentic

153
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,460
than baptism

154
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,400
in some little pond.

155
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,680
Someone left a cake

156
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,420
out in the rain.

157
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,480
Branded.

158
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,440
Marked with a coward shame.

159
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
You guys did a whole

160
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,840
routine about branded

161
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,780
not long ago.

162
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,620
I listened to that

163
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,540
and I'm so glad

164
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,320
to call in and go

165
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,100
tell you my version of it

166
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,240
as when I was growing up

167
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,900
when we were kids.

168
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,720
Yeah, let's hear it.

169
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:53,820
Stranded.

170
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,460
Trapped in a toilet bowl.

171
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,540
Dun, dun, dun.

172
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,600
What do you do

173
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,300
when you're stranded

174
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,760
and you can't reach the roll?

175
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,400
Wherever you go

176
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,240
for the rest of the day

177
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,100
you will know

178
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,060
you're unclean.

179
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,440
Dun, dun, dun.

180
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:08,580
Dun, dun, dun.

181
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,680
Yeah.

182
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,680
He was innocent.

183
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,360
Not a charge was true.

184
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,940
But the world

185
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,080
will never know.

186
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:17,960
Dun, dun, dun.

187
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:19,840
Branded.

188
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,100
Marked as the one

189
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,600
who ran.

190
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,740
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

191
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,360
Marked as the one

192
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,780
who ran.

193
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,120
What can you do

194
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,900
when you're branded

195
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,220
and you know you're a man?

196
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,640
I'm personally

197
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,480
evidence that he had

198
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,620
the branded guy

199
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,380
had to go and fight

200
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,220
the rifle.

201
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,160
Wherever you go

202
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,620
for the rest of your life

203
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,660
you must prove

204
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,780
you're a man.

205
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,800
Boom.

206
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,960
Dun, dun, dun.

207
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:41,800
These are petty

208
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,980
operational devices

209
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,820
that you guys

210
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,760
are using right now.

211
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,320
That was actually

212
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,300
sampled in a...

213
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:46,920
Just plug in

214
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,640
the one little thing

215
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,520
and there's all these

216
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,040
scenes start coming out.

217
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,820
All right.

218
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,280
And I didn't know

219
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,860
what you're talking

220
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,460
about anymore.

221
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,920
Well, this is one

222
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,480
of those shows

223
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,240
for only people

224
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,340
over 50.

225
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,380
Get the jokes.

226
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,900
Someone sampled

227
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,780
the branded...

228
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,540
Yes, somebody

229
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,380
actually sampled that

230
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,060
and made it into

231
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,660
like a hip-hop tune.

232
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,360
I used to hear this

233
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,140
on WCSB

234
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,940
like 10 years ago.

235
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,180
I think it might have

236
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,100
been on Urban Lullabies.

237
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:10,960
I've been

238
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,940
and ranted

239
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,280
and nearly branded

240
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,080
a communist

241
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,140
because I'm

242
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,040
a left-handed.

243
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,360
Well,

244
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,720
those were

245
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,500
the days.

246
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,880
Those were the days

247
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,400
weren't they,

248
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,220
oh, best beloved.

249
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,420
But now they're all gone.

250
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,220
No one remembers

251
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,180
those wonderful shows.

252
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,660
That used to keep us

253
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,660
bright-eyed

254
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,720
and bushy-tailed

255
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,540
in front of the TV.

256
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:30,880
You remember

257
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,140
the one about the parrot

258
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,760
with one single good eye

259
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,560
right in the middle

260
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,320
of his forehead

261
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,040
who used to sing

262
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,500
songs about

263
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,260
Dobbs and Bob

264
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,780
all the time,

265
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,360
I think.

266
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,300
That was the

267
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,260
cyclo-parrot?

268
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,820
Do you remember

269
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,620
the parrot guy?

270
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,580
What was his name?

271
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,320
The parrot.

272
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,560
That was a parody,

273
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,840
not the real thing.

274
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,920
Back in them days

275
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,660
you only had

276
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,420
three shows

277
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,560
to choose from.

278
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:53,860
This is pining

279
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,060
the news, right?

280
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,160
On one channel

281
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,300
they'd have the Munsters,

282
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:57,940
on the other

283
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,120
they'd have the Adams family.

284
00:07:59,220 --> 00:07:59,880
What are you going to do?

285
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:00,920
Yeah, I mean,

286
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,660
and they're on

287
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,680
at the same time.

288
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,780
You know,

289
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,620
on one channel

290
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,000
there's Mr. Terrific

291
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,280
and the other channel

292
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,340
there's Captain Nice

293
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,640
and, you know,

294
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,900
you can't watch them both.

295
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,720
You have to choose.

296
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,300
I spy

297
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,360
Mission Impossible

298
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:13,900
at the same time.

299
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,920
Yeah, what are you

300
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,480
going to do?

301
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,880
How do you know

302
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,480
you're a man?

303
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,580
Wherever you go

304
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,240
Back in the day

305
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,100
one of our famous

306
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,360
children shows

307
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,280
how he decides

308
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,940
to jump on

309
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,540
The Rifleman

310
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,960
against Branded?

311
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,080
And wanted

312
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,940
dead or alive?

313
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,200
In a fight

314
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,800
to the death.

315
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,740
Journey to the

316
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,340
center of the earth

317
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,140
at the same time

318
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,980
as Halloween?

319
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,000
Now you're

320
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,660
really hurting.

321
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,980
You know,

322
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,680
what was

323
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,020
a really ridiculous

324
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,840
example of this

325
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,320
from the

326
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,160
1966 fall schedule?

327
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,860
The Man From Uncle,

328
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,160
The Wild Wild West,

329
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,300
The Time Tunnel,

330
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,980
all on at the same time.

331
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,580
What are you

332
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,260
going to watch?

333
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,640
You have to flip

334
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,500
between channels

335
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,140
whenever there's

336
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,420
a commercial.

337
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,060
Now they're

338
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,840
on The Man From Uncle.

339
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,140
Now they're

340
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,960
in The Time Tunnel.

341
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,200
That's how

342
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,260
Fireside Theater

343
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,880
got started.

344
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,480
Switching between

345
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,040
channels.

346
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,160
The Time Tunnel.

347
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,680
Yeah.

348
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,200
Well, it seemed

349
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,340
so much classier

350
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:12,700
than it was

351
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,260
because they had

352
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,060
little snippets

353
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,020
of Bernard Herrmann

354
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,760
music to play

355
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,460
from the CBS

356
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,720
film library.

357
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,960
Is that what it was?

358
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,120
Covering up the fact

359
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,620
that there was

360
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,120
nothing going on

361
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,400
that these protagonists

362
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,300
were stupider

363
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,760
than a bag of hammers.

364
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,800
They would always

365
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,060
end up on the Titanic

366
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,320
on one episode.

367
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,080
We're supposed to kill Hitler.

368
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,060
Which one's Hitler?

369
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,580
Yeah.

370
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,980
You know,

371
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,860
did you ever watch

372
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,800
an old 1940s movie

373
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,600
called Hitler,

374
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,760
Dead or Alive?

375
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,240
It's kind of grade B,

376
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,580
but these gangsters

377
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,620
get together and say,

378
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,780
I'm tired about this

379
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,420
mug Hitler.

380
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,200
Yeah, me too.

381
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,040
And they go over

382
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,000
and they beat up Hitler

383
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,840
and they shave off

384
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,400
his mustache

385
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,860
and then the Nazis

386
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,900
won't believe he's Hitler

387
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,820
and they beat him up.

388
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,300
No, it's really me.

389
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,720
They cut off my mustache.

390
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,960
I want to see that one.

391
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,620
It's called

392
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,200
Hitler, Dead or Alive.

393
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Not to be confused

394
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,740
with They Saved Hitler's Brain.

395
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,900
No, that's quite different.

396
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,800
Also known as

397
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,480
Mad Man of Matara.

398
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,880
You see,

399
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,700
the whole reason

400
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,940
that Hitler lost the war

401
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,560
is because Stalin

402
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,420
had a bigger mustache.

403
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,720
Then there was also

404
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,260
the thing that wouldn't die,

405
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:12,900
but no,

406
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,480
that was like

407
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,380
an old bearded head

408
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:14,980
in a bottle,

409
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,280
but for Hitler's,

410
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,660
they saved Hitler's brain,

411
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,420
they have the whole

412
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,640
Hitler head in a bottle

413
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,280
and he's mounted

414
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,000
on the dashboard

415
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,840
and he's screaming,

416
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
turn right!

417
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,100
And so they turn left.

418
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,520
He's going,

419
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,260
mach schnell!

420
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,840
Mach schnell!

421
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,620
All the time.

422
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,780
He's hurrying him along.

423
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,000
Joe Riley,

424
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,680
for a horror host show,

425
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,440
made a

426
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,200
They Saved Hitler's Brain

427
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,940
Hitler head

428
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,860
inside a box

429
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,420
for this little

430
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,040
local Dallas TV show.

431
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,600
And there was a guy

432
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:40,980
underneath

433
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,140
working the mouth

434
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,860
so it would say

435
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,400
mach schnell

436
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,460
every now and then.

437
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,920
Which I think

438
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,680
would go faster.

439
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,380
Where's all the

440
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,420
subgenius artificers

441
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,660
who do things like that

442
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,060
for us?

443
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,020
Nobody's made us

444
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,640
a Hitler head.

445
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,260
Get to work, fans.

446
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,360
Gentlemen,

447
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:55,940
I have a question.

448
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,760
A question for the ages

449
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,300
for you.

450
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:57,660
Yes?

451
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,920
Who would win

452
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,820
in a cosmic battle

453
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,800
between the thing

454
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,560
that couldn't die

455
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,500
and the brain

456
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,860
that wouldn't die?

457
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,840
Oh, Stan explained

458
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,940
this just a little bit

459
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,180
to me a little while ago.

460
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:08,680
I don't know.

461
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,580
It was Robocop

462
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,420
versus Chappie.

463
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,220
I'm going to come out

464
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,320
on the side of

465
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,100
the thing that wouldn't die

466
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,040
because the brain

467
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,860
that wouldn't die,

468
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,880
also known as

469
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,920
the head that wouldn't die,

470
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,620
required a complicated

471
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,900
support structure

472
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,020
of blood

473
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,780
and fluids

474
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,600
and things being

475
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,380
pumped through it

476
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,580
by laboratory devices.

477
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,800
But the head

478
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,900
that wouldn't die

479
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,980
was alive

480
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,080
on its own.

481
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,380
A horrible,

482
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,240
bearded,

483
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,300
supernaturally

484
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:33,700
activated,

485
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,880
severed head

486
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,320
howling and gibbering

487
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,400
and that one's

488
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,860
scarier

489
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,540
because the other one

490
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,420
The brain that wouldn't die

491
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,460
was a woman

492
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,780
also known as

493
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,660
Jan and the Pan.

494
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,140
She was a woman,

495
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:44,640
yes,

496
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,800
or had been a woman

497
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,000
and she wanted

498
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,180
nothing but revenge

499
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,780
on her former husband

500
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,740
who had saved

501
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,400
her head

502
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,380
while he went out

503
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,220
to interview

504
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,760
many cheap strippers.

505
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,900
for a replacement body.

506
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,220
Somehow he never

507
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,500
managed to get that body.

508
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,200
I'm sorry.

509
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,640
You saw the movie, right?

510
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,680
Yeah.

511
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,420
Yeah, he's out,

512
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,140
he visits one stripper

513
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,840
after another

514
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,880
sizing up their bodies

515
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,460
and they think

516
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,500
he wants to get together

517
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,040
for some,

518
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,320
well,

519
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,980
some hanky-panky

520
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,260
but no,

521
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,120
he's measuring

522
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,540
the difference

523
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,300
between their

524
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,600
cervical vertebra

525
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:17,940
and,

526
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,260
well, anyway,

527
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,000
they think he's

528
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,020
a real pervert

529
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,580
but he drags

530
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,200
one of them back

531
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,880
but by then

532
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,700
all hell

533
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,500
is broken loose.

534
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,460
The unspeakable monster

535
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,480
in the next room

536
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,420
has broken out

537
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,440
and is in cahoots

538
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,680
with the severed head

539
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,420
on the table.

540
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,300
How?

541
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,420
Only some

542
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,300
Hollywood hack

543
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,160
script writer

544
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,840
could tell you.

545
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,860
Okay, now,

546
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,940
what would be

547
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,440
the severed head

548
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,180
versus a

549
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,220
frankenhooker

550
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,060
who would win?

551
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,280
Oh, frankenhooker,

552
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,040
well, that's a different

553
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,260
movie.

554
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,860
Because that was

555
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,440
a situation

556
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:50,960
where a guy

557
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,420
would go out

558
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:51,800
and collect

559
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,440
body parts

560
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,200
of hookers

561
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,840
to rebuild

562
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,000
his bride

563
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,720
who he had

564
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,400
actually killed

565
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,180
with an automatic

566
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,780
mower.

567
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,620
It was his mistake.

568
00:12:59,680 --> 00:12:59,700
It was a one season

569
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,640
sitcom, too,

570
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,300
that didn't last

571
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,120
and get past

572
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,620
the first production

573
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,120
stages.

574
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,300
Well, frankenhooker

575
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,040
will one day

576
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,440
be a family-style

577
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:08,920
sitcom

578
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,580
but right now

579
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,360
we're talking

580
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,600
future talk.

581
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,240
By the way,

582
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,860
could the brain

583
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,400
that comes down

584
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,280
take on the brain

585
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,140
from planet Eros?

586
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,900
The brain

587
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,980
from planet Eros?

588
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,840
Well, in addition to...

589
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:21,920
That was like

590
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,760
a disembodied

591
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,100
intelligence,

592
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,100
wasn't it?

593
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,720
And that was

594
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,600
a bad brain

595
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,180
there was also

596
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,960
a good brain,

597
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,600
Luce,

598
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,400
who had the job

599
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,600
of rounding up

600
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,040
the brain

601
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,160
from planet Eros.

602
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,540
The bad brain

603
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,360
invented the term

604
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:34,780
mosh.

605
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,600
I had no idea.

606
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,020
Yes.

607
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:38,800
How about the brain

608
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,120
from planet Lesbos?

609
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,860
That was the

610
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,620
Russ Meyer...

611
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,520
At Dobstown.

612
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:43,880
Yeah.

613
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,840
Brain from planet

614
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:46,880
Lesbos

615
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,760
at Dobstown.

616
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,460
Someone else

617
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,400
has taken the bait

618
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:49,540
here.

619
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,000
The number is

620
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,980
216-687-3515.

621
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,840
Here's a new caller.

622
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
You're on the air.

623
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,820
Yes, I was wondering

624
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,220
if you,

625
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,080
perchance,

626
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,440
discussed

627
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,680
the tale

628
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,100
of the inebriated

629
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,040
trouser mouse.

630
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,400
Branded.

631
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,940
Marked as the one

632
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,520
who ran.

633
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,680
Inebriated trouser mouse.

634
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,820
Well, that was

635
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,780
a deadly,

636
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,860
deadly situation.

637
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,080
Ha ha, Pluto.

638
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:17,820
Ha ha.

639
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,440
The inebriated

640
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,640
trouser mouse.

641
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,860
I think they were

642
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,220
subject to a lot of

643
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,220


644
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,920
Could you be a little

645
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,960
more specific?

646
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,440
There are so many

647
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,400
of these characters

648
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,900
running around that,

649
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,720
well, we have to be sure.

650
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,480
Yeah, and they're like

651
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,840
on little tracks.

652
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,580
They keep going on

653
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,180
forever and ever.

654
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,760
They keep running

655
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,200
and running

656
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,560
and running

657
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,100
and going nowhere.

658
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,500
Exactly.

659
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,440
They keep chasing

660
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,220
It's nervous energy.

661
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,240
They're just running

662
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,480
to have something to do.

663
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,560
Like all the pinks

664
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,320
who are realizing

665
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:46,960
too late

666
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,700
that the apocalypse

667
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,540
is upon them.

668
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,420
Running in a treadmill.

669
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,500
I'd like to refer you

670
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,540
to this PowerPoint below.

671
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,100
You know, it's

672
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,340
perpetual running

673
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:57,960
in a cage.

674
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,500
We told as many people

675
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,440
as possible,

676
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,300
but on the other hand,

677
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,300
we knew that

678
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,380
not everybody would

679
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,680
take the advice

680
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,540
because there really

681
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,120
isn't room,

682
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,600
you see.

683
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,980
Only 144,000

684
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,600
will be saved.

685
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,180
Yeah, and then

686
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:12,940
everybody else,

687
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,180
well, many are called,

688
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,320
but few were chosen.

689
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,620
Quite a few of them

690
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,680
are not psychotic,

691
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,860
contrary to public

692
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,340
The spawning grounds,

693
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,260
the macro-crowded seas.

694
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,840
Many of them are

695
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,940
Many feel the call,

696
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,780
but few have

697
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,620
correct change

698
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,720
for the pay toilets.

699
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,580
Yes, and they aren't

700
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,460
going to get it

701
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,440
from standing around

702
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,520
and looking wistful

703
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,860
and doe-eyed

704
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,040
at the successful

705
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,020
subgeniuses

706
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,040
In my father's house,

707
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,240
there are many pay toilets.

708
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,080
You heard it right.

709
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,000
It's not just correct change,

710
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,520
you have to have

711
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,580
those special coins.

712
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,860
An anarcho-vegetario

713
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:46,820
conspiracy.

714
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,660
I've had it

715
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,580
with these vegetarians.

716
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,700
They're killing the planet

717
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,020
with their selfishness.

718
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,540
And they don't

719
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,320
understand that

720
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,920
agriculture itself

721
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,800
is the biggest menace

722
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,200
to the future of humanity.

723
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,840
And their insistence

724
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,740
on a monoculture.

725
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,020
who, this is an actual

726
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,700
true story

727
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,880
of a rock and roll star

728
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,280
of the 60s

729
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,420
who I did an interview

730
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,300
with one time

731
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,620
and who seriously

732
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,960
claimed and believed

733
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,520
and perhaps

734
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,180
howl knows

735
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,160
who I'm talking about.

736
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,020
Question mark.

737
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,000
Anyway,

738
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,960
question mark,

739
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,360
question mark.

740
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,380
Does that mean

741
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,060
an actual...

742
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,420
But anyway,

743
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,180
he believes that

744
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,520
the world is

745
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,320
going bad.

746
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,800
Oops, I'm sorry,

747
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,660
we're out of time.

748
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:28,920
Because

749
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:30,860
wildebeests

750
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,200
in South Africa

751
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,800
have flatulence

752
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,540
from wildebeests.

753
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,720
Frappington wildebeests.

754
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,740
Frank Zappa,

755
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,200
yeah, I know

756
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,000
who you're talking about.

757
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,320
Zappa was crazy.

758
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,220
He really,

759
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,980
he really honestly

760
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,780
thought that the

761
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,900
farting of wildebeests

762
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,360
in Africa

763
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,260
was going to cause

764
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,980
the end of the world

765
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,020
and that's why

766
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,820
he produced those

767
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,920
last several albums

768
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,000
and then killed himself.

769
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,500
And he was in

770
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,700
contact with aliens.

771
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,420
He was in contact

772
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:53,760
with the continent

773
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,640
and that's where

774
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,920
a lot of the noodling

775
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,040
came from.

776
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,080
He had colon cancer,

777
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:57,460
didn't he?

778
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,020
His flatulence

779
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,880
actually killed him.

780
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,440
It was an explosive

781
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:02,980
problem.

782
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,560
He could have gone

783
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,220
to the doctor

784
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,020
and gotten it fixed.

785
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,520
I thought he was

786
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,240
still rocking on.

787
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,100
But he didn't believe

788
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,760
in things like that.

789
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,600
No, he's long gone, Dave.

790
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,300
Long gone.

791
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,360
Now we can all

792
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,780
end the world

793
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,700
because all these

794
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,640
characters are gone.

795
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,520
Now Phil Austin

796
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
is no longer

797
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,320
with us.

798
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,320
They simply

799
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,620
pre-deceased us.

800
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,440
They went before.

801
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,040
What would it take

802
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,860
to bring the

803
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,840
Fireside Theater

804
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,700
back together?

805
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,060
Two more bullets!

806
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,280
Oh, for God's sake.

807
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,680
I'm not cleaning that up.

808
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm not cleaning that up

809
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,260
either.

810
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,020
That's disgusting.

811
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,600
Somebody get a mop.

812
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,960
Too soon.

813
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,440
an actual hollow jig

814
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,220
of the all four members?

815
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,040
You're looking at it

816
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,140
in an unnecessarily

817
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,880
pessimistic way.

818
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,700
Actually, we have

819
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,300
many new members

820
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,220
and they're all

821
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,980
horrible boors

822
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,760
on the internet

823
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,240
and they're all

824
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:01,880
going to be there

825
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,660
at X Day

826
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,280
this time.

827
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,600
Speaking of horrible

828
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,000
boors,

829
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,760
portions of the

830
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,380
following broadcast

831
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,160
will be objectionable

832
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,560
to some members

833
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:10,960
of the audience.

834
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,940
Therefore, WCSB

835
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,560
advises listener

836
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:12,880
discretion.

837
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,840
Views and opinions

838
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,500
expressed on this

839
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,160
program are not

840
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,880
necessarily those

841
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,840
of WCSB or

842
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,380
Cleveland State

843
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:17,640
University.

844
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,680
This could perhaps

845
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,760
be the very last

846
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,260
edition of

847
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:20,980
Synesthesia ever

848
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,200
because the saucers

849
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,620
are coming.

850
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,220
The world ends

851
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:24,940
tomorrow and you

852
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:25,480
may die.

853
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,920
Unfortunately,

854
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,820
these are like

855
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,840
saucers of milk

856
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,680
that the dish-eyed

857
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,520
children are bringing

858
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,200
to us from the

859
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,980
land of poodles.

860
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,640
Man, it's the

861
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,860
flying cups we have

862
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,520
to worry about.

863
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,040
Well, you know,

864
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,740
actually, the saucers

865
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,620
themselves come from

866
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,480
the same china set

867
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,560
as Bertrand Russell's

868
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:39,920
teapot.

869
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:40,780
Right.

870
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,360
Exactly.

871
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,200
That's the point

872
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,280
you're trying to make.

873
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,080
You might even see

874
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,020
a dragon in the

875
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,320
bathtub bathing up

876
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,920
or a flying saucer

877
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,600
that is looking

878
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,480
for its cup.

879
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,080
Dare I take

880
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,860
this other call here?

881
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,540
Yeah, you better.

882
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,720
Hello, you're on the air.

883
00:18:59,180 --> 00:18:59,840
Well, are the

884
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,600
flying saucers

885
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,200
really the origin

886
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,600
of them,

887
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,000
the Nazi regime

888
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,920
who created these

889
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,840
at the end of the war?

890
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,560
The flugelsaurier?

891
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,660
Some saucers.

892
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,540
I thought it was

893
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,440
the Soviets,

894
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,340
but those are

895
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:11,880
the ones that

896
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,020
go to the center

897
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,800
of the earth.

898
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,700
Yes, we've all

899
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,160
been over that,

900
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,440
hashed it over.

901
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,640
Sarah Palin lives

902
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,400
there right now.

903
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,540
Yes, that's right.

904
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,500
And the saucers

905
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,060
originally sighted

906
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,600
in the famous

907
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,880
saucer sighting

908
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,540
when he saw them,

909
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,200
sir,

910
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,160
the sighting

911
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,780
was not of saucers,

912
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,260
but of things

913
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,780
moving like saucers

914
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,980
that were skimmed

915
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,560
across the estuary,

916
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,360
like Hylas and Hercules

917
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,440
throwing discs.

918
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,400
Pilots,

919
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,120
all these stories

920
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,060
are completely made up.

921
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:52,560
They were just

922
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:52,940
broken the sound,

923
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,120
but they were

924
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,940
just being saucy.

925
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,440
In fact,

926
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,280
the saucers,

927
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,940
so-called,

928
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,320
that Kenneth Arnold saw,

929
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,080
were more like

930
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,760
boomerangs in shape.

931
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,680
More like today's

932
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,620
stealth aircraft,

933
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
but they moved

934
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,880
in a manner...

935
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,600
How does anybody know

936
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,280
what a stealth aircraft

937
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,980
looks like?

938
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,780
You can't see it.

939
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,440
It's stealthy.

940
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:12,540
Yeah.

941
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,760
Well, it's a kind of

942
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,820
a V shape,

943
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,700
sort of a wedge shape.

944
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,440
Or so they would

945
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:16,980
have us believe.

946
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,000
Oh, you can tell a wedge

947
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,560
when you see a wedge,

948
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,140
can't you?

949
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,100
Tell a wedge.

950
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,780
I have...

951
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,500
I have actually

952
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,460
a controlling stake

953
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,320
in several wedge

954
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,580
manufacturing enterprises.

955
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,180
Worldwide wedges.

956
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,320
Full disclosure.

957
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,240
There's a big

958
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,200
government contract

959
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,000
going for you

960
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,760
come to here

961
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,160
just to be a silly man

962
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,040
on the radio

963
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,500
for fun things to do.

964
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
You don't need

965
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,700
a stipend

966
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,940
from WCSB.

967
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,660
Well,

968
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,580
I don't even get

969
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,480
a stipend for this.

970
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,280
Stipend?

971
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,240
What stipend?

972
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,640
He was an important

973
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,760
paleontologist,

974
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,760
Dr. Silliman.

975
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,080
Are you all members

976
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,020
of the Illuminati?

977
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,280
Ha, ha, ha.

978
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,080
We could tell you,

979
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,960
but then we'd have to...

980
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,680
I'm a member

981
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,840
of the Latitude Society.

982
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,280
I think the...

983
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,680
I'm a member

984
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,180
of the United

985
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,940
Workers of America,

986
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,840
ESWA.

987
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,420
Hmm.

988
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:00,960
Well,

989
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,480
that's most praiseworthy.

990
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,380
Perhaps it will

991
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,620
intercede

992
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,340
for you

993
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,700
when the time comes.

994
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,020
Because most

995
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,560
of the listeners

996
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,240
to this program

997
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,660
right now

998
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,380
are on, like,

999
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:09,940
heavy drugs,

1000
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,620
so it would be

1001
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,020
very easy

1002
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,960
to brainwash them.

1003
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,000
Will drugs

1004
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,200
turn you on?

1005
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:14,720
That's the other

1006
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,360
source of my fortune.

1007
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,280
Drugs turn on you.

1008
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,220
In fact,

1009
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:17,780
I was staying

1010
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:17,900
there.

1011
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,900
I was my sponsor

1012
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,580
in the Drug Wheezers Guild.

1013
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,200
Drug Wheezers?

1014
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,000
I would have never

1015
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,660
got in without

1016
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,360
guidance and help

1017
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,480
from the brother members.

1018
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,380
Mm-hmm.

1019
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,260
You guys use

1020
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:28,900
a lot of drugs?

1021
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,700
Well, uh...

1022
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,860
It's not a drug?

1023
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,540
Well, it's not

1024
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,100
a chemical drug.

1025
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,640
No, no.

1026
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,260
You don't want

1027
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,120
him to go to waste.

1028
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,000
It's not a drug.

1029
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,700
It's an herb.

1030
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,240
No, not even an herb.

1031
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,220
You see,

1032
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,000
these kids

1033
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,180
are walking around

1034
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:41,800
calling their

1035
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,920
cheap street drugs

1036
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,480
frop and so forth.

1037
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,800
Frop is a very

1038
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,780
special thing

1039
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,900
that only grows

1040
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,780
on the droppings

1041
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,240
of certain

1042
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,380
Tibetan holy men.

1043
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,260
And the effect

1044
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,080
of frop is permanent.

1045
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,520
You only need it

1046
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,020
once, ever.

1047
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,560
That's right.

1048
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:54,700


1049
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:54,860
are you part of

1050
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,620
the LSMK Ultra CIA

1051
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,760
LSD experiments

1052
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,580
in the 60s?

1053
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,100
You're all sleepo.

1054
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,700
This thing is...

1055
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,260
Wake up, sleepo.

1056
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,780
Stop snoring, sleepo.

1057
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,420
The MK Ultra,

1058
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,540
it's the Illuminati.

1059
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,280
It's the...

1060
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,720
The bar machines.

1061
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,100
It's the conspiracy.

1062
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,920
Everybody knows,

1063
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,240
and yet no one

1064
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,140
will talk about it

1065
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,300
because they're crazy.

1066
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,920
Embedded into the audio

1067
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,480
of this program

1068
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,580
is a combination

1069
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,600
of ultra-low frequency

1070
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,180
and ultra-low frequency

1071
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,520
vibrations

1072
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,220
that will alter

1073
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,060
the function

1074
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,760
of the brains

1075
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,380
of people who

1076
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,760
are not even

1077
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,420
necessarily listening,

1078
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:30,840
just standing

1079
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,420
too close to a radio.

1080
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,700
An alternate function

1081
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,960
for an alternate...

1082
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,380
Robert Antoine Wilson

1083
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:36,820
ate cheese!

1084
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,120
Well, the tinfoil hats

1085
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,860
don't work anymore.

1086
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,720
...those things out,

1087
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,880
which I'm wearing right now.

1088
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,780
The tinfoil hats

1089
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,480
don't work anymore.

1090
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,480
We changed the frequency.

1091
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,040
Right now,

1092
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,600
you're going to need

1093
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,660
to wear a leadfoil hat.

1094
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,560
Well, no, no.

1095
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,660
Otherwise, the tinfoil hat

1096
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,940
will just amplify the signal.

1097
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,180
You are underestimating

1098
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:52,480
us.

1099
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,580
We have helmets now

1100
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,220
that automatically

1101
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,900
detect...

1102
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,800
Okay, everybody

1103
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,360
talk at once.

1104
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,500
Paul Krasner died

1105
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
for your sins!

1106
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,420
Oh, I shouldn't

1107
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:01,840
have said that.

1108
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,060
He probably just died.

1109
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,080
Hmm.

1110
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,200
I hope not.

1111
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,380
Paul Krasner.

1112
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,120
Oh, no.

1113
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,840
I hardly even knew

1114
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,180
the guy,

1115
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:11,880
but I heard he was

1116
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,840
just, you know,

1117
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,420
a wonderful salesman.

1118
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,300
I was just making

1119
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,100
everything up.

1120
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,140
Stop petting

1121
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,080
Schrodinger's cat.

1122
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,160
That's Schrodinger's cat.

1123
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,740
Schrodinger's brain

1124
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,920
is actually

1125
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,840
the bigger problem.

1126
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,600
Is there a brain

1127
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,260
or not?

1128
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,740
And then there's

1129
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,560
the sad case

1130
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,800
of Schrodinger's baby.

1131
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:32,960
Oh.

1132
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,600
That was really awful.

1133
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
Well, uh...

1134
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,880
Schrodinger's bonobo.

1135
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,600
The X-ray did.

1136
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,680
That was horrible.

1137
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,900
You know, that was sexy.

1138
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,840
Schrodinger's bonobo.

1139
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,960
So, who will save...

1140
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,120
Are you going to have

1141
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,880
to clean up the box

1142
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,580
afterward or not?

1143
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,580
The pygmy chimps.

1144
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:49,880
Right.

1145
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,380
It was a big thing

1146
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,380
with the latex industry

1147
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,880
in the late 1970s.

1148
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,680
I think it was maybe

1149
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,240
how could corroborate that

1150
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,900
if it's indeed a fact.

1151
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,600
What happened in the

1152
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,780
late 1970s

1153
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,980
that I could corroborate?

1154
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,400
They saved Schrodinger's cat.

1155
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,340
Oh, they did?

1156
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,100
So they did.

1157
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:06,720
Look at that.

1158
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,340
Okay.

1159
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,520
Schrodinger's bonobo stick

1160
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,460
begat some other stick

1161
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,300
about polyvinyl chloride

1162
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,460
and latex devices.

1163
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,160
So that's why I asked you

1164
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
if there was

1165
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,860
an ever-presenting

1166
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,560
clump of bonobo

1167
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,520
that both exists

1168
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,340
and does not exist

1169
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,120
at the same time.

1170
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,440
After so much

1171
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,840
stick-to-itiveness

1172
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,120
to abandon it

1173
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,800
at the last moment.

1174
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,200
It was not Schrodinger's

1175
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,300
type of stuff at all.

1176
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,780
I used to get

1177
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,300
most of my stuff

1178
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,360
at Schrodinger's

1179
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,400
but not since they

1180
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,140
lost their lease.

1181
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,740
I remember going downtown

1182
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,760
on the bus

1183
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,160
with my parents

1184
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,820
as a little kid

1185
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,360
shopping at Schrodinger's

1186
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,040
and getting a malt.

1187
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:49,860
Yeah.

1188
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,300
Yes, at the soda fountain there.

1189
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,700
Yes.

1190
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,220
A lot of old ladies

1191
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,660
went there

1192
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,980
and got sandwiches and things.

1193
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,540
But their prices

1194
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,800
went sky high.

1195
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:58,700
That's true.

1196
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,300
Schrodinger's malt,

1197
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,000
how did you know

1198
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,800
you were going to get one?

1199
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,300
They were forced to

1200
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:02,660
integrate their lunch.

1201
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,480
That's the beauty part.

1202
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,800
You can drink as many

1203
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,300
as you want

1204
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,900
because you're both

1205
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,300
drinking it

1206
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,060
and not drinking it

1207
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,680
so the calories

1208
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,020
cancel themselves out.

1209
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,660
I guess these scientist

1210
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,580
eggheads must be

1211
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,480
a lot smarter than me

1212
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,120
because that stuff

1213
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,340
doesn't make no sense at all.

1214
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,500
I'm just stupid.

1215
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,860
Well, maybe so.

1216
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,420
You weren't supposed

1217
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:19,860
to say that.

1218
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,100
That part.

1219
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,920
I was reading

1220
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,720
a rhetorical.

1221
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,000
Maybe I'm just stupid.

1222
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,400
That doesn't mean

1223
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,260
I really think I'm stupid.

1224
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,380
That means I think

1225
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,060
they're stupid.

1226
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,680
Here, read the juvenile

1227
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,020
article in the

1228
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,640
Book of Knowledge.

1229
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,900
That's just silly.

1230
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,500
Yes, this kiddie

1231
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,880
sugar-coated science

1232
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,980
should bring you

1233
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,540
up to speed.

1234
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,860
The Junior Scholastic

1235
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,160
Edition.

1236
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,240
Now, I read that

1237
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,780
when you have

1238
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,320
quantums,

1239
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,940
you can do anything.

1240
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,040
You can go back in time.

1241
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,440
You can make multiple

1242
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,420
copies of yourself

1243
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,000
and clones.

1244
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,100
If you've got quantums,

1245
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,800
you can just do

1246
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,260
about anything.

1247
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,240
You can put it

1248
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,280
in your homeopath medicine.

1249
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,940
Put quantums in there

1250
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,880
and it's like

1251
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,560
antioxidants.

1252
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And it doesn't have

1253
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
none of that

1254
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,760
grubin in it

1255
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,220
or gluten.

1256
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:02,900
Gluten.

1257
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,340
Nobody likes it.

1258
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,080
I'm a glutton

1259
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:05,340
for gluten.

1260
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,120
That's all that counts.

1261
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,400
I am a glutton

1262
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:07,840
for gluten.

1263
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,440
I don't know.

1264
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,420
It's a glutton

1265
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:11,860
glutton.

1266
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,140
Gluten for gluten.

1267
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:13,720
Gluten pops.

1268
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,100
With electrolytes.

1269
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,640
Yes, in blue.

1270
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,340
Ah.

1271
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,380
At any rate,

1272
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,760
these picky

1273
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,160
matters of diet

1274
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,720
will hardly matter

1275
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,300
when we have

1276
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,140
no stomachs

1277
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,760
and no teeth.

1278
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,900
I want to be on

1279
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,660
the paleo diet

1280
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,700
so I can live

1281
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,400
the average age length

1282
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,780
of a paleolytical man.

1283
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,740
Yes, you can

1284
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,900
wear your teeth out

1285
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,800
chewing pieces

1286
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,380
of rotting animal skin.

1287
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:40,960
Right.

1288
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,020
That's paleo diet.

1289
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,420
The quiet,

1290
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,220
the rumble in your stomach

1291
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,980
which is up against

1292
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,660
your backbone

1293
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,520
and your feet

1294
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,780
bloody and torn

1295
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,600
from being chased

1296
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,460
by a persistent

1297
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:49,840
man.

1298
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,260
It's a mammoth

1299
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:50,960
for 20 miles.

1300
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,460
It's natural.

1301
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,640
The paleo diet.

1302
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,400
That's a great name

1303
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,460
for a rock and roll band.

1304
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,700
Persistent mammoth.

1305
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,440
Well, you know,

1306
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,840
an elephant never forgets.

1307
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,600
I wouldn't go

1308
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,280
messing around

1309
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,100
no mammoth

1310
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,720
if I were you, mister.

1311
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,480
You know,

1312
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,600
we really need to get

1313
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,940
the genetic engineers

1314
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,460
of the world

1315
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,780
on the task

1316
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,180
of creating

1317
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:08,920
pygmy elephants

1318
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,700
that would be suitable

1319
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,560
to keep as pets.

1320
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,140
Save the pygmy elephants.

1321
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:12,960
In small houses.

1322
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
They would make

1323
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,780
the best pets ever.

1324
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,160
of humanities

1325
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,420
that we could have

1326
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,600
if you just take

1327
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,640
your pig in a blanket,

1328
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:19,840
and you're like,

1329
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,740
or your large,

1330
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:21,940
or your,

1331
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,260
I mean,

1332
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,180
your small elephant

1333
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,360
to the store.

1334
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,460
That's your elephant.

1335
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:25,720
You can take your

1336
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,560
dwarf hippopotamus

1337
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,040
and stuff

1338
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,060
and just get on the back

1339
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,400
and you tie them up

1340
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,500
like they used to

1341
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,520
in the old western days.

1342
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,100
They used to tie up

1343
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,460
elephants in the old west?

1344
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,320
They tried,

1345
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,140
but, you know,

1346
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,540
they were significantly

1347
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,960
larger in those days.

1348
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,100
And with our

1349
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,080
new modern technology,

1350
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,200
we could actually

1351
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,740
create,

1352
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,680
create them,

1353
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,720
we could make them

1354
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,480
little teeny,

1355
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,300
tiny, small,

1356
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,880
just big enough

1357
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,640
to look like a pony.

1358
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,720
Only they'd be

1359
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,040
like a,

1360
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,280
even a rhinoceros

1361
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,360
if it tamed it real good

1362
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,400
and removed its horn.

1363
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,220
Homo floresiensis

1364
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,700
lived among

1365
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,840
pygmy elephants,

1366
00:27:59,180 --> 00:27:59,600
didn't it?

1367
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,580
Yes, that was

1368
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,460
the hobbits,

1369
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,100
the real life hobbits.

1370
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,160
They had to deal

1371
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,340
with giant lizards

1372
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,000
and tiny elephants.

1373
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,120
Those lizards

1374
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,680
were huge.

1375
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,060
They were actual dragons.

1376
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,100
So there was a time

1377
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,580
when there was

1378
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,440
cavemen fighting

1379
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,260
on dinosaurs,

1380
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,120
only they weren't

1381
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,580
dinosaurs,

1382
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,840
they were big lizards.

1383
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,280
That's about to come on.

1384
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,300
They're dragons,

1385
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,340
but not dinosaurs.

1386
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,120
Well, no,

1387
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,140
they're not dinosaurs,

1388
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,140
but they're kind of

1389
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,760
like dinosaurs.

1390
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,720
It's kind of like

1391
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,200
cavemen got to fight

1392
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,680
dinosaurs.

1393
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,120
They were, in some sense,

1394
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,300
very much like dinosaurs.

1395
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,740
Their skin was similar

1396
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,140
to the dinosaur skin.

1397
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,520
It's the same as

1398
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,420
Jesus riding on

1399
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,440
a dinosaur and

1400
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:36,680
something.

1401
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,060
Jesus was nowhere

1402
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,380
near these islands.

1403
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,580
instead of spears

1404
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,460
when they were

1405
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:41,880
reattached.

1406
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,060
Jesus didn't know that,

1407
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,800
although, but Jesus

1408
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,820
knew about dragons

1409
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,200
because that's mentioned

1410
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,220
in the Old Testament.

1411
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,080
So, yeah, sure.

1412
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,380
Absolumo.

1413
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,380
That's right.

1414
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,460
Yeah, there's people

1415
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,320
trying to prove

1416
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,980
that the dinosaurs

1417
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,240
were, in fact,

1418
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,480
actually dragons,

1419
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,840
so as to bring it

1420
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,060
into the, you know,

1421
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:02,920
biblical framework.

1422
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:03,920
Nine.

1423
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,360
They are mistaken.

1424
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,800
Sadly deluded.

1425
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,080
Well, now,

1426
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,500
wait until they discover,

1427
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,340
you know,

1428
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,280
Dragonsaurus

1429
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,260
with his big old

1430
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:12,860
flame sack.

1431
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,400
They have discovered

1432
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,880
many dragon-like

1433
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,740
creatures that

1434
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,200
recently became

1435
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,780
but none of them

1436
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,580
lived in the time

1437
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,940
of the hapless humans.

1438
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:20,900
And then how about

1439
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,400
Hellboy?

1440
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,680
That Styracosaurus-y

1441
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,400
kind of monster

1442
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,240
they found in...

1443
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,960
Actually, they called

1444
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,740
him Hellboy because

1445
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,800
it was hellish to get

1446
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,040
the thing out of

1447
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,340
the rocks.

1448
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,520
He was a monster

1449
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,300
but not a

1450
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,200
Styracosaurus, though.

1451
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,540
He was one of those

1452
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,900
Cereptopsian things.

1453
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,660
And he ground

1454
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,400
their bones to make

1455
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:38,780
his bread.

1456
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,040
He was ugly.

1457
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,120
He had them

1458
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,900
stubby horns.

1459
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,280
But apparently

1460
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,140
the real reason

1461
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,640
that the paleontologists

1462
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,440
called him Hellboy

1463
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,140
was because they

1464
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,900
had to carve him

1465
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,340
out of really hard rock

1466
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,340
on a cliffside

1467
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,560
and there were

1468
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,580
endangered species

1469
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,780
living in the river below.

1470
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,140
They weren't allowed

1471
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,800
to let more than

1472
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,480
a certain amount

1473
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,840
of rock and fossil

1474
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,740
fall into the river.

1475
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,160
Tumble down.

1476
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,040
Right.

1477
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,180
I want to go to

1478
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,120
the actual gate of hell

1479
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,920
in Turkmenistan.

1480
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,260
So it was hard

1481
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,320
as hell to get out.

1482
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,700
Get Hellboy out.

1483
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,080
Yeah.

1484
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,660
Hellboy the Dinosaur.

1485
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,300
Hellboy the Dinosaur.

1486
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,360
Yeah.

1487
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,800
He can do all kinds

1488
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,120
of things.

1489
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:17,260
He can do fire.

1490
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,060
Yes.

1491
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,780
The reason they could

1492
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,400
breathe fire

1493
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,860
was a simple one.

1494
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,760
If they leaned

1495
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,880
across the campfire

1496
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,160
already set

1497
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,120
and breathed on you

1498
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,620
then their

1499
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,340
exhalation

1500
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:29,920
would indeed

1501
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,420
turn into a jet

1502
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,380
of living flame.

1503
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,380
Same thing

1504
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:33,840
could be said

1505
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,300
for cows.

1506
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:34,700
You know,

1507
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,280
they belch up

1508
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:35,940
quite a bit of methane.

1509
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,100
Yes, they do.

1510
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,040
And they too

1511
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,600
could be fire breathers

1512
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,380
if they simply

1513
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,360
send a blast

1514
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,420
over a fire.

1515
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,940
Over a campfire.

1516
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,760
Hey, Dave,

1517
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,740
who was the rock star

1518
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,480
you were talking about?

1519
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:47,740
Um,

1520
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,360
I kept on saying

1521
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,100
question mark

1522
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,260
over and over.

1523
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:51,680
I know.

1524
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,060
You must mean

1525
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,960
Trademark Gunderson?

1526
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,620
No,

1527
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,820
it's Question Mark Gunderson.

1528
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,760
Question Mark.

1529
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
He'll be at X Day.

1530
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,600
Yes,

1531
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,660
the Evolution Control Committee

1532
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,560
will be representing it.

1533
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,480
Question Mark is coming

1534
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:03,880
to X Day?

1535
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:03,960
No,

1536
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,240
Question Mark is coming

1537
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,380
to the Mysterians.

1538
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:06,900
I mean,

1539
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,580
Wisteria.

1540
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,080
Trademark is coming

1541
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,080
to Wisteria.

1542
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,240
Wait,

1543
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,040
this is getting confusing.

1544
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:12,920
Yes, Trademark is coming

1545
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,000
to Wisteria.

1546
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,020
There's Question Mark

1547
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,200
and the Mysterians

1548
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,500
who aren't going

1549
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,120
to Wisteria.

1550
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,460
Wisteria.

1551
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,740
But Trademark

1552
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,560
is going to Wisteria.

1553
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,320
For X Day

1554
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,540
and he will be

1555
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,600
appearing twice

1556
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,440
and doing a workshop

1557
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,820
at the Starwood Festival.

1558
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,840
And he's the director

1559
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,360
of the Evolution Control Committee,

1560
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,620
which is kind of like

1561
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,760
time control laboratories,

1562
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,520
but Evolution Control.

1563
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,660
They work hand in hand.

1564
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,200
Yes.

1565
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,600
They work in cooperation.

1566
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,420
You know who you've got

1567
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,540
to get to play X Day

1568
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,120
one of these years?

1569
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,120
No, who?

1570
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,040
The Toilet Bowl Cleaners.

1571
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,860
The Toilet Bowl Cleaners.

1572
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:47,860


1573
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,040
They've already had

1574
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,520
the Arm and Edge.

1575
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,320
There aren't even any

1576
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,640
toilet bowls out there.

1577
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,460
They are the ones

1578
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,480
who make poop songs.

1579
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,260
Like their latest album

1580
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:56,540
is called.

1581
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:56,560
Oh, right.

1582
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,120
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1583
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,200
Yeah, you've talked about it.

1584
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,020
Their latest album

1585
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,360
is called

1586
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,420
The Mops and the Booms

1587
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,960
and Dance and stuff like that.

1588
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,680
The album is called

1589
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,700
You Thought We Ran Out

1590
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,760
of Poop Song Ideas.

1591
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,720
You were wrong.

1592
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,760
Well, Philo Drummond

1593
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,700
and his family

1594
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,340
will be there.

1595
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,140
So, and Pooh Watertowel.

1596
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,620
The band.

1597
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,160
The actual band.

1598
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,200
The duo, Pooh Watertowel.

1599
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,080
Pooh Watertowel.

1600
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,260
Will be joining together

1601
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,120
with the drummers.

1602
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,140
For a reunion

1603
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,640
of Doctors for Wotan.

1604
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,080
And if that doesn't scare you,

1605
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,660
I don't know what.

1606
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,460
They only play on Wednesdays.

1607
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,380
No, actually,

1608
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,020
that used to be true.

1609
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,200
But for the reunion,

1610
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,240
we're making an exception.

1611
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,640
Wood.

1612
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,000
Every day is the day

1613
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,660
of Wotan now.

1614
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,140
The Vortex took them.

1615
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,100
Just took them away.

1616
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,200
Yes.

1617
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,660
As in that great movie,

1618
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,880
The Day Time Ended.

1619
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,860
I've showed that movie

1620
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,920
to Princess Wee

1621
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,720
last week.

1622
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:47,960
Yes.

1623
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,900
What did you think,

1624
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,480
Princess Wee?

1625
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,580
Well, my mind was blown.

1626
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,820
What happened

1627
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,800
to little Billy Ben?

1628
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,300
The Vortex took them.

1629
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,580
What does that mean?

1630
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,620
I don't know.

1631
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,460
What we have here

1632
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,560
is a break

1633
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,920
in the time-space continuum.

1634
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,080
Tell it, Daddy.

1635
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,020
It's a vortex.

1636
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,200
It's an American family

1637
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,900
being tormented

1638
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,000
by special effects.

1639
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,220
That had some

1640
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,660
great stop motion in it.

1641
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,220
Yeah, they did.

1642
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,340
They had the two

1643
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,420
huge monsters

1644
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,360
slugging it out

1645
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:18,920
in the barn.

1646
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,980
And at the end,

1647
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,880
the new age comes.

1648
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:21,640
That's right.

1649
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,940
Nobody understands it,

1650
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,420
but they know

1651
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,140
it's the new age.

1652
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,640
Yeah, they're all

1653
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,540
walking down toward

1654
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,240
the buzzing,

1655
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:26,840
zapping,

1656
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,860
futuristic city.

1657
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,720
The kids riding

1658
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,340
bizarre alien beasts.

1659
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:31,940
I don't know what

1660
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,700
we're walking into,

1661
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,680
but it sure looks pretty.

1662
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,740
And the dad says

1663
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,700
to the mom,

1664
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,180
you know,

1665
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,280
I think this was

1666
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,960
just somehow

1667
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,780
meant to be.

1668
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:39,900
Yeah, that's right.

1669
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,940
That's the end.

1670
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,060
That's the end of the movie.

1671
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,900
Well, sorry,

1672
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,820
spoiler alert.

1673
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,820
Shot, shot

1674
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,240
from some hack writer.

1675
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,460
Loaded quid.

1676
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,980
Well, but they do

1677
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,860
put in a lot of stuff

1678
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,240
about sunspot activity

1679
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,340
to make it profitable.

1680
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,420
Oh, yeah.

1681
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,800
When you get sunspots,

1682
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,020
you're going to watch out

1683
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,880
for the special effects.

1684
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,020
They're coming.

1685
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,220
We have another caller here.

1686
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,900
Hello, you're on the air.

1687
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,620
Save us, caller.

1688
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,040
Save us.

1689
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,680
Yes, I believe

1690
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,640
the sunspots

1691
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,080
are God's acne.

1692
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,920
On the sun's broad

1693
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,820
and burning face.

1694
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,600
They prove that the sun

1695
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,320
was not a problem.

1696
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:16,940
It was a perfect sphere

1697
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,860
when they were first

1698
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,400
discovered by Galileo

1699
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,460
and thus he was consigned

1700
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,720
to re-education

1701
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,680
by the ecclesiastical authority.

1702
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,960
Ours is an adolescent star.

1703
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,300
And his daughter

1704
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,200
is not allowed

1705
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,180
to escape from the nunnery.

1706
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:31,980
Every time the sun

1707
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,680
pops a zit,

1708
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,180
that's a solar flare.

1709
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,960
And Bob is a clearasil.

1710
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,120
That's right.

1711
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,940
I was going to say,

1712
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,800
okay, people,

1713
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,120
how about a little

1714
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,500
J.R. Bob Dobbs

1715
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,740
on that pimply solar disc,

1716
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:44,960
huh?

1717
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,320
Does it dab on you?

1718
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,320


1719
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,320


1720
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,320


1721
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:46,980
On the dobs.

1722
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,080
A little dab, do you?

1723
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,020
Well, yes, I have.

1724
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,560
I believe that Venus

1725
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,140
is circling Uranus, too.

1726
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,100
Venus has transited the sun

1727
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,620
for the last time

1728
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,920
for a hundred years.

1729
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,780
You've totally missed it.

1730
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,200
You missed the transit of Venus.

1731
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,400
What is the matter with you,

1732
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,800
dull, witted fellow?

1733
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,640
I was pretty sure

1734
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,760
it was circling Uranus.

1735
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:11,560
Nope.

1736
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,660
Not so.

1737
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,660
The other way around.

1738
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,260
Stupid.

1739
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:14,960
Stupid.

1740
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,000
The other way around.

1741
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,320
You can't do that.

1742
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:16,700
The two of Earth

1743
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,320
are stupid, stupid, stupid.

1744
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,020
Uranus circles

1745
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,300
the inner worlds,

1746
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,160
including Venus.

1747
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,840
We have a cosmic bidet

1748
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,940
that keeps Uranus clean.

1749
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,420
That was a great man.

1750
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,480
Cosmic bidet.

1751
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:30,840
Yeah.

1752
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,980
The orbit of Uranus

1753
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,340
actually interferes,

1754
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,080
cuts across the orbit of Pluto

1755
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,320
at a point.

1756
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,840
But recently it's been discovered

1757
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,680
that Saturn has rings

1758
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,600
that are vastly huger

1759
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,940
than the ones that have been known.

1760
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,440
Whole astronomical distances

1761
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,340
of ring material

1762
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,900
are around the planet Saturn,

1763
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,640
not just those little visible ones

1764
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,440
that we can see.

1765
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,900
Ring around Uranus.

1766
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,760
That you can launder away.

1767
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,420
Ring around the color.

1768
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,300
So then could you conceivably walk

1769
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,640
on the rings of Saturn?

1770
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,080
Well, you could,

1771
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,160
but you're not going to get me out there.

1772
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,800
Your first life.

1773
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,940
That is more strong material

1774
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,880
that's coming up

1775
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,980
in just a few seconds.

1776
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,160
Yeah, you've heard of

1777
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,200
walking on the wild side?

1778
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,660
It's ice, man.

1779
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,400
Ice.

1780
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,060
Ice.

1781
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,720
And such nice ice.

1782
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,260
If you were actually

1783
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,320
like surfing on the rings of Saturn,

1784
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,620
it would appear that you were

1785
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,320
just going forward

1786
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:22,900
in a straight line.

1787
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,200
Like that movie Dark Star,

1788
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,460
but not like the recent movie Dark Star,

1789
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,000
which is about H.R. Giger.

1790
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,460
Giger?

1791
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,340
Giger.

1792
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,180
No, it's about

1793
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,960
some disaffected astronauts

1794
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,700
in space who were sent out

1795
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,580
to destabilize and destroy

1796
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,900
irrelevant planets

1797
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,060
or some bizarro mission like that.

1798
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,400
Giger.

1799
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,920
Destroy the world.

1800
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:45,920


1801
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,580
The warming sun.

1802
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,520
They have intelligent nuclear bombs

1803
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,180
that will destroy planets,

1804
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,000
but the problem is

1805
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,100
they're a little too intelligent

1806
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,420
and they have to be talked out of going off.

1807
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,920
You must have seen that movie.

1808
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,720
You did see that movie.

1809
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,120
You have seen the movie.

1810
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,320
You did sign the application.

1811
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,740
You did sign the application.

1812
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,200
You are aware of your obligations.

1813
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,940
Well, I think you're better.

1814
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,220
I think that our legal staff

1815
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:15,900
will contact us.

1816
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,200
We'll contact you if you have broken

1817
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,220
any of the aforementioned rules and regulations.

1818
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,320
Well, you can always call

1819
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,640
the toll-free number

1820
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,780
and get your bacon saved.

1821
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,400
But we're so close to the cusp

1822
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,680
of utter immolation and destruction.

1823
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,420
I think you shouldn't

1824
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,620
wait too long

1825
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,760
before seeking expert

1826
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,940
scientific assistance.

1827
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,060
Repent.

1828
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,060
Quit your job.

1829
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,160
Slack off.

1830
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,580
The world ends tomorrow

1831
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,400
and you may die.

1832
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,460
Are you abnormal?

1833
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,360
Different?

1834
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,380
Well, you are probably better

1835
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,640
than most people.

1836
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,360
Hey, Dr. Hal,

1837
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,200
say something from Half-Life.

1838
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,000
Uh, have you seen my coffee cup?

1839
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,040
Whoa!

1840
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:01,940
Man!

1841
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,080
Oh, man, that is cool!

1842
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,420
Hey, Hal, if there were gonna be...

1843
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,640
Why do we all have to wear

1844
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,920
these ridiculous ties?

1845
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:08,800
I'm sorry.

1846
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,280
For those of you who are just tuning in,

1847
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,200
this is Dr. Hal,

1848
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:12,820
who actually...

1849
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:13,780
Me, me, me.

1850
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,100
...actually did some of the voices

1851
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,740
in the video game.

1852
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,120
Half-Life.

1853
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,340
Were you in Half-Life 2 as well?

1854
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,560
I am in Half-Life 2.

1855
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,520
My address to City 17

1856
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,440
is a lengthy oration,

1857
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,620
but then I'm also in Dota 2

1858
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,500
as Tinker,

1859
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,380
who is a sort of little elf version

1860
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,060
of my character in Half-Life.

1861
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,620
Yes, Dota,

1862
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,140
for those who don't play such games,

1863
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,720
is known as Defense of the Ancients 2.

1864
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,060
Dota 2.

1865
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,020
My character Tinker

1866
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,480
masterminds an army of giant spiders

1867
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,840
and other creatures,

1868
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,480
which come sweeping along the screen.

1869
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,600
Yes, yes.

1870
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:46,940
I'm casting.

1871
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,420
And they wanted to mess up my voice electronically

1872
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,640
to turn it into a little elf voice,

1873
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,120
and I said,

1874
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,060
don't bother.

1875
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,500
I'll just do the little elf voice.

1876
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,460
And so I did,

1877
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,520
and it was fine.

1878
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,280
And behold, it was good.

1879
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,560
What does your little elf voice sound like?

1880
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,300
Why, like some little elf taking off

1881
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,460
is what it sounds like.

1882
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,500
You think I'm going to give away a proprietary...

1883
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,240
Oh, is this on?

1884
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,560
Well, thank you for your question

1885
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,720
and interest in the...

1886
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,020
video game industry.

1887
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,200
So you would...

1888
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,160
I have to go prepare for the saucers.

1889
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:22,840
Saucers?

1890
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,980
The saucers.

1891
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,620
Nice to talk with you, everyone.

1892
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,780
See you on the other side.

1893
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,620
All right.

1894
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,100
Thank you, Mark.

1895
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,640
Okay, the saucers are on their way.

1896
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,380
And, uh...

1897
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:31,700
Oops.

1898
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,780
Uh, now we're...

1899
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,040
They've slowed down, I think,

1900
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,220
uh, near Saturn.

1901
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,900
They have to hold off in sight of Earth,

1902
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,980
just as Moses was halted

1903
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,380
at the edge of the Promised Land

1904
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,380
because of his, uh, intemperance

1905
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,260
and displeasing Jehovah.

1906
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,560
I see the other side.

1907
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,280
I may not get there with you.

1908
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,820
I have been to the mountaintop

1909
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,660
and I have seen

1910
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,760
the other side.

1911
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,220
I don't know if I'm going to get there with you.

1912
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,680
Yes, the Lord is going to

1913
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,220
take Dr. Sinister home

1914
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,680
if you don't send in, uh,

1915
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,740
your, uh, hard-earned, uh, sawbox.

1916
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,940
And he saw a 600-foot Jesus

1917
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,280
winking, gesticulating,

1918
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,820
making significant...

1919
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,740
uh, uh, arm and hand signals.

1920
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,180
Uh, only you can make a difference here.

1921
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,900
Help Jesus out.

1922
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:25,520
Yes.

1923
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,640
He needs your help.

1924
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,100
Keep Jesus away from, uh,

1925
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,820
I miss Jesus.

1926
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,500
radio programs and...

1927
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,280
Oh, buddy, we need to pump up Jesus.

1928
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,540
We need to pump Jesus up.

1929
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,020
For one thing, we can do a favor

1930
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,080
by stop using that name for him,

1931
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,240
which was created by the hated oppressors,

1932
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,340
the Romans, you see.

1933
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,140
They didn't like people with those funny...

1934
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,240
I'm talking about the real Jesus.

1935
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,620
...Jewish-sounding names,

1936
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:45,900
that were...

1937
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,520
like, Yeshua, Ben-David,

1938
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,740
or whatever it was that they said.

1939
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,360
That's not the way people have names.

1940
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,360
People have names with masculine endings,

1941
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,860
like Marcus, Lucius, and you, you're Jesus.

1942
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,300
Maximus, Maximus.

1943
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,120
Okay, get out of here.

1944
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:56,480
Next.

1945
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,420
And so, the ones who...

1946
00:40:59,420 --> 00:40:59,720
I knew that.

1947
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,040
...who persecuted and crucified him

1948
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,560
gave him this terrible name

1949
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,100
that everybody uses,

1950
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,740
and I think it's a shame,

1951
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,760
and we have to stop it right now.

1952
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,580
Well, the funny thing about the Latin language,

1953
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,460
uh, is that nouns have to have

1954
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,880
a certain type of ending to be even able to...

1955
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,320
fit into a complete sentence.

1956
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,200
Just so.

1957
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,260
Otherwise, they wander in the sentence,

1958
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,560
like the wandering Jew,

1959
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,680
unable to come to land, come to light.

1960
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,920
You can be a fourth declension noun,

1961
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,960
or you can be a first and second declension noun.

1962
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,740
Hmm, even worse.

1963
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,140
But declension is mandatory.

1964
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,160
Absolutely.

1965
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,900
You must be able to, uh, decline.

1966
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:38,420
Decline?

1967
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,340
Yes.

1968
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:44,140
So, uh, Jesus, or, uh, Je-zoom,

1969
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,620
uh, but come on.

1970
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,820
Uh, or Je-zoo-ay, meaning there are all three of them.

1971
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:49,880
Jesus, Je-za, Je-zooom.

1972
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,680
Mr. Breedee pointed out that, uh,

1973
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,880
the Jews didn't kill Jesus.

1974
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:54,460
No, of course not.

1975
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,700
The Romans didn't kill Jesus.

1976
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:55,940
No.

1977
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,860
Jesus killed himself.

1978
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,740
The cops killed Jesus.

1979
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,140
The police.

1980
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,660
It was police brutality.

1981
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,080
I need to believe that.

1982
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,740
I, I, I maintain that he killed himself.

1983
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,200
By intemperate behavior.

1984
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,140
Well, of course, being God, he's God.

1985
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,020
Nothing could happen that he didn't want to happen, but...

1986
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:09,540
Exactly.

1987
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,500
You know, I mean, his whole plan,

1988
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,300
his whole plan is like,

1989
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,880
okay, so I, I am God,

1990
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,280
and I made these people,

1991
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,860
and I made them real,

1992
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,480
and I made them really messed up,

1993
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,620
and I, of course I'm God,

1994
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,520
so I can't do anything wrong,

1995
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,340
so I must have made them all messed up on purpose.

1996
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,160
Uh, and, and this is all an elaborate plan

1997
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,020
for him to come down

1998
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,260
and have a really rough weekend,

1999
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,060
because he's into S&M,

2000
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,540
and, you know...

2001
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,180
Oh, no, no.

2002
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,820
I mean, that had to have been God's plan all along.

2003
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,420
God wanted to get crucified all along.

2004
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,180
Well, but the cops wanted to help.

2005
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:36,840
And, and, you know,

2006
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,160
and the whole reason he died on the cross,

2007
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,600
he had a little bit of a God complex.

2008
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,340
He was just too proud to say the safe word.

2009
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,180
Yeah, but that doesn't excerpt the cops

2010
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,840
from, uh, Condon's...

2011
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,140
condemnation for following their comp instinct.

2012
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,060
Well, you know, Condon...

2013
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,500
Don't just follow your orders.

2014
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,240
That's not good in the Catholic Church.

2015
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,260
Remember, nobody was ever born a cop.

2016
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,080
Well, what are we supposed to do?

2017
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,760
Burn all the Confederate flags then?

2018
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,860
Why don't we just burn the American flag?

2019
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,080
Why don't we just all jump off a cliff then?

2020
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,340
Well, didn't, uh...

2021
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,340
If you're gonna outlaw everything,

2022
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,660
why don't you just outlaw everything?

2023
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,240
Didn't Dylan Storm Roof Aluminum Siding

2024
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,180
burn an American flag

2025
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,200
on, on his little YouTube video?

2026
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:15,840
Oh, yeah, that's right.

2027
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,560
He did.

2028
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,640
So it's, uh, that's already been done.

2029
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,880
It's past praying for.

2030
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,880
Well, because America's been destroyed.

2031
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,760
It's already, it...

2032
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,240
Obama's already destroyed it single-handedly.

2033
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,000
One time I actually saw...

2034
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,100
Which there's super powers.

2035
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,620
One time I actually saw rolling papers

2036
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,340
with the American flag printed on them.

2037
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,960
Yeah, and a patch on a hippie's ass

2038
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,700
with an American flag on it.

2039
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,240
Now, you tell me that's, uh, not the song of the apocalypse.

2040
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,640
That peace sign is a,

2041
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,680
that's a footprint of the American chicken.

2042
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,840
Well, uh, I guess that, uh,

2043
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,640
a symbol of death.

2044
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,860
And a Confederate flag is a footprint of the American, uh...

2045
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:52,940
Hogswood.

2046
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,600
Um, uh, um...

2047
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,900
A starry X.

2048
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,060
An American, uh...

2049
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:57,560
Starry X star.

2050
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,700
Now, which Confederate flag are you talking about?

2051
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,820
What has to do with an X and stars and, uh...

2052
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,360
Now, which Confederate flag are you talking about?

2053
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,760
The exosaurus.

2054
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,140
The battle flag.

2055
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,460
Everybody has to argue over it.

2056
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,200
The conservative exoskeleton flag.

2057
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,660
We all have to argue over what the,

2058
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,040
that's not even the Confederate flag.

2059
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:12,920
That's the battle flag.

2060
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,620
The Yankees don't know nothing.

2061
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,640
The Yankees don't know nothing.

2062
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,000
I mean, you're a battle flag.

2063
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:17,640
You are a military...

2064
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,420
You're a Virginia Lib Targe.

2065
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,080
You're so stupid.

2066
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,100
They're just idiots.

2067
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,080
They don't even know what the stars and bars are.

2068
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,080
All they can do is call names.

2069
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,380
All they can do is call names.

2070
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,180
All these stupid idiots can do is call names.

2071
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,720
All them stupid idiots can do is call names to people,

2072
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,920
because they're stupid idiots.

2073
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,380
You of Earth are stupid, stupid, stupid.

2074
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,400
That's all they can do is just call people stupid things,

2075
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,200
because they're so stupid.

2076
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:40,020
Well, uh, our friend, Saint Stupid,

2077
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,620
is ecumenically yoked with the Church of the Subgenius.

2078
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,520
This is the Church of the Subgenius, after all.

2079
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:45,620
That's no good.

2080
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,420
This show is so stupid, I can't stop watching it,

2081
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,120
just thinking how stupid people must be watching this stupid show.

2082
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,820
I just sit here just thinking,

2083
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,300
it must be so stupid to sit here watching this.

2084
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,520
I just can't turn it off.

2085
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,940
I can't wait till next week.

2086
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,840
I wouldn't spend too much time thinking about it,

2087
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,280
because you know what's gonna happen next.

2088
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,940
It's so stupid.

2089
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,340
I just love watching it.

2090
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,100
The rocks are gonna melt.

2091
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,620
People will scream.

2092
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,100
Cities will fall into the abyss.

2093
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,340
You know, you're all gonna have a terrible time.

2094
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,620
But...

2095
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,740
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.

2096
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,460
Hosea 615.

2097
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,460
There you go, and if you can't believe Hosea,

2098
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,280
who can you believe?

2099
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,700
He's such a hoser than Hosea.

2100
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,720
Yeah, he's not even a real guy.

2101
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,800
He's an illegal immigrant.

2102
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,220
He's a pig-fibber.

2103
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,000
So, uh, I think we've...

2104
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,540
Pre- and post-testaments, or New Testaments,

2105
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,620
Cretans, you're all Cretans.

2106
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:40,780
Now, is there any other theological question we could enlighten?

2107
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,720
Yeah, I'm not a creationist, I'm a Cretanist.

2108
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:48,280
Yeah, and other such catalogical questions we could enlighten you at?

2109
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,320
Well, it could be.

2110
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:56,560
Just give us a big call here, give us a jingle, a shout-out here on the radio, and...

2111
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,380
And you can call here at the University of San Luis Obispo

2112
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:05,220
if you have any final questions to prepare yourself for the coming apocalypse.

2113
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,680
These universities is nothing but Marxists.

2114
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,940
They sell to all lesbian Marxist professors.

2115
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,660
It's all those kids learn from now.

2116
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,140
That's why it's things like this.

2117
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,560
They think they spell women with a Y.

2118
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:16,860
They're entitled.

2119
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,820
They think they's entitled to everything.

2120
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:25,200
I take that personally, because I am a Marxist impersonalist, impersonator.

2121
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:31,020
Well, you probably think you're entitled to everything on other guy's dime.

2122
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,520
On my dime, yeah.

2123
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,500
I happen to work.

2124
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,340
Well, not really.

2125
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,480
We can carry him on the internet.

2126
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,620
Welfare Keats.

2127
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:41,920
Says the generation that paid a tiny fraction of what today's kids are paying.

2128
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,720
For college tuition.

2129
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,940
Them kids, it's entitlements.

2130
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:46,480
That's all.

2131
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,160
Diversity and entitlements.

2132
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,020
That's all that knows about.

2133
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:51,960
Says the last generation that's actually going to get to collect on Social Security.

2134
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,240
Well, that's all Republican propaganda.

2135
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,060
Still voting Democrats, still poor.

2136
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,280
Still voting Republicans, still poor.

2137
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,260
But, you know what I'm saying?

2138
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,260
No, nobody understands at all what you're saying.

2139
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,420
Patriot, psychotic, anarcho-materialist party.

2140
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,080
I'm talking God's language.

2141
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,680
You need to sit down and take a stress pill.

2142
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,320
I have a confession to make.

2143
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,000
Uh-oh.

2144
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:23,700
As a young child, about 10 or 11 years old, I was in love with Chuck Connors.

2145
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:24,540
I'm sorry.

2146
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,860
Marked as the one who ran.

2147
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:32,280
I thought you were going to say he psychically abused you as a leather man or whatever they

2148
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,060
called him in France.

2149
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:33,440
No, no, no.

2150
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,680
He was innocent.

2151
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,960
Not a charge was true.

2152
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,140
No, that's the...

2153
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,960
And the world will never know.

2154
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,400
Stranded, trapped on the toilet bowl.

2155
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,220
But you're stranded and you can't reach the roll.

2156
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,580
Okay, take three.

2157
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,780
Rubenstein, I listened to all of those X-Day shows from last year in a row, and you was

2158
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,560
talking about that stupid old Bobo character every show.

2159
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,120
Why were you being so repetitive?

2160
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,140
Are you senile?

2161
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:10,500
Well...

2162
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:12,060
First time caller, long time listener.

2163
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,360
I want to talk about Schrodinger's bonobo again.

2164
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:18,620
Schrodinger's bonobo.

2165
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,940
I thought we absolutely hashed that one out.

2166
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,500
I don't see any landowners or any kind of voice or electronic devices pointing anywhere.

2167
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,860
I hear big long periods of silence and I realize it's just a humming in my own brain.

2168
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,120
America's already been destroyed.

2169
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:33,940
You see?

2170
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:34,660
See what I mean?

2171
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,560
It's like a voice is talking in your head.

2172
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,080
America's already been destroyed.

2173
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:38,960
Isn't it?

2174
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,120
It's like a voice is talking in your head.

2175
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,360
You can't make a hair or tail of what you're hearing.

2176
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,500
You can't say it's a real person or it's some disembodied voice that you can hear.

2177
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,580
The transmitters are in your teeth, Bob.

2178
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,160
You can't get away from the transponder.

2179
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,200
You are the transponder.

2180
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:59,000
You've got to pull all your teeth, Bob.

2181
00:48:59,200 --> 00:48:59,800
That's what I did.

2182
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,740
Don't you know your body is a radio receiver?

2183
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,120
That hat's a mess.

2184
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,520
And it looks mighty fine on you.

2185
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:07,620
Pointless. Purposeless.

2186
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,760
The silent radio.

2187
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,460
Radio. It's the happening sound.

2188
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,680
Radio. It's what makes the world go round.

2189
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,040
Radio. Radio.

2190
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:25,140
Yes, radio. The miracle of the age.

2191
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,920
On air, land, and sea.

2192
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:30,080
You better do as you are told.

2193
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,840
You better listen to the radio.

2194
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,140
Radio. Radio.

2195
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,600
Um, uh, I trust you.

2196
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,300
Elvis has left the building.

2197
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,280
Yes, he left a long time ago.

2198
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,140
Thank you, Mr. Marconi.

2199
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:50,420
Now, I've about had it with all this unnecessary, irrelevant sound, jackhammers and pile drivers,

2200
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,160
uh, horrible groaning and shrieking of the, uh, mechanism.

2201
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,500
The slaves in the fields working for us now.

2202
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,740
I slept through that part.

2203
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,520
It's hard to sleep through it when it's a foot away from your head.

2204
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,200
Friendly singing as I pass by their quarters.

2205
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:06,640
Uh...

2206
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,280
Many of the Earth's men have made good slaves. Fine slaves.

2207
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,400
Yes.

2208
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,580
Some are rebellious.

2209
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,320
Make X Day your summer destination. There's a beach party every Wednesday.

2210
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,660
Uh, so, um, make sure...

2211
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,660
There'll be a beef parlor in the basement. Don't forget about that, Dr. Howell.

2212
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,980
The basement? You mean the...

2213
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,420
The beef park in the basement.

2214
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,660
The Alamo basement?

2215
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,440
Um...

2216
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:36,400
Well, not the year that Santa Anna and his mighty crew brought Davy Cricket and the rest of the fortune hunters to their feet.

2217
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:43,860
And, um, we were talking about, uh, John Wayne and his role in the movie Chisholm a while...

2218
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:45,540
John Wayne was a fad.

2219
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:46,640
Oh, shit.

2220
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,120
His first name was Marion.

2221
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:48,940
Yeah!

2222
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,720
Marion Michael Morrison.

2223
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:51,560
I installed mirrors in his bedroom.

2224
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,840
You installed two-way mirrors in his pad in Brentwood. Yes, I know. Well, uh...

2225
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:06,620
But he was in that movie, uh, Chisholm, which is about John Chisholm, who you know has played a significant role in the Lincoln era.

2226
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:14,560
Lincoln County Land Wars, in which, uh, Billy Bonney, aka The Kid, was such a major player.

2227
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:21,180
He had a notch on his, uh, gun for every man he plugged and sent to me as a major.

2228
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,880
And a bunch of nachos under his belt, because he was a 22-cent...

2229
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,420
So they had to send his friend, Sheriff Pat Garrett, to kill him, just like in that movie.

2230
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,380
You know, you know all about that.

2231
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:40,100
Well, the guy who was the bad guy, who was sitting back there pulling the strings, was John Chisholm, wealthy rancher.

2232
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:46,820
But John Wayne, Marion Michael Morrison, was in a movie where he plays Chisholm as a good guy.

2233
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:57,740
Sort of like an ultra-Republican who is, uh, simply trying to scour the country of these bad influences like The Kid and Garrett and all these Mexicans and so forth.

2234
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:01,920
So, uh, that's the movie Chisholm.

2235
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,280
Hmm.

2236
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:03,760
Yeah.

2237
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,180
Chisholm! John Chisholm!

2238
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,620
Anybody ever see that one?

2239
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,780
Johnny Humor was rebel and he robed to the grave!

2240
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,500
Is that Nick Adams? The Rebel?

2241
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,140
In your mind you thought it was dirty, but man, it's not so dirty.

2242
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:27,560
But after he played the Rebel, Nick Adams went to Toho Studios for his unforgettable role in War of the Gargantuas.

2243
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,040
And he fought Frankenstein!

2244
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:32,380
Yes, in Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed.

2245
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:38,040
You know how Frankenstein got there? Why he became giant and everything?

2246
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,500
Didn't the Nazis dig his heart up out of, uh...

2247
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:47,120
The Nazis took his heart from Frankenstein's original laboratory.

2248
00:52:47,280 --> 00:53:02,040
It was transferred in mid-ocean to a Japanese submarine and taken to the city of Hiroshima where they were just operating on it when there was an unfortunate flash in the sky and sleeting radiation which caused the heart itself to grow.

2249
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:07,200
And it was transferred into a giant jumbo form of Frankenstein monster.

2250
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:12,060
Yeah, it's kind of a Japanese giant baby Frankenstein monster.

2251
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:12,940
Clumped it...

2252
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:13,400
Oh my...

2253
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,400
...Budded off of its own heart.

2254
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,260
Then it fights Baragon too.

2255
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,580
Uh, I mean, uh, you can't ask for more than that.

2256
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:24,940
But the most interesting moment of War of the Gargantuas...

2257
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,460
Wasn't it called Frankenstein Conquers the World?

2258
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,440
Yes, Frankenstein Conquers the World. It's true.

2259
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,100
But War of the Gargantuas was originally conceived as a sequel to this picture.

2260
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,820
Oh, he left.

2261
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:39,760
I'm afraid he didn't care to hear about Toho revisited.

2262
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:40,900
His card ran out.

2263
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:49,820
But you know, the thing is, the Gargantuas in the movie, one of them was supposed to be a descendant of these Frankensteinian giants.

2264
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,220
Oh, I didn't get that.

2265
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:54,320
That's because in the American version that was all cut out.

2266
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,340
But in the original version and in the American version...

2267
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,800
That explains why they're kind of humanoid and Frank...

2268
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,160
Yeah.

2269
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,820
...Japo-Frankensteinian.

2270
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:08,420
The, uh, it starts with a ship going through a store... a cloudy, foggy ocean, you know.

2271
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:10,340
And there's the guy up in the pilot house.

2272
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:15,420
He's wearing a little white hat like Gilligan wore on Gilligan's Island.

2273
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,840
And the skipper also wore one of these hats.

2274
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:26,960
And in fact, the director, Inchiro Honda, while directing Gojira and the second Gojira film known in America as Gigantus the Fire Monster...

2275
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,700
...also wore such a little hat.

2276
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,960
Hey, look on my head, Doctor.

2277
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,700
Well, what do you know about that?

2278
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,400
So, the guy is there. He's sweating. He's piloting the ship through the fog.

2279
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,200
He's wearing a hat and he starts saying,

2280
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,040
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

2281
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,840
And you pan down his body and there's a little tentacle around his ankle.

2282
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,260
And that's why he's saying,

2283
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:46,000
Oh, oh, oh.

2284
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,600
And you pan over the tentacle and it gets larger and larger and it goes out the door.

2285
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:54,580
And then you pan across the deck. It gets larger and larger. It's as thick as a barrel.

2286
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,320
Finally, you pan off the ship.

2287
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,740
And an enormous octopus has grabbed the ship.

2288
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:02,860
S.O.S. We are grabbed by an enormous octopus.

2289
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:11,040
Then suddenly, improbably, up out of the depths rears the big hairy, naugahyde-covered giant who grabs a hold of the octopus.

2290
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,540
And they have a terrific tussle.

2291
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,080
Now he is being attacked by a huge hairy giant.

2292
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,640
But then he trounces the octopus.

2293
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:24,480
But then he turns on the ship and starts to bash and smash the ship.

2294
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,140
And that's the end of that.

2295
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,500
And that's the end of that transmission from sea.

2296
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:31,600
Well, it just gets worse from there, oh best beloved.

2297
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,840
Ladies and gentlemen, especially during the scene which introduces the song,

2298
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,920
The Words Get Stuck in My Throat.

2299
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,820
You may remember that song.

2300
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:40,360
What?

2301
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:42,280
The Words Get Stuck in My Throat.

2302
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,340
Somebody better do the high mic.

2303
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,320
I've only heard the Devo cover.

2304
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,560
Well, that's the song that...

2305
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,060
I've heard Boogie Boy sing that.

2306
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:53,400
It is sung in the War of the Gargantuas at the airport.

2307
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,100
There's a cool airport lounge.

2308
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:59,200
And a lady is singing the song when suddenly a grotesque giant grabs her,

2309
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:03,540
chews her up and spits out her dress which lands with a plop in front of the camera.

2310
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,940
At the end of having sung, The Words Get Stuck in My Throat.

2311
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:08,460
Goodness.

2312
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,180
Yes, you can see this deathless classic of cinema.

2313
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:15,880
The Devo's picked that weird obscure song to cover on...

2314
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,920
It's on their very first album.

2315
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:21,400
It's rare not heard everywhere.

2316
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,720
It's seen in that movie first before Devo ever...

2317
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,420
laid a tentacle on it.

2318
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:26,740
Wow.

2319
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:30,500
Now, Devo should do the Mothra song someday.

2320
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,680
Mosura, Mosura.

2321
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,080
I knew he could do that.

2322
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:35,820
Mosura.

2323
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,120
Mosura.

2324
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,000
Friday Jones could sing that song.

2325
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:39,680
Yes, I know.

2326
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,320
You told me.

2327
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:41,060
It's pretty hot.

2328
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:45,460
You'd think she was too little women about this high.

2329
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:51,720
The Ailinas, the fairies from the land of Mosura.

2330
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,100
Yeah, he's a moth.

2331
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,160
He's a big moth.

2332
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,660
He starts out as a caterpillar.

2333
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:03,900
I thought he was kind of stupid looking even when I was a kid and saw the first Mothra movie.

2334
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:04,840
But he's big.

2335
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,220
He's a big moth.

2336
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:12,800
So don't even turn on a flashlight or this huge moth will come swooping down.

2337
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,640
Crush the life out of you.

2338
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,800
Kill not the moth nor the butterfly.

2339
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,120
For the last judgment draweth nigh.

2340
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,420
Princess, will you know what that means about all the spiders in the bathroom?

2341
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:25,160
Oh, no.

2342
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:26,180
No.

2343
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:31,660
See, the best part about being ruptured by the saucers is that you'll no longer need bathrooms.

2344
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,020
You'll no longer need the Jankum huffing chambers.

2345
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,140
You can still have them if you want them, right?

2346
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:41,020
But you will have the option to use wormholes instead.

2347
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,060
You mean werewands?

2348
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,340
That would be a tight fit.

2349
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,460
I'm not sure what you're getting at.

2350
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,100
You remember that Stephen King novel about...

2351
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:58,560
About the guys who are off in the woods and they can't go to the toilet and horrible worms are investigating their nether regions and...

2352
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:09,080
The program is coming to a close, but we've been talking about cosmic stuff all night and that just made me think of the classic song by the Toilet Bowl Cleaners who I think need to play next day one of these days.

2353
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:09,900
You should contact them.

2354
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:10,880
They should.

2355
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:14,320
Because they will teach us how to poop into a wormhole.

2356
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:17,100
Yeah, and poop water towel could open for the toilet bowl cleaners.

2357
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:17,220
Yeah.

2358
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,660
Too bad that you didn't think about that before.

2359
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:24,560
Yeah, and it's upon us, like the Philistines on Samson.

2360
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,940
So thank you very much for being guests on my program tonight, fellas.

2361
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:33,180
Oh yeah, sure. I hope we're able to clear up some of the popular misconceptions.

2362
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,060
The pleasure was ours.

2363
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,760
And we'll be broadcasting from the Saucers next week, of course.

2364
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:47,260
And we'll be doing Bobcasts also from the meeting place and campground itself, even from the landing field.

2365
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,240
Well, those are pre-recorded shows.

2366
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:55,240
More information can be found since only about three people ever show up for those.

2367
00:58:55,240 --> 00:59:00,100
Okay, I was just trying to keep up the mystique, but you now blew it.

2368
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,300
Well, I'm sorry, because it's the visible show.

2369
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:06,720
Yeah, more information can be found at subgenius.com.

2370
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,100
It's educational.

2371
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,380
And we suggest you go there right now.

2372
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,960
Well, we're not suggesting that. That would be a call to action.

2373
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:17,140
Oh, okay. Take that back. Zip it.

2374
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:18,180
But...

2375
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,100
It is out there. It's one of those things that's out there.

2376
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,520
It's educational. It's not prurient.

2377
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,540
So we've got a special episode of Crap Radio coming up next here.

2378
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,200
That's prurient.

2379
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:34,820
It's a thing that if you're interested, you can go. Just like the Starwood Festival. If you're interested, you can go there and read about it.

2380
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,640
There is a lot of information out there about these festivals that a lot of people...

2381
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,420
StarwoodFestival.com

2382
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:45,980
But a lot of you guys are going to continue in your benighted ignorance.

2383
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:52,260
Because you won't make these simple investigations which are made so easy by today's electronic culture.

2384
00:59:52,680 --> 01:00:04,340
There are things that you'll never find online, such as knowing that the Starwood Festival is the way that I met Reverend Stang and the way that Reverend Stang met me.

2385
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:08,680
A lot of really timeless love stories have sprung out of these...

2386
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,120
The virtuous pagans.

2387
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:13,620
Yeah. Come on, baby. Let's make out.

2388
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,760
And have some more special pale ale.

2389
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:20,600
Oh, Senator, my breath is not good enough for me.

2390
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:21,260
That is beyond the pale.

2391
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:26,960
Yes, this is actual archival footage of the love song of J. Alfred Stang.

2392
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,440
J. Fred Stang.

2393
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,940
This is how it first went down, folks.

2394
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:38,120
You know, it's true. Women like a bad boy. And there was no boy better at that time.

2395
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,520
Yes, yes. Women do like a bad boy.

2396
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:41,680
And there he is.

2397
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,960
The baddest fellow of all.

2398
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:47,300
Is that Leroy Brown?

2399
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:50,340
Mm-hmm. And Ivan Stang.

2400
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,820
Yeah, I'm not a nerd. I'm a bad...

2401
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,680
He's a bad, bad boy.

2402
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,540
I'm a man. M-A-N. Man.

2403
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,660
Don't shoot me. I'm a man.

2404
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,420
I'm not a nerd. I'm a cool, bad guy.

2405
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:05,480
Oh, I'm not a bad wizard. I'm just a bad man, my dear.

2406
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,360
I'm a tough subgenius.

2407
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,420
Yeah, a real tough subgenius.

2408
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,440
I... Bob gives me...

2409
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,320
The strength of my abnormality.

2410
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:18,640
You see that pipe? I dare you to knock it out from between my teeth. I double dare you.

2411
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,680
You know, there's the whole concept of famous last words.

2412
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,520
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please. Can't we all just get along?

2413
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:26,760


2414
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,760
You know, there's the whole famous last words, like the last words that somebody says.

2415
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:34,540
There's also the famous last words that somebody hears right before disaster. Like,

2416
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:38,320
I dare you to knock this pipe out of my mouth, coming from Bob.

2417
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:38,980
Yeah. Right.

2418
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:41,660
Famous last words that you hear, not famous last words that you say. Well, it would... Nothing bad about that.

2419
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,920
It would happen to Bob. Bob would get off scot-free in that encounter.

2420
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,300
If I'm wrong, then let lightning strike me dead!

2421
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,520
So if I'm wrong, let lightning strike all of you dead.

2422
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:56,320
And may you all be crushed by a falling meteor right now if I'm mistaken.

2423
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,440
Gee, who could have predicted that?

2424
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,940
Who could have predicted?

2425
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,700
Well, I'm glad you missed me, huh?

2426
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,640
So, uh...

2427
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:09,720
It's been fun, folks. And it's time for us to shuffle off this mortal coil. We'll see you on the other side.

2428
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:15,860
This has been a very special episode of Synesthesia on WCSB. Stay tuned for crap radio.

2429
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:20,040
Thank you again. We'll be back next week. From the Saucers.

2430
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,760
Everybody shuffle. Shuffle off the buckles.
