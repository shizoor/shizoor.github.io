Hey, what you got behind your back there?
What?
Behind your back, right here.
Behind your back, behind your back.
What's this?
I was just catching up on a little reading.
Signs, omens, portents, and charms to ward off...
The subgenius.
Our own subgenius.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
To our portals, the subgenius from ancient horror story tornados.
The hours track will not be broadcast tonight.
In favor of the subgenius.
Commercials.
News reports.
Contest.
Phone calls.
And most importantly, more of the music of the subgenius.
I'm a smoker.
I'm a midnight joker.
Let go, can't don't.
Let go, can't.
Can't come down, gotta be high.
Say you never let me die, die, die.
One more time, but just a little try.
You know how much I love you when I'm high, high, high.
I can be sweet, but I'm better when I'm bad.
And I can be a hippie when I'm mad, mad, mad.
Gotta be high with a twinkle in my eye.
Listen to the music on my high, high, high.
Can't come down, gotta stay high.
What'll I do without my high, high, high?
Life's too fast, I need a lot of slack.
Gotta get the piggies off my back, back, back.
I'm a smoker.
I'm a smoker.

I'm a smoker.
I'm a smoker.






I'm a smoker.
I can be sweet, but I'm better when I'm bad.
And I can be a hippie when I'm mad, mad, mad.
I want to be a hippie and I want to get goat.
I want to be a runaway god to leave hope.
I want to be a hippie and I want to get goat.
I want to be a runaway god to leave hope.
I want to get high.
I want to get high.
When you head thunder, don't run under a tree, just walk in the rain and get stoned with me.
Now I want us to sunbathe, now I want us sun to death, all the kids want us to sunbathe, all the kids want sun to death.
This generation rules the nation with vision.
Music and some refood and vlog, sounds to really make you rub and scrub.
Slam, blam, blam, blam, blam, blam, blam, blam.
Bum, blee, blee, blee, blee, blee, blee, blee, blee, bum.
I said, pass the dutchie by the left hand side.
Pass the dutchie by the left hand side.
Roll another blunt.
Yeah.
Oh, good.
La, la, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta.
Ew.
La, ta, ta, ta, ta.
Just getting high.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
I'm getting stoned.
And what's wrong with that?
The president seems to be too fine.
I've got ecstasy.
I've got cancer.
Wait, wait.
I've got ecstasy.

I smoke two joints in the morning.
I smoke two joints at night.
I smoke two joints in the afternoon.
It makes me feel all right.
I smoke two joints in time of peace and two in time of war.
I smoke two joints because I smoke two joints.
And then I smoke two more.
I smell dope.
I smell dope.
I smell dope.
I'm smelling dope.
I smell dope.
I smell dope.
I smell dope.
I smell dope.

I'm smelling dope.
I smell dope.
Let's go get some fast cooking.
Let's go get some fast cooking.
Let's go get some fast cooking.
Someone keeps saying I'm insane to complain about a round trip ticket when it's all gonna end.
Well, I believe anything that ain't nice when you got Rippin' Striddle and the Jada device.
Just watch the face smiling there in the dark.
Burn all your money when they decimate the Taylor Park.
Yo, I can't do this.
Samper's so genius.
I'm so genius, baby.
So why don't you kill me?
Oh, look, a pantyhose.
You're so genius.
I'm so genius, baby.
So why don't you kill me?
Flesh-fried sauces in a Bobby Ken nightmare.
Stock fists pounding down the door of the world.
Cause one's gotta rant and the other's gotta brag.
Bob's on some window painting, Connie's on the rag with the radio shows.
And the backstage blowjobs.
Can't get it right.
I've been invited to the first week.
What's the fuck?
Burn to death like a Buddhist priest.
Yes, men starving at the subgenius feast.
And it's all for those who fulfill their fate.
Trade the cash for the pills for the bodies for the hate.
And the time is a piece of crap.
Falling down the toilet with Bob's hand on the handle.
Samper's so genius.
I'm so genius, baby.
So why don't you kill me?
I'm a frog.
I'm a noob.
You lost.
Samper's so genius.
I'm so genius, baby.
So why don't you kill me?

Semper Subgenius, dear friends,
by Phineas Narco.
Reverend Phineas Narco.
And he could do it, after all.
And friends, you can get more

He's part of a group

And that's national, one word,

Before that drugged up collage,
God, what kind of a show is this?
Anyway, that was put together
by our friend Soso Dada.
Reverend Soso Dada,
who lives in New York currently,
I think.
Oh, we have all sorts of fun
and games and tapes
and Fernanden and Elie Mer
cut-ups, which were in there
and which will continue to be in here
and in all shows.
And Lone Storm Cowboys
and Dave is here.
And Princess We Are Doe.
Hi, how are you?
Queen of all the UFOs.
And even Potter Nostril is here.
Good to see everyone out there listening.
Potter Nostril, who is
usually not in the...
in the studio,
but is our point man out at Brushwood
where we drill
for the end of the world.
And we prompt...
Next day coming up soon.
Pump, pump, pump.
Pump, pump, pump.
We prompt the jackass muscle.
We make them think without brains.
We teach them to see without eyes,
to smell without nostrils.
Even though Potter Nostril is...
And to live where there is
nothing to live for.
What is that?
Why, that's your own...
Home, home, town, USA.
Home, sweet home.
We're back at...
It's like a suppository
made of lawnmowers.
And lung tissue.
Let's not forget good old
wholesome lung tissue.
What powers our lawnmowers?
Hard as...
You been smoking lunk again?
No, I've been drinking...
Lung junk?
I've been smoking a little bit of lung junk,
but mostly I'm drinking Abyssinian peas water.
Really?
Yes.
It imparts wisdom.
Oh, no, you've missed your fancy pants.
Oh, I guess it's going to be absinthe next.
Oh, yeah.
I'm an absinthe smith.
Yeah, well...
Friends, welcome to another Hour of Slack.
This is Hour of Slack 982.
That's how many there have been.
Including a few reruns.
And this is a rerun of something
that happened only one or two seconds ago.
So it's almost like it's fresh.
Like...
And I wish we had some fresh jokes
or gags or gimmicks to tell you about.
All right, okay, we'll try.
But unfortunately, it's just the same old...
Something about Amish...
Yes, yes, yes, well...
An Amish vibrator.
That's a big crescendo for a bunch of nothing, ain't it?
Is there something?
I can't hear it.
But isn't nothing everything anyway?
Well, before we forget, we should mention,
because we will forget,
that we will mention the subgenius
upcoming event.
Such as the revival at Detroit.
The rhythmic undulation of the book.
March 19th.
We can't recommend that anyone go to that
for legal reasons.
Of course.
But it will be happening.
Right.
In Detroit.
In Detroit, March 19th,
with the amino acids,
who really are a man who is...
An acid.
The Christ punchers who do...
Actually punch.
Yes.
And Reverend Carter LeBlanc and yours.
Who does blunts.
Blunts.
Truly Reverend Stang.
I'm sure you could come along if you wanted to.
If I wanted to be abused like a baby
and touched and fondled the wrong way.
Now, on the other hand...
And you meant to speak like this.
Well, this ain't Catholicism, Dave.
I could be fondled the right way.
I mean, I'm not saying it can't be done.
Are you... Is that an invitation?
It's a form of open invitation.
Fondle me how you dare.
But if you do not fondle me correctly,
you'll probably get the wrong sort of information back.
Well, we can do that.
We can do that.
We can do that on 8X day,
the eighth scheduled end of the planet,
according to Dobbs' prophecy.
And they keep letting us down, but maybe they won't.
There's gonna be 3X days, actually.
There'll be a Tex Day in Texas.
Instead of 7-5-0-5, it will be taking place on 5-7-0-5,
May 7th in Texas, in Austin.
Outside of Austin, in a hippy-dippy campground
run by... well, subgeniuses.
Dabsters in the...
Wicked bellies.
Yeah, wicka-billies.
Oh, wicka-billies.

Wicka-billies.
Wicka-billy.com would actually be the place to find out about Tex Day.
I'll see you down there, partner.
When was the last time you had a steamin' hot bowl of
Wolf Brand Habba-Frap Zippy Lops?
Well, now that's too long.
Yeah, that's a long time.
Too long.
Then there's X Day at Brushwood,
the weekend before July 5th,
building up to July 5th,
when the saucers will arrive and rupture up the dues-paying subgeniuses,
leaving you, dear listener, behind.
Frying in your own fat,
like bacon in the pan,
because you put off that, uh...
Well, we can't, uh, solicit here on the air,
because this is a religious radio broadcast, friends.
We're here to praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
And his master!
His master's on the dark side.
Yes.
Yes.
The dark path of least resistance
proved to be the more powerful form of slack.
The tinky people.
Dark slack had more power than good slack,
or light slack.
Slack light.
Dark energy.

It is dark energy, Slack.
Hardcore slack.
Triple X slack, baby.
It is made directly from dark energy,
the force in the universe which we've yet to find a use for,
a way of concurrently massing to perform activities called work.
And work is what we want to avoid.
And...
We want to create slack with this dark energy.
Yep.
Well, they say that dark energy and dark matter comprise most of the known universe.
And that is most of our adenoids and our atoms.
And most of our embryonic tissues.
I mean our intestines.
That's so dark down there.
And most of your paycheck, Dave, will likewise be in dark money.
Yes.
A new subgenius invention we used to...
They have to make all the denominations.
I think they say.
And most of the people that Paternostril knows are in the dark.
Well, that's why they need to follow his nose.
Paternostril and his great third nostril...
What is he?
Actually makes mushrooms in his own house.
...which moves around on his body.
Sometimes it's in the center of his forehead like there's a...
I don't know where they're supposed to be, but...
Then they go under your nose, on your upper lip, slide around down your back.
What we need is an alignment close to the solar plexus.
If we do not have this, I'm afraid the poor man may die before triple, quadruple, 8x day.
But he can be healed at 8x day, friends.
Because some of the bands that will be there include Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Mondo Retardo Band.
Pactin Salt.
The Amino Acids Man.
Pactin Baked Bean Gravy.
Smokin' Stein.
Smokin' Stein.
The Drunk...
Well, we're going back to the Universal Monster of yesteryear.
The Rummy.
The Rummy.
Yeah.
Who else?
Crackula.
And the Vapyrs.
The Vapyrs.
That's the...
Doc Fropp knows about that.
That was the Phantom of the Froppra.
And did we say Crankin' Stein?
Yes, you certainly did.
Crankin' Stein.
No, that was Smokin' Stein.
Smokin' Stein.
Yeah, there's some litigation going on.
Oh, and the Creature from the Smack Lagoon.
Creature from the Smack Lagoon.
And the Hunch...
Smack.
The Hunch Slack of Brushwood.
I've got a hunch that you're kind of fabricating a lot of that list of bands.
You said Semi, Erstwhile, and the Tettles or something, and the Smallberries are going
to be there.
You mentioned also a lot of groups that I didn't think were real names.
Like...
You got Slackzilla.
Slackzilla.
Slackzilla.
Right.

You failed to mention Slackzilla.
That's a real...
Well, that's because that's a real band and we couldn't get Slackzilla.
Oh, and then they couldn't get them, they sure.
They were a little bit too expensive for us.
You know, we actually have tried to pay Mark Mothersbaugh, who is a dues-paying subgenius.
We offered to pay his way, but...
Plus $35.
He was too busy devolving in Hollywood, I guess.
Yeah.
We did have one of the members of GWAR come to X Day, and of all times, to be doused
with fake blood, it happened to him while he was on vacation.
He got a dip in the pig, huh?
It was an accident.
He happened to be under the World Globe when, like, you smashed it with his sword of justice
and the fake blood poured out.
And who'd it pour out on?
Like, one guy who gets fake blood dumped on him on his day job.
Well, they use real pig blood in GWAR.
They did use real pig blood.
They don't use fake blood, not prostituting blood.
No, no.
In the Church of the Subgenius, we use real blood and sperm and viscera and spit and sweat
and...
All of your precious bodily fluids, Bad Drake.
Not just those ones.
We need all of your precious bodily fluids.
P-A-R-E-F.
Must mix them.
P-A-R-E-F.
So precious, Bad Drake.
P-A-R-E-F.
What makes them so precious?
P-A-R-E-F.
The tiny value, the increments of wealth encapsulated into each molecule, your cells, look.
They're actually growing money, Bad Drake.
Sit down.
Yes, I'm afraid you're not going to be able to take the shark.
It's been going on for years, my dear friend.
Here, let me put my hand on your knee for a second.
No.
Yes, eh?
No.
Let me put my hand on your shoulder here, Bad Drake.
Dave.
Bad Drake, let me put my upper lip on your forehead, Bad Drake.
He uses these skits as an excuse to get fresh with Princess Wee.
To forget what I was talking about.
Bad Drake, your bodily fluids will be the template for a new mankind.
We shall take them.
We shall reform them.
We shall re-engineer.
We shall mutagen them.
Then we shall bake and shake them.
We shall make them.

Until a new man is created.
See, if you wait long enough, he just cracks up.
It just dissolves like that.
Yeah, it has to.
You have to believe that something for nothing can come your way, my friend.
Because even if it doesn't, if you did believe it, you'll think it did.
And that's the miracle of religion.
It's a miracle.
It is a milagro.
The milagro of Bob.
And, oh, other bands.
Other bands that will be at X Day.
The Mind Losers.
Popeye and the Shrimp People.
Uh-huh.
The stupid bleeped-up teenage drunks.
Oh, well, let me say that again.
The stupid fucked-up teenage drunks.
The guy with the surgical scar who claims he used to be on Johnny Carson but nobody can see him and he can go back and forward into the future as a carrot.
The out-of-minders.
Yep.
Will be playing.
Can't remember them.
And, mister, you don't know who you're dealing with.
Well, you don't.
You really don't want to mess with him.
Clearly, clearly don't want to.
He's kind of a jerk.
Know what I'm saying?
Know what you're saying.
Know what I'm saying?
Know what you're saying.
Know what you're saying.
Know what you're saying.
Know what you're saying.
Know what you're saying.


I don't.
Well, what about the, I heard now people like to make jokes about garden gnomes and having sex with them and stuff like that.
You know, and this is really passe talking constantly.
But I heard that you're actually going to have an installation artist there who's going to make garden giants that you can have sex with.
No, you got mixed up.
That's Burning Man.
So there's actually a huge giant that goes around sexing everyone at Burning Man?
No, we have this little puppet that we pretend is a big giant that goes around sexing everyone.
But it actually has squirt vesicles and little tiny sweat drips from its forebrow.
I mean, at least they said it did.
Well, yeah, until the stuff runs out.

It's radio controlled.
Well, it's got a real tiny old gland, doesn't it?
I mean, it's got a real like.
Parts of it are alive, but mostly it's a puppet.
So, geez, man.
I mean, where are we now?
Let me put it this way.
You can catch a disease from it.
Well, we're on our way to ecstasy.
You can catch a disease from a puppet nowadays.
Yeah.
And, geez, man, the world.
Yeah.
Oh, oh, actually, we need.
I'm not a victim.
I'm not a victim.
We need to take a break for PR news, I believe.
From PR news in Washington, I'm part of the problem, not the solution.

Federal officials are bracing for another shortage of roadside bombs during the flu season that begins next fall.
Senator Edward Kennedy says doctors and hospitals need to make better use of the Nazi concentration camp at PR news.
He spoke today at a Cleveland concentration clinic where thousands of patients have been murdered.
Kennedy's getting worse.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has condemned and killed at least 67 people in an attack south of PR's PR news, Washington.
I still don't know.
What's happened in Washington?

Amid continuing insurgent threats, Iraqi leaders say they have paid $57 for a draft course today in Baghdad.

The criminal trial against PR News continues in the world's fifth largest brewery.
This is PR News.
Okay, now you can sing along.
Or bite my fry.
I went to a store.
When I got the gauze and took care of the rectal bleeding, I changed the bumps on my head.
And I knew that the electrodes in my neck were calling me.
How do you change the bumps on your head, Dave?
Well, you just focus your third eye.
Okay.
Well, actually, you have to focus your third nostril, I'm sure.
Anytime I see it, my heart starts bumping and bumping.
You focus. You think of your third nostril as a transmitter of energy.
Not as a receiver of sigh olfactory and things like that.
And concentrate on the bumps.
Oh, glory.
But it comes.
Colors for which she sighs.
She sighs.

I respect her so well.
You do?
Yes.
She's so worthy of your urethra.
Oh, gooey, gory.
She's worthy of your urethra, I was worried.
And I know that we don't want to worry about that.
What was that?
She's worthy of more than your respect.
S'more?
She's worthy of your tinkles and your periwing.
What was that poorly recorded band we just heard?
Oh, that was Carlsbad and the Eskimos.
Punbo and the Tardos.
Punbo and the Tartars.
And they appear with raw meat.
No, it was Lonesome or Mad Cow Pie Dwayne.
And the Beachland Ball Rushers.
No, Mondo's Retardo Band.
Oh, right.
Right.
They were at the Beachland Bull Rushers.
Ballroom.
Yes, being waited to be picked up by old Pharaoh.
In Cleveland.
And said Moses came by, picked him up, put him in his sack, drove him home, and made a sandwich out of them.
Well, sometimes.
An open-faced, yeah, that's a bald-faced sandwich.
Is that part of that spooky religious stuff you guys are into?
Yeah, you've got to stop with this spooky religious stuff, man.
I mean, they were having a conversation last night on East 127th.
You know the old house over there?
With the top windows broken?
Yeah, the top windows broken out and stuff.
I guess there were like 35 people jamming on philosophical rap.
You know, they're just like laying there.
Oh, God, man.
Just think of this, you know.
That can't take, you know.
Don't continue.
And then your dad did it.
It's like, but God, that's not as bad a time to do that.
You know what I mean?
I used to do that when I was a kid.
Yeah.
I thank God.
I'm surprised I'm still alive.
Well, most of these, I guess, people have serious diseases and don't mind discussing that either.
Well, you know, some people feel that they...
They have a rule book that they can go by.
Isn't it always so?
And then you can go by the rule book.
The book of the subgenius is still available.
You may pass it.
It's the book to go by.
Yes, and leave wind as you go.
Now, some people are into philosophy.
Some people are into religions.
Some are into science.
These are all false paths.
And they're all like divided up into...
They're okay for a while.
Yeah, and they're divided up into marketable names.
Like there's hardcore philosophy.
You know, there's rap...
Philosophy light.
There's dub philosophy.
Yeah.
You know.
Yeah.
You got a little something for everybody and you get what you pay for.
Right.
Cheap crap.
You can watch the philosophy time.
It lasts a while.
The philosophy network on cable.
Wrecks your liver.
Yeah.
Just sit there and be ruined by it.
Sure.
Go ahead and be a philosopher if you want to wreck your life.
Yeah.
Look in the yellow pages.
How many philosophers you see in the yellow pages, Mr. Smarty Pants?
Okay.
All right.
Granted, there are more now than there used to be because of, you know, the conditions.
The government.
You know, I mean, I think it's a false philosophy.
There you go.
I think it's a false...
Well, no.
False marketing philosophy.
Philosophy is such a good drink.
It tastes so good.
It blows up in your face just like all philosophy does.
That's right.
It pops in your pocket.
They're all self-verifying and that's the drawback.
Except for the Church of the Subgenius.
It's constantly Bob verified.
Nothing else is real.
It's a dream, baby.
It's all a...
Ride the snake.
A fabulous dream.
Focus on Bob.
If you can just lock on to that face, man.
That cute little face.
Ride.
It's cute as a bag of snakes.
That's a face.
A top star.
Not a face.
I can't get it up with my head.
I can't sleep anymore.
I can't dream.
Don't you understand what's happened to me?
That pipette is in my head.
I can't get it out.
Time for PR news.
From PR news in Washington.
I'm against PR news in Washington.
An OPEC committee is recommending the oil cartels stick to its current polio vaccine.
The decision could heighten U.S. consumer consumption.
The government is making a decision.
They have a lot of concerns about PR news.
The Gates Foundation is giving ten religious and ethnic groups to PR's PR news.
Meanwhile today is the second day of Iraqis flying non-stop for the first time in more than 55 years.
Thousands of people in Russia have been protesting the loss of PR news in the heavily fortified Washington.
Now let's go get cleaned up.
If you're going to storm Kim Jong-il's palace single handed we have to make you a complete soldier in very little time.
How are we gonna do this?
I think I know just what we need.
Once remind everyone of what's going on.
And with every shot show a little improvement.
To show it all would take too long.
That's called a montage.
Girl, we want a montage.
And anything if you want to go.
From just a beginner to a pro.
You need a montage.
Even Rocky had a montage.
Montage.
Montage.
Montage.
Always fade out in a montage.
Montage.
If you fade out it seems like more time has passed in a montage.
If you fade out it seems that more time has passed in a montage.
Can we briefly describe the encapsulated shots that floated by in those listeners' minds.
That they couldn't actually see in their pre-temporal lobes.
Was that that Irishman you were talking about?
Oh, the guy who put the montage together.
Yes.
The series of shots.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That now sounds stupid now.
But anyway.
It is a name, I guess.
It's like Carlo on oil, you know.
Cover him with dissolves and let him go.
Well, he was wiped anyway, wasn't he?
Yeah.
Oh, God.
That is.
Yeah.
Well.
That was from Team America.
And that brilliant computer animated movie, as my dad described it.
I said, no, I think those are really marionettes.
That's dad.
He goes, no, they just put the strings there to make it look like marionettes.
It's really computer animated.
No, they're not married.
Can't you tell?
Damn.
Damn.
It's marination.
Super marination.
Super marination.
The original technique used in Supercar.
Mm hmm.
And some of those other.

Oh, you remember Speed Racer?
Thunderbirds.
The effect he uses is based on the bird.
No, no, no.
Thunderbirds.
I'm sorry.
I got a little spooked up.
But how many.
So how many rock songs are there that glorify the work of the.





The work of the editor, which I, as a collage radio show editor, must point out.
But how many famous editors can you name?
Well, like maybe we could do a rap song.
Name one.
Perry.
Perry.
Yeah.
Perry.
No, no, no.
Great Caesar's ghost.
I'm talking about video film editors.
Perry Noid.
No, that's Avita.
Yeah, right.
Perry Mason.
The Queen of Norway.
No, Christ.
Actually, film editors don't miss the final cut, which the.
Uh.
Director often does.
Well.
No.
Yes, the director often does.
That glorified my career more than just anything.
And memory editing.
There's a movie about memory editing.
Unfortunately starring Robin Williams, but try to get past that.
It's a good movie anyway.
These are personal opinions and are not.
The hollow laughter.
The sounds of people with deviated sinuses.
Dee Dee Allen was the famous editor who edited Final Cut.
No.
Final Cut.
He had the deviated septum to begin with?
Her.
Dee Dee.
Dee Dee Allen.
She's one of the only well-known film editors.
Editors work behind the scenes.
We editors are like, we're the ones who really keep the whole thing together.
You're like the covert guys of the operation.
We keep the universe going.
We keep the dark matter separated from the regular matter, the anti-matter.
What a holy task, too.
And no one surrounds them.
No one suspends their disbelief for them.
Oh, the directors and movie stars get all the, you know, and the gurus, really.
Oh, Bob.
Everybody knows who Bob is.
How many people can name the sacred scribe?
He's a great guy.
How many can name the sacred janitor?
I can.
Hood's Foods and the Cabbage Rolls.
Well, sure, you can, because you're a hand.
Well, let's just stand.
That's your secret name when you're under some day job.
You said I was a sacred maid?
You said I was a sacred super maintenance guy.
Look, you know.
Not the janitor.
You said I was the super.
Okay, right.
Super.
You're the super.
No, you're right.
You're right.
Okay, right.
Because, I mean, who, you know, makes sure the boiler's going and keeps your freaking
radiator on?
That's right.
Subtracting our news, in Washington, I'm keeping dangerous weapons out of the hands
of Pope John Paul for a few more days.
The pope felt well enough to participate inside a nightclub after a bomb was found there.
Workers found the device next to his bed where hundreds of same-sex couples are stationed.
From Kansas City, PR state-run media reported that police were searching for the pope in
Washington.
Well.
Huh?
Eh?
No, that's Slim Myopia and Jerry Waxdorf, wasn't it?
Dr. Sinister, you know better than to mutter what you're saying.

You're supposed to mutter away from the microphone.
You're supposed to mutter way off.
Mutter on mic, dear.
If you're really cool, you put a coffee cup around your mouth and then mutter.
I did not realize that I was in on this conversation.
Well, you are now, baby.
What's really pathetic is that I often recognize the voices of those people doing the PR.
Well, yeah, they also work for NPR.
Yeah, yeah, they've been cut up.
No.
That was the work of Fernando Ndelema, that old cut-up.
He's another cutter.
That's what they call us editors.
Altspotspots.
The media editors.
Cutters.
Great Caesar's Ghost.
He's got his coffee cup.
It hasn't been fully prepared yet.
That's the high-tech level.
He's been preparing it over there by the garbage can for moments now.
You know, I created a little diaphragm in the bottom of this paper coffee cup by merely
placing my keys through it seven times.
And now you see that it works to transmute his voice into this fantastic altered thing.
And if you're not afraid of the way a juicer's contaminated the coffee cup, you can't do
anything about it.
You can't even tell it's contaminated even the sides of your head.
You can turn it around like this and make it sound like you're in a dark tunnel.
Who drank out of that coffee cup before you, Dave?
You don't know where that thing's been, do you?
Geronimo!
Now, speaking of high-tech, we were watching some really old Our Gang movies.
And notice that the level of technology used by those poor children in the Our Gang series
was very similar to that used by subgeniuses at, say, Brushwood.
That is sophisticated.
During that same thing.
The one we were watching...
They were struggling with some evil bootleggers who were trying to chase the kids away from
their camping trip.
I like a dusty area, kids.
And those kids used the tools, the weapons, the weapons of mass destruction that are available
to poor kids out in the woods fighting bootleggers, such as...
Pork kids?
No, poor...
You're talking about poor people again.
Little Pobucker, Punk, the Our Gang, Spanky, you know, Alfalfa, Chubby.
Actually, this was an older one.
Oh, yeah.
It was called Bunkie instead of Spanky.
That was well before Smacky.
It was before Buckwheat.
Weezer.
It was with Weezer.
Weezer was in it.
Weezer.
Anyway, I noticed that back in them days...
Dr. Pankitch, I remember a podcast that you'll remember.
Back in them days, you didn't need your Home Alone, McCulkey Culkin.
All you needed was a beehive, a skunk, a porcupine, as Princess Wee pointed out.
A porcupine.
They didn't show that in this Our Gang thing, but that's another child weapon.
Oh, there's a skunk out there.



A stick, as Patronostro pointed out.
Or a bat, which they used.
Baseball bat.
And there's always an old, open, rusty bear trap.
In any forest, you're going to find an old bear trap, which you can use to foil the bootleggers.
There are some bloody old bear traps in the studio right now.
That's not as uncommon as an item as you think, Stan.
It's not as uncommon as an item as you think.
Well, the industrial bands use those for percussion, don't they?
They also use it for a quick snap.
But they use skeletons and cars and explosions for percussion.
And for neutering.
Art these days is just weird.
I mean, call me old fuddy-duddy.
I just don't get some of this stuff.
Why do they have to neuter themselves in a bear trap?
Because everything's neutral to begin with.
Reanimating corpses and saying, well, that's art now.
They're not doing anything special.
You're just shuffling around.
They call that art.
Yeah, yeah, watch it.
You sit there and you watch the plug-in.
And it's all found art, too.
Because most of the corpses are garbage.
And everybody, you know, that's not real art, man.
To me, real art is something that goes into the back, you know, the behind part of your eyes.
And tickles the little swirly things.
And makes the goo-goo gravy start going.
Next thing you know, you're befundling, you're vomiting.
You can't control your carrots or you can't, you know, you get swollen.
I've been there.
And that's what, you know, that's art.
That is art.
It stirs the soul.
Yes.
And it...
Personally, I have a theory.
I have a theory that art is nothing but a dysfunctional result of millions and millions of years of smiths chipping away at Flint to make stone hand axes.
Through one procreative thousand generation?
That's pretty much all guys did for about a hundred thousand years was chop at these rocks.
They couldn't really talk or sing or do much of anything.
But they could make these stone axes.
They found, you know, you can find.
They found stone hand axes all over the place.
And yet human skulls are very rare from that stone age period.
And yet you can find so many stone skulls around.
Because they didn't keep their hand axes.
They would make the axe when they needed it to clobber the animal and skin it.
Then they'd drop it right there when they were done with it.
They didn't keep the hand axe.
Right.
Too much hand jobbing, animal clobbering, and not enough of the old, you know...
So the smiths and other nearsighted cavemen sat and made things.
All day long chipping rocks together.
As far as I'm concerned, all human endeavor and obsessive compulsive disorder, specifically, and art,
are results of a hog wild stretching of that old instinct of carving hand axes.
We'd be perfectly happy if we were sitting in the dirt on our butts carving hand axes.
But no, instead we gotta go,
Oh, I'm Christo.
I'm gonna hang a giant parachute all across the ocean.
Oh, I'm an artist.
I'm Picasso.
I'm a...
Look at me.
I paint dirty pictures and sell them for a million dollars.
I'm beloved by all humanity.
Look at my use of color and depth.
I'm a freaking genius.
Love me, love me.
Ah, it's ego.
It's madness.
It's nothing but a misfired stone axe carving instinct.
That's gone...
Gone awry.
Yeah, it's gone awry.
And one day...
Time control must always go awry.
One day, one of these befuddled axe artists accidentally discovered a pyramid.
And then if you put the tiny little, like, weasel eye on the top,
the juices will drip down to the mess below.
And a priest will make an incantation.
And then, you know, you know the sauce is right.
And, you know, you know, work versus slack.
That's it.
Here you go again.
Obsessive compulsive behavior that can't be...
I still like...
I still feel like I'm chipping rocks to get laid.
Well, you actually are.
Isn't that true, Wee?
I'm basically...
I'm basically still...
He actually is chipping rocks to get laid, though.
Isn't that true, Wee?
I mean, he's got a bunch of rocks laying...
He has to produce a really nice one.
To keep a roof over my head.





To keep the respect of the society,
just like my ancestor did for a hundred billion trillion years of toil.
So Wee actually has to check your rocks...
But Bob paid!
Before allowing you to perform quite a...
Bob died and Bob paid and Bob sold again and again and again
to justify our sins so that we would no longer have to do that.
We don't longer have to chip rocks to get laid and get paid.
Thanks to Bob,
we can sit back...
Allow him.
...on our butts and have faith.
That's all we need.
Just faith.
We don't have to work.
We don't have to toil.
We just have to...
We don't have to spin.
We're not like some flowers.
We do have to bend.
Or some...
Anything like that.
And friends.
We're not in a disassociation.
When was the last time you gave to Bob?
Disassociation?
No, we're perfectly well to sit where we are and be well.
Be well misunderstood.
That's all fine.
Well and good.
And I'll be well damned if I'm going to allow it to continue
because I'm pretty well shot right now.
I'm sorry.
No, you're not.
It's the thyroid problem again.
It makes the eyeball pop out and then I complain.
And then while I'm pushing the eyeball back in my head
and complaining,
then it's on to another problem.
Glandular problem.
But see, at least you're aware of that.
As long as you're aware of it.
Now, you know, that's the first step in making it better, you see.
Right.
I mean, you're conquering it.
Yes, I'm aware of my glandular problems.
I'm completely and totally in tune with my glands.
I owe our rivers and rivulets an ebbing flow.
I owe my glandular jowls.
I'm aware of everything I am.
You know, the plug-in that makes the same noise as that coffee cup costs $170.
Yep.
And much more in some places.
City kids don't know how to make that sound effect with the coffee cup.
They have to use this filter I'm using right now.
And that's $170.
And that's a Transvex, isn't it?
Isn't that a beautiful new Transvex 16,000, which costs the studio a pretty penny.
That's right.
Thanks, listener.
Thank you very much, listener.
Yep.
I hope you consider your money well spent on that little filter.
It makes you sound just like Dave talking to a coffee cup.
Someday we hope to meet you and perhaps even send you a photo of all four of us, three, five, however many we might be at the time,
hugging the tortoise, you know, banging the weasel, and just doing all the stuff we do to animals.
I bet people wonder what you look like, Dave.
I look like one of the animals we bang on.
I bet those listeners are going, what does that guy look like?
I'm fantasizing about what Dave looks like.
I figure he's got real long hair and this gray goatee.
That's probably what Dave sounds like.
Stang sounds like he's kind of fat.
I'm long on scalp.
I think Stang's a real tall, fat guy.
He's almost blind.
I heard that he's blind and he has these visions, and that's where all that stuff comes from.
Well, the blindness comes from the same place, the same ethereal spring that we all drink from.
It's the same place.
It's the same water that's polluting us all.
It causes ejaculation, premature ejaculation.
And it's in the water?
Of course it's in the water.

I've got my Bob blindfold on.
Drink it down.
I'm wearing my Bob blindfold.
I follow him anywhere when I have that thing on.
You're blind to what's going on around you?
By the sound, or by the smoke.
You follow the smell of the Bob's pipe smoke.
Isn't that what makes us all secure and safe in the arms and the legs and necks of Bob?
On the lap, on the bumpy lap of Bob.
Put that blindfold on.
Smooth down those bumps.
Lap of Bob.
The embarrassing lap.
The demanding lap of Bob.
The demented, disturbing lap of Bob.
The distended, swelling lap of Bob.
With more bumps than it should have in the wrong places.
In the groping hands of Bob.
The suffocating, milky egg of Bob's lap.
The inappropriately groping hands of our lord, J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Smelly, gypsy-like lap of Bob.
The confused, irritating, won't-quit-saying-something-about-the-lap-of-Bob-Bob-lap-of-Bob.
Ugh.
Damn.
Oh, this music in the background.
The one I want to mention is the swinging love corpses from their famous Bay Jam mixtapes.
It's delicious.
It is.
It is quite the, you know, it sounds like these guys were actual musicians or something, you know?
They were until, you know.
Oh, Valentine's Day.
We have a love song.
Valentine's Day.
And a new band.
This is a band that I'm going to try to get to come to X Day without paying them like we do with almost all bands.
Just so long as you don't take their secret powers away like you do to most bands.
Tom.
And Joe.
Actually, Reverend Toilet Sucks sent me this CD and he said, I bought this from these guys because I thought you should hear it.
He said that it was his favorite short-duration personal album this month.
And it was these two spaz guys that I guess have been doing spaz music for a long time.
And it kind of reminded me of Captain Beefheart crossed with Captain and Tennille.
And they have a love song on there called Tell Me, which I wanted to play.
Well, you've got time to do it because we need to be told.
Man, these corpses are so great, though.
That's Ray Hay on guitar.
My hands are so icy now.
I've been sitting here in my own urine for the last 45 minutes waiting for a bus or perhaps the MS vehicle to come by for some kind of help.
And I'm stretched out and he's saying some money, a few dollars.
If only I could read that.
Tell me.
You're the only one that loves me.
Tell me your love will never die.
Oh, and tell me you're the only one that I could be.
Tell me.
You'll never lie.
Tell me I'm the only one that you need.
Tell me your needs will never die.
Oh, how to tell me you're the only one that I could be.
Tell me.
Tell me.
You'll never die.
It was raining from the start.
But nobody came from out of the rain.
Tell me.
Tell me you're the only one.

your love

From PR News in Washington, I'm hard for social corporate culture cattle in Washington.
This comes just days after six Canadian cattle announced they were merging.
The move came as sporadic PR's Peter Koch continued.
Our taxpayers are not going to be able to get their money back.
Our citizens and constituents and their families are going to be ignorant and offensive.
The National Transportation Safety Board says this continued PR News.
As soon as you turn your back, everything in the universe snaps itself inside out with a hideous sucking motion.
The only reason you cannot call the world impossible is because it is only through the world that you know the concept of impossibility.
You have been led to believe that it is impossible.
Everyone feels he or she may be the only living consciousness.
But you are in fact the only one for whom this is true.
