And now, the subgenius hour of slack.
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to
is specially designed only to be played on radio station
K-N-O-N
and only in the city of
Dallas, Texas.
Truth is, not everyone gets the picture.
Hoping your time is all time
and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.
Here's your host,
Reverend Ivan Stang and
Pastor Buck Naked.
Ah, yes, dear friends.
And thank you, Reverend Lepo Abernathy
for that amazing introduction tape.
Folks, I'm beat from doing those last two theme shows
and sticking to the themes like a Nazi.
So, we got no theme.
I'm all out of theme.
I'm themed out.
By the way, I hope the beautiful young lady
I met at the convenience store on the way over here
is tuning in.
It's funny, you know, on the way over to this show,
oftentimes I get asked on dates
by these young ladies
that walk back and forth down the street.
Anyway.
So, it's going to be mostly music tonight, dear friends.
The music of...
Well, it's not all going to be subgenius about...
You going to get any Led Zeppelin?
Yeah, we'll be...
Oh, yeah.
As a matter of fact, this will be a back to the 60s show, friends.
Actually, it's all psychedelic music of every variety.
I got to listen for this little piece of music to end here.
But it's going to be a bunch of favorites.
I may not be here next time,
but Reverend Cleve Duncan,
of Boston,
will be in town next weekend, Buck, by the way.
The Del Fuegos will be playing at the Ritz.
I'll be at home.
Their organist, Cleve, a great subgenius preacher,
will be here upon this show.
But for now,
it's going to be mostly music
from the Bulldada Time Control Laboratory archives.
Almost all of this music
is by members of the subgenius church.
A lot of our listeners remember him.
He was on the phone to us last week.
That's right.
He called last week in a state of...
Supreme hormonal agitation.
Right.
What was that line he had?
We can't remember.
About the back door or something like that?
Yeah.
Had old Cleve.
Ooh, yeah.
Well, anyway, that record over there, Buck, is...
By the way, if you are the one who is listening to us,
I'd like to say hi to you,
because just about all of our regular listenership
is down at the Circle A Ranch tonight.
Oh, praise...
Well, that's all the listeners we have, I think.
It's just those 12...
12 people.
But why don't you put on...
Oh, there's a lot more of them that you already have.
Buck, that record over there,
we're going to go quick through songs
and just stop and tell you what they were in between.
But this one, not the first one, Buck,
the last one.
Yeah, this is a record that Cleve did.
This is Reverend Cleve Duncan
sent their first...
Oh, this beautiful friend.
This is the Swinging Areodites
doing...
their renditions of Yesterday.
This show is about styles,
and you'll see what I'm talking about.
This one's...
Oh, callers.
We'll kill callers tonight.
It's 823-7490, friends.
And 801.
And 823-8801.
Now, I'm sure Cleve wouldn't mind us talking over...
this part of the Swinging Areodites
beautiful rendition of the song.
But we're going to cut off here
when he gets into the, really,
the meat of this lovely rendition, folks.
Remember those days
before the radiation,
before fluoridation,
before Tylenol and Gerbers.
Ah, yes.
Yesterday.
Yesterday.
Oh, my God, I've seen so far.
Oh, wait.
Stop, you place a highway.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Suddenly,
when I got half the man I used to be,
there's a shadow waving over me.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Oh, my God.
Yesterday.
Love was such a music.
Game to play.
And now I need a place to hide away.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Let's speed it up, boys.
Oh, wow.
I'm not going to see too far away.
I'm not going to see too far away.

Believe in yesterday.
Ah.
Simb Хuyh.

What else to do
try?
Why?
People here.
I should
Why don't you go back up in the mountain, man?
Find the Paul McCartney guy, bring me the big sleeve
Cause I believe
Oh, such a day I'd have to guide you
And I might have a good way, man
Cause I've been speaking the magic
Of the new-to-country man
Bring me the bongo, man
Hold the time!
One, two, three, two, two, three
Follow me
For me here
You must have beer
I took a spare bottle
I think I'll have another beer
We must hide the fruit
For just for me we believed in more beer
I'm getting fiver
Sour-broth in mine
Cause I smell like sour-broth
Enough of this ethnic crap
How about a little avant-garde free-form jazz
One doesn't go back to 79
One doesn't go back to 79
One can't even be honest

Rich and I know that you understand Really do love the job that you do.
Bob steal, Bob bargain!

Bob's my crotch, Bob's my toothpick, Bob's my brain, Bob's an ugly yellow stain, Bob's a cactus, Bob's an itch, Bob is taking off every stitch, Bob's my master, Bob's my slave, Bob will rob me, Bob will save, Bob's my toaster, Bob's my fridge, Bob's my little sister Mitch,
Bob will cost you, Bob is free, Bob's a watch, and Bob's the key, ensure that Bob Dobbs is the man, who used your leg as a frying pan, if your mind is a jar, you can pour down the sink, and the subgenius church is the missing link, damn it!
Pills to the left of me, pills to...
Right now, before we go anyplace else, I want you to go with me to a special place that I know.
It's a museum, but it isn't an ordinary museum.
It's a very abstract museum in which they show sound paintings.
If you can say that you show sound.
But, I don't see why you can't.
But here we are in this corridor.
Some of the most beautiful works of art are here.
Here's one right here.
This is by a very fine young artist.
Here, let me turn it on.
Hi, I'm Steve Jobs.
Hi, I'm Steve Jobs.
The artist is the swinging love corpses, friends.
Here's the big one.
What's more, the beautiful...
See?

Pretty, dear.
cushiony canister
Now, this is just cooked
but made of teach samples.
You didn't read that?





Thank you.
You recognize that voice, I know.
That's Dr. Philodrummon.
Snorting and hooting.
Yes, the man closest to Bob.
And this is what he does in his spare time.
Sick, isn't he?
That's the fabulous Swinging Love Corpses
with Ray Hay on guitar
and the stinks drumming on bass and keyboard.
Oh, yeah.
And Lordy, I don't know who did this one coming up here.
Snorting and hooting.

Oh, friends, I hope you were getting that one in stereo.
That... I don't know who did that.
Bishop Huey in Houston gave me that tape,
and somebody told me it was Pink Floyd,
but I don't believe it.
Oh, yes, dear friends, and here's an old-timer.
This is just, like I said,
an evening of psychedelic music.
All of this music is about Bob,
including this one.
This is also one for multitrack headphones.
If you've got headphones with 18 speakers on it,
then use those.
I hope you also enjoyed the music for this album.
Keep listening to that for the next episode.
There we go.
Here we go again.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, look at this,


So...
Never again.

Friends, it's dark and scary and windy out there,
but you can stay nice and comfy here inside KNON.
Now listen, folks.
Ask not what you can do for the conspiracy.
Ask what the conspiracy can do for you.
The great M. Ilkman said that,
and it reminds me, friends of the pledge drive.
As you know, two vast,
vast Christian media conglomerates
are trying to take over the station's airwaves.
There used to be another,
but they dropped out when they realized
that the normal pink press
was going to tear them apart over it now.
The other two are still out
to have variety and minority subgenius programming
removed from the air
so there can be another all-Christian station.
Now, KNON will win the case.
That's pretty much given.
In fact, I've been hearing that...
You know what happened?
What?
You know what happened?
The war's over.
The war's over?
Good Lord.
I had this whole rant here prepared
to save KNON and the damn war's over.
I was going to talk about how, you know,
what a bad name they were giving Jesus and everything.
Here's the update as I understand it.
Remember, this is only a little better
than what Stan gave you,
but from what I heard,
you're going to have to start turning
to a different station,
a place in the air to get KNON
because they're swapping stations with the Criswells.
They're going to trade...
They're swapping licenses.
Okay, it's like, you know...
Oh, wait, we've got to be quiet
and listen to this part.
Here we go.
Here we go.

Hello!
Friends, this is Doctors for Dinosaurs,
that sick predi...
What is it?
Descendant of Doctors for Bob.
Okay, okay.
Very good old man, Mr. Williams.
I'm sorry, Mr. Williams,
but we're going to have to operate.
Oh dear, you can't afford the anesthetic?
Oh, Mr. Williams.
Oh, Mr. Williams.
Lie down here, Mr. Williams.
Oh my God, you got your right in it.
God, you're ugly.
With your claws off.
Oh, Mr. Williams.
You're so cool, Mr. Williams.
Your eyes are closed.
Right, Mr. Williams.
Ah!

I'll have to get them there to clean that up later.
Oh.

Oh.
What can I do for you, sonny?
Oh.
Uh, this here and, uh...
Oh.
Oh.
That's all right.
It's catching.
Oh, no.
And a pack of forums.
Forums.
Oh, yes.
Here they are.
These have little gladiator tips.
They're cute and strong.

And that's Holiday Decanter.
Wild Crow is on special.
$214.89.
That's a bargain for a collectible like that.
Look at those eyes.
They'll follow you wherever you go.
That's why I bought it.
Come again now.
Thank you.
99.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Oh.
My anus butt-wumper.
Get out of the way, mister.
Have you boys caught that nasty Indian yet?
That's what I come for.
Now, listen, Ma.
You better turn the eyes off in the lizard.
Yeah, before he shoots him out.
Yeah, we lost him up at the trailhead
over to Mount Boron.
Oh, my.
Yeah.
Now, you just stay.
Stay inside.
Keep safe.
Oh, he's broke my TV.
We hit the light, Sonny,
and get behind the counter.
Come on down here.
Oh, for God's sakes.
This is worse than an Indian in a goat fight.
Shh.
Keep your voice down.
It's not just happening here.
It's happening over in Hollywood, too.
I heard it on the radio.
This is a strange place.
Just as strange as Hollywood any day.
I expect you've heard the voices.
No.
What voices?
Oh, most people hear them as soon as they come into town.
You gotta keep your TV on real loud all the time
to drown them out.
It's a...
Oh!
Oh, sugar, sugar.
Is that one?
Oh, they must come up from the next world.
That's all we know.
Sugar, sugar, sugar.
Oh!
Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar.
How does it know my name?
What?
Oh, they call everybody sugar.
Be careful.
Don't let him read your mind.
Sing.

They tortured me.

They make me sad.

Well, I went on down to my girlfriend's shack
To see how they did hang
When I got there,
her cupboard was full of books

was there I couldn't ignite a thing there was no shard no bone no trig I thought my comic book
collection was about this big yeah frop without slack is like slack without frop but where the
hell else am I going to cop I found my dog food collection about five o'clock but all that food
was stale I thought I'd call that RIPoff schmuck but I forgot he was in jail ended up killing a
porcupine just to see if I could smoke his run oh frop without slack is like slack without frop
but where the hell else am I going to cop yeah frop without slack is like slack without frop
oh
Where the hell else am I going to cop?
I don't know what I am going to do.
I just know that this here trip ain't through.
Oh, fop without slack is like slack without frop.
Where the hell else am I going to cop?
Oh, fop without slack is like slack without frop.
Where the hell else am I going to cop?
Yeah, fop without slack is like slack without frop.
Don't cop from that guy there.
Where the hell else am I going to cop?
Oh, stay away from that.
Fop without slack is like slack without frop.
Uh-huh.
Where the hell else am I going to cop?
No way.
Oh, yes, friends.
Let's see.
What did we play?
That very last thing was by the great Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.
He sends something every couple of weeks, one of those eight-track sing-along-with-yourself tapes,
and he's good at it.
Let's see.
Before that, we had the subgenius parrot and parakeet training tape by, well.
And then there was the Firesign Theater before that.
And before that, a synthesizer junk by yours truly.
That's right.
I dared play.
And before that, butt-naked girls singing,
You're a very ill man, Mr. Williams,
with the most blood-soaked of all Dallas.
Bands, Doctors for Dinosaurs.
Oh, yes.
And this coming up is, who is this guy?
It doesn't matter.
It says, it's got a bad number on it.
I can't say the number over there.
It's one of those bad numbers they told us not to say.
The earth turned gray.
The sea turned black.
Huh?
The rivers turned red.
The sun turned cold.
The beast turned pale.
The stars turned fast.
The air turned to poison.
The sun turned dark.
But let's leave things of this world behind
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack
from the Church of the Subgenius.
Ah, yes, dear friends.
This is Reverend Ivan Stang with the facts.
That's right, the facts.
But why are you so hung up on facts, my friend?
The Church of the Subgenius, unlike the conspiracy that you serve now,
does not confuse you with so-called facts.
There are no facts to the enlightened man.
To one trained in the Church by Bob Dobbs,
ultimate truth can be found in a potato,
in a comic book,
or at the bottom of a bottle of liquid slack.
Because, friends, slack is what comes first.
Yes, slack must come even before truth.
So why are you letting the experts pull the wool over your eyes?
Forget the facts, friends, and do like Bob.
Pull the wool over your eyes.





And relax in the safety of your own delusions.
This is your only hope, my friend,
if you wish to unravel the punchline to the joke of life.
Let there be slack.
God, really, folks, let there be slack.
I just...
The wind just blew so hard it knocked the, uh, needle off.
Whoa!
That's close enough.

Ah, the whole world is going crazy.
Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.
Dare I ask it? Yes.
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the Earth each and every day?
The answer? Yes, definitely.
Take that and shove it up the tube marked certainty,
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.
Are you on drugs?
Of course not, Mr. Baldwin. I'm trying to explain.
Yes, and very strangely.
Perhaps strange enough to understand my little secret.
Sir?
I mean, saying there was a power failure so your clock didn't go off,
and then claiming a meteorite held you up on Central just as an excuse to be late.
I mean, you must be wacko.
But, sir, there will be drugs.
Yes, pretty odd.
Odd. Odd enough to believe this.
Sharon, I am not a regular human being.
I am, in actuality, an alien from a distant solar system.
Sir, it's been a long day as it is, and it's only noon.
Yes, Sharon, you heard me right.
An alien from a distant solar system.
We came here for two reasons.
One was for our food, which you have here in abundance.
Kittens. We suck their guts out.
And second, to mate.
And you seem to be just weird enough to do it, Miss Sharon and Joy.
Yes, Glorp needs ladies.
Oh, no!
You do not believe my claim?
Then look at this!
And now you see me as I really am.
Sharon, let's have sex.

Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!



Unfortunately, I won't tell you.
Unfortunately?
Unfortunately?
That show is right.
Your show, cancelled.
Bad words on your show.
No, no.
Forbidden language used on the air.
Yeah.
Ew.
The insipid, insipid noises from your little collar face holes.
Face crime. Face crime. You know what that means.
Naughty nigger.
No, no.
Yes, another caller's soul sucked out.
She paid for one breath of church air with that soul.
Now, was that worth it?
No.
No, is this abuse worth it, caller?
Bad luck, caller.
I got a question.
Don't hang up on me.
I just want to check it out for you.
Wait, wait, don't hang up on you?
Yeah, don't hang up on me.
And don't play everything all at once, right?
Don't play all the microphones and turntables and recorders real loud.
No, I just want to ask you something.
Do you want to think of something else?
Well, yeah, go ahead and ask.
It's getting cold out here, little caller.
Hurry up.
Come on, come on.
What?
What?
I can't hear you.
It's so cold in here.
You don't understand.
The caller's being manipulated.
Now there's nothing but caller.
Then you drown it all out, you know?
Right.
It's just frustrating.
I know.
Okay.
What is the point?
There used to be a point to the show.
Yeah, there was a point to the show, and the point was Bob Dobbs,
so we just don't need that guy anymore.
Oh, James, or Mobius.
Okay, but what was the old point?
Well, the old point was that it wasn't like Bob.
You could turn to somebody and everybody called up and they had a good time.
It was a caller party.
Everybody comes in your...
Yeah, funky caller party.
You know, you'd have a lot less work to do.
You'd sit back and you'd start work.
You'd start the callers.
You'd start the callers.
You'd start the callers.
And you know what the subgeniuses do to us if we do that?
Oh, no, don't talk about that.
Just the memory.
It's cold and rainy out here.
Have you ever been peed on like this?
Caller, you're fading.
What's wrong?
Well, it sounds like everybody's fading.
I can't believe those guys.
That's that California show.
See, now that's another station.
That's trying to take over our airwaves.
That's...
These...
These...
There's that echo again.
Those creatures.
Well, you know, this is an unusual hour of slack ending.
Usually as it gets down to about 1226 like it is now here on KNON 90.9.
Why, the entire Monday morning crew and Norm Ward and all his friends are usually crowding behind me,
clustered around.
But...
Friends, they seem to be having some sort of trouble with the phones.
Maybe the poltergeist has set it up to where the hour of slack has to turn into three hours of slack.
Or 24 hours of slack.
Maybe days and days.
Well, anyway, just in case Norm does come in here and kick me out at the appointed hour,
which if I was him, I certainly would do.
And if he doesn't, I've got a tape of him doing it anyway.
I do have something that...
I should have been playing at the end of every show since we started the show 21 shows ago.
And this is the credits for the hour of slack.
What we were just hearing before...
Before the credits started, to give you a credit, was...
The...
The...
More than an hour, less than a show show.
But...
As well as that, you find...
You like my heart, yeah!
The voices, faiths, music, and editing you've been listening to come from...
Leepo Abernathy.
The Buck, Naked, and the Jaybirds.
Dr. Odan Canobite.
Show's right up on the green lines, Dr. G. Gordon.
Killer for Bob.
Help me somebody, she ain't got...
Dr. Spool.

Go!

Well, I'm ready to go!
Reverend Cleve...

I ain't gonna...
Dr. Snavely Eklund.
And I'll see you on the radio, but you can't...
Hey, what are we getting to?
This is the DNA of...
Gordon and Bob.
Now that you have a paradigm perspective, let's move on to...
Thanks.

This is Dr. Ahmed Fishmark.
This is Blast Madness.
Bob is my blindfold world...
This is Herr Dr. Chris Gross.
This is Hell's Mommy Satellite Geekbirds.
This is compatible with all religions.
And this is Negative Lands.

Now you may have observed, if you walk into a wall, you get a certain sensation of reality.
When you take a look.
Through your memory book, you may perceive a certain rhythmic regularity.
The crazy things your mind gets up to when you're awake.
Throwing clouds of rain over Brighter's Day.
And there was once a little man.
He worked all day, slept all the night.
He looked at the sun.
It didn't seem bright.
It didn't seem right.
He wondered, did the world go rolling along on its own?
Or did the sky go blue?

Or did the sky go blue?
Or did some spirit move it with a black cat bone?
And he set out to find the causes behind the events in the world and the seasons of the mind.
So he asked his wife about it and his wife said yes.
Come back and see me if it's time to know less.
He knew too much of questions of the world at large.
Everybody knows the politician's in charge.
So he went to the king house just the next day.
To see that politician with his hair dyed grey.
Jump down, turn round, blow you up or kiss the ground.
Trying to be the president of a land so gay.
He had those false pretendies.
Had to love his style.
Bound to make some havoc with that violent smile.
Hey Salvador, darling, make a walking, talking something.
You paint some freaky pictures.
Make the likeness of that man.
Muchos dollars if you can.
And so the little man,
He was a little man.

Asked the politician who makes the plan.
Who makes the plan.
What happens to me.
And who has the key.
Now you are asking me who makes the scene.
His highness king gold and madam silver his queen.
They keep it all a rustling with the dollars and pounds.
And everyone knows that money makes the world go around.
And so the little man,
Asked king gold and madam silver come tell me what you can.
And king gold said,
Lifting his golden voice from his golden bed.
Now money is something, it's a basic flow.
And me I am the archetype of jewels and dough.
I do a lot of talking both slow and fast.
But me make decisions, no, of course it's the past.
Oh the past is something, we all have some.
Universal history is a bundle of fun.
Now I get sleepy, starting to nod.
And if you want to check the picture.
Want to check the picture.
Want to check it, check it with God.
And so the little man,
Climbed up on a rickety ladder to the heavenly lands.
And he shed a tear.
He's all so queer.
And it doesn't seem clear.
Yeah.
Now God was sitting easy in a heavenly chair.
Breathing deep and lazy on the heavenly air.
The little man got near him just to get right from wrong.
Said God are you responsible for all that goes on.
God looked up from having a heavenly thing.
He gave that little questioner a heavenly wing saying.
Men have colored me with the colors of their minds.
So I find.
They use me as an excuse for all kinds of goofs.
And for crimes of all kinds.
All your so hard facts painted thinly on the void.
Why were you not more pleasantly implored.
Anything you want to do I'm happy if you make it go right.
And it's true if it makes you happy.
Oh you know it makes the world more bright.
And you shall have liberty.
Liberty.
It always was yours.
Yours anyway.
You're one of my kind.
You're an infinite mind.
You make each new day.
There's nothing more.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Transparency.


I can say.
I can.
I can.
You do.
You can.

I was ready to be on the show,
but right now we're just absolutely slackless, Reverend Stang.
I think it's all your fault.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
We're just all out of slack.
That's okay.
It's time to read a PSA anyway.
Where's that log?
That's a good question.
Yeah, where is that log?
Where'd you put it, Phil?
Well, in the meantime, friends,
as background music here,
we can't stop for more than a second.

Yes, yes, yes.
I've always loved her.
Yes, I agree, man.
It really makes it.
Yeah, that's how we all see you, man.
It really makes it.
Susie, you just got to town,
and we've been very interested in your development.
Forget it!
Hmm.
It can't happen here.
That's what they all say, friends.
You remember the Mothers of Invention?
I was just telling somebody here
that was one of the three things,
along with R. Crumb's comics
and Jimi Hendrix's first album
that turned me overnight
from a nightmare
Nixon Youth in 1967
to a mad, crazy prophet of the airwaves.
Yes, friends.
What you're hearing are the
Norm Ward will be in
and the Hour of Slack,
I mean the...
Monday morning,
Norm Ward and all his crew
are here, are striving
to get the phones working,
and they will, friends, they will.
So hang on.
I know you've all got something to say,
and you'll be able to, yeah,
beg for slack.
Pray for Norm and his machines.
But, uh,
one more little change of pace here.
This is, um,
this is George Clinton.
Huh!
Huh!
Huh!

With electronic bait, man is nuclear fission.
And the fish on his line is bigger in his mind
than the reality of the reel he has to reel it in.
You shouldn't have bit, fish.
The one that got away is the catch of the day.
You shouldn't have bit, fish.
You took the bait, it's too late to pray.
Now over you, they say the grace.

But I didn't hear nobody pray
Yes, friends.
This is not Reverend Stang of the Church of the Subgenius.
That is.
Nay, nay.
No.
Mr. Ed's back in here again.
Anyway, this is KNOAN-FM, Dallas-Fort Worth.
The voice of the people, the choice of the masses.
And other things.
Yeah, among other things.
But my name is Norm Ward.
John Horton is in Baltimore, Maryland tonight.
He's not missing anything.
The folks from Inertel.
A real nice guy.
He can't figure out what's wrong.
He told me to throw a few switches, and I did.
And it didn't happen.
I don't think I need to worry about it.
Robert, you want to talk about it?
You want to get here and talk real quick?
We can do this.
We can at least inform you.
Give him a minute.
Okay.
We can talk about something that was mentioned earlier during the hour of slack.
And that is the fact that apparently an agreement has been reached in principle on the challenge to the license.
And have you got the newspaper there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Anyway, this appeared in the Thursday edition of the Dallas Times.
Harold.
March 6th.
And the terms of the agreement says K&N will give up the frequency.
It says it would have to give up its hopes of expanding broadcast capacity from 10,000 to 100,000, which is allocated on this frequency.
And what we're going to do is what KCBI wanted to do three years ago.
Which was trade frequencies.
So KCBI, K&N will take the frequency of 89.3 and remain at 10,000 watts.
And KCBI will take over 90.9.
And I'm sure they'll have the money.
I don't know why.
But I think they just might have the money to get the equipment to run it at 100,000 watts.
You can go up to 100,000 watts from that.
I know.
What?
Yeah.
It has to be directional.
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
And that's something very unusual.
Joy is just telling me that we can go to 100,000, but it's directional.
And FM directional is a very unusual animal.
And would probably cost more money than the undirectional.
Yeah.
Okay.
Anyway.
I'm surprised he hadn't already done it.
So anyway.
Plus they're going to pay off.
They are going to, I guess, pay off.
I don't know.
Just.
Look.
Yeah.
See, here's the other.
Yeah, I know.
But that's what's interesting.
Even more interesting.
The other people that had filed are also getting a settlement.
So the folks at.
They didn't disavow.
Yeah.
KCBI is paying off the other group as well as KON.
So it's like.
I don't know if I like that or not.
Well, I mean, you know, with the commercial.
And with the commercial frequencies.
I mean, you know, if you can get 17 million for it, great.
Which is what Cap City's got for a kiss.
Or so.
Whatever they got.
16, 17 million.
But.
I just.
For some reason, the idea of paying off people for non-commercial frequencies.
I.
Doesn't sit well with me.
Following.
The preceding was an editorial opinion.
Okay.
But.
Why don't we go ahead and just say that right now that any opinions expressed during the
next hour are those of.
Of Norm and myself as an individual and not necessarily those of the management.
Of K and O N.
Okay.
That's Robert Jackson.
Reverend Stang, are you still going to do something here or.
Hey.
Are you waiting on me?
Up to you guys.
I've got a.
Well, I was.
A Laurie Anderson tape.
Ooh.
Well, I was just going to say.
I can read this weird newspaper to everybody.
You got a newspaper?
Well, it's the Forty and Times.
The Journal of Strange Phenomena.
It's reports on.
Like believe it or don't.
Yeah.
And some of them are just news clippings that are funny.
Like this guy here.
A novelist, Arnold Bennett, died of typhoid fever.




He died of typhoid in Paris after drinking a glass of water to prove the water was perfectly
safe.
It's got loads of news items like that.
True facts.
True facts that are ironic and sad and hilarious to those of us it didn't happen to.
Okay.
Well, the only reason I came on is to let everybody know that we are going to suspend
Monday morning for this week just because I can't get you folks on the air.
They took out the old phone.
We used to have.
Yeah.
Well, you can talk.
I just, you know, I only want to listen to myself talk for so long.
And then I got bored.
But the Two-Faced Kitty.
I think that was done with mirrors.
I'm sorry.
I've got this book of freaks, folks.
Yeah.
No kidding.
Yes.
But anyway.
But before they took out the old telephone, we had one line that came in and I could have
patched that in.
But it is here no longer.
So I am going to check out for this week.
Remind everybody that our.
Our pledge drive will start next week.
We're going to be starting it off here.
And we want everybody to participate because I think we should be able to raise about $2,000
during this show.
What do you think, Robert?
At least 10 times that much, I think.
Oh, you're disgusting.
This man is just plain greedy.
I'm sorry.
Well, I think $2,000 in pledges would be reasonable.
So that's what we're going to need.
We're going to do it like you know who.
We're going to say.
We need.
$2,050.
We need 40 people to give us $50.
Is that right?
Is that $2,000?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I need 40 listeners next week to come up with $50.
So that's what we're going to do.
We're going to raise $2,000 during my show next week to get things off to a real big
start.
Reverend Stang, why don't you entertain the masses with your stories of mystique and illusion
and Laurie Anderson.
No, no.
Well, those were.
Those were true.
No, they can't.
They can't hear you when you're leaning over.
I know.
I don't want to.
Take your mic.
I don't have anything to say.
Take the mic with you.
It moves.
See?
Isn't that amazing?
Yeah.
It makes noise, dude.
Oh, God.
It just friends the microphone.
It's too slack.
It's achieved slackness.
Listen to that.
Look.
Total slack.
It has been slacked.
Look what.
It's slack to the max.
Look what an hour and a half of slack does to a microphone.
Just look at that.
Can we get camera two to close up on that?

Yeah.
Yeah.
It still has that good tone.
There is somebody that we need to be slackful with, and that is Heritage Cable, folks.
We are no longer on the Community Billboard audio channel.
We are no longer on any of their audio channels.
I noticed that just today.
Your antenna, your receiver, you can't pick up K&O in through the cable either.
They can't hear you unless you talk louder.
Why sad, G1?
There you go.
Now they can hear you.
All right.
I said that you can't pick us up when you hook up the cable.

I said that you can't pick us up when you hook up the cable to your receiver either.
K&O in is the only FM signal that you can't pick up.
Now why is that, friends?
That's because we have some people that aren't paying attention down at Heritage Cable.
Now the folks, if Warner Amex could do anything else right, at least they had us on down there.
And they took us off once, and I called down there, and I got into the chief engineer,
and he said, no prob.
And he ran down there, and he just plugged the right things in, and he fixed it immediately.
Now I don't know if the same people are working there or not, but different people are running
it.
Now, no, well, I understand what I mean, that the same guy may be down there pushing
the buttons, but different people are running it.
And you folks need to get on the phone and call Heritage Cable first thing tomorrow and
tell them you want K&O in on your cable or else.
And we know what that means.

That means no, or else you cancel the service.
They don't care about the FCC.
They care about if you're going to send them any money or not.
So anyway, the ultimate threat.
That's right.
You can discontinue, discontinue your subscription.
Are you ready to go, Reverend Stang?
There, I think we're back in.
All right.
Well, I appreciate your time and efforts, and thanks for covering for me here.
Oh, sure, you bet.
As a matter of fact, I'm going to get back to praising Bob here pretty soon.
Oh, I'm going to get out of here.
I'm going to get out of here before you start this.
I'm going to get out of here before you start this.

I know Robert might throw you out, but I'm going to let you have it.
What was the line, Bob, slack?
I don't know, but we'll be back.
We'll be back next week.
It'll be pledge drive time, so don't you dare miss it.
Bring your checkbook.
I'm going to bring mine.
Thank you.
Thank you.
A praise norm, friends.
Well, you know, how long am I going to be in here?
Until you get tired of it.
Do you want to go home?
Well, no, no.
Hey, I'll keep entertaining the masses, folks.
Give me Dr. Gene Scott's time slot.
48 minutes.
Yeah, we have a new program on.
Excuse me.
Oh, yeah.
3 o'clock.
Friends, at 3 o'clock, and we'll have a cartridge coming up here any second now.
It's the...
This.
This.
All right.
You're going to get a new program.



The minutes.
This is a phage.
You know the world is in bad shape, and the future looks frightening.
We know the questions.
Let's find some answers.
Give me a call to Monday morning with norm another week supposed to 24 AM Monday mornings
on k o.
n.
oh that's right friends hang in there for that one that's gonna uh okay and in fact that that

Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
This here and, uh...
Oh.
Oh!
That's all right.
It's catching.
Oh, no.
And a pack of forums.
Forums.
Oh, yes.
Here they are.
These have little gladiator tips.
They're cute and strong.
$65.
And that's holiday decanter.
Wild crow is on special.
$214.89.
That's a bargain for a collectible like that.
Look at those eyes.
They'll follow you wherever you go.
That's why I bought it.
Come again now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
$99.
Mm-hmm.
Ah!
Oh!
Oh!
My anus butt bumper.
Get out of the way, mister.
Have you boys caught that nasty Indian yet?
That's what I come for now.
Now, listen, Ma.
You better turn the eyes off in the lizard.
Yeah, before he shoots him out.
Yeah, we lost him up at the trailhead over to Mount Boron.
Oh, my.
Now, you just stay inside.
Keep safe, huh?
Oh, he's broke my TV.
We hit the light, Sonny, and get behind the counter.
Come on down here.
Oh, for God's sakes.
This is worse than an Indian in a goat fight.
Shh.
Keep your voice down.
It's not just happening here.
It's happening over in Hollywood, too.
I heard it on the radio.
This is a strange place, just as strange as Hollywood any day.
I expect you've heard the voices.
No.
What voices?
Oh, most people hear them as soon as they come into town.
You got to keep your TV on real loud all the time to drown them out.
Yes.
Oh!
Shh.
Is that one?
Oh, they must come up from the next world.
Shh.
That's all.
Shh.
No.
Sugar, sugar.
Oh.
Sugar, sugar, sugar.
How does it know my name?
What?
Oh, they call everybody sugar.
Be careful.
Don't let them read your mind.
Sing.
Sing something.
Anything.
Hey, lazy Steve.
There's no...
Help me.
Help me.
Say thanks.
Help me.
Say thanks.
You got to believe...
You got to believe...
Help me, please.
Help me, please.
Help me, please.
Please help me.
Well, I went on down to my girlfriend's shack to see how they did hang.
When I got there, her cupboard was bare.
I couldn't ignite a thing.
There was no shard, no bow, no twig.
I dropped my comic book collection.
Was about this big, yeah.
Well, Frop Without Slack is like slack without frop.
But where the hell else am I going to cop?
I found my dog food collection about five o'clock.
But all that food was stale.
I thought I'd call that ripoff schmuck.
But I forgot he was in jail.
Ended up killing a porcupine just to see if I could smoke his rhyme.
Oh, Frop Without Slack is like slack without frop.
But where the hell else am I going to cop?
Yeah, Frop Without Slack is like slack without frop.
But where the hell else am I going to cop?
I don't know.
You know what I am going to do.
I just know that this here trip ain't through, oh.
Frop Without Slack is like slack without frop.
Where the hell else am I going to cop?
Frop Without Slack is like slack without frop.
But where the hell else am I going to cop?
Yeah, Frop Without Slack is like slack without frop.
Don't cop from that guy there.
Where the hell else am I going to cop?
Oh, stay away from that.
Frop Without Slack is like slack without frop.
slack without froth where the hell else am i going to cop no way oh yes friends let's see what did we
play that very last thing was by the great reverend bleepo abernathy he sends something
every couple of weeks on those eight track sing along with yourself tapes and he's good at it uh
let's see uh before that we had the parakeet the subgenius parrot and parakeet training tape uh
by well and then there was the fire sign theater before that and before that a synthesizer a
synthesizer junk by yours truly that's right i dared play and and before that butt naked girls
singing uh you're a very ill man mr williams with the most blood soaked of all dallas bands
doctors for dinosaurs uh yes and this coming up is who is this guy it doesn't matter it says
it's got a bad number on it i can't say the number over there it's one of those bad numbers they
told us not to say the earth turned gray the sea turned black the rivers turned red
the beast turned pale
the stars
fast the air turned to poison
but let's leave things of this world behind and walk now down the path of bob for this brief
minute of slack from the church of the subgenius
ah yes dear friends this is reverend ivan stang with the facts that's right the facts but why are you
so hung up on facts my friend the church of the sub genious unlike the conspiracy that you serve now
does not confuse you with so-called quote facts unquote there are no facts to the enlightened man
the one trained in the church by bob dobbs ultimate truth can be found in a potato in
a comic book or at the bottom of a bottle of liquid slack because friends slack is what comes first yes slack comes first


must come even before truth.
So why are you letting the experts
pull the wool over your eyes?
Forget the facts, friends, and do like Bob.
Pull the wool over your own eyes
and relax in the safety of your own delusions.
This is your only hope, my friend,
if you wish to unravel the punchline
to the joke of life.
Let there be slack.
God, really, folks, let there be slack.
I just, the wind just blew so hard
it knocked the, uh, needle out.
Whoa!
That's close enough.
Get up, puppet boy.
You've got a job to do.
Even so, you're free to go.
Well, you're not so tired to do.
Listen, puppet boy.
Before you disobey,
consider that the strings attached
could never be
true.
In your head, puppet boy,
it's the little things that count.
Little problems, little minds,
little points of view.
Puppet boy,
if the world makes that up,
you'll give me up
for the trigger-based things like you.
Stand up, puppet boy.
Time to start the show.
You'd better do something.
Brand new moves, they feel like
to watch you go.
Huh.
Puppet boy.
Get.
Get up, puppet boy.
You've got a job to do.
You've got a job to do.
Get up, puppet boy.
Even so, you're free to go.
You're free to go.
Well, you're not so tired to do.
Listen, puppet boy.
Before you disobey,
consider that the strings attached

Little problems, little minds,

Puppet boy,

You're notendre wit.
StandNium's not trying to mess with you.
That's fine.
You can see what you're worried.







You shouldn't miss out on a show.
Puppet boy.





It's theword they work with all day.
No game.
We're here to stay.
Even a little more.

No game.
What's that, puppet?
Don't tell me what to do.
What's that, Puppet Boy?
I'm not a creep like you.
What's that, Puppet Boy?
I move when I want to.
I can't hear you, Puppet Boy. Now dance, dance, dance!
Stay out of bed unless you're gonna get wet.
I'm a boy, not a toy, I'm not through yet.
Stay out of bed unless you're gonna get wet.
Now wake up, Puppet Boy!
Ha!
Listen, Puppet Boy.
You're not a robot slave.
Consider that a string's attack could ever make you misbehave.
Puppet Boy is the thing that counts.
Puppet Boy, you're the problem, you're the mind, and the world is yours.
Puppet Boy, it's a little thing set up.
Be me up in the tree, I'll do things like you.
Puppet Boy, it's a little thing to like.
You're the problem, you're the mind, and the world is yours.
Friends, I'm sorry. It wasn't the wind that was blowing this needle all across the turntable.
It was apparently that poltergeist again,
because Buck put the window up and all of a sudden everything just started flying around the room,
and the needles were jumping, and phew!
Who do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be today?
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?
Oh boy!
Heaven is so terrible, it's like it's rephesies
And the things could be worse than when there's nothing on TV
I'd rather be a cowboy than just airplane got the walls
I've been reborn so many times I can't remember them all
And I say, who do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be today?
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?
Just like somebody on TV!
I think I'll be a scary boy, I think I'll be a hunk
I think I'll be a tough guy and I think I'll be a punk
I might just be a fashion star all dressed in pretty rags
Over half across the other side and walk around in red
Who do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be today?
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?
Just like somebody on TV!
Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be?

Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be?
Oh yeah!
Do you like to live just like a rock in the middle of the sea?
Do you want to suffer?
Do you want to go by yourself in a pool of blissful misery?
Do you feel like a saint in honest clothes with a rosary in your hand?
Do you want to be crazy like Bando?
Like a stranger in a strange, strange land?
Would you rather push the buttons and be feared by all humanity?
Or perhaps you'd like to be a bum?
Do you want to be stupid just like me?
Who do you want to be today?

Hi girls.
I thought I was afraid you couldn't do it, Buck.
I'm glad you were able to work that out.
I hope it gets some results.
Or har.
This is Dr. Onan Kanabai.
Think a bob.
.
Dr. Onan's Wootan Man.
.
When you drive in 16 hours, think a bob.
Think a bob.
When you use your mutant powers, think a bob.
Think a bob.
When your blood is low in sugar, when they're picking out the boogers.
When you shoot them with a luga, think a bob.
Think a bob.
When you're outside exit, think a bob.
Think about when you're using sex devices.
Think about when you're walking through the woods.
When you make out with the girls.
When you're beat up to the hooves.
Think about.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, big fat, big fat, big fat, big fat sick.
Bad.
Babby, baby, bad baby.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No.
Can they perhaps been».
Don't do that.
When you see a flock of birds, think about
When you just run out of words, think about
When a ring falls from your collar, when you hear a given holler
When you ride chicks for one dollar, think about
When you ride to the subgenius, think about
P.O. Box 1403-06, think about
When you cast your mojo hexes, when you ride through Dallas, Texas
When you're off the residence, think about
The whole world's gone crazy!
Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.
Dare I ask it?
Yes.
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the Earth each and every day?
The answer? Yes, definitely.
Take that, and shove it up the tube, mark certainty.
In the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.
Are you on drugs?
Of course not, Mr. Baldwin. I'm trying to explain...
Yes, and very strangely.
Perhaps strange enough to understand my little... secret.
I mean, saying there was a power failure so your clock didn't go off,
and then claiming a meteorite held you up on Central just as an excuse to be late.
I mean, you must be wacko!
Yes, pretty odd. Odd enough to believe this.
Sharon, I am not a regular human being.
I am, in actuality, an alien from a distant solar system.
Sir, it's been a long day, as it is, and it's only noon.
Yes, Sharon.
Sharon, you heard me right.
An alien from a distant solar system.
We came here for two reasons.
One was for our food, which you have here in abundance.
Kittens. We suck their guts out.
And second, to mate.
And you seem to be just weird enough to do it, Miss Sharon and Joy.
Yes, Glorp needs ladies.
Oh, no!
You do not believe my claim? Then look at this!
And now you see me as I really am.
Sharon, let's have sex.
There was a second service at the beginning of the show.
Because your brains, dear...
...out by us.
Unfortunately, that show...
Your show, cancelled.
Bad words on your show. No, no.
Forbidden language used on the air.
Yeah.
Ew!
The insipid, insipid noises from your little collar face hole.
Face crime, face crime. You know what that means.
Naughty nigger.
No, no.
Yes, another collar's soul sucked out.
She paid for one breath of true cheer with that soul.
Now, was that worth it?
No.
Horrible little collar's soul.
No, is this abuse worth it, collar?
Bad little collar's.
I've got a question.
Don't hang up on me.
I just want to check it out for you.
Wait, wait. Don't hang up on you?
Yeah, don't hang up on me.
And don't put your hands on me.
Don't play everything all at once, right?
Don't play all the microphones and turntables and tape recorders real loud.
Yeah, here.
No, I just want to ask you something.
Do you want to think of something else?
Well, yeah, go ahead and ask.
It's getting cold out here, little collar. Hurry up.
Come on, come on.
What, what?
I can't hear you. It's so cold in here.
No, you don't understand. The collar's being manipulated.
Now there's nothing but collar.
Then, then you drown it all out, you know?
Right. It's just frustrating, I know.
What is the point?
There used to be a point to this show.
Yeah, there was a point to this show, and the point was Bob Dobbs,
and we just don't need that guy anymore.
Oh, James, or Mobius, or something like that.
Okay, but what was the old point?
Well, the old point was that it wasn't so much Bob,
it was the church subgeniuses that everybody called up and they had a good time.
Oh, it was a collar party. Everybody comes in your...
Yeah, funky collar party.
Well, you know, you'd have a lot less work to do.
You'd sit back and sound work, and just let the collar sit in the pocket, right?
And you know what the subgeniuses do to us if we do that?
What do they do?
They make a...
Oh, no, don't do that.
Don't talk about the collar.
Just the memory.
It's cold and rainy out here.
Have you ever been peed on like this?
Collar, you're fading.
What's wrong?
Well, it sounds like everybody's fading.
I can't believe those guys.
That's that California show.
See, now, that's another station that's trying to take over our airwaves.
That's, um...
These...
There's that echo again.
Those creatures.
Well...
You know, this is an unusual hour of slack ending.
Usually, as it gets down to about 1226, like it is now, I hear on KNON 90.9,
why the entire Monday morning crew, Norm Ward and all his friends,
are usually crowding behind me, clustered around.
But friends, they seem to be having some sort of trouble with the phones.
Maybe the poltergeist has set it up to where the hour of slack has to turn into three hours of slack,
or 24 hours of slack.
Maybe days and days.
Well, anyway, just in case Norm does come in here and kick me out at the appointed hour,
which, if I was him, I certainly would do.
And if he doesn't, I've got a tape of him doing it anyway.
I do have something that I should have been playing at the end of every show since we started the show 21 shows ago.
And this is the credits for the hour of slack.
What we were just hearing before the credits started, to give you a credit, was...
The...
The more than an hour, less than a show show.
But, as well as that, you find...
The voices, tapes, music, and editing you've been listening to come from...
Leepo Abernathy,
Buck Naked and the Jaybirds,
Dr. O and Canobite.
Show's right up on the Green Room.
Green Lines, Dr. G. Gordon.
G. Gordon Gordon, killer for Bob.
Tell me somebody, she ain't got...
Doctors for Bob.
Dr. Philo Drummond, overman, first degree.
Reverend Cleve Donut Duncan.
Dr. Snavely Eklund.
Can't have seen it on the radio, but you can find it.
Yeah, we're only kidding, too.
We're just trying to make sure that you have a good nap.
Or a good nap.
Now that you have paradigm perspective, let's move on to the shift in paradigm.
This is Dr. Ahmed Fishmark.
This is Glass Madness.
Bob is my blindfold world.
This is Herr Dr. Chris Gross.
This is Hell's Mommy Satellite Gevers.
This is compatible with all religions.
And this is Negative Lands.
These are those fantastic swinging love corpses.
These are doctors for dinosaurs.
These are doctors for Wotan.
This is Gary the Brogue Fan.
This is St. Seymour Hyperboles.
The unmistakable.
This is Arch-Poet.
This is Sturgo Dox.
This is Chattoons.
Help me somebody.
This is D.K. Jones.
This is Palmer Breedings of the Lies Foundation.
Hi Palmer.
And this is the Pope of all New York, David B. Monk.
We're through.
This is Mark Mothersbaugh.
This is the man in the movie.
This is Buck Naked, the fighting creature.
This is Dr. Howell.
I didn't understand the meaning of this explanation, but I'm sure I'll call her later.
I won't be able to help her.
This is Mark Byron Warner.
You never hear his voice.
But you hear lots and lots of his tapes and his fine editing.
You have reached the correct number.
This is someone else.
Your call has already been analyzed.
And this is Reverend Ivan Stang.
Ah, yes. Thank you and praise Bob.
Oh, and this is KNON 90.9 FM, Dallas, Texas, the voice of the people and other things.
Praise Bob!
Now you may have observed
If you walk into a wall
You get a certain sensation of reality
When you take a look through your memory book
You may perceive a certain rhythmic regularity
The crazy things your mind gets up to
When you're away
Throwing clouds of rain
Over brightest days
And there was once a little man
He worked all day
Slept all the night
He looked at the sun
It didn't seem right
It didn't seem right
He wondered
Did the world go a-rolling along on its own
On its own
Or did some spirit move it
With a black cat bone
And he set out to find
The causes behind
The events in the world
And the seasons of the mind
So he asked his wife about it
And his wife said yes
Come back and see me
If it's time to know less
Due to much of questions of the world at large
He said yes
Everybody knows
The politician's in charge
So he went to the king house
Just the next day
To see that politician
With his hair dyed grey
Jump down, turn round
Blow you off or kiss the ground
Trying to be the president of the land
So gay
He had those false pretend
He's had to love his style
Bound to make some havoc
With that violent smile
Hey
Salvador Daz
Charlie Maker
Walking, talking something
You paint some freaky pictures
Make the likeness of that man
Muchos dollars if you can
And so the little man
Asked the politician
Who makes the plan
Who makes the plan
What happens to me
And who has the key?
And who has the key?
And who has the key?
And who has the key?
Now you are asking me
Who makes the scene
His Highness King Gold
And Madam Silver his queen
They keep it all a rustling
With the dollars and pounds
And everyone knows that money
Makes the world go around
And so the little man
Asked King Gold and Madam Silver
Come tell me what you can
And King Gold said
Lifting his golden voice
From his golden bed
Now money is something
It's a basic flow
And me I am the archetype
Of jewels and dough
I do a lot of talking both
Slow and fast
But me make decisions no
Of course it's the past
Oh the past is something
We all have some
Universal history
Is a bundle of fun
Now I get sleepy
Starting to nod
And if you want to check the picture
Want to check the picture
Want to check it
Check it with God
And so the little man
Climbed up on a rickety ladder
To the heavenly lands
And he shed a tear
And he was a little boy

It's all so queer
And it doesn't seem clear
Now God was sitting easy
In a heavenly chair
Breathing deep and lazy
On the heavenly air
The little man got near him
Just to get right from wrong
Said God are you responsible
For all that goes on
God looked up
From having a heavenly thing
He gave that little questioner a heavenly wink
Saying, men have colored me
With the colors of their minds
So I find
They use me as an excuse
For all kinds of goofs
And for crimes of all kinds
