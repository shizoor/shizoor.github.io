1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Look out! God is right behind you!

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,280
The Soft Genius Hour of Swatch!

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:15,980
Goodbye.

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:17,160
Goodbye.

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,700
Goodbye.

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,700
Goodbye. Goodbye, Earth.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,100
Night, little monkeys in your cage. Night, night.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:35,600
All your great skyscrapers, your achievements, your mighty books and discoveries, your symphonies, your armies, your concentration camps.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,140
All of it was burned up.

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,100
Your indoor plumbing, your toiletries, and your many delicacies that no one can use.

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:53,620
A tiny spark, dying ember in the middle of thousands and billions of light years of empty, cold space.

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,960
Glowing, stinky hole in your...

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,080
Nothing.

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,080


15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,740
Now, you are about as important as a cork in the ocean, my friend.

16
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,380
Think of a cockroach, if you would.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,760
I don't know if you want to think of one for too long, but just imagine the revulsion you feel when you swat one and brush it away from yourselves.

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,080
Think of yourself as a mere cockroach compared to these weird exes, archons, whatever the hell they are.

19
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,720
They don't notice you. They don't care about you.

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,840
If you happen to hitch a ride and they don't swat you off, then count yourself lucky.

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,080
But don't think...

22
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:38,280
You're some kind of a big deal just because God or some aliens happened to pick you up by the scruff of your neck and show you a thing or two.

23
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,840
They're in there with you. They're in the room with you.

24
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,320
You can't see them. You can't smell them. You can't taste them.

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,920
But they're in the room with you, and they blend with the walls, with the CDs, with the vinyl rack, with the digital...

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,300
What did they do with everything?

27
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,700
And with the airwaves.

28
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:11,180
It's the hiss buried in the tape that we use to carry the code, the coded signal.

29
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,160
But it's the only way we can stop them.

30
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,600
The human mind.

31
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,200
The human mind is capable of receiving and transmitting radio signals.

32
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,740
It has no way of converting this knowledge or...

33
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,380
...the ability into a practical use.

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:35,020
However, the brain has in it, in some miraculous way, the ability to transmit and convert and receive radio signals.

35
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:44,060
We use your brain as an envelope to send our letters to the others.

36
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,380
They are a correspondence with a world you could never fathom.

37
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,480
It's square to your round.

38
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,580
It's cheesy to your musky.

39
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,100
It's black to your white.

40
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,240
It's green to your red.

41
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,100
It's out of focus to your sharp image.

42
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,760
Do the rat in the cheese.

43
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,580
The cheese is the universe.

44
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,360
Do the rat, baby.

45
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,040
Do it one more time.

46
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,640
Everybody loved Obagi Kodo.

47
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,480
Do the rat.

48
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,660
Do the rat.

49
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,000
Do the rat.

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:22,200
There are more things in this cheese than your little science has ever dreamt of, Mickey.

51
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:22,660
...Micky.

52
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,900
I've been stuck here for so long.

53
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,180
Just wondering when it's gonna end.

54
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,880
When it's gonna blow up.

55
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,920
When this sun is gonna go nova.

56
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,200
Could that be what's happening today?

57
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,080
If you think X-Day was just Bob's way of saying, well, it's just aliens or something.

58
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,740
Don't feel bad that God's gonna supernova your sun unexpectedly for no particular reason.

59
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,580
No special timing.

60
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,080
Oh, God.

61
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,380
I don't know.

62
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,240
I'm gonna do it around the time Bob said something what's gonna happen.

63
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:03,180
It's nice you let us know around the time because, you know, if we was more God-like, we could have made our plans accordingly, but...

64
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:10,940
It's kinda like we...but we're kinda like the old dog that just got too sick and we...you take the old dog out in the woods, you go,

65
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,840
Here, old dog.

66
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,060
Here's a big old hunk of raw meat.

67
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Mmm, isn't that good?

68
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:22,400
And when that dog turns around to gum that raw meat, you pull out your .45 and blow his poor...

69
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,100
pathetic old doggy brains out because it's the kindest thing to do.

70
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,220
Is that what our planet is, that old dog?

71
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,340
Is...

72
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:40,520
Are we that old dog just being put out to pasture, put out on the ice flows, toothless to fend for itself or go under?

73
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,500
Is it?

74
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:48,280
Is our planet to...is our planet being sent off to the rest home?

75
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,380
Yeah, like everything's gonna have its time and go.

76
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:52,380


77
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,120
Maybe our time already came and went and we didn't even know it.

78
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,640
All things must pass.

79
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,300
We was laughing and playing them Dionysian dances by the old Greek riverside.

80
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,120
Them were the days.

81
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:10,080
We was jumping through hoops and wrestling with bears and then we invented hydrogen energy and decided to blow us up some bombs and...

82
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,340
And have tooth decay.

83
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,840
And then have...

84
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,660
Truth decay.

85
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,440
And then...and then before we knew it, nobody knew the truth.

86
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,780
Nobody was well anymore. Nobody was even really alive.

87
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,200
They were just going...

88
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,360
Going...

89
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,160
Going...

90
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,960
Going...

91
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,840
We thought we had the ultimate weapon.

92
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,320
Turned out God had it all along.

93
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,500
We thought we was gonna hold a gun to our own head and...and we didn't even get the chance.

94
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,540
No, we thought we were so prideful, we thought we could destroy ourselves.

95
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,080
Mother Nature showed us what for.

96
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:49,020
Say, you boys think you can wreck your environment with them factories and bombs?

97
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,700
Let me show you a thing or two.

98
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,280
Here, I'll just spit this little spit water into that sun thing, that little light bulb you got lighting you up.

99
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,720
Look very calmly and clearly at the question, Mr. Pavilion Head.

100
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,460
Counting down the minutes to the end of the solar system.

101
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,560
What you usually think of first in a situation like this is who benefits?

102
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,760
Earth first.

103
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,280
Who takes all?

104
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,880
There's a power play going on. The sun's getting bigger. It's getting weirder.

105
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,940
It's getting flatter and longer and more sideways and more...everything it's not.

106
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,680
You know, Mars will probably be real tropical in about 30 minutes.

107
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,180
Three hours? If we can get to Mars in about three hours, it'll probably be real nice.

108
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,820
But then by the time we got there, it would be Pluto would be getting all tropical and we'd have to get there and we just...

109
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,340
Pluto, man.

110
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,200
And then three...

111
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Oh yeah, there's going to be like palm trees on Pluto and you'd be...

112
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,540
I don't know if I got enough rocket motors for Pluto.

113
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,700
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if we're going to be able to make...

114
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,980
Pluto's no cat anemone planet.

115
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,020
And especially that...

116
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,360
Not really.

117
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,080
You know, they showed me on board that ship tonight, what you guys don't believe.

118
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,120
There's going to be no planets left. There's just going to be cold rocks.

119
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,660
A picture...a hologram...of Mars.

120
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,200
Nikola Tesla.

121
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,560
Yeah, I suppose.

122
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:52,840
What?

123
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,420
Well, they showed me a hologram of Nikola Tesla.

124
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,900
It was like one of them talking holograms and explained exactly what's going on right now.

125
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,320
And it said...

126
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,560
It said why we're at this crossroads we're at.

127
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,020
And it sang this song.

128
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,120
Yeah. No, no it didn't.

129
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,240
This is the best end of the world song I could ever imagine, friends.

130
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,340
This is Einstein's Secret Orchestra live at XXX Day.

131
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,780
Just a couple nights ago.

132
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,040
Just a couple nights ago, dear friends.

133
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:30,420
As we ushered in the end of the world, we're going to go out dancing, sleeping, loving and eating.

134
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,420
And...

135
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:38,740
But it's fall for BTEN because the sun really is going down, folks.

136
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,340
Them flaunting shoes out in Nevada, they're spitting water.

137
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,900
Well, you feel like a cow, you got a hubcap down the sky.

138
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,080
You feel like a cow.

139
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,800
Oh yeah.

140
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,940
You feel like a cow.

141
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:59,060
You're an untamed youth, not so cute with your clothes full of baghawks.

142
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,960
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl.

143
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,780
Get it off.

144
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,460
Bag off.

145
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,840
Get it off.

146
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,220
Get it off.

147
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,660
Sounds pretty good, huh?

148
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,400
Man, you were rocking there, Dave.

149
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,360
I was dancing so hard, my vertigo almost made me fall off the stage.

150
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,840
You missed it, people.

151
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,700
You missed it.

152
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,560
This is what you missed.

153
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,780
There was dancing naked crazy women wearing nothing but neon.

154
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,340
There was a giant 20-foot tall neon man staggering around.

155
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,560
A huge robot from outer space.

156
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,280
An incredible light show.

157
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,080
And this!

158
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,060
And actually, that boomerang thing that he had.

159
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,860
That man from his back zone was propelled by them solar winds right there.

160
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,980
I think.

161
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,180
There was something else going on there.

162
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,900
Windy and wild.

163
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,300
Yeah, solar wind.

164
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,220
You got a hubcap down the sky.

165
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,440
You feel like a cow.

166
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:07,960
Yeah.

167
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,060
Get it off.

168
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,660
Bag it off.

169
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,800
Get it off.

170
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,500
Bag it off.

171
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,420
Get it off.

172
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,440
Get it off.

173
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,840
Get it off.

174
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:22,920
Get it off.

175
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:22,920


176
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:22,920


177
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:22,920


178
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,640
I'll have to play this some more next week.

179
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,800
Get it off.

180
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,900
Well, it's time to get it off now, but I think we're going to be stuck with it for a while.

181
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,220
However long it takes for the world to totally end.

182
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:45,420
We must get off even if we have to be blown off by an incredible solar hurricane.

183
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,080
Which is exactly what we're looking at.

184
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,260
Ride the tail of the comet, my friend.

185
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,380
Hee-haw!

186
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,680
How long before the novelty wears off?

187
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,060
You know, people go through regular, you know, hurricanes and stuff.

188
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,380
What would a solar hurricane really be like?

189
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,740
How many seconds would it last?

190
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,700
I figure we can work this into the world's scam for another six months or so, and then it's going to burn out.

191
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,420
I don't think so.

192
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,980
It looks very imminent right now.

193
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,700
It looks like something's really ready to happen quickly.

194
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,020
That would make sense.

195
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,400
Wouldn't that?

196
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:15,400


197
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,260
That just figures.

198
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,940
Bob would be off by five days.

199
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,820
Yeah, but Bob is one of those glass jars.

200
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:27,740
I think it's mostly his brain that's in there, but it looks like his body, like in that weird, what you call it, doll thing.

201
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,180
Get it off.

202
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,260
Okay, this is where all the weird subliminal gas is coming out.

203
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,360
Party life is 1966, my friend.

204
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,400
I really like the fact that it made them lose control of their salivary glands, though.

205
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,340
I didn't mind them really loading.

206
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,700
I didn't mind the high sub-sonics that made them have to go number 12.

207
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,980
But once them salivary glands started going, it was very hard to work up there on stage because it makes your strings go dry.

208
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,080
Makes my mouth water.

209
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,300
It makes them rushed out.

210
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,900
They oxidize from the saliva.

211
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:05,940
I'm going to have to wait one more year to hear her sing this song for real.

212
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,380
No, I think we might be getting taken home.

213
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,900
It's like the old folks home, or maybe the mean kids home.

214
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,220
What was it, the orphanages home?

215
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,040
That's where we're going, only we're going to be tortured at it.

216
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,400
The home for slackless children.

217
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,520
The home for tortured slackless children.

218
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,580
You won't believe the devices they got there Tuesday.

219
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,020
They got like these big racks, you know, like these inquisitional racks, only they're like expositional.

220
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,760
And they're just for you, Dave.

221
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,820
No, no, they're for all of us.

222
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,860
That's the problem.

223
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,200
You can't believe it, see.

224
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,800
We've got to come up with some kind of new religion or a new science.

225
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,380
Two and one.

226
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,700
Now to continue with the tape recording.

227
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,960
Take me home.

228
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,100
It was a pleasant Sunday afternoon.

229
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,820
Keep your hat on tight.

230
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,940
You're back to the wind.

231
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,120
And you're sacking the saddle.

232
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,200
Heads or tails and happy trails.

233
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,980
Open the Bombay door.

234
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,460
Let her rip.

235
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,260
I'm not going to wait.

236
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,460
The path of the righteous man is the same.

237
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,620
All my clothes are uncomfortable.

238
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,320
They pull me, they snatch me, and they let me down.

239
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,840
All my clothes are uncomfortable.

240
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,840
All my clothes are uncomfortable.

241
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,140
They eat me too loose or too tight.

242
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,940
They eat me too loose or too tight.

243
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,580
They never fit me just right.

244
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,060
All my clothes are uncomfortable.

245
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,960
All my clothes are uncomfortable.

246
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,000
All my clothes are uncomfortable.

247
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,960
All my clothes are uncomfortable.

248
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,000
Nothing left nothing for me.

249
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,760
Nothing left nothing for me.

250
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,500
Nothing left nothing for me.

251
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,740
Nothing is nothing for me

252
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,380
All my clothes are uncomfortable

253
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,420
All my clothes are uncomfortable

254
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,440
All my clothes are uncomfortable

255
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,300
All my friends are irresponsible

256
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,600
They need it to loose or too tight

257
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,600
Nothing is nothing for me

258
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,620
Ah, yes, dear friends.

259
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,060
Little Theodore.

260
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,180
That was indeed Little Theodore

261
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,640
with a F, not a TH.

262
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,280
Or you might pronounce it Fyodor.

263
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,440
But he pronounces it Little Theodore.

264
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,920
And the lovely babushka

265
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,940
live at the Dos Equis trip

266
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:57,860
XX Day Subgenius End of the World Drill

267
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,220
in 1999.

268
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,600
And friends, I'm just now starting to sort through

269
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,040
all the things that I've said.

270
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,500
What it takes from that miraculous failure of an event.

271
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,960
A failure in that, well, Bob,

272
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,680
whatever, for whatever reason,

273
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,280
the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

274
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,900
didn't show up.

275
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,700
Nay, nay, nay, okay.

276
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,780
And which is what we were talking about

277
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,480
on that radio show at the beginning of this radio show,

278
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,700
the July 8th Einstein Secret Orchestra

279
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,620
Swamp Radio Show on WCSB

280
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,780
in Cleveland, Ohio.

281
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,180
We've got more of that.

282
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,820
From the next, from last week's show.

283
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,740
Hey, see, this stuff is all packing up.

284
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
And I'm not even in Dallas, don't you see?

285
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,160
I'm traveling, trying to save souls

286
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,440
at the last minute before XXX Day,

287
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,340
July 5th, year 2000.

288
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,800
And so, we're, I'm on the road

289
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,400
and I don't have all my gear

290
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,580
and I don't even have Little Theodors

291
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,400
address for you.

292
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,880
You'll just have to look it up until next week

293
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,620
or call.

294
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,280
Stang at subgenius.com

295
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,200
and ask me then, next week.

296
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,420
Everything's fine.

297
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,980
Everything's just fine.

298
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,160
We're, right now, we're deep in the lair

299
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,160
of the Termite Queen

300
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,480
with Einstein Secret Orchestra.

301
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,120
And I don't know where exactly we're going to go

302
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,960
from this particular lair.

303
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,380
We have several different tunnels we could take.

304
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,160
I have excellent recordings.

305
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,280
You know, the kind of recordings

306
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,320
that you like.

307
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,760
The ones with the organs on them.

308
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:52,840
So, I hope Bob loves you, friends.

309
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,540
And we'll be back once we figure out

310
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,980
what to play next.

311
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,580
We'll be right back.

312
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:08,580


313
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:08,580


314
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:08,580


315
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:08,580


316
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:08,580


317
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,940
Friday, will you forgive me

318
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,740
for running off the Termite Queen?

319
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,400
Will you give him the super gravity

320
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,280
that he so desperately desires?

321
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,560
Yes, I forgive you.

322
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,920
Can I have my anti-matter from you, Auntie?

323
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,380
You can have my panty matter.

324
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,840
I have panty matter and can I lick

325
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,460
the wisdom to tate?

326
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,240
Yes, you can carve dice out of the wisdom

327
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,240


328
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,580
You've been licking on me wrong.

329
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:32,960
It's the only way I can keep my panty on.

330
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,000
I am the only one who can have panty on.

331
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,000


332
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,580
Can I wash the darkness off of you?

333
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,540
You can lick my whip.

334
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,060
My whip?

335
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,700
Man, she looks like my babysitter used to look.

336
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,460
As long as anybody's got a whip, I'll be there to lick it.

337
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,400
A lot of people say my prayers aren't answered.

338
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,480
People do not hear.

339
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,320
God does not understand.

340
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:02,980
I don't understand.

341
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,980
You know, nothing's going on when I'm praying.

342
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,860
It's because there's sin in your life.

343
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,180
The heavens turn to brass.

344
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,680
God turns his face.

345
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,580
He shuts his ears and his eyes.

346
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,480
And Nehemiah is saying, evidently, God hasn't been

347
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,940
listening as his people, the Jews, the Hebrews,

348
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,660
have been crying out to him.

349
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,080
The subgenius is saying.

350
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,680
It's the same way with Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

351
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,380
Oh, it's...

352
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:32,960
It's the same way.

353
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,780
John, we need you to go now.

354
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,700
daughters to follow box,

355
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:35,800
to follow means.

356
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,180
Exactly.

357
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:37,380
God abandoned thấy you.

358
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,980
Not click.

359
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,620
Yes, Jim.

360
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,020
You were so loud yet okay.

361
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,080


362
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,360
Kit your meat and flowing beyond kind.

363
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,740
Out of this bed.

364
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:50,740


365
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:50,740


366
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,360
I will, Macro l webinars.

367
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:52,360


368
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,480
Then trying so hard to reach.

369
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,940
It's me it over.

370
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,180
Oh my.

371
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,560
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise goddamn Bob!

372
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,680
Oh, yes!

373
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:21,360
And they said that X-Day didn't happen last year, that it was a failure.

374
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:31,760
And all your friends, it was a great success because we fooled the normals into thinking that the end of their world was going to be that easy.

375
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:41,620
Oh, hell, man, me and Chaz, Dave, we were dose-ecchi-us all along.

376
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,720
We knew it was really going to be 1999 and not 1998 or 2000.

377
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,340
And besides, you know, when you get...

378
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,660
Right down to it, really, Occam's razor comes to mind.

379
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,800
The simplest answer to a problem is usually the best.

380
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:07,520
And the simple answer may just be that, well, hard as it may be to believe, but...

381
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,140
Bob!

382
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,500
Uh, screwed up.

383
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,900
Yes! Yes, it's hard to imagine that J.R. Bob Dobbs could...

384
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,340
A preacher, a holy man, a holy man like Bob could lie...

385
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,460
But besides, on top of all that stuff, friends...

386
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:44,220
I guess some of those people that complained about the so-called failure of X-Day last year, maybe they just happened to miss that very first sentence at the top of the very first pamphlet that was published in 1979, and I don't mean the phrase $1.

387
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,020
Friends, at the top of that pamphlet, what does it say?

388
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,140
It says, the world ends tomorrow!

389
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,220
The world ends tomorrow and you may die!

390
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,080
Not the day after tomorrow, not on July 5th, 1998.

391
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,560
Tomorrow!

392
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:03,440
How many of you have been living your lives as if the world ends tomorrow?

393
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,860
Or else, as if you had all the time in the world?

394
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,900
Because if you ain't doing one or the other, you're wasting it all!

395
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,200
But who cares anyway, friends?

396
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,880
God damn it, we're religious nuts!

397
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:28,660
Did the Jehovah's Witnesses stop coming to your door just because their world didn't end those five or six times in a row?

398
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,240
Hell no!

399
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:34,280
Are we gonna let the Jehovah's Witnesses out-cook us?

400
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:34,940
Say no!

401
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,340
No, friends, we'll be the ultimate superstitious religious nuts.

402
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:48,580
But besides, when you get right down to it, isn't reality itself a superstition?

403
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,000
How ill-equipped I was for this.

404
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,760
I had started with the time machine on the absurd assumption that the men of the future would be infinitely ahead of ourselves.

405
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:03,720
I had come without weapons, without medicine, even without enough matches, of which only four remained.

406
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,480
Friends, we've activated the dome to protect the small encampment here.

407
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,900
It could come down at any time right now, but we have put over...

408
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,380
Don't leave the dome.

409
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,920
That's just my...

410
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,060
There are tornadoes tearing down cities.

411
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,240
There are cities all around us right now.

412
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,400
So please stay within this dome.

413
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,320
And it seems to have a few leaks.

414
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,800
But we'll work on that.

415
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,220
Yeah, does anybody have any glue and tape?

416
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,180
I'm gonna play some music.

417
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,540
You can dance and enjoy the prom.

418
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:50,880
At 7 o'clock, please join us for the ATF radio show, which is Reverend Ivan Stang, Papa Joe Mama, and Janeer Hypercleets will be broadcast here at 7.

419
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,200
At 7 o'clock, yes, sir.

420
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:53,980
What?

421
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,200
Oh, and we have one more crooner.

422
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,260
It's me again.

423
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:10,120
Actually, I'd prepared a little something that seems rather appropriate because we're here at a prom, and a prom is supposed to be for graduation.

424
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:17,360
And we graduate on Monday, and I can't sing.

425
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,380
Neither can anybody else, I know.

426
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,800
But strangely enough...

427
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,540
This little piece is based on something that has played on the radio.

428
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,720
Music?

429
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,140
Ready?

430
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,420
Read.

431
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,180
Okay.

432
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,560
Cue again.

433
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,340
Waste the power and beauty of your youth.

434
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,720
Oh, never mind.

435
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:41,300
The conspiracy spends inconceivable amounts of time and money trying to get you to waste your youth in a manner that benefits them.

436
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,040
But trust me.

437
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,160
In 20 years, you'll look back and realize you did squander your youth.

438
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,940
But with the aid of J.R. Bob Dobbs, you did it in a way that got...

439
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,720
You slacked, got your money and friends, and most of all, got you laid.

440
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,360
You are even more obsessed with sex than you can imagine.

441
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,220
And this is good.

442
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,860
Don't worry about the future, because the exes are going to come and take care of it all.

443
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:17,620
And even if they don't, you'll have a much better time partying with your choice of sex partner than if you sit around worrying about what they tell you is important on the news.

444
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,040
The real troubles in your life are the ones you have to deal with.

445
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,800
The ones thrown at you by the conspiracy, and they're going to hit you whether you worry about them or not.

446
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,160
Do one thing every day that pisses someone off.

447
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,400
Remember the words of Zardoz.

448
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,860
The gun is good, the penis is evil.

449
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,980
Be evil.

450
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,620
Remember to bathe regularly.

451
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,020
Don't waste your money on lottery scratch tickets or self-help courses.

452
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,400
Waste it on Bob.

453
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,020
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

454
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,660
Sometimes you give head, sometimes you take it from behind.

455
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,580
You do it long and hard, and in the end you only do it with yourself.

456
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,180
Remember the affairs you've had.

457
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,880
Forget the ones your mate had.

458
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:05,720
If you succeed in doing this, don't tell him or her.

459
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,020
It will save you a lot of headaches that way.

460
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,240
Keep your old tattoos and piercings.

461
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,500
Throw away your old pairs of underwear.

462
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,600
Extra meditate regularly.

463
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,820
At least once in your life, you must kill Bob.

464
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,020


465
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:27,260
Some people accomplish this at 22, while others don't kill him until they're 40 years old or more.

466
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,420
Don't worry about that moment until it actually happens.

467
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,360
When the time is right, you too will know that it's time for you to kill Bob.

468
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,640
Download plenty of bomb-making instructions from the internet.

469
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,620
You don't have to do anything with them, but just downloading them will piss off the conspiracy.

470
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,060
Bring your mind to the breaking point at least once.

471
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,980
You won't miss it when it's gone.

472
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,140
Maybe you'll have sex tonight. Maybe you won't.

473
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,480
Maybe you'll make love tonight. Maybe you won't.

474
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,700
Maybe you'll settle down with a sub-g mate.

475
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:07,260
Maybe you'll get arrested for molesting children and spend the rest of your life in prison as a sex toy for a guy named Bubba.

476
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,080
Whatever you do, don't stroke your ego too much, or else stroking it will be the only way you get any.

477
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,380
Your mate matters.

478
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,040
You are only one half of a man.

479
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,220
You're a couple, but so is everybody else.

480
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,380
Abuse your body. Test its limits in every way you can.

481
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:35,100
Don't be afraid to go to the edge, especially when the conspiracy warns you away, but don't kill yourself just because you can.

482
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:41,700
The exits may be coming, but it's up to you to make the time until they arrive worthwhile.

483
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,240
Have sex, even if you have nowhere to do it but your own living room.

484
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,400
Be naked in public at least once. It's a rush you won't regret.

485
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,220
I did, and the videos to prove it are on sale right over there.

486
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,960
Well, actually that's not true.

487
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,260
Stang edited my scenes out so that they won't hurt the video sales.

488
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,040
Accept certain inalienable truths.

489
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,180
Television lies, the conspiracy lies, and Bob lies.

490
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,640
But given a choice, whose lies would you rather believe?

491
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,540
Christianity is stupid.

492
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,900
Communism is good.

493
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,980
Give up. Give up.

494
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,600
Cut off all your hair at least once, just to see how it feels.

495
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:34,580
And finally, a word of advice for those of you who feel like going into your local high school and opening fire with a machine gun.

496
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,100
Wait until X-Day.

497
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:45,060
When the pleasure saucers arrive, then we'll finally have our chance to take it out on the ones who trapped us on this mud-hole planet.

498
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,880
I was all ready to go last July when I stood there and waited for the sex goddesses to come.

499
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,760
I thought they'd call in the convicts to rupture me away.

500
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,500
But Bob's screwed up and the saucers haven't arrived yet.

501
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:59,260
So I guess that means we've gotta find other ways to make life bearable under the conspiracy.

502
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:06,020
But if you can't wait and you go postal before X-Day, the conspiracy will destroy you.

503
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,780
You are not strong enough to bring down the conspiracy by yourself.

504
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,720
But as long as they don't consider you a threat,

505
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,580
then there's no reason why you can't live every day as if X-Day was just around the corner.

506
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,880
And it is a threat.

507
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,120
is just around the corner.

508
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,540
But trust me

509
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,540
on the $30.

510
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,580
Praise Reverend Modemac

511
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,200
and Aaron,

512
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,340
Reverend Aaron.

513
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,800
Come on!

514
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:44,240
Oh, praise Reverend Modemac.

515
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,000
Indeed, friends,

516
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,280
an amazing moment

517
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,660
from the subgenius prom.

518
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,900
Praise Jesus.

519
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:50,900
Praise Jesus.

520
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,060
I saved you all.

521
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,640
Praise Pope S. Lilith,

522
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,340
king and queen of the prom.

523
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,920
Anybody else want to sing a song?

524
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,820
Oh, spare us, oh Lord.

525
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,120
Sing.

526
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:06,040
Oh, there were some people

527
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,460
at this place last year

528
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,420
who seemed to be kind of pissed off

529
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,080
that they didn't get to destroy

530
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,840
the entire planet for $30.

531
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,800
They should be damn glad

532
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,740
that Heaven's Gate

533
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,640
didn't get to...

534
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:17,960
You're first!

535
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,260
Their whole goal

536
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,900
is to put a microchip

537
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,060
underneath the skin

538
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,060
of a person's hand or forehead.

539
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,800
And I was pretty amazed

540
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,920
because that's exactly

541
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,740
what the book of Revelation says,

542
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,400
chapter 13, chapter 13, chapter 13.

543
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,420
There are people out there

544
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,080
who are musicians

545
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,020
that may well like

546
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,060
to be involved in a group,

547
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,000
especially a group that tours

548
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,340
and reaches people for Christ.

549
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,940
How can they get a life?

550
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,980
They're very loving

551
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,200
and gentle little people.

552
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:47,960
Yes.

553
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,660
There's something terribly wrong with them.

554
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,380
How do you mean?

555
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,380
They seem to have the minds

556
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,480
of five-year-olds.

557
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,540
How do you expect them to be?

558
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,180
Far ahead of us, of course.

559
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,580
Incredibly ahead of us

560
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,720
in knowledge and in science.

561
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,980
Look at them.

562
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:00,960
Children.

563
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,100
They seem happy

564
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,500
in this huge garden of theirs.

565
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,180
If the Lord is going to come again,

566
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,380
well, what's going to happen

567
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,120
to my mother?

568
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,140
So pink and hard.

569
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,540
And remain into the coming...

570
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,660
Happy New Year!

571
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,320
Happy New Year!

572
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,320


573
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,100
The sun's sent us off.

574
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,540
Taking you little babies

575
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,620
full of cash

576
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,500
and old...

577
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,360
and old...

578
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:26,960
and old...

579
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:26,960


580
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,160
And you're carrying sips

581
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,820
walking, shuffling off

582
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,580
into the horizon.

583
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,560
New baby 1999

584
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,440
comes crawling around the bend.

585
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,120
His machine gun in one hand

586
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,480
and a crack pipe in the other.

587
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,640
And the old man 1998

588
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,640
with his broken bob pipe

589
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,140
and his crashed saucer.

590
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,640
No watering.

591
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,700
He wanted to go down into the pond.

592
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,060
His pink feathers, yeah.

593
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,620
Into the pond.

594
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,040
Into the pond with old man time.

595
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,980
I'm just calling to see what we can do about getting the pornography out of our stores.

596
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,820
What it was, I just walked in a store ten minutes ago,

597
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,440
and they had pornography magazines plainly in view right over the counter.

598
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,400
Nothing covering them up or nothing.

599
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,720
They're making money off a dial of porn.

600
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,860
If the Lord is coming, what's going to happen to those that are dead?

601
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,840
You are one light hour behind me.

602
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,200
One hour behind you.

603
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,440
You people have already moved into the future, and we're all hung up here.

604
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,520
You still have an hour to go, or a little less than that.

605
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:28,380
To reach the destination, the plateau, we have already stood upon.

606
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
Yeah, that's it.

607
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,460
You've already achieved the apotheosis.

608
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,620
You have reached the peak,

609
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:39,300
and we're still scrambling up the side of that damn sidereal mountain.

610
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,480
We haven't gotten anywhere near the peak yet.

611
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,420
Yeah, but it's in view.

612
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,860
The light's at the end of the tunnel.

613
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,380
Yeah.

614
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:45,580
Yeah.

615
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:45,820
You can sort of reach up to it.

616
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,260
You can focus on the light at the end of the tunnel.

617
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:48,740
Yeah.

618
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,320
I don't know.

619
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,220
That big, that four-foot...

620
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,160
Bong.

621
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,080
Bong.

622
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:54,680
Bong.

623
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,200
Bong.

624
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,600
Bong.

625
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:55,760
Bong.

626
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,420
At the end of the tunnel.

627
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,620
Rightening as the thought may be, it could happen.

628
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:10,220
As I explored the countryside with Wiener, seeking safety,

629
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,440
I fancied I could even feel the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet.

630
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,760
I could indeed almost see through it to the Morlocks scurrying below, waiting for the dark.

631
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,080


632
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,240
Wiener's fatigue grew upon her.

633
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,700
I took her in my arms.

634
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:33,360
Then, as the night embraced us, she put her arms around me.

635
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:39,400
We stopped at the edge of some woods, and she slept.

636
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,560
Looking up at the stars that suddenly dwarfed my own troubles,

637
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,600
I thought of the Eloi and the Morlocks,

638
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,660
and of how they must have forgotten their shared ancestry,

639
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,260
and how man as we knew him had been swept out of existence.

640
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:07,460
Then I was hungry, and for some reason connected it with the great fear that existed among the Eloi.

641
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,980
I shivered before I even knew why.

642
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,500
And then I broke into a sweat.

643
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,540
For the most part, I was not.

644
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,740
For the first time, I realized what the meat I had seen below might be.

645
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,960
The Eloi were the fatted cattle which the Morlocks tended and preyed upon.

646
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,240
What else could it be?

647
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,020
Bong, bong at the end of the tunnel.

648
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,240
Frightening as the thought may be, it could happen.

649
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:43,120
The sun will become dark, the moon blood red, the stars of the heavens will fall,

650
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,940
there'll be two major earthquakes that are going to be coming,

651
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,920
the islands and the mountains are shaken out of their sockets,

652
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,140
and the second one, no island, no mountain was found in the face of the earth.

653
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,260
It's all coming.

654
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,660
Yes, I'm ready now.

655
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,960
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times,

656
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:10,180
and think to yourself, there's no place like Bob.

657
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:14,940
Knowing her fate, Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the earth.

658
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,900
On board were the Twelve.

659
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,960
The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician,

660
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,820
and the other so-called gods of our legends.

661
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,000
But not Bob.

662
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,180
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind,

663
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,380
let us rejoice and let us sing and dance.

664
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,160
And there was much rejoicing and singing at X-Day.

665
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,340
But we'll have to wait another year.

666
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,000
Hail the sex goddesses.

667
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,500
Because they did show up at X-Day.

668
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,860
A new day.

669
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:56,280
Yeah, we went over the rainbow into the mitochondrial yeti DNA level C.

670
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,080
Well, we're going to have to go north and south and east and west.

671
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:06,200
And we've got to wait another year, yeah, but we're going to fill up a new pipe.

672
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,440
We're going to wait for the sun to shine.

673
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,280
We're going to turn around and take our time.

674
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,600
We're going to break the seal to the other side.

675
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,900
You know, from the valley, I hear the muffled cry

676
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,480
of all them poor sheeple that we left behind.

677
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,400
And we're going to take that next evolutionary step.

678
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,260
Yeah, we're going to climb on those rocket ships.

679
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,540
We're going to build the vessels if we have to.

680
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,620
We're already testing the engines.

681
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,100
We're already testing the systems needed for this trip.

682
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,760
We're on the ride, yeah.

683
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,780
Mitochondrial Eve, thanks for the ride.

684
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,640
We'll take it from here.

685
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,460
Oh, here, here, this is the video down feed from the rocket launch.

686
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,900
Launch the rocket ship.

687
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,060
Remember they were all chanting this together as we were lighting the fuse?

688
00:34:59,060 --> 00:34:59,880
Yeah, I do. Everyone was dancing.

689
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,080
Mojo and I were out there lighting rocket butt.

690
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:08,100
Mojo was wearing his 20-foot-tall robot, neon robot costume.

691
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,040
Oh, my God, they're trampled in film crew.

692
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,820
And I was in my dances with rockets, regalia.

693
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,380
Friday was wearing that sheer vinyl rubber outfit.

694
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,940
Well, if that was an outfit.

695
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,180
I think it was the part of the down.

696
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,840
I liked the women carrying the torches.

697
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,960
The real skin there.

698
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,680
The scantily clad women carrying the torches was my favorite part of it.

699
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,360
Launch the rocket ship. Launch the rocket ship.

700
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,780
How many days do we have left, Stang?

701
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:46,340
Oh, I think it's like only 11 months.

702
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,980
Launch the rocket ship. Launch the rocket ship.

703
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,300
11 months, 21 days, and 79 seconds.

704
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,000
Well, we got our work cut out for us, Mojo.

705
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,100
Until XXX day, friends, until we leave this dirtball Earth.

706
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,520
We've had one more slight miscalculation.

707
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,620
That was my uncle's name.

708
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,980
Hey, Mojo, you think we can hit orbital velocity by next year?

709
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:04,920
Sure.

710
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,100
How far do we want to go?

711
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,580
And how many do we want to take with us?

712
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,660
200 light years, 200,000 people.

713
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:12,500
Yeah.

714
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,500
And for $200,000.

715
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,300
$200,000 a piece.

716
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,540
200,000 people for $200,000 a ride.

717
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,120
Yeah, a piece.

718
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,420
You can't even get $30 out of that many people.

719
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,700
How are you going to get $1 each?

720
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,360
Well, there won't be a lot of people going, but, you know, that's not the thing.

721
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,780
You know, if you can come up with the cash, you can get out of here.

722
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,480
That's about it.

723
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,280
That's what...

724
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,160
Well, that's always been the message.

725
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,560
That was the message of the 5X day drills.

726
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,800
The problem is...

727
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:41,600
I've been seeing on the Internet and the outer spew and some of the other subterranean designs that keep all sub-rasa,

728
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,300
you know, like Captain Optimus and four eyes and all those kinds.

729
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:51,460
They were saying that it's conceivable that everything might end, like, in less than a year.

730
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,600
You know, you're saying 11 months and so many days.

731
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,140
Like, in 11 days, things could get real, real bad.

732
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,580
We got to take the elevator up by then, Daddy-O.

733
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,360
Well, they said...

734
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:00,640
Get on the bus.

735
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,360
There have been mistakes as far as encrypt-aggraving the, you know, the encyclicals.

736
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,420
And that the actual date was July 29th or something like that.

737
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,160
What?

738
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:11,640
1999.

739
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,460
Well, that's, you know, one of these cults I tapped into.

740
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:19,820
All I know is that I'll rise up to those saucers so light and clean and fluffy.

741
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,380
Clean?

742
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,640
You have been eating far too many Three Musketeers.

743
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,220
And speaking of three things, the third man on the moon, that's a spy term, baby.

744
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,360
Did you know that?

745
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,560
The third man.

746
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:32,980
That's...

747
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,260
He's not a man, but he's a spy.

748
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,080
Well, if he was the third man on the moon...

749
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,200
He was a subgenius spy.

750
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:37,980
He was.

751
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,340
He was a spy for Dallas.

752
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,000
I take my marching orders from Moscow.

753
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,120
But he was a spy for Dallas.

754
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,300
I'm sorry.

755
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,060
Oh, it's a cow...

756
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,500
Is it cowboys versus Yankees again, Dave?

757
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,620
I don't know.

758
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,980
You're going to get personal about it.

759
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,160
I don't know, Tovarish.

760
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:57,220
You know, you guys never want to split all the oil or the cows or any of the other wonderful things.

761
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,520
The Whippoorwills or them tumbleweeds or any of that stuff.

762
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,880
I know Vance Johnson for what he was.

763
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,120
And I know the dupes for what they was.

764
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,280
Yeah, you did.

765
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,080
And you didn't...

766
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,340
His great society in outer space came to pass.

767
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:18,620
But unfortunately, it was on the salt mines of Mercury where we have been sentenced.

768
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,760
Did you ever hear of the creatures of Jekyll Island?

769
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:26,140
I think I live on Jekyll Island.

770
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,680
Some of my best friends are preachers from Jekyll Island.

771
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,320
They're preachers from Jekyll Island?

772
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:30,860
Sure.

773
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,240
That's a big church there, too.

774
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:33,860
Yeah, really big.

775
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,540
They control it.

776
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,760
They get their $30 any time they want.

777
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,780
I know the preacher from the black legume.

778
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,280
The black legume?

779
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,940
I think that's...

780
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,500
The preachers from the black legume.

781
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,560
That's the Carson and Jack Bean people.

782
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,240
That's almost as good as Hideous Crack Baby.

783
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,440
Oh, that's my neighborhood.

784
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,440
No, that was my movie.

785
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,460
I was going to make Hideous Crack Baby.

786
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,180
Did you...

787
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,280
Were you going to use the huge pumpkin-headed people to portray...

788
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,400
Or Lumba, the body-less spine-free?

789
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,760
I was going to use my son.

790
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,780
Well, I didn't know he had any preternatal deformity.

791
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,560
My third son.

792
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,960
Oh, your third eye, I thought you were going to talk about.

793
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,280
My son by Friday.

794
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,120
Oh.

795
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,920
Hideous Crack Baby.

796
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,000
The wisdom eye.

797
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,420
Friday didn't do any crack.

798
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,260
Friday, straight arrow.

799
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,800
You just took the crack and jumped on him?

800
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,260
Just a crack of the whip.

801
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,760
Just a crack of the whip.

802
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,600
That's her crack.

803
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,580
The wisdom whip.

804
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,080
From what I hear about crack...

805
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:26,620
Somebody's slack.

806
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,180
If you don't lick the wisdom eye, you will feel...

807
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:29,180


808
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:29,860
You jumped right off.

809
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,920
You will feel the wisdom whip.

810
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,380
You will feel the wisdom whip.

811
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:32,380


812
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:32,380


813
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:32,620
Yeah.

814
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,240
I'm afraid that's what most people get, is the kiss of the wisdom whip.

815
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,420
And then they learn.

816
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,700
Try to get me her crack, though.

817
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,020
Oh, you got Dave excited now.

818
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,460
You're so glib with that third tongue and that third nostril right above them third eyes.

819
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,320
Your face you just put on all sideways.

820
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:50,780
Third time's the charm.

821
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,620
Have I showed you my third asshole?

822
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:53,880
Oh, my God.

823
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,760
Do we want to see it?

824
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,240
No, we don't.

825
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,020
I don't think anybody, the listeners, even want to think about it, because now we already

826
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,340
have.

827
00:39:59,340 --> 00:39:59,800
Yeah.

828
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,120
Now my dad ruined the rest of my evening.

829
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,800
That's all I'm going to be able to think about.

830
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,240
I'm looking into this big hole in this bottle.

831
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:06,740
Yeah.

832
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,000
He was drinking out of that tea.

833
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,920
I was going to smoke a cigarette now.

834
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:11,600
Yeah.

835
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,120
Man, I'm not going to be able to breathe through this hole in my face anymore.

836
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,140
Ain't touching that crack, Jack.

837
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,160
Stop thinking about that thing you mentioned.

838
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,040
Especially with your mojo, it's probably got all kinds of weird lights around it and rockets

839
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,220
and stuff and explosive things.

840
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,520
Explosive devices, trip wires.

841
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,560
They're about booby traps, bobby traps.

842
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,180
Now, sir, could you please pull down your pants and bend over the table here?

843
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,980
I'm not having no explosive devices in there.

844
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,800
There's no explosive devices in there.

845
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,940
Just don't think there's any kind of thing that's going to .

846
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,080
That's how Rocket Butt made it through customs.

847
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,260
Well, when I pass gas, shock diamonds come about 10 feet out the back.

848
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,240
That's all I can see.

849
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,440
Blue shock diamonds.

850
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,000
What's a shock diamond?

851
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,340
Like when you ever see a jet fly overhead really fast.

852
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,540
And as you look at it, it's like, oh, my God.

853
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,960
And you look at it as it's flying away from you, like at the air show, you'll see the

854
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,160
.

855
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,780
These blue shock diamonds.

856
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,380
Do they look like diamonds or just shimmer like stuff?

857
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,020
They just sit there.

858
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,420
It's like the air is so tortured, it glows.

859
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,140
Oh, that's a good image.

860
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,480
It almost looks digital, even.

861
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,920
It looks like some kind of an animation added to reality or something.

862
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,080
Well, you know what they say about the kind of propulsion devices and things they're using

863
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,320
now is alien science, alien tech.

864
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,340
Well, that doesn't sound very good.

865
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:28,480
I don't know.

866
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:28,820
It's very natural.

867
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,940
We're too dumb to make that stuff up.

868
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,240
Of course we had to get it from the aliens.

869
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,540
I know a lot of people that use shock wave patterns just to get stoned.

870
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,180
They can't do anything else anymore.

871
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,080
Nothing else works.

872
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,920
Yeah, my doctor gave me a lot of electroshock wave therapy, a mess of times, felt good.

873
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,100
That doesn't sound natural either.

874
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,440
This all sounds so like...

875
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,400
It's not very organic.

876
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,040
No.

877
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,600
Well, I don't know.

878
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,560
You got to get your juice.

879
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,960
Well, you guys are staring into a rocket button.

880
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,040
You're going to ruin your eyes.

881
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,240
Now, you know, I don't know.

882
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,520
Just sit there and watch.

883
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:58,520


884
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:58,520


885
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:58,520


886
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,080
It sounds like you don't want to get off a plane.

887
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,820
Come on, Dave.

888
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,460
You know, get cool, man.

889
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,200
Be a sophisticate.

890
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:04,640
Come on, now.

891
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,580
This show doesn't host the Brushwood Air Defense very often.

892
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,200
What does it matter?

893
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,120
Stang promised me my body wouldn't be good for you.

894
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,700
The views expressed here are solely those of myself and the cause.

895
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,000
They do not express the views of Cleveland State University or WCSB University, so if

896
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,120
the listener discretion is advised, turn your radio off.

897
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,680
Yeah, me too.

898
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:19,980
No, we did that.

899
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,800
I did that earlier, but I mean...

900
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,440
Don't do it enough.

901
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,200
It is legal.

902
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,660
You can use those words as long as you don't use them to mean what they mean.

903
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,320
Yeah.

904
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:32,620
Like, you couldn't, like, scream intercourse or defecation real loud, like, to pound the

905
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:32,620


906
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,440
No, you could, as long as you weren't talking about those things.

907
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:41,420
Well, if I were to pound the table, though, like I was cursing and going, ah, intercourse,

908
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,460
I stubbed my toe on it.

909
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,120
Yeah, that's okay.

910
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:43,940
Yeah, you can do that.

911
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,260
That's okay.

912
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:47,020
Just whatever you do, don't talk about anything, you know...

913
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,380
Don't use the F-word if you're talking about sex.

914
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,360
Don't get in it.

915
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,760
Give me them fornicating...

916
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,120
And it's not just words.

917
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:53,520
Cheese crackers.

918
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,400
It's the concepts.

919
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,420
It's a ban.

920
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:55,820
Okay.

921
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,760
Ban on concepts.

922
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,520
To even get people thinking about stuff.

923
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:58,860
Right.

924
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,380
It's a ban on concepts.

925
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,040
Like nipples, for instance.

926
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:02,740
That's...

927
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,480
Don't even get them thinking about it because that leads...

928
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:05,780
You know what?

929
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,600
That leads to...

930
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,820
Well, I'm already thinking about it, so you know it works.

931
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,340
The wisdom teat.

932
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,320
Yeah.

933
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,000
If you never mean what you say, then they can never get you.

934
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,900
God doesn't want competition.

935
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:15,440
I like that.

936
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,720
He doesn't want you to eat of that apple of knowledge.

937
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,300
He doesn't want you to...

938
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:19,900
If you never mean what they say...

939
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:27,360
Lick that wisdom eyeball or suckle the wisdom teat or excrete the wisdom fluids.

940
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,040
No, no, no.

941
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,300
He doesn't want you to stay ignorant and in the dark like a mushroom.

942
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,140
They want to feed you excrement and give you sandwiches sometimes.

943
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,220
He doesn't want you to know about that fig leaf.

944
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:36,940
No.

945
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,260
And believe me, you'd be happier if you didn't know about it.

946
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:40,920
You'd be...

947
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,660
You don't want to know.

948
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,260
You really don't.

949
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:43,780
But you're gonna.

950
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,080
You're gonna.

951
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,760
You're gonna know about that fig leaf.

952
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,320
I know you're gonna do it.

953
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,220
You're gonna know about it someday.

954
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,900
As soon as God said not to, that's when we...

955
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,160
He knew you were going to.

956
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,060
That's how he got you to do it.

957
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:56,620
Yeah.

958
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,260
So funny.

959
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,820
Cause he controls everything that ever happened.

960
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:00,440
He...

961
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,680
So, for you to even think about it is too hard.

962
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,280
Well, you suck a big dick, you...

963
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,120
You don't want to think of his sense of humor.

964
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,340
It's not very funny.

965
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:21,840
See, they once said that this God of this solar system was a clone.

966
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,400
And here's the part.

967
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,700
Here's where he came out.

968
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,960
Oh, look at the gigantic...

969
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,600
The little...

970
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,600


971
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,600


972
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,600


973
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,600


974
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,600


975
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,600


976
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,600


977
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,600


978
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,600


979
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,600


980
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,600


981
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,600


982
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,600


983
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,600


984
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:26,600


985
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,440
Robot man lying in knee.

986
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:28,880
Mojo.

987
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,300
With a dog's head plastered etched in his chest.

988
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,120
He's licked the eye.

989
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,320
Here comes No-Mo.

990
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,260
I mean, it's Mojo up onto the stage.

991
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,880
Here's a clone.

992
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,520
He is not alive.

993
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,160
His feet are bigger than his regular body.

994
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,280
So something's wrong with the cloning device.

995
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,620
He's electrocuting himself.

996
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,420
Some of them are shorting.

997
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,400
Now, three of them are shorting out.

998
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,660
The goth kids are going crazy.

999
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,400
Oh, my God.

1000
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,240
They're penetrating themselves.

1001
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,900
They're prostrating themselves.

1002
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:03,240
One little blind girl fell down on the floor.

1003
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,340
She's being trampled down.

1004
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,840
She's being trampled down.

1005
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,440
That's why we waited till tonight to tell you.

1006
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:08,700
Oh, this is terrible.

1007
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,480
Oh, my God.

1008
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,480
We cloned them.

1009
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:19,900
Just hundreds and hundreds of little Fridays dancing around the giant alien.

1010
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,100
There's no individuals left.

1011
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,260
The room is full of clones dancing.

1012
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,340
And as you see that,

1013
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,140
the prenatal fire's getting real bright.

1014
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,320
It's starting to burn around the edges of the tent.

1015
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,180
The smoke's getting...

1016
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,740
It's climbing higher now.

1017
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,740
Oh, my God.

1018
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,140
A thousand tiny Papa Joes.

1019
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,660
That's about 2,000 tiny Fridays.

1020
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,160
A thousand tiny Papa Joes.

1021
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,960
An endless civilization of pain.

1022
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,620
It's an ill description.

1023
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,460
A terrible thought to hold in your mind for longer than five seconds.

1024
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:52,980
At the sixth second,

1025
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,320
all those lower parts of your body start to release.

1026
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,040
You know, your sphincter and your gastrointestinal glands.

1027
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,840
They all start to release the biler fluids.

1028
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:06,420
And then those feisty, fighting, pain in the ass fluids.

1029
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,180
And you just...

1030
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,620
That's what happens.

1031
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,560
You get that feeling.

1032
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,920
This is hard medicine to swallow for some.

1033
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,060
Oh, we're back.

1034
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:26,560
We're back in the station.

1035
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,120
I can't get enough of it myself.

1036
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,580
Dave, shut the airlock.

1037
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,320
No.

1038
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,680
No, I already shut it, man.

1039
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,120
Stop leaving it open, man.

1040
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,900
Well, I think that red light is something else.

1041
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,980
I already shut the airlock.

1042
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,660
His moon pants are breached, too.

1043
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,060
If you leave the moon pants...

1044
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:40,240
Those ain't mine.

1045
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,100
If you leave the airlock open,

1046
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,880
Mojo and Friday will zip out through the little hole.

1047
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,960
Because Friday told me she wanted to zip out through the little hole.

1048
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,180
And Mojo is the zip that's flying out of the little hole.

1049
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,820
He's been looking for the little hole to zip out of for...

1050
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:55,340
Yeah.

1051
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,040
Yeah.

1052
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,660
Please tell me, is the devil still pursuing you?

1053
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,100
Is there still law?

1054
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,860
There's still law.

1055
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:05,580
Yes.

1056
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,560
But how can there be love without the father?

1057
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,960
He hasn't left us.

1058
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,040
That is what I will tell the others.

1059
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,900
That is what I will tell the others.

1060
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,220
That is what I will tell the others.

1061
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:23,900
That is what I will tell the others.

1062
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:27,720
That is what I will tell the others.

1063
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:27,720


1064
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:27,720


1065
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:27,720


1066
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,920
But friends, let's discuss the simple practical matter.

1067
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,120
It was so convenient last year

1068
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,880
when the world was supposed to end on Sunday.

1069
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,160
And this time, well, gosh,

1070
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:41,500
it just so happens to fall on a Monday.

1071
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,020
And I guess there are some folks who are saying to themselves,

1072
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,100
oh, well, I'm going to go to Brushwood

1073
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,800
and celebrate the coming cataclysmic judgment

1074
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,660
up until Sunday night.

1075
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,920
Up until Sunday.

1076
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,040
Up until Sunday night.

1077
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,280
Then I've got to be ready to go back to work

1078
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,480
by Monday morning at 8 a.m.

1079
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,320
just in case the exes fail to arrive at 7 o'clock

1080
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,440
like they did last time.

1081
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,000
Backslider!

1082
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,060
You are a backslider!

1083
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,000
You twist that knife.

1084
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,060
You have stuck that knife in the bob and twisted it.

1085
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,060
Twisted it!

1086
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,720
When you show such lack of faith.

1087
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,420
Because friends, as we all know,

1088
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,060
a subgenius cannot be ruptured

1089
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,840
while it is clocked in

1090
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,540
and working,

1091
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:26,940
for the conspiracy.

1092
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,340
So, Sunday night and Monday morning,

1093
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,640
are you going to let your stinking earth job

1094
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,880
come before eternal salvation?

1095
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,200
Why should you?

1096
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,020
Do you really think that job's still going to be there after all?

1097
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,960
And no matter what happens,

1098
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,080
God damn it,

1099
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,820
the other religions all have their religious holidays.

1100
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,980
We only ask for one.

1101
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,040
July 5th is our main religious holiday.

1102
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,820
Therefore, you should get off work paid.

1103
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,000
And you should insist on it.

1104
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,300
And if you don't, you're pink.

1105
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,940
So I don't want to see any of you faithless fuckers

1106
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,900
leaving this campground Sunday night.

1107
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,880
We'll be up at the top of the hill

1108
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,220
mocking you.

1109
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,000
If you can't get off earth,

1110
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,680
at least get off work.

1111
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,200
At some time,

1112
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,400
in the track of human decay,

1113
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,820
the Morlocks' food would have to have run short.

1114
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,240
The beasts of the field,

1115
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,400
as provided so generously in the Bible,

1116
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,280
had run their course.

1117
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,920
Possibly the Morlocks had lived for a time

1118
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,520
on rats or other vermin.

1119
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,560
Or perhaps,

1120
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,980
man's prejudice against human flesh

1121
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,380
is not a deep-seated instinct after all.

1122
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,420
All the while,

1123
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,620
Weena slept beside,

1124
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,040
unable to conceive of her fate.

1125
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:55,180
Some of you, I know,

1126
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:55,180


1127
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:55,340
somehow,

1128
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,300
the Eloi knew to fear the Morlocks.

1129
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,600
But not why.

1130
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,400
But you know, every...

1131
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:17,340
Gosh, it seems like every X day is the same, friends.

1132
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,480
Only a few hours left to go,

1133
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,160
and yet we still run around going through our days

1134
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,160
acting as if all those words were true.

1135
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,340
As if all those bills had to be paid.

1136
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,180
As if we had to keep on acting civil,

1137
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,640
or even human.

1138
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,060
As if we even had to keep wiping our butts.

1139
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,700
But yet it really is coming.

1140
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,920
Of course it is coming.

1141
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,720
It's so hard to believe.

1142
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,940
It's so hard to believe because maybe it's just

1143
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,300
too good to believe.

1144
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,220
Maybe that's the problem.

1145
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,040
Maybe it's just too good for us

1146
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,600
lowly, wretched subgeniuses

1147
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,920
to believe that it could happen.

1148
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:58,560
That a mere $30 in Bob's pocket

1149
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,500
would buy us a spaceship

1150
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,460
the size of a planet.

1151
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,240
Each!

1152
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,860
Or to buy us...

1153
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,520
revenge, my friends.

1154
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,320
Revenge!

1155
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,560
Well, for those that are into that,

1156
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,580
personally, I'll probably kill a few of my old enemies

1157
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,740
and then I'm out of here, man.

1158
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,380
I'm off.

1159
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,860
I will get off, my friends!

1160
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,100
I will get off!

1161
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,320
And if the X is...

1162
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,540
Hell, I'm gonna stay right here at Brushwood

1163
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,380
until I get off, until I get my escape vessel.

1164
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,220
And I hope I see you

1165
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,540
here Monday morning,

1166
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,600
July 5th, 1999, if...

1167
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:40,560
you know,

1168
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,880
maybe just even if we don't see each other

1169
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,540
here at Brushwood, we'll see each other on the saucers.

1170
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,760
Once you get your saucer, invite me over, would ya?

1171
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,760
Invite me over to my saucer, just so...

1172
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,900
Hey, Reverend Stang!

1173
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,440
And Muam will telepathically beam that message into my head.

1174
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:02,780
He'll forward it like email.

1175
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,700
Come on over to my joint, Reverend Stang.

1176
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,620
We'll have us a party.

1177
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,720
I got a real good Martian Grand Canyon I built here.

1178
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,700
I made trees look like Salvador Dali trees.

1179
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,080
And I got the best prop in the universe.

1180
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,260
Muam said,

1181
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,240
We'll party, man!

1182
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,180
And if I happen to be enjoying building my own Grand Canyon

1183
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,360
on my escape vessel,

1184
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,680
I'll just send a robot in my place.

1185
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,380
My buddy'll never know the difference.

1186
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,640
All of this, friends, all of this,

1187
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,180
for a measly $30.

1188
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,340
And every one of you here paid it, I betcha.

1189
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,360
Welcome aboard, friends.

1190
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,480
Now, recently,

1191
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,200
well, actually, it was a few years ago,

1192
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:49,080
Bob Dobbs said to his young ward,

1193
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,000
Onan Canobite, who's probably here,

1194
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:53,800
he said,

1195
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,700
Onan, I'm gonna pose you a riddle.

1196
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,420
How many conspiracies,

1197
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,100
it's kind of a joke,

1198
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,440
how many conspiracies does it take

1199
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,800
to oppress all subgeniuses

1200
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,960
all over the entire world, all through history?

1201
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:09,840
One!

1202
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,140
One is all it takes!

1203
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,040
And he said,

1204
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,260
Onan, do you know what the one thing

1205
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:20,120
that all of your enemies have in common?

1206
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:21,900
You!

1207
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,220
You!

1208
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,240
If I, never mind.

1209
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,520
We'll do it when we do it.

1210
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,280
Kill him all up.

1211
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,600
We're basking in slack right now.

1212
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:32,840
Oh yeah, look at his bass.

1213
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,640
He just basking right out,

1214
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,960
hanging out in the open.

1215
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:36,880
How come we never

1216
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,360
discussed the basks problem?

1217
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,320
And the bass situation?

1218
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,240
The poor bass people have been a people

1219
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,460
for nine, six, thousand years now,

1220
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,260
and the Spaniards and the Frenchies

1221
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,460
always want to keep them in their,

1222
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,040
you know, in their little hilly towns.

1223
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,740
Like the squabbles of mites on a plum.

1224
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,740
on. Yeah, I'm sorry.

1225
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,500
Well, didn't the Nazis go to the trouble

1226
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,520
to bomb them? The Basques?

1227
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,580
Like in the Spanish Civil War? Yeah, so they're

1228
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:00,340
not completely ignored.

1229
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,260
The Nazis bombed everybody like we do.

1230
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,560
Well, that's true. Because the people

1231
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,560
there get bombed, so they think it's the right

1232
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,540
thing to do, is drop bombs on everybody

1233
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,460
else. We just drop a

1234
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,600
bass call down into the water

1235
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,640
and they'd come right up to it. Oh, a bass call.

1236
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,440
Oh, a fish call.

1237
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,180
Swim up with their little snorkel fins

1238
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:21,100
and their skin diver suits

1239
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,280
and then we'd just drop dynamite

1240
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,160
in and stun them. It usually didn't kill

1241
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,980
them, but they'd float to the top, belly up.

1242
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,980
Then you'd just go around and whack them.

1243
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:29,980
You'd dig them.

1244
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,660
And lift them up into the boat.

1245
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,980
In Japan, they get some of them mermaids that way?

1246
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,520
In Japan, they just

1247
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,840
fry them mermaids whole. They're still

1248
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,220
squiggling. My houseboat don't smell like

1249
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:43,240
fish for that reason.

1250
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,460
What reason do they smell like fish for?

1251
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,760
Where'd Dave go?

1252
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,080
He fell.

1253
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,540
He fell into a... Wow, you just kind of

1254
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:54,640
dissipated there. Dave, we were looking right...

1255
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,960
Both of us were staring right at you

1256
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,180
and you just sort of like...

1257
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,580
It sounded like a hole he zipped out.

1258
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,540
He had hair around it and he fell right in.

1259
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,800
We could see through you for just a second

1260
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,360
there, too, and your voice seemed

1261
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,840
really far away. Well, that's...

1262
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,760
I was fading into another dimension now.

1263
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,920
You were in your interdimensional shifts, but I was

1264
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:13,400
thinking about...

1265
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,280
I want to go to the first dimension.

1266
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,640
I was a low D. I was...

1267
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,700
I want to go to the first dimension. I just want to go to the

1268
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:22,700
point. Well, that's what they said

1269
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,540
God originally was, was just a point.

1270
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,780
Don't you have to mix two...

1271
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,580
Look at your head in the mirror sometimes, Chad.

1272
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,300
...with ice and PCP to be

1273
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,200
one-dimensional, to really just...

1274
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,900
Really. ...get down to the point. That is true.

1275
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:36,140
If you were to take a lot of PCP, you would understand

1276
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:37,600
being a one-dimensional creature.

1277
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,520
You would. You do. You are.

1278
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,540
That's what they are. See, that

1279
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,240
means a bunch of people in different dimensions

1280
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,420
coexist with us. Help, I'm a rock.

1281
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,360
Jump in a black hole,

1282
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,980
and you'd find out what one dimension is.

1283
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:52,460
Mm-hmm. Just squash down a little singularity.

1284
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,280
Yeah, but how could you do that, you know,

1285
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,200
conceivably without astral traveling?

1286
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,840
Just jump. Just jump.

1287
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,780
People just lack the courage to just jump.

1288
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,980
Just follow Bob into the abyss.

1289
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:04,620
Look for that blindfolded

1290
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,520
man with a pipe, and follow him

1291
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,500
off that cliff. Just jump. So you're saying

1292
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,200
the abyss is all around us, right?

1293
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,640
That there's nothing above or below?

1294
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,660
Find yourself a black hole and jump.

1295
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,460
That easy. You can make the black

1296
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,740
hole at home in your kitchen.

1297
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,900
How do you do that with a little bit of

1298
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,820
vinegar and baking soda? Well, there's a few

1299
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,960
other ingredients. You need a little neutron matter.

1300
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,600
I don't know. I've heard a bit of

1301
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,780
disgusting on the radio. These kids will try that at home.

1302
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,320
You need one of those reverse centrifuges

1303
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,940
that create suction instead

1304
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:34,080
of an outward... Oh, you have a little bit

1305
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,460
of panty matter. You can do it in a funny way.

1306
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,360
Panty matter would work. Panty matter works fine.

1307
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,600
I heard if you put a hand of glory

1308
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,780
in a microwave and just let it go for about

1309
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,820
six hours... You get a glory hole.

1310
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,260
You get a glory hole.

1311
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,940
That's right. And anything will go into that.

1312
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:49,860
And anything comes out of it, so there,

1313
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,340
you go. It always...

1314
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:53,780
It always comes out the

1315
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,020
other side. Who's got the panty

1316
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,560
matter? Friday's got to have some.

1317
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,680
She's got a myth. She's

1318
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,820
disappeared again. Well, she

1319
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,960
probably fell into another one. She's playing the guitar

1320
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,380
and that her in the background.

1321
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,680
Oh, let's listen to her.

1322
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,180
She's rocking, man.

1323
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,460
She's really good.

1324
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:14,080
For somebody who doesn't

1325
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,700
frop, she's a damn good

1326
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,460
guitar player.

1327
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,240
Yeah.

1328
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,080
Yeah.

1329
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:18,100
Yeah.

1330
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:19,540
Yeah.

1331
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:19,740
Yeah.

1332
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:19,960
Yeah.

1333
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:19,960


1334
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:19,960


1335
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:19,960


1336
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:19,960


1337
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:19,960


1338
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:19,960


1339
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:20,040
Yeah.

1340
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:20,900
Yeah.

1341
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:20,900


1342
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:20,900


1343
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:20,900


1344
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:20,900


1345
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:20,900


1346
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:20,900


1347
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,580
She's really good.

1348
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:22,540
Right.

1349
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:25,900
Well, not...

1350
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,820
Actually, this was a solo part that nobody

1351
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,820
played a solo in. Everyone did rhythm.

1352
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,340
Listen, listen.

1353
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,900
There was supposed to be solos in there,

1354
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,920
but Dave played rhythm, Michelle played

1355
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,240
rhythm.

1356
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,600
I was doing a solo, but it wasn't a

1357
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:39,720
music point.

1358
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,600
Mojo was doing the solo. That's who was

1359
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,160
doing the solo.

1360
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,560
That skin flute solo right there.

1361
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,480
Skinny on a skin flute.

1362
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,700
That's what I was doing.

1363
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:49,180
That's what you're going to do.

1364
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:49,380
That's what you're going to do.

1365
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:49,940
That's what you're going to do.

1366
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:49,940


1367
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,740
See, that's what happened to what's-his-name, the third man on the sun.

1368
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,780
Who was the third man to walk on?

1369
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,360
Pete Conrad.

1370
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,460
Pete Conrad.

1371
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:57,920
All hail Pete Conrad.

1372
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,780
Praise Pete Conrad and rest in space, hopefully.

1373
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,300
You are on.

1374
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,560
You are on.

1375
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:06,340
We're on.

1376
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:12,400
From up here in the escape vessels, we see the Earth blinking and winking down below.

1377
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:17,420
There are some garbled signals, though, coming through as we look out the windows.

1378
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:22,260
Either the moon or the planet Mercury was passing across the sun's disk.

1379
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,940
Naturally, at first, I took it to be the moon.

1380
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:32,900
But there's much to incline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to the Earth.

1381
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,480
The darkness grew apace.

1382
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:41,700
A cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts from the east, and the showering white flakes in the air increased in number.

1383
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,520
From the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper.

1384
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,340
Beyond these lifeless sounds.

1385
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,480
The world was silent.

1386
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:51,800
Silent?

1387
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,620
It would be hard to convey the stillness of it.

1388
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:59,160
One by one, the distant peaks vanished into blackness.

1389
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:04,240
Shadow of the eclipse crept toward me, and the sky was absolutely black.

1390
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:08,440
A horror of this great darkness came on me.

1391
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:16,500
I felt I was fainting, but a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote and awful twilight sustained me while I climbed back into the time machine.

1392
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:24,620
One day I was completely engulfed.

1393
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:28,340
But this ancient human mastiff stood back and assured me, while a tattered cloud of

1394
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:33,420
light Traveled energetically free?

1395
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,780
Did he have some okay?

1396
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:43,820
Never mind.

1397
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,240
Oh, you told him!

1398
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:51,900
of my gauge ran back to the starting point, the old familiar walls of the laboratory came

1399
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:57,420
around me, and very gently now, I slowed the mechanism down, and I stopped.

1400
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:14,680
And found myself in the lair of the hour of slack of the church of the subgenius and friends

1401
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:25,600
for information on the church of the subgenius and all its evil children and progenitors.

1402
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:31,440
Please write a to him about that.

1403
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:43,240
Post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

1404
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:49,100
75214.

1405
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:51,940
Pull that chain.

1406
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,280
75214.

1407
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:06,320
And friends, we've been listening to a lot of Einstein's Secret Radio from the WCSB Swamp Radio show

1408
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:10,340
of July 15th after XX Day.

1409
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:14,400
We've been hearing live recordings from XX Day, the DeVival.

1410
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,040
Also with ESO in the background.

1411
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,520
Why he's just so nepotistic around here.

1412
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:27,460
And some old red tape on books of the time machine, H.G. Wells' fantastic classic,

1413
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:31,120
which I've probably read about a dozen times.

1414
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:38,600
And friends, it's just so okay to be back on Earth still.

1415
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:39,620
Darn it.

1416
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,060
You know, we'll make do.

1417
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,300
We'll make do.

1418
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:44,660
We'll make do.

1419
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:44,660


1420
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:44,660


1421
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,140
One more year.

1422
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:52,240
In the background is Einstein's Secret Orchestra CD, their first CD, Swamp Radio.

1423
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,440
Actually, it's called Witch Disco.

1424
01:01:55,560 --> 01:02:06,360
And you can write for information on Einstein's Secret Orchestra at P.O. Box 81555, Cleveland, Ohio.

1425
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:12,460
That's Box 81555, Cleveland, Ohio.

1426
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:12,460


1427
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:18,980
4-4-1-8-1.

1428
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:28,560
Ah, yes, and we'll be back next week with The Trial of Papa Joe Mama.

1429
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:33,600
Yeah, although I've got to go to Starwood in between.

1430
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:35,860
No telling what could happen there.

1431
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:39,260
Talk about the lair of the termite queen.

1432
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,360
Oh, lordy, lordy, lordy.

1433
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,080
Hey, casburgh, what's the fourth you got here?

1434
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:47,280
Tell us what happened.

1435
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:47,280


1436
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:47,280


1437
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:47,280


1438
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:47,280


1439
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:47,260
