1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,420
You will hear an important message prepared by Director J. Edgar Hoover.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,400
Who are you?

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,640
Of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,120
Who are you?

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,760
J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,440
has prepared this following important message.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,780
In case of the hour of slack, remain disturbed.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,080
Do not act normal so far as possible.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,660
But now let me tell you a story that I think will tug at your heartstrings as it did mine.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,700
The Self-Genius Hour of Slack.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,700
Shut up, listen.

12
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,840
Listen, I tell you.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,740
Not much else you can do anyway with this show, I suppose.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,760
Tonight, if it is night where you are,

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,360
we're replaying such bits and pieces of the recent Winter Star Symposium devival

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,300
as are suitable for airplay and or sex play.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,980
It was a very unusual...

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,300
unusual devival in that it climaxed in a celebration not of Bob,

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,660
but of microorganisms.

20
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,060
Well, we had to get it out of our systems.

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,240
Or I did, anyway.

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,120
I wish I could get this cold out of my system.

23
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,860
I guess that's what I get for fiddling with microorganisms.

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,740
Anyway, my main co-devivalist at Winter Star was the singer Reverend Fat Man D,

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,160
a fantastic torch singer and bulldog dartist

26
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,860
who at the end was joined by her husband, Tommy,

27
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,740
and I was able to get him to play for me, Amoeba,

28
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,320
more microorganisms there,

29
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,000
after I showed and narrated my new bug-porn video production

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,800
starring my flea circus,

31
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,540
which are on youtube.com slash RevStang channel.

32
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,880
Anyway, we will be playing a new song from the Psychoskeletons

33
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,740
and more songs from a guy that Dr. Legume turned us on to,

34
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,960
the singer Jonathan Colton.

35
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,440
Furthermore, we shall hear brief bits of Witch Disco

36
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,640
performing at Winter Star with former members of Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

37
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,380
and a few other...

38
00:01:59,380 --> 00:01:59,760
collages.

39
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,800
by the large Sweetness McGee and by Lee Murr,

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,560
who did our titles,

41
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,000
and they put all that stuff, peppers, the mix.

42
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,560
There's even some puzzling evidence.

43
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,860
But first, the news.

44
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,160
From PR News in Washington,

45
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,800
I'm popular among Western journalists and contractors.

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,820
Lebanon's Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri says he does not suspect families were near major hotels.

47
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,260
One hotel is crushing a Shiite revolt in the Mediterranean today.

48
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,100
EU leaders say their priority is more corruption,

49
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,980
a proposition that's been controversial

50
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,780
because of...

51
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,560
PR News shissels.

52
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,480
The Dow Jones 43-10-2-16-9.

53
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,640
A real estate trade group says this is PR News.

54
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,960
It reflects a big drop in demand since last month.

55
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:46,260
The National Association says 61% of its members will expand by more than 2%.

56
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,220
That's despite PR News in the U.S.

57
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,300
President Obama is trying to find a job.

58
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,060
The president has been caring for elderly relatives,

59
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,520
and that does not include PR News Washington.

60
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,040
Last week, I left a note on Laura's desk.

61
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,100
It said I love your signed, anonymous friend.

62
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,540
Turns out she's smarter than I thought she was.

63
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,300
She knows I wrote it, now the whole class does too.

64
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,840
And I'm all alone during couples informed.

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,660
When she skates by with some guy on her arm

66
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,320
But I know that I'll forget the look of pity in her face

67
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,980
When I'm living in my solar dome on a platform in space

68
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,000
Cause it's gonna be the future soon

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I won't always be this way

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,600
When the things that make me weak and strange get engineered away

71
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,760
It's gonna be the future soon

72
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,540
I've never seen it quite so clear

73
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,880
When my heart is breaking I can close my eyes

74
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,660
It's already here

75
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,020
I'll probably be some kind of scientist

76
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,300
Building inventions in my space lab in space

77
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,840
I'll end world hunger, I'll make dolphins speak

78
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,520
I'll make dolphins speak

79
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,220
Work through the daytime, spend my nights and weekends

80
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,340
Perfecting my warrior robot race

81
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,720
Building them one laser gun at a time

82
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,560
I will do my best to teach them about life and what it's worth

83
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,240
I just hope that I can keep them from destroying the earth

84
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,300
Cause it's gonna be the future soon

85
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,160
I won't always be this way

86
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,520
When the things that make me weak and strange get engineered away

87
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,900
It's gonna be the future soon

88
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,820
I've never seen it quite so clear

89
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,100
When my heart is breaking I can close my eyes

90
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,220
It's already here on earth, they'll wonder

91
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,540
As I piece by piece replace myself

92
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,760
And the steel and circuits will make me whole

93
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,380
But I'll still feel so alone

94
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:29,520
And I'll still feel so alone

95
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:29,520


96
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:29,520


97
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,200
Until Laura calls me home

98
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,980
I'll see her standing by the monorail

99
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,240
She'll look the same except for bionic eyes

100
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,740
She lost the real ones in the robot wars

101
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,780
I'll say I'm sorry, she'll say it's not your fault

102
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,660
Or is it?

103
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,300
And she'll eye me suspiciously

104
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,440
Hearing the word of the servos inside

105
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,120
She'll scream and try to breath

106
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,700
But there's nowhere she can't hide

107
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:16,160
When a crazy cyborg wants to make you his robot bride

108
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,360
Well it's gonna be the future soon

109
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,180
And I won't always be this way

110
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,840
When the things that make me weak and strange get engineered away

111
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,880
It's gonna be the future soon

112
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,640
I'll see her standing by the monorail

113
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,780
I've never seen it quite so clear

114
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,180
And when my heart is breaking

115
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,080
I can close my eyes

116
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,380
It's already here

117
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,040
The Future Soon by Jonathan Coulton

118
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,720
The future actually begins at July 5th, 1998 by the way

119
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,300
But isn't that a truly subgenius song?

120
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,420
Our friend Dr.

121
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,960
Legume, who is doing fine by the way,

122
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,940
came to Cleveland to see this guy perform

123
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,640
and tried to get me to go on account of,

124
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:05,920
as he put it,

125
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,820
Jonathan Coulton is the ultimate subgenius songwriter

126
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,020
and probably doesn't even know he's a subgenius

127
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,700
When I finally got to listening to Coulton in headphones,

128
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,680
which is the only way I can hear lyrics,

129
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,420
I realized he was right and so will you

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,800
during the next few hours of Slack

131
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,460
You can get tons of music at jonathancoulton.com

132
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,020
and that last name is spelled C-O-U-L-T-O-N

133
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,480
He's also in Wikipedia

134
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,260
as is the Church of the Subgenius and Hour of Slack

135
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,340
But now, let us high our heinies to the recordings of Fat Man B

136
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,340
singing at the Winter Star Symposium 2010, DeVival

137
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,520
Friends, I'm at the very irreverent island of Stang

138
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,580
Yay, back in the days of 1995 by the reckoning of the Pinks

139
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:10,060
It was a cold day in February and I was gonna do the biggest show of my life

140
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:20,040
300 people would gather that day to hear the brandings and vocal stylings of Ivan Stang

141
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,960
So I decided I would shave my head and bald I approached

142
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,360
the following ten years

143
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,040
Only when Bush was re-elected was I thrown into a deep depression

144
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,560
We'll have to finish this later

145
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,700
J'ai un grand tatou

146
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,740
J'aimerais se rasspercir par bord de boue

147
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:47,860
Le bon Dieu sait qu'est-ce que je voudrais avec mes grands, grands tatous

148
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,020
J'espère les yeux ne peuvent pas se hide away

149
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,020
Les yeux me font un tatou

150
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,420
Nunque vous l'avez vu

151
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,040
J'aimerais maintenant pas vous le現rer

152
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,220
Enjoy your Dames et niem caloros

153
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,320
I've been to the kitchens, we're throwing zu ‌es

154
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,760
My Katoura and my Switch ‌o, my Herm middle ear

155
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,240
Let the Dames and my Switch ‌et all

156
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,240


157
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,300
Ch cigar hop merely behind my back

158
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,220
Don't stop now, stop here

159
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,300
Trying to get on the games

160
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,000
Exźしました s koy22

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000


162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000


163
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,840
Des matchés

164
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,100
Ha, ha, ha.

165
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,140
Thank you so much.

166
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,600
The Church of the Subgenius has, like any religion,

167
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,660
we have our own holidays and stuff

168
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,480
that usually correspond to whatever the existing holidays were.

169
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,500
The Christians did that with Christmas.

170
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,820
It was a Roman holiday, and they used it.

171
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,600
Well, Valentine's Day, we don't really have a Valentine's Day

172
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,000
in the Church of the Subgenius,

173
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,780
but we have a holiday that happens to fall on the same day,

174
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,500
Anal Sex with Cashiers Day.

175
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,280
And I was a little worried because, you know,

176
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,900
Atwood is closing down shortly after all this.

177
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,260
This will be the last thing at Atwood per se.

178
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,700
Somebody else may buy it.

179
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,440
We'll probably find another place.

180
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,680
But, yeah, there are cashiers working.

181
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,740
There's one at the desk, one at the bar, one at the gift shop,

182
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,200
and probably another one.

183
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,360
So, you know, let those cashiers know how you value them tomorrow.

184
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,080
What if it gets them pregnant?

185
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,560
Well, I guess that's what you'd need that short-duration marriage for.

186
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,680
No, you can't get them pregnant with anal sex.

187
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,360
What if they get you pregnant?

188
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,360
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

189
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,500
Man, we'll use the face healing, I guess.

190
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,580
Okay, we took care of the spanking.

191
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,860
You know, I have a problem with faith healing, not face healing.

192
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,360
In fact, last night my friend Gail was talking about that movie,

193
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,800
What the Bleed.

194
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,920
Do We Know, which I personally consider to be hogwash through and through,

195
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,860
up one end and down the other.

196
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,440
But I'm not a regular proper pagan.

197
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,740
I don't really believe in most of this stuff.

198
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,500
I'm kind of from a secular humanist.

199
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,540
Of course, I believe in Bob, I believe in slack,

200
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,600
I believe in bizarre, magical, crazy things that happen,

201
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:45,160
and monsters from outer space and so forth, you know.

202
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,780
But eventually I realized it sunk in well.

203
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,800
Faith healing doesn't.

204
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,260
It does actually work, even if it's not, no medicine that is involved.

205
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,120
If people believe they're going to get better, they often get better.

206
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,420
And so I started taking that to heart.

207
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,580
And now I'm hooked on placebos.

208
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,240
So be careful.

209
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,980
Don't go down that road.

210
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,560
There's, and then luckily Bob Dobbs,

211
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,580
J.R. Bob Dobbs, who flashes by every now and then on the screen there,

212
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,600
he's the perfect placebo.

213
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:31,520
And the conspiracy is the imaginary disease that Bob is a placebo for.

214
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,760
Now, when we talk about the conspiracy, you know,

215
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,860
every weird cult talks about some conspiracy or another.

216
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,500
And, you know, it might be the UFOs hidden at Area 51,

217
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,640
or the Kennedy assassination, that's a good one,

218
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,860
or the newer one is the 9-11 truther conspiracy.

219
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,660
And those are all true, whichever, you know,

220
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,980
there's enough conspiracies that you can have your own, very own conspiracy.

221
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,180
There's so many of them you can believe anything you want.

222
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,660
But the real conspiracy that we're talking about, the worst one, the scariest one,

223
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,160
is the one that doesn't even know it's a conspiracy.

224
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,660
It's the conspiracy of the plain, ordinary, normal people who don't like surprises.

225
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,400
They don't like things that are different and weird that they don't understand.

226
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,220
Now, some of us, that's the first thing that we're interested in,

227
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,020
weird, disgusting, horrible things that creep us out.

228
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,000
It's like, oh man, something new.

229
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,080
I'm a monster fan from way back in...

230
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:42,040
But the thing is, though, every one of us, no matter how true to Bob we are,

231
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,960
there's a part of us inside that's just a nasty conspiracy pink boy.

232
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,880
A normal.

233
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,180
A mediocritan.

234
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,900
The Barbies and Kens, we call them.

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,080
The cage dwellers.

236
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,020
We have so many...

237
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,880
We have almost as many bad words for them as they have for us weirdos.

238
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,340
Which basically is what this is all about.

239
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,620
Church and subgenius is a church for weirdos.

240
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,560
Plain and simple.

241
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,780
You can be a pagan, you can be a scientist, you can be a scientist pagan.

242
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,360
We don't care.

243
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,760
You can even be a lawyer!

244
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,500
And we'll let you be a subgenius.

245
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,280
You can be a virgin!

246
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,340
And we'll still let you be a subgenius.

247
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:20,620
But...

248
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:29,600
And every single one of us, there's those times when that little nasty thing inside you makes you do something mean.

249
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,400
I'm mean most of the time.

250
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:38,100
My beautiful wife, Princess Wee, who's taking the pictures over there, is always sweet and nice.

251
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,580
One day she asked me, she said, why do you have to be so mean?

252
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,960
Well, I'm a subgenius to begin with, but...

253
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:50,680
It's like, baby, if you could know what it feels like, just for one second,

254
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,340
if you could know what it feels like to be mean, you'd never want to be nice again.

255
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:05,200
As my friend Nenslow said, in every relationship, there has to be a mean one and a nice one.

256
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,460
And if you want the other one to be the nice one, you're going to have to be the mean one.

257
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:19,760
But, I've spent a lot of years ranting about the conspiracy and how bad jobs were and so forth.

258
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,540
Of course, then I...

259
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,360
I had a job.

260
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,120
But, really, the...

261
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,660
You know, we get our own selves into most of our messes.

262
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,800
We really do.

263
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,980
It's easy to blame the man or whatnot, but...

264
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,200
The conspiracy you have to fight first is the one that lives inside your own heart.

265
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,160
Everybody's trying to tell everybody else what to do and how to vote and so forth.

266
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,520
And my attitude towards that is, look, you know, mow your yard, then tell...

267
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,060
Then start telling everybody else what to plant in their garden.

268
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,060
You know?

269
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:05,320
But, there's this horrible moment that you get to where you realize that the kick me sign that you've had on your back

270
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,580
that's caused you all this trouble, you finally discover the kick me sign on your back,

271
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,780
and it's in your own handwriting!

272
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,320
That is a scary moment, friends.

273
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,680
But, we're trying to reach...

274
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,640
out to get new subgeniuses.

275
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,920
It's only $30, by the way, and you can buy a membership ordainment back there,

276
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,140
and you'll be able to perform marriages, real ones, or funerals, whatnot.

277
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Can't do divorces.

278
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,100
If only. We'd be making money.

279
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,360
But we're trying to reach the youth.

280
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,340
It's hard to reach the youth, though.

281
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,600
It's so easy to reach old age.

282
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,360
Some of you may have noticed that.

283
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,300
As I kill the kids, it's an attention span.

284
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,000
You wouldn't understand.

285
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,680
That kid soapy, purchased too expensively.

286
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
But it worked.

287
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,740
When the museum's full of people,

288
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,900
we're imposed a time tolerance of within 30 minutes

289
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,640
to show up at a time consum Ende

290
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,680
or we can fracture that time following an exam that passed our movi

291
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:39,680


292
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:50,620
the amount of work done

293
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:50,620


294
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,480
Thank you.

295
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,600
Thank you.

296
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,620
Thank you.

297
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,860
Thank you.

298
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,400
Thank you.

299
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,260
Thank you.

300
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,240
Thank you.

301
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,660
Thank you.

302
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,860
Thank you.

303
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,000
Thank you so much.

304
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,880
That's a brand new one.

305
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,400
It hasn't been released yet.

306
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,720
Fatman D

307
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,040
does have a couple of CDs

308
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,140
and you can find information about those

309
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,180
and samples and crazy pictures

310
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,160
at fatmandd.com

311
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,200
Fatmandd

312
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,600
being

313
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:57,020
spelled P-H-A-T-MAN-D-E-E dot com.

314
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,720
Now another love song, a bit different, from Jonathan Coulton.

315
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,420
Welcome to my secret lair on Skullcrusher Mountain.

316
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,300
I hope that you've enjoyed your stay so far.

317
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,360
I see you've met my assistant.

318
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,320
Scarface, his appearance is quite disturbing.

319
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,900
But I assure you he's harmless enough.

320
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,380
He's a sweetheart, calls me master.

321
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:48,040
And he has a way of finding pretty things and bringing them to me.

322
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:55,480
And I'm so into you, but I'm way too smart for you.

323
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,600
Even my henchmen think I'm crazy.

324
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,240
I'm not surprised.

325
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,700
I'm surprised that you agree.

326
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:09,240
If you could find some way to be a little bit less afraid of me.

327
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:14,640
You see the voices that control me from inside my head.

328
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,200
Say I shouldn't kill you.

329
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:17,800
Yeah.

330
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,960
I made this half pony, half monkey monster to please you.

331
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,920
But I get the feeling that you don't like it.

332
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,140
What's with all the screaming?

333
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,000
You like monkeys, you like ponies.

334
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,260
Maybe you don't like monsters so much.

335
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,460
Maybe I use too many monkeys.

336
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:53,260
Isn't it enough to know that I ruined a pony making a gift for you?

337
00:24:53,580 --> 00:25:00,600
Oh, and I'm so into you, but I'm way too smart for you.

338
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,740
Even my henchmen think I'm crazy.

339
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,800
I'm not surprised that you agree.

340
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:14,340
If you could find some way to be a little bit less afraid of me.

341
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:19,840
You see the voices that control me from inside my head.

342
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,240
Say I shouldn't kill you.

343
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,000
Yeah.

344
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah.

345
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,800
Yeah.

346
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:26,740
Yeah.

347
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:27,600
Yeah.

348
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:28,760


349
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:28,840
Yeah.

350
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:28,840


351
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:28,840


352
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:28,840


353
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:34,260
Before the two of us alone inside my golden submarine.

354
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:40,920
While up above the waves my doomsday squad ignites the atmosphere.

355
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:48,360
And all the fools who lead their foolish lives may find it quite explosive.

356
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:55,340
Well, it won't mean half as much to me if I don't have you here.

357
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,900
I know it isn't easy living here on Skull Crusher Mountain

358
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,720
So maybe you could cut me just a little slack

359
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,480
Would it kill you to be civil?

360
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,040
I've been patient, I've been gracious

361
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,400
And this mountain is covered with wolves

362
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,960
Hear them howling, my hungry children

363
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,960
Maybe you should stay and have another drink

364
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,580
And think about me and you

365
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:34,940
And I'm so into you, but I'm way too smart for you

366
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,880
Even my henchmen think I'm crazy

367
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,120
I'm not surprised that you agree

368
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,640
If you could find some way to be a little bit less afraid of me

369
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,940
You'd see the voices that control me

370
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,140
From inside my head

371
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,580
Say,

372
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,860
I shouldn't care

373
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,720
I shouldn't care

374
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,980
I shouldn't care

375
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,740
I shouldn't care

376
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:21,600
I only think of you

377
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,700
Well, it's because I'd like to be as close to you

378
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,020
As you've become to me

379
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,840
Just drinking some liquid chicken

380
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,200
What happened?

381
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,780
I remember that liquid chicken

382
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,940
You're what?

383
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:44,920
Huh? What?

384
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,720
What?

385
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,640
Why did you tell that song?

386
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,220
I'm just using her here for a minute

387
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,140
Oh, here we are

388
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,080
I'm a man, a man, a man

389
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,840
I'm a man, a man, a man

390
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,560
I'm a man, a man, a man

391
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:08,860
I'm a man, a man, a man

392
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,440
Pop man

393
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,060
That makes me laugh

394
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,300
And anyways

395
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,380
Well, take a tip from convalescent patients

396
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,740
Chances are they know what they're doing

397
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,880
Serve a hard boy or girl for breakfast

398
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,020
Eat it now, you and your whole family

399
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,040
I could be in the water

400
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,140
You did the pop

401
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,600
Sorry

402
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,380
Well, now here's, um

403
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,800
I will do a little bit of ranting

404
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,140
here

405
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,980
And it's actually not by me

406
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,360
My script writer, Reverend Onan Canobite

407
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,740
is, um, about 20 years younger than me

408
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,520
And he's still an angry young man

409
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,400
I've got slack at a certain point

410
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,200
I have to fake my hate

411
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,920
Can you imagine being a subgenius cult leader?

412
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,620
You know, the whole idea is to hate the normals

413
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,020
Just like they've been hating us

414
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,780
Well, now I have to fake it

415
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,800
I've got, I've, I've, I've

416
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,940
I don't know what happened

417
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,460
I, I, well, I moved to Cleveland is what happened

418
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:32,900
In, in Dallas it was really easy to hate all the time

419
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,200
But we're in a nice neighborhood

420
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,980
Cleveland Heights, I can't hate

421
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,940
Anyway, I mentioned the, the normals

422
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,960
And, and Onan pointed out pinks, pink boys

423
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,200
That's our subgenius term for people who think that

424
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,440
Their normal is everybody else's normal

425
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,940
Now, I know my normal isn't normal

426
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,080
Because mine is superior and theirs is inferior

427
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,960
It's that simple

428
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,340
My normal can accommodate theirs

429
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,780
In the same way that I accommodate my own waste

430
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,200
I'll let Onan speak for himself, really

431
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,640
They cannot process my normal

432
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,840
It rends them, it burns them

433
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,520
My life in itself is exact and correct

434
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,320
In each moment

435
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,800
Because my normal is monster movies and comic books

436
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,300
And, and you can fill in the blank yourself at that point

437
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,520
You know, I'm sure you all love monsters and comic books

438
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,260
I'd have to be crazy not to

439
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,520
But there's probably other weird things

440
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,380
That I wouldn't like that you're into

441
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:40,940
Who knows?

442
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:45,260
The pinks want to return to a time that never existed

443
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,420
A time when they were the engines of progress

444
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,900
Instead of the parasites off our hard work

445
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,500
Now, somebody might say

446
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,940
Well, I thought you guys were in a slum

447
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,140
What do you mean hard work?

448
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,020
For some of us, that is slack

449
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,120
If we're working at what we wanted to be working at

450
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,860
Then there's the day job

451
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,900
And, well, you know

452
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,920
I'd just be damn glad you still have one

453
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,860
At least you have something to hate

454
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,920
You know, if it wasn't for the conspiracy

455
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,940
We'd have no reason to exist as a church

456
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,180
We'd have no one to hate at all

457
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,280
You know, and really, it's like any other religion

458
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,800
It's not that we love Bob that much

459
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,760
It's that we love the idea

460
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,140
Of everybody else burning in hell

461
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,760
So, anyway, the pinks

462
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,180
They have this nostalgia

463
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,500
For a time that never existed

464
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,280
And they superimpose their nostalgia on us

465
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,800
Which makes for a kind of

466
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,140
Nostalgia

467
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,320
A cultured sickness

468
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,060
But what is the cure?

469
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,460
Say Bob!

470
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,400
Bob!

471
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,840
What is the cost?

472
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,080
Say $30!

473
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,080
And what is the law?

474
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,420
Fuck them if they can't take a joke!

475
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,080
That is the one law in our religion

476
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,800
It's the only one

477
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,440
We actually have

478
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,720
In Revelation X, I think

479
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,840
There's a list of 195 sins

480
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,100
But those are just for fun

481
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,420
Those are just suggestions, you know

482
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,260
The funny thing about that one law

483
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,160
That fuck them if they can't take a joke law

484
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,320
Although it is illegal to say on the radio

485
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,740
By golly, as a philosopher

486
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,660
It works!

487
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,040
It really does work!

488
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,820
And if you will just give it a try

489
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,500
Apply that the next time you get

490
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,160
All agitated about something

491
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,640
Remember Bob, think of his face

492
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,440
And go, fuck them if they can't take a joke

493
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,660
And you would be amazed

494
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,500
At how that actually applies in real life

495
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,280
Um, Onan had a little note here

496
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,340
He said, P.S. although I have an undying hatred for the normals,

497
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,720
My life is very good

498
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,340
I spend most of my time happy

499
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:01,140
When I must deal with normals, it ruins a few hours of my day

500
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,060
Not years of my life

501
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,520
I still stoke the fires of hate

502
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,760
As a blazing beacon for young subgeni

503
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,500
Who, like I did, need to know where the hate is supposed to go

504
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,120
Outward and artward

505
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,900
As one of my friends said

506
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,060
Let's, because, let's smoke some pot

507
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,320
So we can get back to hating

508
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,120
The conspiracy instead of ourselves

509
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,180
But enough about the conspiracy!

510
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,800
You don't want to hear about the conspiracy

511
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,460
You want to hear moron religion

512
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,740
And have we got a moron religion for you

513
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,100
As Dennis Murphy said

514
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,680
Church of the subgenius

515
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,280
It's a no brainer

516
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,740
You notice it doesn't say church of the genius

517
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,320
Almost anybody can qualify for that

518
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,280
If you have the 30 bucks

519
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,760
But really it's not intelligence that counts

520
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,200
We think that they've misdefined intelligence

521
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,920
What counts is sense

522
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,740
Common sense, sense of humor, dollars and cents

523
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,860
And sense Amelia for some people I guess

524
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,620
That one works in Amsterdam

525
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:21,080
So tonight is a night for people who love being a subgenius

526
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,640
I love being a subgenius

527
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,800
The church of the subgenius

528
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,920
It's like having a pet you can fuck

529
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,740
You signed our lie-ability form

530
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,800
You've drunk the lemonade

531
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,700
And you're now a Dobbs approved apotheologist

532
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:43,960
So go ahead

533
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,040
Sneak up behind the pink boys

534
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,720
And give them an executive debriefing

535
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,240
Send in your 30 dollars

536
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,300
And laugh all the way to a fully equipped fallout show

537
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,240
You're free, free

538
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,060
As of this moment you are free

539
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,520
I'm a holy man and I can declare this

540
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,040
You may now do anything you want

541
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,460
And we'll still take your money

542
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,860
We'll still take that money

543
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,400
Bob, we're not worried about collecting tonight

544
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,080
Bob gets it all in the end

545
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,620
And then Bob gives it to us

546
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,720
In the end

547
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,300
And every subgenius at some point will rear up the show

548
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,300
And bleep

549
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,120
You can't put me in a box

550
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,960
Well, we all end up in a box some day

551
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,680
So until then friends make sure that

552
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,580
When they listen to your slack box recording

553
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,580
It's a good one

554
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,820
You know

555
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:44,360
You need to find a short duration personal savior

556
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,300
Bob makes a real good one

557
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,760
He may not last forever

558
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,280
As we say

559
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,960
Bob is not the answer

560
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,900
But praise Bob

561
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,280
Neither is anything else

562
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,720
And a short duration personal savior is handy

563
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,840
Because let's face it

564
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,060
You've got a short duration personal existence my friend

565
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,460
Now people

566
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,240
You're either born a subgenius or not

567
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,560
You're subgenius by birth

568
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,260
And if not

569
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,960
You can pay us to tell you otherwise

570
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,580
Laugh it up

571
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,340
This is war

572
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,020
It really is a kind of a war

573
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,440
On one side are the cool people

574
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,120
And on the other side

575
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,600
The cool people

576
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,180
It's the subgeniuses that are in the middle

577
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,280
We're through being cool

578
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,880
And we're through being uncool

579
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,080
We cast derision upon the coolostomy bags of the normals

580
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,620
And their designer parasites

581
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,920
Being cool or uncool

582
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,960
Has nothing to do with being a subgenius obviously

583
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,560
What matters is slack

584
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,020
I can't tell you how you get slack

585
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,360
But I can tell you how I get slack

586
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,880
For me slack is usually avoiding

587
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,300
Amateur performance art religious events

588
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,280
For you clearly this is not the case

589
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,320
Or is it?

590
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,900
That was all from Winterstar before that

591
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,200
There was some Lemurian pop man

592
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,240
Puzzling evidence and Jonathan Coulton

593
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,960
Now I mentioned earlier that this Winterstar devival

594
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,980
Was not a normal subgenius devival

595
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,040
I'm about to play an example of why

596
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,800
I'm just going to play a clip of it

597
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,860
Because the recording doesn't really do it any good

598
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,300
It's not justice but check this out

599
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,880
I still can't believe this happened

600
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,420
In a subgenius devival

601
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,560
Imagine all the people

602
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,940
Living life in peace

603
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:50,100
You will say I'm a dreamer

604
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,060
But I'm not the only one

605
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:05,980
I hope someday you'll join us

606
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:13,620
And the world will live as one

607
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,860
And with that I now introduce to you

608
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,560
The man who started it all

609
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,860
Whether he knew it or not

610
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:22,860


611
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,820
He meant it or not

612
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:30,180
The very Reverend Ivan Starrr

613
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,280
I cannot believe that the song Imagine

614
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,880
Happened under my watch at a subgenius devival

615
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,780
Normally it would be Sympathy for the Devil

616
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,180
Sorry guys I apologize

617
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,600
Please too

618
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,540
I willing to trade this song

619
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,840
On for an illusion

620
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,880
Say jump in to the

621
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,640
Did it not just get Bach

622
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,840
It went flying

623
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:27,660
creating its own PR news. Obama says he needs some 200,000 more. He says that it is something

624
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,620
that's being talked about. That announcement comes on the heels of a government report

625
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:36,080
saying a terrorist attack using a spending freeze is disappearing from radar.

626
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,640
Aid agencies, meanwhile, are still struggling to provide clean PR news.

627
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:01,940
I did that noise with a program called NetLogo, which I learned about from the

628
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,160
Kearns Holler Journal, which is where you should go to learn everything.

629
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:12,580
Thanks to Lee Murr for PR news. Now at Winterstar, another way the revival was different was that

630
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:20,020
instead of having weird Bob videos to unveil, I had weird microscopic life videos. Bug porn.

631
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:26,680
I've been filming the animal cules that I collect from bird baths and ponds,

632
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:32,180
amoebas and copepods and things, and I cut it to some music by Speed Cave.

633
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:40,940
You can see those at youtube.com slash RevStang. No period in RevStang. It's all live. All nude.

634
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,160
I brought the microscope home. I used to do this when I was a kid, and I put a

635
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,700
piece of dirt on a slide, and the first thing I saw was the most disgusting

636
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,060
thing.

637
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:56,240
Animal I've seen before or since. I'm still trying to find him again.

638
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:03,320
And I've come to love those disgusting little animals, so I've started a flea circus.

639
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,420
This is the micro aquarium of Dr. Stangnassus, you might say.

640
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,620
My family was going, what the hell is this about? You were always into dinosaurs and monsters.

641
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,820
What this seems like it was out of left field, but if you think about it, it does make sense.

642
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,020
Every little boy like me who never grew up loves dinosaurs and monsters.

643
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:31,140
Well eventually it sinks in. The dinosaurs are all in the movies and the monsters are all people.

644
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:41,660
But there's these things. I also always wanted to be a wildlife photographer, and this way I get to do that, but I can stay indoors.

645
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:48,300
I can be a wildlife photographer, but I don't have to hike anywhere to speak of.

646
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,820
Most of these animals came from a bird.

647
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,780
They're all in the bird bath in our backyard.

648
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,820
And they are animalcules.

649
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,340
One reason I shot the video is so I could see them better.

650
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:08,000
You know, blown up real large like this, it's actually a lot easier to see their little tiny innards, their clockwork insides.

651
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,720
Just in case anybody wonders, no animalcules were harmed in the making of this video.

652
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,560
Much.

653
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,800
I love animals.

654
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:20,800


655
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:20,800


656
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,760
One thing I learned was don't play God.

657
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,800
Don't try to help these creatures.

658
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,880
Occasionally you'll find a nematode tangled up in some algae.

659
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,340
I made the mistake of trying to help him.

660
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,140
Bender found out the hard way.

661
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:40,880
And if you ever watch Futurama, when Bender became God, he encountered the same problem.

662
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:46,360
You try to mix in with your creations and you'll just mess them up.

663
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,740
So I have a real hands-off policy with these guys.

664
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,700
They are so very indecisive.

665
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,580
Like this one.

666
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,500
Look at this guy.

667
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,660
He just can't make up his mind.

668
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:08,100
You know, the sad thing is, for most of these creatures, there's only one sex.

669
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,920
They don't have males and females, or else they're all females.

670
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:17,940
Like these creatures, the philodena rotifers, they're almost all females.

671
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,120
Males are very rare.

672
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,720
They do parthenogenesis.

673
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,380
Which means they can fertilize themselves.

674
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,600
I was saying to some other subgenius,

675
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,640
Well, that seems like an efficient idea.

676
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,660
What a great idea.

677
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,160
And the guy goes,

678
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,300
No! It's a bad idea!

679
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,880
It's a real, real bad idea!

680
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,920
But who knows?

681
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:42,480
You know, mitosis, or cell divisions, a lot of them just simply split in half.

682
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,280
Well, for all we know, that feels like having an orgasm combined with having a baby at the same time.

683
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,560
We just don't know.

684
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,680
What does it feel like to divide into two?

685
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,660
Does it hurt?

686
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:56,740
Does it feel great?

687
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,600
This guy bites something and then spits it out.

688
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,240
Which shows us that they have opinions.

689
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,780
You know, they may not have much, but they know what they like.

690
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,840
You tend to just write them off.

691
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,760
You know, I mean, most people don't even think about them.

692
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,840
Or if they do, they kind of puke.

693
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,820
By the way, some of you hippies, after seeing this,

694
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,300
it may change your life.

695
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,240
You may decide that you're never ever going to go skinny dipping in a lake again.

696
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:31,020
That was certainly my first impression when I realized what was in the average pond water.

697
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,000
You know, the funny thing is,

698
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:40,560
we're full of these things like this, you know?

699
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,100
We're not really, you know, we think of ourselves as individuals.

700
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,560
But we're made up of little single cells.

701
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,120
What I didn't understand was that the cells themselves,

702
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,420
even a single celled creature, which most of these aren't.

703
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:00,860
The rotifers, for instance, almost all have about 1,000 cells.

704
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,300
Isn't that nice?

705
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,480
And scientists know what every single one of those cells do

706
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,980
and what's in every bit of DNA.

707
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,440
One thing they've learned is that part of the cell,

708
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,540
the mitochondria, is another creature with its own damn DNA.

709
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,040
And, uh,

710
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,340
and on top of that, you know, you hear bad things about E. coli,

711
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,500
but actually we're full of a certain type of E. coli.

712
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,700
They help make our guts work.

713
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,980
So yeah, a person can actually spend hours staring at these little boogers

714
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,960
and you end up naming them.

715
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,520
You start infesting them with personality.

716
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,900
You start seeing their likes and dislikes.

717
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,300
And, uh, and when you leave for a week,

718
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,460
you don't have to worry about them going crazy

719
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:52,180
or take them to the pound or anything.

720
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,540
They're very low maintenance.

721
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,720
That's my dad.

722
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,720
He can see through my camera.

723
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,760
They're doing it, Doug. They're doing it nasty.

724
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,520
He's just a piece of algae.

725
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,140
Why in the hell would he make it look like a piece of algae?

726
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:10,580
He's lonely.

727
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,960
There's another little creature going around in circles down there.

728
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,420
I see it.

729
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,120
We're going to spawn it.

730
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,800
No, I think that's not a piece of algae, Doug.

731
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,340
I think it's what it is.

732
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,700
It's necrophilia going on.

733
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:31,880
That's what it is.

734
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,960
I'll be haunted forever by the death of that rotifer.

735
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,740
But here his spirit, you see, has fled his body

736
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,580
and is rising up into heaven.

737
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,140
That's the, you can see through it.

738
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:48,280
And you can see it.

739
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,040
He's like a ghost.

740
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,040
And he's rising up to rotifer heaven

741
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,520
where there's no Dr. Stangs or Dr. Moreau's

742
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,780
with their little machines.

743
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,440
One of the amazing things that happened at the Winter Star Devival,

744
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,640
which I was not expecting at all,

745
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:11,160
was the appearance of Fat Mandy's husband, Tommy Amoeba,

746
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:14,080
who not only sang his theme song,

747
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,360
but sang it in a full body Amoeba costume.

748
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:17,700
And he was a little bit of a skimp.

749
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:21,020
And nothing else except for a star-spangled thong.

750
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,140
He was formed in primordial ooze

751
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:30,160
When chemicals merged and something grew

752
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,460
He split in two and then in four

753
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:39,020
So now today, it's a whole lot more

754
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,320
Amoeba, oh, Amoeba

755
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:47,240
The lowest form of life

756
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,020
Tommy Amoeba

757
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,840
He'll make it all right

758
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:59,500
Others evolved to higher forms

759
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,440
The dodo bird and the dinosaur

760
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,780
The human bee

761
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,580
And cockapoo

762
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:23,260
Tommy remained to himself true

763
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:27,380
Viva Amoeba

764
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:31,700
The lowest form of life

765
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,520
Tommy Amoeba

766
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,540
He'll make it all right

767
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:43,300
Viva Amoeba

768
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:43,300


769
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:47,580
Viva Amoeba

770
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,640
Tommy Amoeba

771
00:48:53,300 --> 00:49:01,200
And the spiders from Mars

772
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,480
Tommy Amoeba!

773
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,480
Strange day in Texas.

774
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,380
Harry's Harry's Harry's drink has failed.

775
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,480
They're doing it, Doug. They're doing the nasty.

776
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,640
I think one of those is just a piece of algae.

777
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,140
They're doing it, Doug. I have ordained it.

778
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,320
I think one of those is just a piece of algae.

779
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,440
No, I think that's doing the nat–

780
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,480
doing the nasty.

781
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,920
No, I think the algae's doing the nasty.

782
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,920
Thank you, Pappy.

783
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,980
They're doing it, Doug. They're doing the nasty.

784
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,160
I think one of those is just a piece of algae.

785
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,600
I have four dangers.

786
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,960
Thank you, Pappy.

787
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,940
All fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite them.

788
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:53,260
And those fleas have little fleas and so ad infinitum.

789
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,340
And it's true. I learned that fleas have parasites.

790
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,120
And those have parasites.

791
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:10,780
Nature is an unbelievably beautiful system of exploitation, killing and eating.

792
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,640
It's great.

793
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:20,300
The thing is, if it weren't for those tiny things, plants wouldn't grow.

794
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,580
Those nematodes aerate the soil.

795
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:30,160
In fact, I think it's been determined that the weight of animals

796
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:30,980
that live...

797
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:37,340
Life in the dirt worldwide vastly outweighs the combined weight

798
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,260
of all the animals that live on the surface.

799
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,600
All the whales and elephants and people and everything

800
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,020
don't come anywhere close to taking up as much solid mass

801
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:52,420
as all those creatures that are in the dirt.

802
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,200
And I don't know. I'm a weird guy.

803
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,580
Yes, I'm a weird guy.

804
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:00,940
Another.

805
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:06,760
Another weird guy was Mark Twain, who wrote an entire novella from the point of view of

806
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:12,020
a germ who had once been a man and remembered being a man, but likes being a germ.

807
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,620
It's called 3,000 Years Among the Microbes.

808
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:23,760
In this passage, his germ friend Franklin is discussing the germs that inhabit germs.

809
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,100
Yes, the wee creatures that inhabit the bodies of us germs and feed upon us.

810
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,640
They poison us and rot us with disease.

811
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,920
Oh, what could they have been created for?

812
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,380
They give us pain.

813
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,820
They make our lives miserable.

814
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,740
They murder us.

815
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,260
And where's the use of it all?

816
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,000
Where are the wisdom?

817
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,440
Oh, friend, we live in a strange and unaccountable world.

818
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,640
Our birth is a mystery.

819
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,340
Our little life is a mystery and a trouble.

820
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,540
We pass and are seen no more.

821
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,120
All is mystery, mystery, mystery.

822
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,060
We know not whence we came nor why.

823
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,760
We know not whither we go nor why we go.

824
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,380
We only know that we were not made in vain.

825
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:11,680
We only know we were made for a wise purpose and that all is well.

826
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:18,420
We shall not be cast aside incontinently and unblessed after all we have suffered.

827
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,260
Let us be patient.

828
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,480
Let us repine.

829
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:22,640
Let us trust.

830
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,780
The humblest of us is cared for.

831
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:26,620
Oh, believe it.

832
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,040
And this fleeting stay is not lost.

833
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:30,040


834
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:30,480
The end.

835
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:38,820
You notice that he did not suspect that he also was engaged in gnawing, torturing, defiling,

836
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,740
rotting and murdering a fellow creature.

837
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:43,660
He and all the swarming billions of his race.

838
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,300
And none of them suspects it.

839
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,840
That is significant.

840
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,160
It is suggestive.

841
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,300
Irresistibly suggestive.

842
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,700
Insistently suggestive.

843
00:52:53,720 --> 00:53:00,040
It hints at the possibility that the procession of known and listed devourers and persecutors,

844
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,360
is not complete.

845
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:09,640
It suggests the possibility, and substantially the certainty, that man is himself a microbe

846
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:15,820
and his globe a blood corpuscle drifting with its shining brethren of the Milky Way

847
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:24,060
down a vein of the master and maker of all things, whose body mayhap glimpsed partwise

848
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:29,300
from the earth by night and receding and lost to view in the measureless remoteness of space.

849
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:33,620
And that is what men name the universe.

850
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,140
The correct version of that verse I said earlier was,

851
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:49,300
Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite them, and little fleas have lesser

852
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,960
fleas and so ad infinitum.

853
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:58,620
And the great fleas themselves, in turn, have greater fleas to go on, while these again,

854
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:02,460
have greater still and greater still and so on.

855
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:11,720
That's by Augustus de Morgan from The Budget of Paradoxes, 1872, after Jonathan Swift.

856
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,580
But Winterstar isn't all germs, friends.

857
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:20,500
A lot of this festival takes place in cabins along a lakeside road, and inside those cabins

858
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:26,940
are drumming or pirate songs, or in the case of what we're about to hear, space jams by

859
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:33,600
a witch disco and or Ron Slaib and Bob Mosick.

860
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:39,740
What follows has not been filtered by me, but is just what it sounded like inside the Winterstar

861
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:44,020
space jam cabin very, very, very early on Valentine's Day morning.

862
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:19,640
Now that music degenerated into a puppy pile of girls groveling on the couches and laughing

863
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,180
at the echoes of their own laughter.

864
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,780
Help me!

865
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:26,720
Help me!

866
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:26,920
Help me!

867
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,980
Help me!

868
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:30,120
Help me!

869
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,860
Help me!

870
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,260
Help me!

871
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,460
Help me!

872
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:39,040
Help me!

873
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:40,340
Help me!

874
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,100
Help me!

875
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:42,820
Help me!

876
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:43,500
Help me!

877
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,120
Help me too!

878
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,320
Help me!

879
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:54,480


880
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:54,940
Help me reuse my life!

881
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,580
No, honey!

882
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,020
He's like, I want to be in this puppy pile.

883
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,460
Come on over.

884
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,640
Here, here, here, here, here.

885
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,220
Go, go, go.

886
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:10,720
Let's go.

887
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,660
We're going to left you.

888
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,100
Billions and billions.

889
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,840
I mean, they're all a joke.

890
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:25,820
They're all a joke.

891
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:29,040
They're not in my head.

892
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,340
They're not in my head.

893
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,200
They're not in my head.

894
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,540
Yes, they are.

895
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,520
No, they're not.

896
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,100
No, they're not.

897
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,060
I thought they are.

898
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:38,960
They're not.

899
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,200
They're me.

900
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,920
They're me.

901
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,020
All right, you win.

902
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:59,180
And this has been the Hour of Slack.

903
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:06,860
The music we've been hearing in the background during my credits is by Mayan Ruins.

904
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,360
That's the name of the band.

905
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:15,840
You can find their wonderful instrumentals at myspace.com slash mayanruins.

906
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:22,940
If you want to know more about the Church of the Subgenius or Winterstar or X-Day or any of that stuff,

909
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:39,020
Post Office Box 181-417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

910
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:41,080
And praise Bob.

911
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,880
Thank you.

912
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:58,880


913
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,860
But I'm not the only one.

914
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:10,660
I hope someday you'll join us.

915
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:18,800
And the world will live as one.

916
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,340
Thank you.

917
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,280
Thank you.

918
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:24,820
Thank you.

919
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:24,820


920
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:24,820


921
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:24,820


922
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:24,820


923
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:24,820


924
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:24,820


925
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:24,820


926
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:29,560
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for coming to Winter Star.

927
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,560
My name is Fat Mandy.

928
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,440
This is Princess We Are Dope.

929
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:42,720
Well, I don't want to follow the two of us.

930
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,700
I think the only thing that should come on next is...

931
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,340
Oh, not that one.

932
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:50,440
Yay!

933
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:51,280
Opa!

934
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,100
Opa!

935
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,400
It's Bob, motherfucker.

936
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,300
In high times.

937
00:58:58,620 --> 00:58:59,720
About 40.

938
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,880
Holy shit, there he is.

939
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:02,980
Oh, my motherfucker.

940
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,200
The real guy.

941
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,480
Just like the drawing, man.

942
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,800
It really got the likeness, I have to say.

943
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,060
You're looking good.

944
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,220
Number 24 in high times.

945
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,040
About 40.

946
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,760
Right next to Bob.

947
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:16,100
That is seriously.

948
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:21,740
And this is a little bit of the workshop here, as you can see.

949
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:22,960
Post.

950
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:23,640
Poster, computers.

951
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,900
Very fucking private.

952
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,660
What the hell's that hanging over his head?

953
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,300
He's got Bob coming out of his head.

954
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,160
But large.

955
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,160
It was kind of large.

956
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:31,640
Where's Bob?

957
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,520
Looks like he's got a...

958
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,040
Bob is the real thing coming out of his head.

959
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:35,900
Shut up, boy.

960
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:36,620
Number one.

961
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:37,660
Oh, my motherfucker.

962
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:38,920
Bong number one.

963
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,300
You gotta be shitting me.

964
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,520
And what's down here?

965
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:50,000
The subgenius power of sweat.

966
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:51,660
By great.

967
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:52,500
By the way.

968
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:54,060
I don't mean good.

969
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:55,060
I mean large.
