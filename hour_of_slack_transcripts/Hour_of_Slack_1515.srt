1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
You are on the theological hotline. How can I make you hot?

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:19,440
Ah, yes, dear friends, welcome to the Hour of Slack, number 1,370-something.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:29,620
And may this Hour of Slack be the most slackful of all the hours heretofore and forthwith.

4
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:38,720
Your time of listening is now your time of deep, relaxing slack.

5
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,080
Slack is the soft voice, slack the luminous cloud.

6
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,320
We in our slack rejoice.

7
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:55,620
And thence comes all the charms or ear or sight, all melodies the echo of that voice,

8
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,980
all colors a suffusion of that voice.

9
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:07,680
And though the exists once more withheld the lights of their countenance

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,960
from the helpful, hopeful, upturned faces of the ex-day postulants,

11
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,780
we have not even been challenged.

12
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,140
Nay, rather than that, our faith has been reinforced even more

13
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,480
so that we are truly the children,

14
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,060
the warriors of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

15
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,520
Praise God!

16
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,720
But not the worriers, sir, we're not the worriers of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

17
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,980
We're not worried because we have faith in the ultimate success of our mission,

18
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,260
the Nameless Mission, a small part of which is to bring you broadcasting opportunities

19
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:58,420
such as this one where you and we can participate together victoriously in what we call,

20
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,780
the Hour of Slack.

21
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,480
Rar! Rar! Rar! Rar!

22
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,340
That actually hurt my Adam's apple.

23
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,620
I have done that so many times in the last few days.

24
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,520
I've developed a bruise on my throat.

25
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,800
In Adam's fall, we sinned all.

26
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,540
And the bruise on the throat, which the Bobcaster feels,

27
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:27,780
is only cognate to the bruise on the heel given by that old serpent, Satan.

28
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:36,680
Yes, the adversary, the evil one, was nipping at the heels of the faithful at Exde.

29
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,800
But even old Sequa, most monstrous denizen of the watery depths,

30
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,120
took only four minor victims.

31
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:53,020
When we expected a holocaust of many, including even the most faithful.

32
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,420
Perhaps the locals had fed him the sacrifices,

33
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,400
which, oh, I'm sorry,

34
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,640
according to Native American tradition, are his due.

35
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,480
But perhaps he, like the holiday itself,

36
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,400
decided, for no reason that could be named,

37
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,880
to be kind and forbearing,

38
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,720
and to have the faith, the faith in Bob.

39
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,280
But there is a great support for the Lord.

40
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,280


41
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,280


42
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,080
To atone everything for sin?

43
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,180
To back one more victor.

44
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,080
Blav clav.

45
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,400
And to make a promise of running in heaven.

46
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,600
We. We.

47
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,720
She's got big bobs, daddy.

48
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,240
Shazam.

49
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,080
The corporations themselves receive corporate welfare, corporate television, corporate money.

50
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,860
They're corporate fascists. It's all true.

51
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,140
Can I get a free spa?

52
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,340
Brain and brain. What is brain?

53
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,560
My mind is not my mind.

54
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,300
Yes, dear friends.

55
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,000
Welcome to hour of slack number 1515.

56
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,400
One thousand five hundred and fifteen.

57
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,980
That's how many shows.

58
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,160
That's too many.

59
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,200
But we're going to do it. We're going to do another one anyway.

60
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,460
And I do have something unusual in front of me tonight.

61
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,560
It is a book, a great big, thick black book.

62
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,560
The hardcover.

63
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,980
It came to the sacred post office box of the church.

64
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,700
I sort of was expecting it, but I couldn't believe it when I saw it.

65
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,780
It is the title of this book.

66
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,800
This book is rhetorical ripples.

67
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:36,520
The Church of the subgenius, Kenneth Burke and comic symbolic tinkering by.

68
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:47,220
Well, for our slack purposes, we'll call him Reverend Lee Cipher, Ph.D.

69
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,440
And this giant book is this guy's dissertation in partial fulfillment.

70
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,440
Of a Ph.D. requirement in media art and text.

71
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,400
And I won't embarrass the huge university.

72
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:10,820
And the guy did get his Ph.D. or his doctorate or whatever he was getting this this bruise of his work.

73
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:19,800
There have not been many academic studies of the Church of the subgenius, although he does mention them.

74
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,320
And they're kind of interesting because one of them really didn't like it.

75
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,560
I thought.

76
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,400
You were deliberately stupid and we are, but that's not all we are.

77
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,760
Anyway, I'm going to read some of this because I couldn't believe it.

78
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:39,420
I couldn't believe how seriously somebody was taking our spazz church of macho irony.

79
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,280
But as it says here.

80
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:54,400
Humor has long been an effective way to engage difficult socio political topics in a way that avoids.

81
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:02,720
Polemical confrontation and provides opportunity for pleasure, catharsis and self knowledge.

82
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:23,360
In the context of today's polarized politics and protest, creative satirical performance that deploys symbolic tinkering can provide a comic frame of reference that, according to Kenneth Burke, more effectively conveys its message.

83
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,060
While providing.

84
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,740
Reflexive insight.

85
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,940
The.

86
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,200
Now, I don't understand this word satirical.

87
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,480
I'll have to look that up.

88
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:40,180
This satirical church of the subgenius naturally practices this rhetorical frame in their multimedia creations.

89
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,480
Using the lens of Burke's attitudes toward history.

90
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:53,900
This essay is an analysis of subgenius rhetoric with a focus on their hour of slack live radio.

91
00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:14,300
Program and the book Revelation X to provide an informative example of Burke's comic frame applied and clarify the nature of its utility by exploring the rhetorical impact of the church of the subgenius and the relevance of its quote comic corrective.

92
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,760
Unquote.

93
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:22,960
Politically cynical subgeni are actually that should be pronounced subgenie.

94
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,320
Subgenie.

95
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,660
Politically cynical subgenie are none.

96
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:35,860
Nevertheless, keen cultural critics who sophisticated use of a complex comic rhetoric warrants more serious attention.

97
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:47,380
And then he quotes quite a bit of art graphics and slogans from our material, such as J.

98
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,560
R.

99
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,200
Bob Dobbs.

100
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:48,900
Great statement.

101
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,500
You'll pay to know what you really think.

102
00:09:52,860 --> 00:10:00,160
Or as it says in subgenius pamphlet number one, our creed orthodoxy is the only heresy.

103
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:12,440
And as Ruckert said in encounters with Kenneth Burke, the most serious truths can be coached into jokes.

104
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,960
Now, don't worry, I'm not going to read this entire book.

105
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,620
I should hope not.

106
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,020
It's quite thick.

107
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,940
Yeah, it's a great book.

108
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,400
A great.

109
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,820
It is a great book.

110
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,820
Great in size.

111
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,040
But it is very impressive looking.

112
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,100
Oh, yeah.

113
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,600
Yeah.

114
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:38,420
And for the most part, although it's hard for me to understand the big words, I kind of agree with them.

115
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,300
Although I don't know what I really don't know what he means by rhetoric at all.

116
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,300
Anyway, here's some more of it.

117
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,080
Burke's initial connection written in 1937.

118
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,840
Kenneth Burke's observation above.

119
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:58,740
About the utility of the comic frame to promote maximum consciousness is even more relevant and necessary in 2014.

120
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:09,620
As our world is rapidly connecting and transforming via new protein communication technologies, most notably the web, smartphones and social media.

121
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:19,500
While these astonishing new tools have sparked revolutions and helped to hold power accountable, we have yet to transcend our foibles.

122
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,460
The world remains at the mercy.

123
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:29,960
The world remains at the mercy of unaccountable power, deadly conflict, environmental degradation and increasing socioeconomic disparity.

124
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,380
Burke addresses these issues directly in his writing.

125
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:39,460
And they are also central targets of the subgenius satire.

126
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,380
I'll have to look that up.

127
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Which, in spite of its non-activist nature, has nevertheless had a subtle but surprising impact on popular culture and civic discourse.

128
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:57,240
The Church of the Subgenius is worth our attention for its evolving protean narrative.

129
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,620
Its unschooled use of Burke's sophisticated rhetoric.

130
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,820
You got the unschooled part right.

131
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,660
Its keenly targeted cultural critiques.

132
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,120
I'll have to look for those in our material.

133
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:19,760
And perhaps most importantly for its insistent valorization of sufficient leisure for unfettered creativity.

134
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,440
And its modeling of the world.

135
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:21,440


136
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,060
Its

137
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:38,680
I hope the powerful utility of the comic frame and the crucial necessity of free creative exercise will become clear in the following pages.

138
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,540
Wrestling power to account with humor.

139
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,220
And personal development of strong creative skills.

140
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,960
Maybe two of the most valuable and hopeful survival tools.

141
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,120
We can deploy in our rapidly changing 21st century.

142
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,120
Wow.

143
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,540
And, uh, yes, that's just page one and two.

144
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,640
There's a lot of stuff in this big book.

145
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,480
There's a lot of quotes from me.

146
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,940
I guess he interviewed me a couple of times.

147
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,440
I vaguely remember that.

148
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,520
He actually came to Wisteria during a Starwood and interviewed me.

149
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,600
I would call that a tome.

150
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,480
Yeah.

151
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:21,740
Yeah.

152
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,680
And he did a survey of Hour of Slack listeners.

153
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,980
Well, here's a picture of Philo and me at Burning Man in the year 2000.

154
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,180
Isn't that pretty?

155
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,380
Very pretty.

156
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,880
It's in color.

157
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:41,180
Here's a reprint of Buck, former pastor Buck Naked's little newsletter, which he called Hour of Slack.

158
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,900
And, um, in the fall of 1984.

159
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,300
We got the radio show in 85.

160
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,920
But, uh, yeah, you can't see this.

161
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,060
And so I'm not going to show you the pictures.

162
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,640
Although it is really a strange thing for, oh my God, there's my ex-wife belly dancing at X day.

163
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,540
Strange, strange, strange.

164
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,240
Uh, well, him.

165
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:10,920
Aha.

166
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,480
Oh.

167
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,840
And I thought my church was bad.

168
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,900
Praise Reverend Cipher.

169
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,840
Yeah.

170
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,020
Yeah.

171
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,960
Um, yeah, it's, it's funny.

172
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:34,400
I was reading all these highfalutin things about how wonderful we are and, and how strange and weird that man is who is called Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

173
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,980
If you can hear me, can you hear me?

174
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,460
Yes.

175
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,080
I can.

176
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,040
Oh, that's wonderful.

177
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,720
Cause I was going to ask we, if you do me a favor.

178
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,120
I'd even do you a flavor.

179
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,860
What is it?

180
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,580
Um, sometimes.

181
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,800
You could say, hello, you're on the theological hotline.

182
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,620
How can I make you hot?

183
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,840
Only do it real sexy, right?

184
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,000
So it sounds like.

185
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,640
I'll write that down.

186
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,540
You're, you're on the theological hotline.

187
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,560
Hello.

188
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,520
You're on the theological hotline.

189
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,560
How can I help you?

190
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,740
Can I do something hot?

191
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,380
No, no.

192
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,780
It's how can I make you hot?

193
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,080
How can I make you hot?

194
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,240
Type two.

195
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,020
Take three.

196
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,560
No, no.

197
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:17,560


198
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:17,880
I can do it.

199
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,160
Take three.

200
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,740
They're small.

201
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,420
Can I do that again?

202
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,500
Just one more time.

203
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,540
I know I'm done really, but I can do one better.

204
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,280
Just one better.

205
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,560
No, she was one who's going to do it.

206
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,260
Here, I wrote her a script.

207
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,800
He's written my script for me now.

208
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,980
I have the power, the power of pen and paper.

209
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,360
That's because you're her suit, young man.

210
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,100
Okay, stand by.

211
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,980
We're going to do, we're going to do.

212
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,440
Here, stand by.

213
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,380
I'm pulling music now.

214
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,060
We'll do take one.

215
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,460
You're on the theological hotline.

216
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,300
How can I make you hot?

217
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:47,540
Only do it real sexy, right?

218
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:47,540


219
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:47,540


220
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:47,540


221
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:47,540


222
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,720
Do that one more time.

223
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,820
A little bit slower.

224
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,020
A little bit more slowly.

225
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,220
Yeah, a little breathier.

226
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,200
Yeah, it's a lot.

227
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,840
She's a little bit juicy and stuff.

228
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,720
You are on the theological hotline.

229
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,760
How can I make you hot?

230
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,320
Okay.

231
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,920
That's a wrap.

232
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,380
That's a wrap.

233
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,160
Yeah, I'll have a chicken wrap and a pork wrap.

234
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,660
That's a wrap.

235
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:17,520
Yeah, that's good.

236
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,940
And wrap some bacon around it.

237
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,560
I was thinking about clear foil.

238
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,440
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:21,740
Speak.

240
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,780
That's a wrap song.

241
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,560
A wrap sandwich song.

242
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:26,980
Yeah.

243
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,460
You could sample that and put sandwiches on it and just describe everything that's going

244
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,340
on in the world because none of it makes any sense to begin with.

245
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:43,240
You could just perfectly just describe any, I'm sorry.

246
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,520
I read that phrase, nothing makes any sense.

247
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:53,220
Anyway, earlier in this book I was reading, it was a book about the Church of the Subgenius,

248
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,540
Dave.

249
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,820
I just got it in the mail.

250
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:01,220
There's only two copies that I know of in existence, but this guy, Reverend Lee Cipher

251
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:09,700
in Virginia, wrote his PhD dissertation book about the Church of the Subgenius, and he

252
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,780
sent me a hardbound copy of it.

253
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,300
It's not terrible.

254
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,800
It's actually pretty cool.

255
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,760
No, it's really pretty cool.

256
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,800
I couldn't understand it.

257
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,500
It's not hiding her hair of the fancy wordage, but it has lots of good pictures.

258
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,680
Well, look here, Dave.

259
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,180
Here's a letter from R. Crumb down at the bottom.

260
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,260
God, it's so lame.

261
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:37,240
Well, keep on Bobbin', and an R. Crumb drawing of Bob Dobbs saying, Hup Ho, in his keep on

262
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,620
trucking thing.

263
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,620
It's in the book?

264
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,900
Yeah, it's in the book.

265
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,200
Yes.

266
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,320
He's reprinted a letter.

267
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,780
You don't know about all these?

268
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,380
Well, I don't know.

269
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:53,040
I saved our famous people letters after they became famous before I threw them away.

270
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,180
Well, here's one from Ken Kesey.

271
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:04,180
Ken Kesey said in July of 1982, Attention all you subgeni who claim to represent Bob.

272
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,380
You are taking yourselves and your religion entirely too seriously.

273
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:14,460
I used to love reading the stark fist, but with your new issue, more than 50 pages, you

274
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,960
have invaded the realm of wretched excess.

275
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,620
It now takes up all of my slack time to stagger through this voluminous rag.

276
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,820
Slack off.

277
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,080
Dobbs would understand my dilemma.

278
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,980
Surely, a few pages would suffice.

279
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,800
Wishing you luck, the Reverend Hardly Visible.

280
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,760
P.S. I'm enclosing money.

281
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,800
And he scotch taped four pennies.

282
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,420
And that was the late Ken Kesey.

283
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,020
No.

284
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:49,240
These relics of antiquity need to go in the sacrosanct areas of the Turks' compounds deep

285
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,420
in South America, where the monkeys hide and the children play in the trees and argue with

286
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,260
each other voluminously.

287
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,900
Well, all of this historical stuff.

288
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,340
Questions of?

289
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,680
Yes, yes?

290
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,900
Questions of theology.

291
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,500
I'm sorry.

292
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:04,880
Theological.

293
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,020
You're on the theological hotline.

294
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,660
How can I make you hot?

295
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:11,900
Why?

296
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,000
Why?

297
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,580
I don't want to.

298
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,540
Here's a postcard from Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo.

299
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,600
Wow.

300
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,120
Yeah, it's a, yeah, the back when we were famous and famous people paid attention to

301
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,000
us, that was cool back in those days.

302
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,980
But I could see your house though with luminarias and stuff like that all over the place and

303
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,380
little votive candles.

304
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:40,840
And here's, here's a framed autograph from so-and-so, so-and-so.

305
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,280
He said, keep, keep.

306
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,060
You know who I do have a framed autograph of?

307
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,960
Ray Harryhausen.

308
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,840
Ray Harryhausen, the great stop motion animator.

309
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,560
Yes, we do.

310
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,380
It's framed.

311
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,840
That is some Vinars right there, buddy.

312
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,840
Well, notice I didn't, I didn't frame the letters from R. Crumb or Ken Kesey or Mothersbaugh

313
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:04,840
or David Byrne.

314
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,820
I framed the, we framed the Jack Chick comic postcard.

315
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:10,820


316
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:10,820


317
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:10,820


318
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:10,820


319
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,580
Oh, I see.

320
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,920
The Jack Chick comic posters and the Susie the Flusie artwork.

321
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,640
And I framed the Oingo Boingo fellows.

322
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,420
Oh, that's right.

323
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,400
Yeah, Danny Elfman.

324
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,640
Elfman's autographed photo.

325
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,500
I, I framed that.

326
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,960
And I framed it.

327
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,640
It's a frame.

328
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,740
It's a frame up.

329
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,080
It's a frame up.

330
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,040
You framed Elfman.

331
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,800
Yep.

332
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,760
He didn't really write any of that repetitive music.

333
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,220
Frame up.

334
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,800
Starring Wins Hardwick.

335
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:40,800


336
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:40,800


337
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:40,800


338
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,260
Yeah, and Jim Slanny.

339
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,460
Jim Slanny.

340
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:43,460


341
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,560
And back in them days, back when Bob was famous, we was riding high.

342
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,800
And I do mean high.

343
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,600
This was the 80s, remember?

344
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,180
Everything goes back in the 80s.

345
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,280
Everything did go.

346
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,060
It went away.

347
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:03,460
All our money, our fame, my voice.

348
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,600
Now I talk like Bill Clinton.

349
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,060
Just a poor old washed up, old adulterer.

350
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,140
Well, I think we'll everybody.

351
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,740
Well, I think we'll everybody.

352
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:17,740
What everybody wants to know and what the listening audience wants to hear is why you

353
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,420
sound like Bill Clinton and why you've chosen that as some sort of icon to live out your

354
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,020
macrimony.

355
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:29,840
And one other thing, you refer to yourself in the very beginning as shot and spent back

356
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,320
in the 1980s when everybody knows you just have not capitalized on your fame very well.

357
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,760
Linda?

358
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,660
You mean that?

359
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,780
Well, you know.

360
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,940
You mean the fact that I don't answer letters from famous people and hide from the telephone

361
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,500
and never go to parties.

362
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,240
But I'm not Bob.

363
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,700
Bob does all of that stuff.

364
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,840
I'm just a scribe.

365
00:21:51,840 --> 00:22:00,320
I'm supposed to sit in the office with a hunchback in a garret assembling ministerial packets

366
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,780
to mail out to subgeniuses, which reminds me I have to do that very thing starting tomorrow.

367
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,800
And carefully documenting everything that happens.

368
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,200
Now, we need.

369
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,960
What we need, Dave, is a chimpanzee.

370
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,540
To do most of the work that I do.

371
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,680
Oh, I thought you meant to do a chimpanzee voice and I haven't been able to do chimp voices

372
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,060
anymore.

373
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,160
Oh, wow.

374
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,320
I learned that from Cheetah.

375
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,060
Was that you or we?

376
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,080
No, that was me.

377
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,640
No, that was him.

378
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,940
Well, it was Cheetah.

379
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,580
I was channeling the great spirit of Cheetah.

380
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,560
The inimitable imitator.

381
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,080
The army of Cheetah.

382
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,180
The army of Cheetah.

383
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,180


384
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,180


385
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,180


386
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,180


387
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,180


388
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,060
The great stripper author of Ritalin for Brother.

389
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,740
Wow.

390
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,780
In Lobotown, USA.

391
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,380
Yeah, I can channel these different dead things.

392
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,000
These different artifacts you can reconstruct in your mind.

393
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,200
I'm a spirit medium.

394
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,120
Yeah, I'm not just making this stuff up, you see.

395
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,420
These are the spirits are speaking through me.

396
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,420
They're thousands of years old.

397
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,160
The elder brothers and sisters of mine.

398
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,160


399
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,860
The elders of the goddesshood of the hidden mountain are speaking through me and I'm

400
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,020
channeling their homeopathic wisdom.

401
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,740
Well, I don't know...

402
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,800
Water has a memory.

403
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,860
Did you know that?

404
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,740
Water has memory?

405
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,820
Yeah, water has a memory.

406
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,500
Well, that's the premise for storing information.

407
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,120
Water, like in Rollerball.

408
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,940
I'm a new age homeopath.

409
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,000
Water has a memory.

410
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,140
See, if you put one molecule in a bottle, it's like water.

411
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,140


412
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,140


413
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,140


414
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,880
If you put one molecule of medicine in it, why, then you can sell tiny, tiny jars of

415
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,120
it for thousands of dollars because it has medicine in it.

416
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,720
Because water remembers.

417
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,940
I saw that in a movie called What the Bleak Do We Know?

418
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:03,000
And that movie proved what the makers of the movie know, which was a bunch of hogwash.

419
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,000
You see, I'm adherent of the forbidden sciences.

420
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,140
Oh, yeah?

421
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,820
Not the allowed sciences or the quiet sciences, but the...

422
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,480
What?

423
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,780
The arcane truths.

424
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,980
What are they?

425
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,240
Can you explain in detail if you have them?

426
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,860
If you have five, think of your Oriflex...

427
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,840
Dave, explain it in detail.

428
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:33,140
Isn't that what we've been doing for the last 35 years for an hour a week?

429
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:39,180
Explaining or at least teasing, hinting at the arcane secrets.

430
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,140
That's what I thought.

431
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:47,180
Or going so deep that perhaps fracking is not a solution or reverse or whatever you

432
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:47,580
call it.

433
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,000
Injection.

434
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,740
And injection into another planetary sphere would be nice too, but you hear everybody

435
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,660
speak about lately.

436
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:04,240
You hear all the big humdrums and the fatwigs on various radio shows using your expressions

437
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,700
freely.

438
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,500
The pundits and punsters.

439
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,580
The pundits and punsters.

440
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,140
And what they don't pull over us is the fact that we're not going to be able to do anything.

441
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,140


442
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,140


443
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,420
They're just going to be on their own memories, can't be given anywhere else.

444
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,640
There's no sukkur or balm of Gilead coming from those breasts.

445
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,900
They're just feeding us a bunch of...

446
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,960
It's bad to say it.

447
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,120
Lone cow Dave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

448
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,620
Of course I remember that.

449
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:34,880
I think it was 1974 in the backyard of my grandmother's house.

450
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,960
No, it was in the backseat of your grandmother's car with Reverend Televangelo.

451
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,120
Oh boy.

452
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,920
Remember Reverend Televangelo?

453
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,160
Yes.

454
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,340
She was very pretty.

455
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,940
The car is not in the yard though, because it certainly is.

456
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,280
For all intents and purposes, you know, you live in the car in the back of the house.

457
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,980
We'll all live in the car in the back of the house soon, Dave.

458
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,900
Behind the rich man's house.

459
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,960
We live in the abandoned car behind the rich man's house.

460
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,100
That's the fate of what was once the most...

461
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,580
Middle class.

462
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,980
We'll live in a bog among the reeds, Paul.

463
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,120
That'll be about it.

464
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,780
Just a little sphincter movement to the right, a little sphincter movement to the left.

465
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:25,060
Everything's fine and settled back into the grit of post-urban society.

466
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,500
Whatever this is, this transhumanistic...

467
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,780
Hey, did you ever read Bill McKibben?

468
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,560
No.

469
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,220
He makes you cry.

470
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,800
Well, I'll drop that right there.

471
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,480
He'll make you cry?

472
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:37,940
This one.

473
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,120
This one.

474
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,880
This one.

475
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:38,980
This one.

476
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:39,980
The first one.

477
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:39,980


478
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:47,940
Those who can do, those who can't teach, those who can't teach become cultural critics.

479
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,040
There, how's that?

480
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,580
Well, that's perfect, but it still doesn't make sense in the way that we...

481
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,340
The reason I mentioned that...

482
00:26:59,340 --> 00:26:59,780
...in the way that we...

483
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:06,900
In this book about the church of the sub-genius, the guy said that there hadn't been a lot

484
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:14,020
of academic coverage of the church but some of it was negative okay here this

485
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:21,060
is good you'll like this chapter 3 academic responses a brief survey of the

486
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:26,640
literature in contrast to the occasionally alarmed attention of law

487
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,300
enforcement to the Church of the subgenius academia has hardly bothered

488
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:37,500
to take a second look at Bob until the 2010 publication of Carol Cusack's

489
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,420
invented religions imagination fiction and faith there had been very little

490
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:48,160
serious examination of the Church of the subgenius as Cusack notes in her work

491
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,820
quote most critics are hostile in the sense that they are certain that the

492
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:59,680
Church of the subgenius is a childish prank and nothing more unquote a few

493
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,060
references that can be found

494
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:01,280
you can see the reference to the book of the church of the subgenius in the

495
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:01,480
book of the church of the subgenius in the

496
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:01,480


497
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,260
few references that can be found are usually brief and dismissive for

498
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:05,780
few references that can be found are usually brief and dismissive for

499
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:15,960
example Paul Mann's May 1995 postmodern culture essay stupid undergrounds

500
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:22,320
describes the Church of the subgenius as quote worthless expansive and

501
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:28,360
aggressively sophomoric in his criticism of various underground challenges to

502
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,120
traditional rationality Cusack also

503
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,520
notes Mann's scathing assessment of the Church of subgenius writing that he has

504
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:42,820
quote foamed at the mouth over JR Bob Dobbs and dismisses the impact of their

505
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:48,340
satire now here's the funny part I've looked up this guy Paul Mann in

506
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:48,880
Wikipedia

507
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,900
and he's not in there!

508
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,080
he wasn't considered notable enough to be in Wikipedia but guess who is Reverend Ivan Stang how about that

509
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,880
uh-huh

510
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,640
And dr. Renfield Fuckhunter aka Dr Firely Drummond

511
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:09,700
Dr. Well I'm already dead so let's give it a try

512
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:14,820
I mean, why not live each day as if you died a couple

513
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,300
weeks ago and smell the same way my theory about the whole thing you're not

514
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,540
really the populating you're on your undulating to a different rhythm you

515
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:29,060
don't know yeah like you're not depopulating your undulating to a different rhythm uh-huh

516
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,700
rhythm. It's all by virtue. That's a household knowledge. That's more than a

517
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:39,260
noticeable too. It's about, it goes far far into space, you know, the vibrations and

518
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,980
waves go on forever. Every stupid vibration is made because everything's

519
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:49,640
constantly making stupid vibrations goes on forever. What a blight on the universe.

520
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,960
Maybe. Well anyway, I just thought it was funny that that cultural critic of

521
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,080
postmodernism never did anything worth listing in Wikipedia or anywhere else. I

522
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,280
typed his name in and there were about ten notable Paul Manns, but they weren't

523
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:12,740
him. Though Mann's complaint seems to miss the complexity of subgenius parody,

524
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,000
he also seems offended by the energy of the subgenius' voluntary creative

525
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,820
participation in collective critique. Quote, oh this is good,

526
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,940
the cult of Dobbs Christensen

527
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,520
analyse a rabid over-participation in the stupid spectacle

528
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,260
of the Real that goes far beyond any blank parody or post modern pastiche.

529
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:41,480
In an... Then our on a friend goes on. In an age, that has been noted for

530
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:47,020
increasing isolation and disengagement, participation seems an odd thing to

531
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,100
condemn, as subgenious history reveals the rhetorical performance of the church

532
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,920
can sometimes evoke passion. But ifacjiah is guilty of sounds of holes, vision of

533
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:54,920


534
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,780
guided responses, like when that guy killed that person that one time.

535
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,400
And they have not been limited to mere academic polemics.

536
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,860
And then he goes to some other bookie person who said,

537
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:12,180
oh, the Haverford Journal essay, quote,

538
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,860
the new traditionalists, Baudrillard, Devoe,

539
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,620
and the postmodern de-evolution of the simulation.

540
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:25,920
Listen, he focuses on rhetoric to describe subgenius impact on Devoe.

541
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,540
The pseudo-religious organization's rhetoric forms yet another pillar

542
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,400
of Devoe's de-evolutionary philosophy.

543
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,660
The church is an artificial postmodern religion that ordains priests,

544
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,840
such as founding Devoe member Mark Mothersma at the low, low price of $29.95.

545
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,800
We never did that.

546
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,140
We never sold membership.

547
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,620
We never sold membership for $29.95.

548
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,480
No.

549
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,520
It's always been $29.96.

550
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,160
Yeah.

551
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:53,380
No.

552
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,220
So it's been round.

553
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,600
No, we actually, we round them off because it's hard for us to do the math.

554
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,720
Well, are you supposed to be doubting the credibility of somebody who did a thesis about you?

555
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,160
Yeah.

556
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,920
I mean, is this Paul?

557
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,420
Yeah.

558
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:08,720
Is this Paul Mann existing, or is he like, are you going to have to go?

559
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,620
I'm sure he's.

560
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,520
And search through literary journals, because there's a lot of people named Paul Mann.

561
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,160
You wouldn't expect him to appear in Wikipedia.

562
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,860
But he might appear in the line.

563
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:18,220
Yeah.

564
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:29,100
I mean, I've read a Harvard College review of photojournalistic essays on pubic hairs and formations in the nearby rock structures or something.

565
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:34,580
And, you know, they got all that stuff like they talk about, you know, like you were just saying.

566
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,100
Well, I got one thing to say.

567
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,160
You've got to search through literary journals.

568
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,480
Fight the man.

569
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,120
Fight Paul Mann.

570
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,420
Actually, I'm sure he's dead by now.

571
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,800
No, he might be on his.

572
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,040
He might be sailing his.

573
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:48,700
He might be sailing his.

574
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,420
He might be sailing his.

575
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:49,420


576
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:49,780


577
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:49,780


578
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:49,780


579
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:49,780


580
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:49,780


581
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:59,180
Someplace where the luminaries don't shine, you know, just to hang in his head in shame and then going around hoping for tenure, which is more than five year.

582
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,000
Well, apparently we have been mentioned in a whole bunch more books.

583
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:10,460
We were mentioned in Magic, Rhetoric and Literacy by William A. Covino.

584
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,980
You Google that one successfully?

585
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,500
No, I haven't bothered with most of these other ones because they like us.

586
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:17,980
They thought.

587
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,780
We were funny.

588
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,660
A world of fantasy gone wild.

589
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,180
And they spell fantasy with a P-H.

590
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,820
A protean sophistry.

591
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,940
Which, okay.

592
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,400
You don't need to say that in a scientific journal.

593
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,760
So, man, those guys are rough on each other.

594
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,640
Princess, you'll like this one.

595
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,780
Listen to this line.

596
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,720
In a unique observation, Covino demonstrates some interesting rhetorical parallels between the description of.

597
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:56,280
Bob from the book of the subgenius and a contemporary description of the goddess by author activist Starhawk.

598
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,060
Oh, my.

599
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,180
Yeah.

600
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,680
So this guy compares us to Starhawk.

601
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,140
Goodness.

602
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,780
We compared Bob's description to Starhawk's.

603
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,580
Interesting statements about some fictitious goddess.

604
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,640
I see.

605
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,400
It's very, very interesting.

606
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,760
And there's a parallel with Marcuse.

607
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,520
His great refusal countering the commodification of culture.

608
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,400
A riotous acknowledgement.

609
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,100
The part about when he fought in the Spanish Civil War.

610
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,960
I remember that.

611
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,260
The part where Stan was a hero in the Spanish Civil War.

612
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:36,520
Where he saved a bunch of American volunteers by washing tampons and putting strange articles in his eye, ears, and nose.

613
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,740
Here's a good one.

614
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,020
This is a real good one.

615
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:47,660
It seems Covino's final analysis of the church is tainted by the hyperbolic observation.

616
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,020
Of former subgenius J.

617
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,720
Kinney.

618
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,660
As recorded in the fall 86 issue of Whole Earth Review.

619
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,500
Kinney fears that.

620
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,280
Now get this.

621
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:58,760
Quote.

622
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,860
The church's widespread cynicism is a license for widespread hatred.

623
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,380
And that quote.

624
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,900
The church's absolute cynicism is tantamount to fascism.

625
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,740
Now the funny thing is.

626
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,840
I know J.

627
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,360
Kinney.

628
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,640
He's a little friend of ours.

629
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,220
He was the guy who first put us in touch with.

630
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,420
For crime.

631
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,040
Yes.

632
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,860
And Paul Maverick.

633
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,400
Yes.

634
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,000
J.

635
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:21,840
Kinney was kidding.

636
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,580
Funny letters.

637
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,300
This.

638
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,340
The statement about the church.

639
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,900
That these academics have been quoting for 25 years.

640
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,920
Was written like the church itself.

641
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:34,920
In jest.

642
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,040
J.

643
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,460
Kinney was kidding.

644
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,640
And these academics have.

645
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,600
It's.

646
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,840
They're academics.

647
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:46,520
Yeah.

648
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:46,880
Right.

649
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,700
What can you say?

650
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:47,960
What.

651
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:48,320
You know.

652
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,260
They're half and half.

653
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,460
Just like everything else.

654
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,480
Like the authorities.

655
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,900
And the anti-authorities.

656
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,160
Half of them are into it.

657
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:55,340
To be.

658
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,420
Do good things.

659
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,780
And get stuff out there.

660
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,800
And the other half are just.

661
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,640
Well.

662
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,280
They have to get.

663
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,660
They learned how to speak this way.

664
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,460
And just like.

665
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,420
They still had to do a lot of work.

666
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,660
And it was probably fun for them.

667
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,700
And they're a real jerk off.

668
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,140
No.

669
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,700
Never mind.

670
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:09,780
I.

671
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,360
I.

672
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,140
Went too far off one range.

673
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,680
Among academic responses.

674
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,000
Carol Cusack's invented religions.

675
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:17,900
Represents.

676
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,160
The first thorough and thoughtful analysis.

677
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,880
Of the church of the subgenius.

678
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,540
Making it a central text.

679
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,640
In my brief review of the literature.

680
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:26,680
No.

681
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,560
Nevertheless.

682
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,860
Cusack argues.

683
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,520
That.

684
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,460
In the context of 17th century.

685
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,040
English ranters.

686
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,980
The church has a quote.

687
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,680
Legitimate pedigree.

688
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,260
In the history of western religion.

689
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,440
One that stresses anarchic protest.

690
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,840
Sensual indulgence.

691
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,360
And innate divinity.

692
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,520
I think they.

693
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,560
What they meant was.

694
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:50,900
Divine.

695
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,080
Innainity.

696
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,880
I thought.

697
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,440
We were.

698
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:56,880
Diddling.

699
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,460
Innainity.

700
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:57,900
I think.

701
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,320
So there was a misprint in here.

702
00:36:59,560 --> 00:36:59,960
Oh.

703
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,720
I thought you were.

704
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,300
Offering sexual amenities.

705
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:02,960
That's not.

706
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,400
How bad my hearing is going.

707
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:04,700
Right.

708
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,060
Lately.

709
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,340
I think it's from putting.

710
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:06,980
Tabasco.

711
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,120
Stars.

712
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,180
On.

713
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,760
Right in there.

714
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,140
You know.

715
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,020
Where it isn't.

716
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,500
Really.

717
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,700
You stuck it in your ear.

718
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,180
Didn't you.

719
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:15,460
Dave.

720
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,700
They told you not to.

721
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,500
Well.

722
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,360
They said.

723
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:19,640
If you.

724
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Put those nails.

725
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,740
They said.

726
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,440
Dave.

727
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,800
If you put those nails in your ear.

728
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,160
We're not going to let you watch TV.

729
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,320
In the group room anymore.

730
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,800
Have you ever watched the plasma.

731
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,900
Grow in the group room.

732
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:30,920
Have you ever.

733
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,900
Ever seen the plants.

734
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,580
Wave to you.

735
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,620
And then start to bark.

736
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,740
Softly in the wind.

737
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,400
No.

738
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,760
I was never locked up.

739
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,860
In a mental institution.

740
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,900
Like you were.

741
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,320
Dave.

742
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,400
I was not locked up there.

743
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:41,940
I was there.

744
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,860
Of my own free will.

745
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,760
And I could come and go.

746
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,300
As I please.

747
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,320
And I just chose.

748
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,220
To not be held.

749
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,500
And dragged down to the ground.

750
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,200
And beaten up.

751
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,420
By people with street jackets.

752
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,540
As the great man once said.

753
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,240
Stop abusing that substance abuser.

754
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,640
Now.

755
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,380
Baby.

756
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,620
Oh.

757
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,760
That is one of my favorite songs.

758
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,500
Especially in Quebec nowadays.

759
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,280
Where everybody.

760
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,040
You know.

761
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,520
Get silly on the church.

762
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,580
Of the subgenius.

763
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,660
And everything.

764
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,340
The guy like.

765
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:09,720
Got there.

766
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,180
You know.

767
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,240
I think God.

768
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,820
God got mad at Tibet.

769
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,180
No.

770
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,380
No.

771
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:13,840
It was Nepal.

772
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:14,900
God.

773
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,300
Oh.

774
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:15,600
Man.

775
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,880
He put the hammer down.

776
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,100
The hell out there.

777
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,520
You know.

778
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,440
Those people must have done something.

779
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,860
They must have legalized.

780
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,640
Gay marriage.

781
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,140
Or something.

782
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,600
In Nepal.

783
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,460
Because they.

784
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,120
Did you hear about that Princess?

785
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,380
Were you about the terrible earthquake?

786
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:29,640
Yes.

787
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,680
It shook Mount Everest.

788
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,140
Yes.

789
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:31,940
I did.

790
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:32,580
Yes.

791
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,440
It shook Mount Everest.

792
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,000
And a bunch of rich people got killed.

793
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,020
They were climbing Mount Everest.

794
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,380
Yeah.

795
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,520
Two Americans.

796
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,020
Who probably would still be alive.

797
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,340
If they'd never been rich.

798
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,340
And successful enough.

799
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,800
To live their lifelong dream.

800
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,200
Of.

801
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,060
Climbing Mount Everest.

802
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,200
Yeah.

803
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:47,840
Which of course.

804
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,660
Ended their life.

805
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:48,940
Because.

806
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,680
Happened to climb it.

807
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,140
On the day.

808
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,680
When the big earthquake happened.

809
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,900
And there was an avalanche.

810
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,540
Well they turned it into a tourist event.

811
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,200
Where like.

812
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:56,480
You know.

813
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,040
Your helicopter.

814
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,880
About three quarters of the way up there.

815
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,100
So you're just taking a walk.

816
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,300
In a place real close to the crest.

817
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,100
And then.

818
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:04,640
You know.

819
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,280
If you're one of the.

820
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,380
A climber.

821
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,080
Who has a.

822
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,440
A Sherpa with him.

823
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,360
Then you can go all the way up.

824
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,240
And put your.

825
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:11,900
You know.

826
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,420
Your rings.

827
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,300
And your goblets.

828
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,240
And all your different.

829
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:15,780
I have.

830
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,120
You carried from the church.

831
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,380
Church.

832
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,200
On the top of the suitcase.

833
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,960
Whisk it back.

834
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,240
It's a tourist event now.

835
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,080
The helicopters aren't even real anymore.

836
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,360
They.

837
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,320
I read that.

838
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,380
On Mount Everest.

839
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,340
At the various.

840
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,040
Camp.

841
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,720
Base camps.

842
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,060
That you stop along the way.

843
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,120
There's.

844
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,160
There's so much.

845
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,580
Human excrement.

846
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,940
That it's piled up.

847
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:37,340
In.

848
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,140
Like.

849
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,540
Huge walls.

850
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:40,800
Because.

851
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,700
What do you do with it?

852
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,680
It's frozen.

853
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,540
It's frozen solid.

854
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,040
There's no air or heat.

855
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,240
To decompose.

856
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:46,620
The poo-poos.

857
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,180
It doesn't decompose.

858
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,180
It just freezes.

859
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,360
And they pile it up.

860
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,500
In huge piles.

861
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,240
So there's giant piles.

862
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,080
Of frozen.

863
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,460
Poo-poo.

864
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,620
Of people.

865
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,740
Not yet.

866
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,040
He's.

867
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:58,820
You can't grow.

868
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,940
Frop on this stuff.

869
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,020
Or you can.

870
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,760
You probably grow.

871
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,400
Some kind of.

872
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:02,860
No account.

873
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:03,640
Dirt weed.

874
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,860
Marijuana or something.

875
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,620
But you can't grow.

876
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,060
Frop.

877
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,800
Unholy.

878
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,420
Not on human.

879
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,740
Not on frozen human.

880
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,520
And so.

881
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,800
So.

882
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,300
You know.

883
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:11,780
It's sad.

884
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,260
How people just have wasted.

885
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,040
And you know.

886
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,560
They're talking about.

887
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,400
Putting a tram.

888
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,160
Into the Grand Canyon.

889
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,660
Did you hear about that?

890
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,640
It's the lag tights.

891
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:22,800
You mean.

892
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,380
The micro.

893
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:23,900
I mean.

894
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,460
The Mennonites.

895
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:24,920
No.

896
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,380
No.

897
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,000
In fact.

898
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,900
The Navajo.

899
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,800
And.

900
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:28,660
Or.

901
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,120
Whichever Indians are.

902
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,060
In control of that section.

903
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,040
Of the Grand Canyon.

904
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,100
Where they have that big.

905
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,160
Glass.

906
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,080
Shelf.

907
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,080
That you can walk on.

908
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:37,920
For fifty dollars.

909
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,220
And look down.

910
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,720
They are.

911
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,520
Seriously.

912
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,300
Considering.

913
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,420
Putting a tram.

914
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,000
So that anybody.

915
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,080
Can go down.

916
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:46,540
To the bottom.

917
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,600
Of the Grand Canyon.

918
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,720
Just get right on.

919
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,160
And you know.

920
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,360
What that's going to mean?

921
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:51,840
Trash.

922
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,520
And noise.

923
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,680
And big.

924
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,240
Fat.

925
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,060
Waddling.

926
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:55,720
Americans.

927
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,940
And Asian tourists.

928
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:57,720
Everywhere.

929
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,080
The animals.

930
00:40:59,220 --> 00:40:59,780
Will all.

931
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,460
Go away.

932
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,700
And someday.

933
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,620
The Grand Canyon.

934
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,140
Will just be filled with.

935
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,160
Big gulp.

936
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,180
Cartons.

937
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:07,800
And.

938
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,520
Burger wrappers.

939
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,160
Blowing.

940
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:11,880
Through the wind.

941
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:12,940
As it is.

942
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,700
The Grand Canyon.

943
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,240
Is so.

944
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:14,960
Grand.

945
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,000
That I know.

946
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,180
That I'll never be able.

947
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:17,920
To walk down.

948
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,400
In there.

949
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,100
Because then.

950
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,200
I'd have to walk back out.

951
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,460
And I've stood on the.

952
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,220
I've sat.

953
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,020
Halfway.

954
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,660
A little ways.

955
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,300
Down the trail.

956
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:25,760
And watched.

957
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,480
Strapping young people.

958
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,420
Walking out of the Grand Canyon.

959
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,680
And the pain.

960
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,820
On their faces.

961
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,680
Is how I knew.

962
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,640
That I would never.

963
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,280
Do that.

964
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,180
But now.

965
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,000
They're talking about.

966
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:37,440
Putting.

967
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,220
For money.

968
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,160
Putting.

969
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,300
A tram.

970
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,440
Or you know.

971
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:41,940
A subway.

972
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,400
A subway.

973
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,400


974
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:43,700
Whatchamacallit.

975
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,640
A conveyance.

976
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,400
A conveyance.

977
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:45,780
A train.

978
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,800
That goes down.

979
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,520
From the top.

980
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,280
To the bottom.

981
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,280
Of the Grand Canyon.

982
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,120
So that the waddling.

983
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,140
Obese Americans.

984
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,020
And other.

985
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:53,740
Tourists.

986
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,620
Can suck their thumbs.

987
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,260
While they.

988
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,380
Shuffle along.

989
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:57,780
Going.

990
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,000
It's hot down here.

991
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,520
Why should air condition.

992
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,280
This place?

993
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,140
Because people.

994
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:05,880
Are spoiled.

995
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,120
Foul.

996
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:07,900
Ugly.

997
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,500
Things.

998
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,640
Whose.

999
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,360
Lives.

1000
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,400
Are not.

1001
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,060
But.

1002
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,320
An endless.

1003
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,200
Succession.

1004
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,040
Of vile.

1005
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:15,900
Tasks.

1006
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,640
I must say.

1007
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,780
As a personal reflection.

1008
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:19,900
I visited.

1009
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,620
Chaco Canyon.

1010
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,200
One time.

1011
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,440
And the thousand.

1012
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,240
A couple.

1013
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:23,880
How many thousand.

1014
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,680
Year old trail.

1015
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,200
Which is very straight.

1016
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,120
But very narrow.

1017
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,120
Was damaged.

1018
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,440
While I was there.

1019
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,400
By a bus full of stupid.

1020
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,600
German tourists.

1021
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,200
Oh my.

1022
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:33,520
That thing is named.

1023
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,000
Deutschland.

1024
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,640
But it's like.

1025
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,420
Let's go.

1026
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:37,800
Okay.

1027
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,440
Let's go.

1028
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:38,860
You know.

1029
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,240
And like.

1030
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,440
No man.

1031
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,680
It's hard for one car.

1032
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,760
To go on this trail.

1033
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,240
And everybody suggests.

1034
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,360
You use the regular.

1035
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,240
You know.

1036
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,640
20th century.

1037
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,300
Asphalt.

1038
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:48,940
Trail.

1039
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,160
That extends.

1040
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,160
All the way around.

1041
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,420
But isn't the old one.

1042
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,780
But they let you go on it.

1043
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,520
And the tribal elders.

1044
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,280
Of which.

1045
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,080
There aren't any.

1046
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:57,760
It's the.

1047
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,760
Park system.

1048
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,540
Told the police.

1049
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,560
That they had no.

1050
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,040
Right.

1051
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,320
Or left.

1052
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,360
Or shoe.

1053
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:05,820
Well.

1054
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,240
You know.

1055
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:06,620
Dave.

1056
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,000
You're right about.

1057
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:09,280
The.

1058
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,440
The tribal elders.

1059
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,320
Have pretty much.

1060
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,020
Been replaced.

1061
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:12,820
By tribal.

1062
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:13,980
Politicians.

1063
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,280
Who run.

1064
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,440
For the office.

1065
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:16,940
Of.

1066
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,080
President.

1067
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:18,700
Or chief.

1068
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,640
Of the tribe.

1069
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,280
And they're just like.

1070
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,120
Every other.

1071
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,240
Kind of politician.

1072
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:24,660
And the corruption.

1073
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:25,360
Within.

1074
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:26,680
Tribal.

1075
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:27,580
Organizations.

1076
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,020
Is one of the biggest.

1077
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:29,760
Problems.

1078
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,780
That our Native American.

1079
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:31,960
Brothers and sisters.

1080
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:32,480
Have.

1081
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,680
It's not just.

1082
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,000
Problems from.

1083
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:35,580
Outside.

1084
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,120
From the pink man.

1085
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,400
But the.

1086
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,560
But the fellow.

1087
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,480
Red man.

1088
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,260
Sometimes.

1089
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,140
Is.

1090
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:43,820
Spitting.

1091
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,320
A bunch of.

1092
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:44,740
Red man.

1093
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,180
All over.

1094
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:45,600
The place.

1095
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,680
So to speak.

1096
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:48,800
Isn't that a kind of.

1097
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,080
Chaw.

1098
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:49,900
Tobacco.

1099
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,760
I think so.

1100
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,040
Red man.

1101
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:52,560
Yeah.

1102
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,300
You know.

1103
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:53,900
Everything gets.

1104
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:54,780
In our land.

1105
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,080
The conspiracy.

1106
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,400
Lives inside.

1107
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,180
Even.

1108
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,500
The most devout.

1109
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,640
And pure.

1110
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:01,600
Subgenius.

1111
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,400
It's kind of a.

1112
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,160
Contradiction.

1113
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:04,660
In terms.

1114
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,120
There.

1115
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,440
You know.

1116
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:07,920
But I mean.

1117
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,120
You know.

1118
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:10,940
You know.

1119
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,220
We.

1120
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,620
We run into the same.

1121
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:13,860
Silly.

1122
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,400
Stupid.

1123
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:14,940
Office.

1124
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:15,120
Office.

1125
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,580
Politics.

1126
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:16,700
Even within our.

1127
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,700
Nice little.

1128
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:19,340
Harmless cult.

1129
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,600
Harmless.

1130
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,060
Until next day.

1131
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:22,480
That is.

1132
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,960
When our brothers.

1133
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,900
From the stars.

1134
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:26,580
Shall come.

1135
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,200
And give us the weapons.

1136
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,800
We have long.

1137
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:30,780
Awaited.

1138
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,180
That we may.

1139
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:32,880
Meet.

1140
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,180
Out.

1141
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,100
Vengeance.

1142
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:34,520
On the.

1143
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,220
Incensei.

1144
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:36,740
Meat.

1145
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:37,580
Puppets.

1146
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,620
We call.

1147
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,600
Humans.

1148
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:40,720
E.

1149
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:41,940


1150
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:42,360
E.

1151
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,220
E.

1152
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:44,380
E.

1153
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:44,480
E.

1154
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:44,920
E.

1155
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,920


1156
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,920


1157
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,920


1158
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,920


1159
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,920


1160
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,920


1161
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,920


1162
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,920


1163
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,920


1164
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,920


1165
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,920


1166
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,920


1167
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,920


1168
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,920


1169
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,920


1170
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:44,920


1171
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,140
E.

1172
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:46,120


1173
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:46,440
E.

1174
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:46,880
E.

1175
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,540
E.

1176
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:48,740
E.

1177
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:48,740


1178
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:48,740


1179
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:48,740


1180
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,740
My throat hurts again.

1181
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,220
Yeah.

1182
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,740
I had just a.

1183
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,760
Short while.

1184
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:53,780
You will be.

1185
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,180
Fine as wine.

1186
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:55,420
In.

1187
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,040
Supper time.

1188
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,680
And just to relax.

1189
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,220
And.

1190
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,700
Tell us more.

1191
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,340
About the.

1192
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:00,980
Antiquities.

1193
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,220
And about your.

1194
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,580
Your own life.

1195
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,200
At home.

1196
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,020
Were you a.

1197
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:05,940
Coddled child.

1198
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,260
Or were you.

1199
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,620
A reasonably.

1200
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,320
Good boy.

1201
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,220
I was a.

1202
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,200
Cobbled child.

1203
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:12,960
They.

1204
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:13,980
Shoot me.

1205
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:14,680
Like.

1206
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,120
A horse.

1207
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,920
And they built.

1208
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:17,420
The shoes.

1209
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:18,100
They nailed.

1210
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:18,520
The shoes.

1211
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,620
Around my feet.

1212
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,640
And said.

1213
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,600
Now go and walk.

1214
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,020
My son.

1215
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:22,300
Actually.

1216
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,020
We were talking to.

1217
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:23,620
Pappy today.

1218
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,100
That's my father.

1219
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:26,160
About.

1220
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:26,720
Your feet.

1221
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:27,900
Eighty six.

1222
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,620
And he said.

1223
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:29,600
I.

1224
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:30,680
He said.

1225
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,320
What did he say.

1226
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:31,880
He basically.

1227
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,500
Was explaining.

1228
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:32,920
Why.

1229
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,140
I was stupid.

1230
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:35,420
Because.

1231
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:35,900
He.

1232
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,340
Had imparted.

1233
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:37,680
To me.

1234
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,100
Certain.

1235
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:38,980
Arcane.

1236
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:40,500
And.

1237
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,380
Occult.

1238
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,480
Secrets.

1239
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,080
That.

1240
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:44,680
He says.

1241
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,240
Essentially.

1242
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,440
Made me.

1243
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:47,260
Rather than.

1244
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,180
The sharpest.

1245
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:48,860
Sharpest.

1246
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,720
Hunting knife.

1247
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:51,500
Instead.

1248
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,460
Into a wooden.

1249
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,500
Stirring spoon.

1250
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,240
Dull.

1251
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:55,720
And.

1252
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,440
Soft.

1253
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,800
My father.

1254
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:58,700
Doesn't.

1255
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,160
Give me.

1256
00:45:59,180 --> 00:45:59,680
All that much.

1257
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:00,240
Respect.

1258
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:00,920
It's funny.

1259
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:02,580
Well.

1260
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,060
I would say.

1261
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,280
Such high winded.

1262
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:04,960
Or long.

1263
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:05,420
You know.

1264
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,480
When it comes to.

1265
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,120
Breaking wind.

1266
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:07,740
Your father.

1267
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,080
Yeah.

1268
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,340
Probably one of the most.

1269
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,380
Supreme aristocrats.

1270
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,340
In the entire universe.

1271
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,360
Well.

1272
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,460
You might say.

1273
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:14,840
The apple.

1274
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,280
Don't fall.

1275
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,320
Far from the tree.

1276
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:17,440
Well.

1277
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:18,440
Apples.

1278
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,220
Are good.

1279
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:20,760
For feeding.

1280
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,260
Horses.

1281
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:21,980
And making them.

1282
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:22,740
Do you know.

1283
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,080
What.

1284
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:23,720
And that's what.

1285
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,140
We're doing.

1286
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:24,540
Right now.

1287
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,420
But I was talking.

1288
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,200
Specifically.

1289
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:26,860
About where.

1290
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:27,380
To get such.

1291
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:28,840
High minded.

1292
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:29,440
Occult.

1293
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,160
Ideas.

1294
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,480
I mean.

1295
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:30,800
There's just.

1296
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:31,340
Some sort of.

1297
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,060
Do you have to wear.

1298
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:33,600
One of them.

1299
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,360
Conical hats.

1300
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,180
No.

1301
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:35,800
My father.

1302
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:36,300
Was saying.

1303
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,180
The opposite.

1304
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:37,620
That.

1305
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,040
Because.

1306
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,520
He had.

1307
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:39,940
Inculcated.

1308
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:40,420
Me.

1309
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,380
As a child.

1310
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,140
With certain.

1311
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:43,600
Arcane.

1312
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:43,960
And.

1313
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:44,680
Occult.

1314
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,360
Garbage.

1315
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:45,680
That.

1316
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,300
That was why.

1317
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,180
I was so dumb.

1318
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:49,360
He loves to.

1319
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:49,860
He.

1320
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,020
He cannot.

1321
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,740
He just cannot.

1322
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:53,580
You know.

1323
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,220
Grant me.

1324
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:54,740
Any.

1325
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:55,980
Slack.

1326
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,640
In terms of.

1327
00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,020
Well.

1328
00:46:59,100 --> 00:46:59,260
You know.

1329
00:46:59,300 --> 00:46:59,920
We ought to show him.

1330
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:00,460
This book.

1331
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:00,920
A good luck.

1332
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,360
Pappy.

1333
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:01,920
This.

1334
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:02,220
This.

1335
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:02,620
This.

1336
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,060
A learned.

1337
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,020
A scholar.

1338
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:04,560
In a dang.

1339
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,260
University.

1340
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:05,740
Somewhere.

1341
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:06,480
And wrote up.

1342
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,320
A fancy book.

1343
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,120
About how smart.

1344
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:08,680
We is.

1345
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,240
Yes.

1346
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,440
You should show that.

1347
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:10,900
To him.

1348
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:11,360
Well.

1349
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:11,680
You know.

1350
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,140
What he'll do.

1351
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,000
He'll skim through it.

1352
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:13,180
And go.

1353
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,060
Well.

1354
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:14,360
How come.

1355
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:14,700
There's not.

1356
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:14,800
Not more.

1357
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:15,660
Color pictures.

1358
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,460
They didn't spend.

1359
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,420
Much money on this.

1360
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:18,620
Now.

1361
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:18,920
Did they?

1362
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:19,880
You know.

1363
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,160
That's.

1364
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:21,200
You know.

1365
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,360
He just.

1366
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:22,940
I do know.

1367
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,200
I love my father.

1368
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:24,800
And I think.

1369
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,460
That he truly.

1370
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,240
Loves me.

1371
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:26,820
Despite.

1372
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:27,540
My.

1373
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,000
What he considers.

1374
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:30,440
To be.

1375
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:30,960
Idiocy.

1376
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:31,780
Because he keeps saying.

1377
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,380
He kept saying.

1378
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:33,620
Now.

1379
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,200
Ivan.

1380
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,040
You need to.

1381
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,200
Learn from that.

1382
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:39,880
Billy Graham.

1383
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:40,440
And.

1384
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:41,980
Jim Baker.

1385
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:42,920
And Jim Jones.

1386
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:43,760
And some of these.

1387
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:44,380
Other successful.

1388
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:45,640
Televangelists.

1389
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,240
And make your.

1390
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:46,760
Churches.

1391
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:47,340
Subgenius.

1392
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:47,980
Fancier.

1393
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,280
So you can get more money.

1394
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:49,860
More money.

1395
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,480
And I was going.

1396
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:51,620
Well.

1397
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,100
But.

1398
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,000
But Pappy.

1399
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:53,440
Well.

1400
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,280
That was what Dr.

1401
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:54,760
Axe.

1402
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,220
Originally.

1403
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,440
Wanted us to do.

1404
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,480
Was to rip off.

1405
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,400
Stupid people.

1406
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,700
Like all the other religions.

1407
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:00,120
Did.

1408
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:00,320
And I.

1409
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,040
I was going.

1410
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:01,420
No.

1411
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,300
No.

1412
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,160
We want to rip off.

1413
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,180
The nice people.

1414
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,540
Not the stupid people.

1415
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,100
So.

1416
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,020
And he never understood that.

1417
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:09,720
No.

1418
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,800
He never got the part.

1419
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,280
Where you can't keep a straight face.

1420
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:12,680
I can't believe.

1421
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:13,540
A lawyer.

1422
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,520
Would not understand.

1423
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:14,940
Oh.

1424
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:15,320
He does.

1425
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:15,780
He.

1426
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:16,180
He.

1427
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,540
He understood it.

1428
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,060
It's just that.

1429
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:18,520
Because.

1430
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,880
It was his son.

1431
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:20,480
That did it.

1432
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,420
He always has to do.

1433
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,240
The one upmanship.

1434
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,160
You see.

1435
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,660
I think that's really odd.

1436
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,080
But.

1437
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,740
I'm kind of stuck in between.

1438
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,360
My son.

1439
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,020
And my dad.

1440
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:29,620
Who both.

1441
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,820
Are constantly proving to me.

1442
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,060
How much better they are.

1443
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:33,480
At everything.

1444
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:35,500
No.

1445
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:35,880
Seriously.

1446
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:36,600
I know.

1447
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:37,340
Well.

1448
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,240
I have to laugh.

1449
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:38,940
It's just bizarre.

1450
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,000
I used.

1451
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:41,720
I used to cook.

1452
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,460
For the family.

1453
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:43,620
You know.

1454
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,040
You know.

1455
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:44,440
Pusket.

1456
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,040
And chili.

1457
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:45,580
And stuff.

1458
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:45,900
Well.

1459
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:46,360
My son.

1460
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,000
Decided to become.

1461
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,080
A gourmet cook.

1462
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,580
He makes sushi.

1463
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:51,600
And things.

1464
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,200
Like that.

1465
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:52,900
Really.

1466
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:53,760
Really fancy stuff.

1467
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:53,760


1468
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,360
He makes amazing things.

1469
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,320
It's just.

1470
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,280
It's just to prove.

1471
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:57,860
That his dad.

1472
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:58,780
Doesn't know how to cook.

1473
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,180
I used to make movies.

1474
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:00,540
Remember.

1475
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,560
I was like a filmmaker.

1476
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:02,100
Well.

1477
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:02,420
He's a.

1478
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:03,400
I was a film editor.

1479
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,500
He's a.

1480
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,140
He's in the director's guild.

1481
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,400
Mm-hmm.

1482
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,460
He lives in Los Angeles.

1483
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:08,880
Hollywood.

1484
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:09,520
Mm-hmm.

1485
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:09,940
Mm-hmm.

1486
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:10,220
Mm-hmm.

1487
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:10,320
So.

1488
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:10,620
They.

1489
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:10,800
They.

1490
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:11,920
They're motivated.

1491
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,280
My whole family's motivated.

1492
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:14,660
By how to make.

1493
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,640
Poor old.

1494
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:16,900
Grandpa.

1495
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:17,780
Stang.

1496
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:18,440
Feel.

1497
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:19,480
Inadequate.

1498
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:20,640
But.

1499
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,280
I won't listen to him.

1500
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,860
Because I'm a sub-genius.

1501
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,840
We're not as smart as geniuses.

1502
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,200
We're sub-geniuses.

1503
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:27,900
We're not.

1504
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,280
We're.

1505
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:28,960
We're better.

1506
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:29,640
Just because.

1507
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,820
Not because we're smarter.

1508
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:32,540
Or better looking.

1509
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:33,900
Because we ain't.

1510
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:34,480
Amenical case.

1511
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,580
Just because.

1512
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,620
Just because.

1513
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,420
That's all.

1514
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:39,880
Because why?

1515
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:40,480
That's why.

1516
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:41,200
Because why?

1517
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,320
Because.

1518
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,020
Because.

1519
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:44,360
Because.

1520
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,000
Hey, did our music finally end?

1521
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,020
No, that was.

1522
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:49,700
I think.

1523
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,120
It's a sort of.

1524
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,900
Gently faded away.

1525
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:58,820
I use this CD because it is 40 minutes of non-stop music.

1526
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:06,160
By people who slayed Pink's for Charlie Manson.

1527
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:10,900
It's from the soundtrack album of the film Lucifer Rising.

1528
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:12,640
Kenneth Anger.

1529
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:12,840
Oh, man.

1530
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,040
This unbelievably boring art movie.

1531
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:16,840
Oh, it is.

1532
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,320
It's so.

1533
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:17,640
God.

1534
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,100
He saw me walk out of the theater.

1535
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:20,920
I'm so bored.

1536
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,140
He gave me that autographed poster.

1537
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:24,720
That's another autograph we have.

1538
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,000
Yes.

1539
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,620
Kenneth Anger.

1540
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,440
He gave me a poster.

1541
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,500
And he gave me the record album of this.

1542
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,860
And then I went into the theater and watched several of his famous underground movies.

1543
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,960
And they were so dull.

1544
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,120
And then when it came.

1545
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,820
Pretentious and artsy-fartsy and pompous.

1546
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:41,960
And then.

1547
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:42,220
Then.

1548
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,960
Then Lucifer Rising starts up.

1549
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:44,480
And it's like.

1550
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:47,460
And I thought, I need to sneak out of here.

1551
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,220
But I hope the famous director, Kenneth Anger, doesn't see me.

1552
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:50,820
But he did.

1553
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:57,300
And then when I ran into him again 10 years later, I said, hey, could we use your music on the Hour of Slack?

1554
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:57,960
And he said, no.

1555
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,560
It's sacred music recorded in a prison by Bobby Boosalil.

1556
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:05,500
The Charles Manson's minion.

1557
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,820
And you can't use it for any subgenius stuff.

1558
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:09,900
So.

1559
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,080
So the anger in Kenneth Anger.

1560
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:12,480
Came out.

1561
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,680
It's going to be even angrier now.

1562
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:18,120
Because I just played that home record in the background on a stupid subgenius show.

1563
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:25,600
Hello?

1564
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:30,520
What?

1565
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,080
Hello?

1566
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:31,880
Hello?

1567
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:32,980
Hello?

1568
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:33,600
What?

1569
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,520
What's happening?

1570
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,760
Is this the theological hotline?

1571
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,340
How can we make you hot?

1572
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,040
Well, it's just a question.

1573
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:44,380
It's a question of controversy over the last few millennia.

1574
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:52,340
I've always wondered if Dobbs, perhaps, doesn't recreate himself over every generation for the last few.

1575
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:57,700
If he doesn't just become a new thing for time.

1576
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,400
And then becomes an old thing.

1577
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,220
And becomes a new thing.

1578
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,320
And self-renewal.

1579
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,580
Like Oslapis.

1580
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,700
Or Mamamoo.

1581
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,220
Mamamoo.

1582
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,160
Mamamoo.

1583
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,760
I don't know what the heck that boy's going on about.

1584
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:11,960
I don't know.

1585
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:14,920
And I don't know where that alien voice came from either.

1586
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,300
I think that was Dave's tape recorder, wasn't it?

1587
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:20,900
Was it?

1588
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:22,100
Was ist?

1589
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,560
Was ist los?

1590
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,580
Was ist los?

1591
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,040
The hunt is los.

1592
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,060
No, no, no.

1593
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,260
Hey, I have, it's getting near to the end of show.

1594
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,180
And we haven't played much music.

1595
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:38,940
But I have some new music from Reverend Byrne.

1596
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,500
His last name is Bridges.

1597
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,220
Reverend Byrne Bridges.

1598
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:48,040
And I think he's an American, but he's in Germany.

1599
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,680
Reverend Byrne Bridges?

1600
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,300
What do you think of that, Princess Leigh?

1601
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,100
I think he's in Berlin.

1602
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,240
And his name is Byrne?

1603
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,420
Byrne Bridges.

1604
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,320
Byrne Bridges.

1605
00:52:59,320 --> 00:52:59,740
Byrne Bridges.

1606
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,440
I like it.

1607
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,760
It's a good name.

1608
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:05,000
And he sent three pieces of anti-music for Bob,

1609
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,340
of which I'm going to play one for three minutes,

1610
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,100
starting in two minutes.

1611
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,160
And that'll be the end of the show.

1612
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:12,720
The end of our show.

1613
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:14,840
So there, I've done that.

1614
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,180
Yeah, two minutes from now, I will play this.

1615
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,460
And it's very, it's quite different.

1616
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,540
It's new.

1617
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,320
It's brand new.

1618
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,020
I might want to listen to some of that,

1619
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,220
even though I'm not participating.

1620
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,880
But I might want to linger to.

1621
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,300
I'll leave you on, but potted down.

1622
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,160
Like a potted plant.

1623
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,180
Ah, if only someone would pot my plant.

1624
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,140
Someone would plant it deep in the earth when it needs to be.

1625
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:46,000
The sun can shine and the moon can whisper soft things in my head.

1626
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,300
One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one evening,

1627
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:55,320
I think it was at the end of April, sometime like this.

1628
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,300
No, no, I'm sorry.

1629
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,160
I didn't know that the sun could shine

1630
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,780
when your roots were way down there.

1631
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,620
Well, when they plant you, Dave, rest assured,

1632
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,660
I will come and water you.

1633
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,080
Wow, that's so sweet.

1634
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,780
You will even,

1635
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,460
you will even leave droppings, I suppose.

1636
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,980
Yeah, yeah, because, you know,

1637
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:20,460
froth grows on the graves of dead holy men and yeti's.

1638
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,180
And yeti droppings.

1639
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:27,720
And between your holiness planted in the ground

1640
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,880
and my droppings,

1641
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,280
maybe we can grow some decent frappe on that thing,

1642
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,440
on your Skellington, the Dave skull.

1643
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,760
But what will it avail, Stan?

1644
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:39,960
It won't avail the universe, or the world, anything.

1645
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:41,780
It will not avail it.

1646
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,520
Right.

1647
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,900
It will all come to no avail?

1648
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,960
Yeah, but at least it'll save me an extra trip to the bathroom.

1649
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:49,820
Let's put it that way.

1650
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,420
Friends, you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry,

1651
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:57,340
Hour of Slack, from the Church of the Subgenius.

1652
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,340
You can write for more information,

1653
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,880
those of you in prison, from Subgenius.

1654
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:10,520
That's post office box 181417, Cleveland Heights,

1655
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:15,560
Ohio 44118.

1656
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:17,580
Praise Bob.

1657
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,300
Hey, that Monster Hunter music went really good.

1658
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:21,820
Yeah.

1659
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:22,700
That worked.

1660
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,660
Yeah, it was perfect.

1661
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:24,900
Thank you, thank you.

1662
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,780
Yes, it was an excellent cue.

1663
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:31,540
That's some orchestra in Japan doing the Monster Hunter

1664
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,380
video game theme.

1665
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:32,620
Yes, yes, I know.

1666
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,060
I think that was the fifth anniversary album.

1667
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,500
There should be a new anniversary album.

1668
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,180
Coming up, it's a big deal in Japan.

1669
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,300
I'm a Monster Hunter.

1670
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:48,820
We'll play that song.

1671
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,320
OK, OK, we have a song we have to play.

1672
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,180
OK, Dave, I'm going to start fading you out.

1673
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,400
I'm going to fade down that music.

1674
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:59,500
I've been feeling faded for most of the evening.

1675
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:03,580
I think it was those giant things you gave me, the water.

1676
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,140
And coming up, burn bridges.

1677
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,760
Oh, don't feel faded, Dave.

1678
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:22,720
You've got to live your life in excess to the arrival of the excess with the rule over

1679
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,520
your life.

1680
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:37,500
You don't need a God's approval, just the starkness of removal and they are bobbed up.

1681
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,480
You've got to live your life in excess to the arrival of the excess with the rule over

1682
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:40,480


1683
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:40,480


1684
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,180
your life.

1685
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,300
The teeth standing, suck of the ecchi.

1686
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:52,080
Wash the pinks, turn into confetti on the morning of X day.

1687
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:02,340
You can make the water wetter, but there's a deity that's better.

1688
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:06,340
It's J.R. Bob Jobs.

1689
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:20,580
The true job was some genius.

1690
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:27,140
Oh, yes, flak and kernel foundation.

1691
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:31,300
And lots of sex.

1692
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,240
Until it hurts.

1693
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:37,260
I just killed you.

1694
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,360
It's a faith founded in common.

1695
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:46,260
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

1696
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:49,580
And flak for the ordain.

1697
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:59,340
And the lads say the butterfly coppers had a baby struck Emily.

1698
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:05,420
And the blanched hour under itself leaves the smusk in the hands of a true believer.

1699
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:11,120
And it shall cause empathy upon the fat of thy own lambs.

1700
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:15,680
And it shall wait upon the neck and stump to thy very end days.

1701
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:22,720
And the demons shall yet accompany thee upon the holy quest for the blood of Moab and the lamb.

1702
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:28,040
On of the eighty billion tribes of Moab.

1703
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:36,320
And sickness and blight and malady and beast shall be upon thy own lambs.

1704
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:36,320


1705
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,180
And enemies in the tempest.

1706
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,580
And it shall be good.

1707
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,780
And it shall come to pass in the end times.

1708
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:51,820
And it shall reek upon the trembling masses at which they shall soon forget.

1709
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,740
Yea, early I say unto thee.

1710
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,400
Yea, yea, by the smiling pink false prophets.

1711
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:04,540
And launch and yet launch again.

1712
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,300
Yea, yea, by the smiling pink false prophets.

1713
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:06,520
And E!

1714
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:07,540
ANURA!

1715
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:07,780
AMRE!

1716
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,180
