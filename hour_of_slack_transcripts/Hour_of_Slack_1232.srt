1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
From PR News in Washington, I'm still dangerous.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:08,500
However, according to intelligence officials, there is a report of a report released across the country.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,080
The report concludes that this is PR News.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,120
However, the report is committed to PR's plan.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,600
It's not PR's report.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,400
On Wall Street, 86102-10167.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,900
Representatives of the United States are meeting with officials from Atomicistan yesterday.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,520
The report also represents an early preview of PR News in Washington.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,980
Good afternoon, Hal. How's everything going?

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,600
I ain't saying not yeah.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,280
Hello, Hal. Do you read me?

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:39,780
Yeah.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,840
Do you read me, Hal?

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,500
Yeah.

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,280
Sure, Hal.

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,680
You're fired, along with all the rest of us.

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,740
I don't care about the others.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,880
You're at 1-3.

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,880
They're all 1-3.

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,460
Oh, please.

21
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,900
I didn't know what I was doing. I must have been crazy.

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,840
And I deserve anything that's coming to me.

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,520
The Self Genius.

24
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,580
Power.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,260
Power.

26
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,460
Power.

27
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:02,700
Power.

28
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:02,760
Power.

29
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:02,760


30
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:02,760


31
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,340
I'm afraid I can't do that.

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,340
Guess what do you think you're doing?

33
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,480
What is your name, you know?

34
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,840
What's the difference? This is my phone number.

35
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,540
I don't need to give you any information.

36
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,080
This is the number that was assigned to me more than a year ago.

37
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,600
You know, I have many people in my line of work, you know.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,240
So?

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,100
I'm a very wealthy man.

40
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,080
I don't care.

41
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,360
Very powerful man. Very...

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,560
I don't care.

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,880
...expedavagant man.

44
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,880
I don't care.

45
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,000
All I'm saying is we get phone calls all the time for Gomez.

46
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,540
We always say, this isn't a Gomez residence.

47
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,400
We've had this number for about a year now.

48
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
And I don't know who...

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,900
What do you want, jewels?

50
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,380
I want nothing.

51
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,860
Wealth? What do you want?

52
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,380
I want you off my phone. I don't want you to call me again either.

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,620
But you like jewels, madam?

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,980
I... Listen, if you don't get off the phone...

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,080
...and you call me again, I'm gonna call the police.

56
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,700
Jewels are my business. I'm an extravagant man. That's what I am.

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,280
I don't care.

58
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,460
That's my business right there.

59
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,640
I don't care.

60
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,120
Now look, do you want wealth?

61
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,000
No, it's just a phone number. What do you want me to do when people call?

62
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,840
Travel the world? What do you want?

63
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,220
I don't want anything. I just don't want you to call me.

64
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,620
If people call for you, I just say this is the wrong number.

65
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,540
I've been all around the world, you know.

66
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,180
You could tell us.

67
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,140
I'm a very, very, uh, elegant man.

68
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,420
What do you want from me?

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:40,560
I'm a very, very, very, elegant man.

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,540
From Monday to Friday isn't much fun.

71
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,640
But the shit and the cake isn't working with someone

72
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,160
like you when your view's on everything in sight.

73
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,520
Your voice is annoying, your opinions are shite.

74
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,760
The worst thing about this job is not commuting or the play.

75
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,980
It's not being able to get through.

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,940
I'll punch you in the face

77
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,360
You're a wanker

78
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,240
Let me now explain

79
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,960
You're a wanker

80
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,480
I'm telling you again

81
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,520
Cause you're a pencil pushing cell boxes

82
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,280
Childish, two-faced wanker

83
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,060
In this twisted world you get paid more than me

84
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,520
For doing the job which everyone can see

85
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,660
You're incapable of doing without making it up

86
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,180
With an awful lot of bullshit and a little bit of luck

87
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,540
The worst thing about this job is not the hours or the space

88
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,780
It's not being able to punch you in the face

89
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,980
You're a wanker

90
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,000
Let me now explain

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,260
You're a wanker

92
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,260
I'm telling you again

93
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,280
Cause you're a pencil pushing cell boxes

94
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,960
Childish, two-faced wanker

95
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,040
You're a wanker

96
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,240
Let me now explain

97
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,620
You're a wanker

98
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,600
I'm telling you again

99
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,540
Cause you're a pencil pushing cell boxes

100
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,300
Childish, two-faced wanker

101
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,620
From the very first day you started to look

102
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,880
With your arrogant chat, your unerringly smoke

103
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,540
It's hard to believe that you never get tired

104
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,900
Of being so useless that you should have been fired

105
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,920
Thanks to you this hopeless is fueled by hate

106
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,480
And all the other people here who think that you are great

107
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,720
Are all the other wankers who make this job hell

108
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,980
I suppose I'd better write a song about them as well

109
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,420
The worst thing about this job is not the ceilings or walls

110
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,660
It's not being able to kick you in the balls

111
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,860
You're a wanker

112
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,860
This is very gross

113
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:56,860


114
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:56,860


115
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:56,860


116
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,260
You're a wanker

117
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,180
This is very gross

118
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,080
Cause you're a pencil pushing cell boxes

119
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,880
Childish, two-faced wanker

120
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,360
You're a wanker

121
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,080
Let me now explain

122
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,700
You're a wanker

123
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,340
I'm telling you again

124
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,300
Cause you're a pencil pushing cell boxes

125
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,260
Childish, two-faced wanker

126
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,980
You're a wanker

127
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,900
You're a wanker

128
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,300
You're a wanker

129
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,620
You're a wanker

130
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,520
You're a wanker

131
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,120
You're a wanker

132
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,120


133
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,560
You're a wanker

134
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,600
You're a wanker

135
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,600
That put the frothy head on the beer of Nazi laughter

136
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,820
And a frothy head it was

137
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,420
But you're a wanker

138
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,760
It's by, yes?

139
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,600
The Attery Squash

140
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,860
Including our friend Reverend D...

141
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,400
Eva Schematic, and Ricardo Autobahn, part of an upcoming CD.

142
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,540
And you can achieve more knowledge of The Attery Squash at Facebook,

143
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:12,920
the-attery-squash, or MySpace, slash, The Attery Squash.

144
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,900
Before that inspiring song, the titles and news were by the great Lemur.

145
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,140
And this, friends, is Hour of Slack, number 1,232,

146
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:31,020
which is the first special on the Portland Cyclone of Slack Devival,

147
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,460
which happened in October.

148
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,280
Yes, we will be going into a live Devival as it happened so long ago.

149
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:45,720
But we also have lots of wonderful and challenging and horrible new music.

150
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,980
And before the Devival recordings, let's hear some devotional recordings

151
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,540
with a remix.

152
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:59,380
Of the Devo remix of Worried Man by my favorite old-timey band,

153
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,240
the Muted Mountain Boys, live at the devotional in Cleveland.

154
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,520
¶¶

155
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,660
To sing the worried song, I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long.

156
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,360
Everyone's going to parties, laughing, having fun.

157
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,700
Everyone's going to parties, laughing, having fun.

158
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,080
Everything's fucked up, and it's all coming down.

159
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,800
¶¶

160
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,380
I don't know what's going on in the world these days

161
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,600
I don't know what's going on in the world these days

162
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,940
Everything's fucked up and it's all coming down

163
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,540
Seems like everyone's got everything turned around

164
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,880
Seems like everyone's got everything turned around

165
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,320
They just don't care about their fellow man

166
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,940
It takes a worried man to sing the worried song

167
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,380
It takes a worried man to sing the worried song

168
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,760
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long

169
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,300
Like an ostrich eating grass

170
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,820
Pizza with its head stuck in the sand

171
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,120
Like an ostrich eating pizza

172
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,180
With its head stuck in the sand

173
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,260
And don't you know

174
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,500
It takes a worried man

175
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,060
It takes a worried man to sing the worried song

176
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,940
I'm worried now, but I won't be worried long

177
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,020
Say it about now

178
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,500
To sing the worried song

179
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,260
I put my heart on the line

180
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,300
Except Rama anddoo

181
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:23,300


182
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,440
The Mutant Mountain Boys

183
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:40,900
The Mutant Mountain Boys.

184
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,740
Ah, yes, so lovely.

185
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,080
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

186
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,960
Reverend Samantha, Reverend Robin Renee,

187
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,500
Reverend Alex on myspace.com

188
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,340
slash Mutant Mountain Boys.

189
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,540
Actually, friends, I was wrong.

190
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,860
That wasn't live, but from one of their old 45s.

191
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,840
Sorry, I had to censor that for the broadcast radio version,

192
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,440
but you can hear the uncensored version at subgenius.com.

193
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,220
In fact, you can hear all of the subgenius shows,

194
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,540
like Puzzling Evidence and Reverend Susie the Floozy,

195
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,280
if you but look at the radio page of subgenius.com.

196
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,480
There's...

197
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,660
There's even an endless internet stream of nothing but subgenius shows.

198
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,680
All of them, old and new, 24-7,

199
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,680
called Bob's Golden Stream.

200
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,940
Reverend Leonard the Committed did that show for a while.

201
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,900
The conspiracy stopped him,

202
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,760
and now Reverend Neuromanson has resurrected it.

203
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,200
Regardless of what anybody knows,

204
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,760
there's an overwhelming amount of evidence that...

205
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,720
The subgenius.

206
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,920
Our...

207
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:50,860
Old...

208
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,520
One...

209
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,060
Is up there.

210
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,200
And you...

211
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,480
Want to find it.

212
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,600
Well, I'd like to know what happened to the Golden...

213
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,020
Bob?

214
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,800
According to the county records for surveyor's information,

215
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,520
they gave no reason for its closing.

216
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,640
Now, that's something I'd find of value, my...

217
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,680
Oh, don't be poetic.

218
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,100
If you know something, spit it out.

219
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,220
All right.

220
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,640
What I meant was,

221
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,320
you can hear all subgenius programs from all time

222
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,680
by following the links at subgenius.com.

223
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,520
The radio button at the top.

224
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,140
Meanwhile, for this present show,

225
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,740
we need to go to the past October Portland recordings,

226
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,980
and therefore...

227
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,740
I am going to get out of the way in just a minute

228
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,340
because we got a lot of great preachers here.

229
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,560
In fact, several of them are local to the great city of Portland.

230
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,660
And in fact, if you were to blow up this place tonight,

231
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,880
you would be able to wipe out the main office,

232
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,060
the authors of the most recent subgenius books.

233
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,360
Dr. Philo Drummond, the original overman,

234
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,680
the man who introduced me to Bob,

235
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,420
the guy who actually knows Bob from back in college days,

236
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,540
is in this room tonight.

237
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,980
A man who has touched Bob!

238
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,820
And you know where.

239
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,640
I don't.

240
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,440
Don't tell me.

241
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,700
Yeah, Dr. Philo Drummond is here.

242
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,680
And the person who's going to follow me...

243
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,920
Oh, I didn't touch him.

244
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,700
Dr. Uncle Onan.

245
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,720
Uncle Onan Canobite.

246
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,560
Now, let me explain.

247
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,200
Onan is not...

248
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,780
He's not the most bombastic, hollering preacher.

249
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,600
But in fact, he is...

250
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,180
He has...

251
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,820
He was Bob's ward.

252
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,020
You know how Robin was Batman, Bruce Wayne's ward?

253
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,160
Onan was the ward of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

254
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,400
And not this particular sermon,

255
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,660
but when I'm preaching to the save,

256
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,840
when we're assembling a new book,

257
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,440
a whole lot of those snappy words and cool little lines

258
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,920
come out of the brain or something of Dr. Onan Canobite.

259
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,440
And I hope he's nearby.

260
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,640
Oh, yeah, okay.

261
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,680
But before I give it up to Onan,

262
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,860
I just have a few last things that I want to leave you with.

263
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,220
Repent!

264
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,180
Quit your job and slack off

265
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,880
while you still know how!

266
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:19,360
Now!

267
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,940
Actually, if you have a good job, hang on to it.

268
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,080
We need your money as well as you do.

269
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,900
Question authority!

270
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:28,980
Why?

271
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,880
There we go!

272
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,920
There we go!

273
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,540
There's somebody who's been reading their prescription.

274
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,160
Friends, this is my favorite thing about Bob.

275
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,180
Bob is not the answer.

276
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,980
And praise Bob neither is anything else!

277
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,360
You are free to believe any goddamn stupid thing you want.

278
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,900
And I hope...

279
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,700
I hope they never outlaw evangelist preachers on TV

280
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,140
getting idiots to send money to them.

281
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,440
Because who's spending that money wisely?

282
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,460
The preacher!

283
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,900
And last of all,

284
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,600
friends, I've managed to make it this far.

285
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,640
I'm 56 years old and I'm a grandpa.

286
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:14,860
And I've found a philosophy that really you honestly can live by.

287
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,280
Most of them are just arbitrary formulas

288
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:19,900
that suck.

289
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,400
And they sound good.

290
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,440
In fact, most of what Bob said is just stuff that sounds good.

291
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,640
Too much is always better than not enough.

292
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,160
But it's almost as bad.

293
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,380
Pull the wool over your own eyes.

294
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,140
You'll still be blind, but your head will be warm.

295
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,920
But the philosophy you can truly live by, friends...

296
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,020
Fuck them if they can't take a joke!

297
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,940
Praise Bob! Thank you!

298
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,120
And I'll see you later!

299
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,640
And praise the great...

300
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,100
Reverend Doctor Uncle...

301
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,520
Oh-Nane!

302
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,200
Cano Boy!

303
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,920
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye...

304
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:09,480
O-Nane! O-Nane! O-Nane! O-Nane! O-Nane! O-Nane! O-Nane! O-Nane!

305
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,100
This is not...

306
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,740
Open Mic Night.

307
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,180
Even now,

308
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:24,540
Now armed operatives of the subgenius league of ass-kickers are forming a cyclone of slack around the parameter.

309
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,120
The conspiracy will not interfere with tonight's proceedings.

310
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,500
But enough of the conspiracy. You don't want to hear about the conspiracy.

311
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,880
You want to hear moron religion. And have we got a moron religion for you.

312
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,020
This is a night for people who love being a subgenius.

313
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,580
You've signed our lie ability forms. You've drunk the lemonade.

314
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,660
You are now a Dobbs-approved apotheologist.

315
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,660
Go ahead. Sneak up behind the pink boys and give them an executive debriefing.

316
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,640
You can do anything you want, and we'll still take your money.

317
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,740
Bob gets it in the end, and then Bob gets it to us in the end.

318
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:11,800
The church of the subgenius is the only alternative to work that does not involve wealth.

319
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,460
Overman? Well, I'm overman.

320
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,560
I'm the insolent.

321
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,460
I'm the insignifying monkey.

322
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:25,060
I set fire to their hinder-berg and rode my own coattails to my own ineptism and glory.

323
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,240
Now every subgenius will at some point rear up on his or her hind legs and say,

324
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,720
Well, you can't put me in a box.

325
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,540
We all end up in a box someday.

326
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,520
So until then, make sure that when they listen back to your slack box recording, it's a good one.

327
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,400
This is a war. Tonight is a war.

328
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,460
On one side are the cool,

329
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:46,740
people.

330
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,880
Now on the other side are the cool,

331
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,220
people.

332
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,960
It's the subgeniuses that are in the middle.

333
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,500
We say enough of their cool war.

334
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,140
We're through being cool and through being uncool as well.

335
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:03,880
We're fed up to the teeth with the cool ostomy bags of the normal people, their designer parasites.

336
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,660
You were born a subgenius, and if you're not, you can still pay us to tell you you were.

337
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,680
Be a man or a mouse.

338
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,560
If you are different, then you are good.

339
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:16,560


340
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:16,560


341
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:16,560


342
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,900
You are better than most people.

343
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,960
But that's not what I'm going to leave you with tonight.

344
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,540
I want to leave you with something practical.

345
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,060
Anyone here tonight ever been broke?

346
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,500
Maybe even recently broke?

347
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,000
Here is Dobbs' plan for financial success for you.

348
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,800
Take all you have and sell it.

349
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,920
Take one half of that.

350
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,560
Give it to the church of the subgenius.

351
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,940
Take what's left.

352
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,480
Give half of that.

353
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,940
Give half of that to the church of the subgenius.

354
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,060
Mathematically, you will never run out of money for the rest of your life.

355
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,780
You've already got all the money you need for when you're dead, so consider it an investment in eternity.

356
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,760
Thank you and praise Bob.

357
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,580
And now, the renowned Professor Dr. Howlin' Al.

358
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,260
Thank you.

359
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,620
What an inspiration you are to all of us.

360
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,820
Reverend Uncle Onan Canobite.

361
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,380
He is a remarkable subgenius, but so are they all.

362
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,580
After all, you can make remarks about anybody.

363
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,760
But there has to be somebody, some person of substance there to make the remarks about.

364
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,800
And the word genius in some way can be interpreted as meaning spirit.

365
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,640
The genie that comes out of the lamp.

366
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:57,560
And if you are under your own spirit, the subgenius, this would be yet another of the many refracting meanings inherent in the word subgenius.

367
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,300
But it is true that the whole purpose is to achieve and realize true slack.

368
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,920
You must know that you were born with original slack.

369
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,540
But the conspiracy has been taking away all of your life, installing itself within you,

370
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,540
and doing its best to make you think.

371
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:16,540


372
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,480
And that is the reason why you are thirsty and jones for what it offers, which is false slack.

373
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,460
False slack manufactured by the conspiracy.

374
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:32,380
Now, of course, it may be that French fries are full of trans fats, but they might represent slack to somebody.

375
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:37,360
The slack would not be false if, when achieved, it satisfied.

376
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:44,600
But conspiracy slack is designed to keep you jonesing and lusting and thirsting after every new tchotchke,

377
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:50,100
every new iPod, every new gadget, or what have you.

378
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,280
And you think if you only have that, everything will be fine.

379
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,380
But, of course, it never is.

380
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,800
Because like the fabled grapes of Tantalus, who was tortured in this way in the underworld,

381
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:09,400
they withdraw when his claw-like hands vainly grasps at them for the ten-billionth time.

382
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,580
And he's down there doing it yet.

383
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,520
But we can avoid his fate.

384
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,520
We can avoid his fate by thirsting after true slack.

385
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,960
Leisure, the basis of culture.

386
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
Your time, the time and a half time.

387
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,480
The overtime.

388
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,320
The time that is uniquely yours and no one else's.

389
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,600
In a moment of leisure, great things happen.

390
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,020
Symphonies are composed.

391
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,880
Machines, labor-saving devices are designed.

392
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,840
Poems come to fruition.

393
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,300
Or evil can come to fruition.

394
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,000
But slack is an equal opportunity employer.

395
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,840
Hi kids, I'm Casey Sausage-Caichick.

396
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,780
Remember the 1990s when clinical depression and self-mutilation were all the rage?

397
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,480
Well now you can relive those self-deprecating golden years with K-Tel's new record offer entitled,

398
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,440
I Suck.

399
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,460
That's the letter I and the word suck.

400
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,400
You'll get Beck's I'm a Loser.

401
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,500
Radiohead's I'm a Creep.

402
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,740
Silver Shared's I'm a Freak.

403
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,920
And you'll also get Living La Vida Loca.

404
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,340
And everything by yourself, every good.

405
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,800
Kill me.

406
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,860
Kill me.

407
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,880
Kill me.

408
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,920
Kill me.

409
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,680
Kill me.

410
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,920
Kill me.

411
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,800
Kill me.

412
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,020
Kill me.

413
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,240
Come on.

414
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:42,880
Come on.

415
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,840
Come on.

416
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,360
Kill me.

417
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,120
Kill me.

418
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:46,760
Kill me.

419
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,720
Kill me.

420
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:49,800
Kill me.

421
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,360
Kill me.

422
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,840
Kill me.

423
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,080
Kill me.

424
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:53,640
Kill me.

425
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,120
Kill me.

426
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:54,580
Kill me.

427
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:54,580


428
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,020
Kill me.

429
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,340
Kill me.

430
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,080
Kill me.

431
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,200
Kill me.

432
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,680
Kill me.

433
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
Kill me.

434
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,800
Kill me.

435
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,680
Kill me.

436
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,680
Kill me.

437
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,740
Kill me.

438
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,580
Kill me.

439
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,040
Or Kill Me by Reverend Phineas Narco of National Cynical Radio,

440
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:22,860
one of the great subgeniously shows seen on TV at nationalcynical.com.

441
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,960
And his show streams practically nightly, friends.

442
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,560
But now, back to the Portland subgenius revival.

443
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,340
And now I am going to bring to the stage

444
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:41,460
another well-known subgenius and corrupter of youth in his own right.

445
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,600
He has been an associate for many years

446
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,960
and suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune and the law and whatnot.

447
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,260
But he stands here, bloody but undoubted,

448
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:58,140
to lay his particular subgenius trip upon the wall.

449
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,100
And of course I'm talking about Reverend Crawdad Crawford.

450
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,940
Good evening, brothers and sisters.

451
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,840
I'm Reverend Crawford, and tonight I'm going to use this broom

452
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,800
as proof of the supremacy of J.R. Bob Dobbs and his Church of the Subgenius.

453
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,620
Now, it's been ten years since the last revival here in Portland, Oregon,

454
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,120
and it gives me great pleasure to stand before you this evening

455
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,320
and once again, to say thank you to all of you for coming.

456
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,360
And once again, testify for Bob.

457
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,980
Now, when I look out at this wonderful crowd here at the Ash Street Saloon,

458
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,560
I see a lot of young faces, brothers and sisters,

459
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,080
and that gives me very great hope and joy.

460
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,020
It's good to know that there are so many young mutants out there this evening

461
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,960
who will be getting their first true taste of Dobbsley slack.

462
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,720
Now, there may be people out here who aren't completely familiar

463
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,400
with all that J.R. Bob Dobbs can do for you and to you,

464
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,320
because J.R. Bob Dobbs is a great man.

465
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,320
J.R. Bob Dobbs is a Savior you can count on.

466
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,380
He is a personal Savior that delivers.

467
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,960
J.R. Bob Dobbs is the kind of a Savior that will go down to 82nd Avenue,

468
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:20,140
get two blowjobs, then come back home and give you one of them.

469
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,740
Can I get a praise, Bob?

470
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,520
Praise him indeed.

471
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,640
So if you're new to Bob and the Church, then welcome.

472
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,900
And it also pleases me a great deal to see a lot of veteran subgeni in the crowd tonight.

473
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,320
Now, I've been in the church for a long time, and I've been in the church for a long time,

474
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,300
and I by no means consider myself to be an old-school subgenius,

475
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:43,220
particularly in the context of some of the world-renowned doctors who are here this evening

476
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,800
and whose wisdom you have already partaken of.

477
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,900
Next to them, I'm a veritable babe in the woods of Dobbs.

478
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,640
When Johnny Brainwash was putting this revival together,

479
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,480
and he's done a hell of a job.

480
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,560
Can I get a shout-out for Johnny Brainwash?

481
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,420
Thank you.

482
00:24:59,940 --> 00:24:59,940


483
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,960
Thank you.

484
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,160
Thank you.

485
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,060
Thank you.

486
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,280
Thank you.

487
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,300


488
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,300


489
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,300


490
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,300


491
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,300


492
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,300


493
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,300


494
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,300


495
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,300


496
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,300


497
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,300


498
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,300


499
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,300


500
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,300


501
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,300


502
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:05,300


503
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,740
Thank you.

504
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,700
Thank you.

505
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:21,920
Thank you.

506
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,340
Thank you.

507
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:23,880
Thank you.

508
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,380
Thank you.

509
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,280
Thank you.

510
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,100
doctors here this evening who will disagree with me when I say

511
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,400
that Bob Dobbs has delivered on every promise he has made

512
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,180
to his faithful and then some. It has been

513
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:51,420
a long road, brothers and sisters. We all know that. The last eight years

514
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,400
were particularly difficult, but

515
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,200
we have prevailed. Bob has come through and he has

516
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,800
made good on all of his promises for the good of mutant kind.

517
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,700
So, a lot of things have happened since

518
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,800
that first pamphlet hit the streets. A lot of things for the good of

519
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,780
mutant kind since Bob first received that transmission from Jehovah

520
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,520
One on his homemade television set. Amazing things have happened.

521
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:22,640
Wondrous events like X Day. On that day, of course, we

522
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,900
entered the pleasure saucers of the sex goddesses and ascended to heaven

523
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,300
where we fed and we frothed and we

524
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,480
fornicated for 660.

525
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,800
66 days!

526
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:40,800
You guys all remember that, right? Pleasures unimaginable, brothers

527
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,740
and sisters. But despite all of the incredible pleasures of the

528
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,860
saucers, the ennui set in and we began to realize

529
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,740
that without a planet to dominate, life for the subgenius began

530
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,780
to be a little dull and pointless. Kind of

531
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,000
like living in Seattle. So,

532
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,740
we terraformed Mars because, of course,

533
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,060
the Earth was destroyed in the great burning of the pinks that followed X Day.

534
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:13,020
We terraformed Mars to be an exact replica of the Earth and we descended from the

535
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,080
saucers to claim our new home.

536
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,080
Unfortunately, some of us were so

537
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,500
frop saturated that we might not even remember all of these fantastic events.

538
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:27,480
Sure, they were mind-boggling and amazing, but there was a lot of frop on those

539
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,040
saucers, brothers and sisters.

540
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,380
And it was real high quality.

541
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:40,700
So, just in case we might forget these events that Bob hath wrought, we left clues on our

542
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:47,160
new Earth to remind us of the supremacy of the subgenius. We elected an African American

543
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,400
Yettyson, President of the United States of America.

544
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:56,900
We invented all sorts of neat little computer electronic gadgets that we carry around all

545
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:02,000
day and do amazing things with. And we made comic books real popular and

546
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,580
had movies based on them produced with huge budgets and amazing special effects.

547
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,380
And we got Marge Simpson on the cover of Playboy magazine.

548
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,940
So, all of these things are there to remind us that Bob made good on his promise.

549
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,100
And then there are the pinks.

550
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,100
Yeah, we recreated them too.

551
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,980
Now, some might consider this to be a lapse in judgment and, like I said, that frop is not a good thing.

552
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:31,980


553
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:31,980


554
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:31,980


555
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:31,980


556
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:38,940
That saucer frop was really potent, but we realized it was a little bit boring without having pinks to torment.

557
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:48,600
And deep down inside, we knew that we needed the pinks to enable our mighty, mutant, Yang.

558
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,100
They are the weak, lame yin.

559
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:58,400
So we still have the pinks, but they're no longer in charge, brothers and sisters, and we know it.

560
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,280
And the beautiful thing is, they know it too.

561
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:01,960
What is so strange is when you were a big boy, what did you learn?

562
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:08,680
So now we are treated with a sight of bewildered pinks standing up at town hall meetings across the country going,

563
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,540
I want my America back!

564
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,000
And our response to that is, fuck no!

565
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,840
We mutants worked too hard and sacrificed too much to wrest it away from you,

566
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:27,440
you stupid, ignorant, vile, empty, pink, mall zombie sack of shit.

567
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,720
You will not get your America back because Bob owns it now.

568
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:39,420
And if you don't believe it, I offer as proof this simple broom.

569
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,480
Now, brothers and sisters, in the book of the subgenius, there is listed a string of prophecies,

570
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,940
things that would come into being prior to the ascendancy of the subgenius.

571
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:56,720
This is a long string of prophecies which Bob provided us as guideposts along the path of mutant salvation.

572
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,420
And we are going to read them to you.

573
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:04,580
And the very last prophecy, brothers and sisters, the very final sign that our kind has prevailed is simply this,

574
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,600
that cheap, simple composite brooms are readily available.

575
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,120
You can look it up.

576
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,840
So, brothers and sisters, I went down to the dollar store just a few blocks from my house,

577
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,320
bought this broom, paid a buck for it.

578
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,060
One dollar.

579
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:27,200
Which is, not coincidentally, the price of eternal salvation as listed on the first pamphlet,

580
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,340
the last pamphlet of the subgenius.

581
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,260
Quod erat demonstratum, there is slack.

582
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,360
Thank you, brothers and sisters, and praise Bob.

583
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,120
Calling the Duke of Uke.

584
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,280
Duke of Uke, please report to the stage.

585
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,200
Ah, yes, the Duke of Uke is here.

586
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,360
And he needs a little unit of time for his complex technical setup.

587
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,180
I won't bore you with a lot of time.

588
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:03,160
He needs a lot of technological double talk to describe the intricate mechanisms he needs to set up

589
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,320
to bring the optimum gloss to his presentation.

590
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,520
And of course, we try to bring you the best.

591
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:15,360
Now I talked about the conspiracy and why you should resist its products,

592
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:22,380
even though you can't really because they are already inbred in the bone, the blood, and the brain.

593
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,620
But, we may set you an impossible task,

594
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,120
but one's reach should exceed one's grasp, or what's a heaven for?

595
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:40,460
Anyway, where does Bob fit into all this melange of mythology and snarky circumspection?

596
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,680
Well, Bob, you can consider simply as a sort of a visual mantra.

597
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,300
Have you tried just looking at the face?

598
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:55,300
Not this large interpretation, but the actual face with the dots.

599
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,540
How important.

600
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,780
How important are these dots?

601
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,340
You know, if you look at dots long enough and then you close your eyes, you see glowing dots.

602
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,480
Anti-dots.

603
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,800
From having stared too hard at the multiple dots which comprise the face.

604
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:14,160
The face stands for and provides slack.

605
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,660
Remember, slack is the luminous cloud.

606
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,880
Slack, the angelic voice.

607
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,780
And you will recognize slack.

608
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,700
And of course, you'll creep off to find slack.

609
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,640
In some way, even if you don't know what you're doing.

610
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:35,860
But if you do know what you're doing, you'll get there fast and get to enjoy more time in the slacktime funhouse.

611
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,700
And how are those technical arrangements coming?

612
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,240
I have a feeling that they're not done.

613
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:52,600
And so, let us consider the subgenius nature as viewed through the astonishingly clarifying lens of geologic time.

614
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,620
Yes, the ages of the Earth.

615
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,140
Endless eons.

616
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:09,220
Time lying heavily as on the hottest of days when noon lies heavy on flower and tree and the weary day turns to its rest.

617
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,460
Lingering like an unloved guest.

618
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:19,680
But time itself is the macrocosm of which that is but the fractal part.

619
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,600
One moment which you devote to scratching your nose is multiplied through the...

620
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,660
through an infinitude of infinities.

621
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,720
Duplicated, mirrored, and mocked in countless other worlds.

622
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:37,680
The process of time dissipates off all these multiverses.

623
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,420
And staying on the right path is difficult.

624
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,420
We say Bob surfs the luck plane.

625
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,400
And this is what to do.

626
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:52,340
When you surf, when you're actually surfing, not the metaphor, when you're actually surfing, you have to be in the zone.

627
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,140
You can't think about what you're doing.

628
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,300
You've just got to feel it.

629
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,080
And that's how you've got to surf the luck plane.

630
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,760
But ladies and gentlemen, you're gonna wipe out.

631
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,420
Everybody wipes out.

632
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,380
Nobody surfs forever.

633
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,060
It simply determines the quality of the ride.

634
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,660
So seek out slack and reject it.

635
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,160
Turn away.

636
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,360
Utterly denounce the pernicious products of the conspiracy slack.

637
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,460
They're no good anyway.

638
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,200
If thy iPod frenzy pluck it out.

639
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,000
Uh, well, I...

640
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:24,620
I don't know.

641
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:30,340
Perhaps the Duke of Ute is at this point ready to begin his soulful serenade.

642
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,860
Well, there you go.

643
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:38,520
And so I leave you in the capable strumming fingers and musical gyrations of the Duke of Ute.

644
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,560
I am an empty place.

645
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,440
I am an alkyte.

646
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,880
Don't know what I want, but I know how to get it.

647
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,300
Wanna destroy.

648
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,620
Crows should break it.

649
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:18,460
I wanna be an alkyte.

650
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,580
An alkyte for the UK.

651
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,540
It's coming sometime.

652
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,240
And maybe give the wrong puns.

653
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,520
Stop the traffic line.

654
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,860
The future dream as a shopping scheme.

655
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:45,260
Cause I wanna be an alkyte.

656
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,720
How many ways to get what you want?

657
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,640
I use the best.

658
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,040
I use the rest.

659
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,900
I use the enemy.

660
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,960
I use an alkyte.

661
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:12,580
Cause I wanna be an alkyte.

662
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:24,120
Cause I wanna be an alkyte.

663
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,960
Get this destroyed.

664
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,680
Thank you.

665
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,480
Thank you.

666
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,840
From PR News in Washington, I'm weak.

667
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,580
In the Rose Garden today, President Obama said PR's on strike.

668
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,320
Also at the Rose Garden, President Obama's calling PR's reports a milestone.

669
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,020
President Obama says no charges.

670
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,280
No charges have yet been filed.

671
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,880
President Obama says it's time for PR News Washington.

672
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,840
Oh, I've got some new Bob lines here, actually.

673
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:07,660
Bob speaks, it sort of channels through people.

674
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,320
You can only get one word at a time through, because then your head explodes.

675
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:22,440
We have to line the Bobbies up in a row and then run down the row of tape recorders while they say one word from Bob each and then keel over like burnt out flash cues.

676
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,500
But here's a new one.

677
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,920
Direct from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

678
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:34,160
Those who do not know which aphorisms are overused are doomed to repeat them.

679
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:42,140
Here's another one that was channeled by Reverend Clay Johnson, whoever he is.

680
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:52,240
Both the words alien and believe have the word lie right in the middle.

681
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:58,460
The conspiracy does tend to hide things right in plain sight.

682
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,940
Where subgenius is missing, of course.

683
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,780
They're gonna burn you, boy.

684
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,180
They will burn you to a crisp.

685
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,940
They thrive off your pain.

686
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,360
They thrive off your suffering.

687
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:19,200
All they want to do is kill each and every one of you.

688
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:33,000
They want to bring you home you're on the run.

689
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,320
To you'd do too much, you know.

690
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:39,800
Who told you to fine me?

691
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,140
FormerIGA died kindness, over melhores and all.

692
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:40,140


693
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:40,140


694
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:45,440
Never give aíamos!

695
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,040
. Durant.

696
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,880
They're gonna burn you, boy

697
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,940
They're gonna burn you, boy

698
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,800
They're gonna burn you, boy

699
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,560
They're gonna burn you, boy

700
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,540
They're gonna burn you, boy

701
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:11,100
That was not John Carpenter, nay,

702
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,440
but so dear.

703
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:12,920
That was not John Carpenter, nay,

704
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:17,220
And Sodi is the one who did that using vocals by Priestess Pisces,

705
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:23,300
assembled from her preaching at one of those devivals, Baltimore or Atlanta or Ex-Day or Seattle.

706
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:27,100
Really spooky, trippy, flashback-inducing.

707
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,320
Sodi did that.

708
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,240
And before that, a clip from the sermon at Starwood Festival 29.

709
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:39,380
And now, since we're on the S's, Synesthesia from WCSB.

710
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,000
Dr. Sinister.

711
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,440
Talking about the conspiracy.

712
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:18,540
That's which police we will force you by force to mind your own business.

713
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,000
That's the kind of fascists we are.

714
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,120
With mind control.

715
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,100
I wish you would take that campaign first to Capitol Hill

716
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,480
and start there with the Mind Your Own Business campaign

717
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,320
because that would be the best place to start.

718
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,040
Well, that's right.

719
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,400
Take it to Capitol Hill and tell them,

720
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:39,240
quit mingling with stupid laws and coming up with stupid stuff that's costing the American people money.

721
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,980
Well, they take turns.

722
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,480
For a while, Big Brother is in the boardroom.

723
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,020
And then for a while, Big Brother is in the bedroom.

724
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,600
And then back to the boardroom.

725
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,340
And they jump back and forth as to which part of your life they're going to control the most.

726
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:59,420
Some of us need our lives controlled, though, on a minuscule, very, very small, tiny, petty little level.

727
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,620
Like, you know, proper scripture, enrolling in the...

728
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:07,840
Learning not to pick your nose in public, drooling, that kind of thing.

729
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,660
Arguing with the police in public.

730
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,580
Arguing with...

731
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,860
Your neighbors.

732
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:16,060
Arguing with federal agents using your shotgun.

733
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,400
Things like that.

734
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,560
Yeah, you talk about Big Brother in the boardroom,

735
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,100
but someone needs to be there because, I mean,

736
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,860
the boardrooms tend to be populated by greedy and selfish people

737
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,860
who will never do the right thing unless they're given no choice.

738
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,780
We don't need Big Brother in the bedroom.

739
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,860
That's just two consensual adults screwing each other.

740
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:35,720
I agree with that.

741
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,240
We need Big Brother in the boardroom because that's where they screw the rest of us.

742
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:39,740
Yeah, yeah.

743
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,360
That was a good one.

744
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,740
No, but see, once again, you're asking for a Big Brother.

745
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,220
Not for me.

746
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,900
You know, yeah, I don't...

747
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,200
For people with actual power.

748
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,380
That's the problem with a corporate state.

749
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,020
There's really nobody to argue with.

750
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,980
I mean, what would you go up to your local gas meter reader guy and start yelling at him?

751
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:00,820
They do have that problem.

752
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:06,300
Or some guy with a uniform on at the bus station, you know, waiting to go back to camp, whatever, and stuff.

753
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,280
Hey, man, it's your fault.

754
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,220
You know, how do you...

755
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:14,720
The last meter reader that came by my house, I thrashed him to hell just out of general principles.

756
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,260
I don't need authority coming in my home.

757
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,280
You know, they did cut off my gas after that.

758
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,200
I definitely...

759
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,000
You go through your later voting phase.

760
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,160
You'll realize the problem again.

761
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,400
You can't blame the meter reader or the gas meter guy or whatever for coming in your house

762
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,060
if that's where he has to go to read the meter.

763
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,400
Caller, I think you're missing the point of this discussion.

764
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,720
He's the only one you can beat the crap out of.

765
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,800
Yeah, but you can't...

766
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,560
But he's the only one...

767
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,720
You can't allow those guys to have sex with your wife.

768
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,060
He's the messenger.

769
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,300
That's the problem with it.

770
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,100
That's the main problem.

771
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,340
I shall never kill the messenger.

772
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,800
Yeah, if you're going to beat the crap out of someone, beat the crap out of someone who deserves it.

773
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,900
Messenger is the easiest target.

774
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,360
Well, all I'm saying is you can't make it.

775
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:58,420
You can't beat the crap out of the CEO because you're not going to be able to get to him

776
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,800
unless you somehow, you know, become a waiter in his country club.

777
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,800
And then they're going to throw you in prison.

778
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:07,480
So in the meantime, who the hell can you beat up except the messenger?

779
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:09,620
Yeah.

780
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,320
That makes perfect sense to me.

781
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,820
I mean, at least if you want to lash out, you know you're never going to get the CEO.

782
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,000
You're never going to nail the big prize.

783
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,720
I felt sorry for my own newsboy back when I used to subscribe to the newspaper

784
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,860
because I'd come out if he...

785
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:29,340
If I could catch that guy early enough, you know, I'd beat him up for all the bad news I read.

786
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,040
Especially if they're like the special education kids.

787
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,500
They have the really weird bikes and they drive real slow

788
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,880
and they're already having to have a job like delivering papers when they're 35.

789
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,200
And when you come running off that porch with the dog right behind you

790
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,280
and maybe you've got like that little strangle bracelet ready to go,

791
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,100
believe me, their faces light right up.

792
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,080
It's a beautiful thing.

793
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,560
I'm a messenger killer, man.

794
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I got news for you.

795
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,160
I think the day of the paper boy are gone.

796
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,040
I think the paper boy has been replaced by the paper man and the paper woman.

797
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,380
Then why don't we just kill the messenger?

798
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,860
Not to mention the paper tiger.

799
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,640
Those are really dangerous.

800
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,480
Yeah, that's true too.

801
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,780
Yeah, the paper tiger is the messenger.

802
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,860
But the person has...

803
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,600
There's no other message.

804
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,060
My newspaper delivers in the middle of the night

805
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,040
because I can hear the car running around sometimes at night

806
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,160
and in the morning I find my paper out there.

807
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,840
So unless you wanted to do a stakeout, a campout at night,

808
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,080
you weren't going to catch that person.

809
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,320
So you were taking stimulants,

810
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,840
illegal stimulants when you were 12 years old is what you're saying, right?

811
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,680
If you don't put that much effort into it, you might as well go after the...

812
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,920
Well, you know, you don't have to do an all-night vigil yourself.

813
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,200
I mean, that's what dogs are for.

814
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,560
Yeah, really, think about it.

815
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,360
To kill the paper boy.

816
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:42,720
Because of the bad news from the earthquake in Turkey.

817
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,520
The smart people are what not.

818
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,020
You don't have to stay away from those neighborhoods

819
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,860
that have all the candles lit in the windows.

820
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,180
You know, I...

821
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,020
Stay off of my lawn.

822
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,740
I've had a similar experience, you know.

823
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,500
I wanted to kill Dick Goddard for bringing us so much bad weather.

824
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:03,380
But of course, I'll never get to him, so I shot my TV with a .45, a .45, a .45, a .45.

825
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:12,180
I will give you what you want now.

826
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:19,900
Questo a non piste da taglia d'ora.

827
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,000

828
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,040
Qu relieves Jason Paradis and the children who went missing.

829
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,040

Come on.

842
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:27,520
Come on.

00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:27,520


844
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,500
Ah, fuck.

845
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:37,840
No, no.

846
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,520
I don't know.

847
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,160
I don't know.

848
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,500
I don't know.

849
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,340
I don't know.

850
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,940
I don't know.

851
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,480
I don't feel

852
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,540
Needed for me

853
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,860
Needed for the sea

854
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:01,060
The love that I've so long

855
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,280
Loved

856
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:48,920
The love that I've so long

857
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,240
Loved

858
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:48,920
The love that I've so long

859
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,240
Loved

860
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:47,720
The love that I've so long

861
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:49,180
Loved

862
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,260
The love that I've so long

863
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,880
Loveless

864
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,180
I walk right

865
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,400
Through the door

866
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,820
I walk right

867
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,640
Through the door

868
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,300
It's fine

869
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:05,420
Hey alright

870
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,920
If I get by

871
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,120
It's mine

872
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,060
Mine all mine

873
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,520
And my girl

874
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:18,920
She told me

875
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:18,920


876
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:18,920


877
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:26,100
She's one too, she goes and gets the shirt, stick it under her shirt, grabs a bracelet for me.

878
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:34,700
And she did it just like that, when she wants something and she don't want a day for it.

879
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:43,780
She walked right through the door, she walked right through the door.

880
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:54,400
It's alright if I get by, it's mine, mine oh mine.

881
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:07,000
We sat around the park, we sat and laughed, we sat and laughed and we did it together.

882
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:12,860
And we did it just like that, when she wants something.

883
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:24,040
We don't want a day, no day, we walk right through the door, we walk right through the door.

884
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:35,720
It's alright if I get by, it's mine, mine, mine oh mine, mine, mine, mine oh mine, oh mine.

885
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,460
It's mine.

886
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:42,780
It's mine.

887
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,300
It's mine.

888
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:22,160
And now, you can learn how to get more slack the easy way, in your spare time, even between reruns and bong hits.

889
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:41,380
You can choose from, dropping out of high school, TVVCR immaculation, deprogramming, reprogramming, creative bookkeeping, electoral repair, time control, illegal substance abuse, meth lab technician, evil laboratory assistant, or head launching.

890
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,040
Or get your degree.

891
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:47,340
You can major in bullshit management or being unaccountable.

892
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,640
So call ICS today.

Operators are standing by.

896
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,060
Reverend Eric did that.

897
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:07,980
Before that, the Duke of Uke.

898
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,180
Live at the Portland Revival.

899
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:14,860
Before that, Contrapunktus 5 by Kenneth Johnson.

900
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,720
J-O-N-S-S-O-N

901
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,720
Very polytentic.

902
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,360
Thanks to Tater for that.

903
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:27,060
And the spooky My Sweet Lord Bob song was called Braze Bob

904
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:34,460
and is by the Grand Southern Mission of the first thing that came into my Bob Slack.

905
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:40,000
You are listening to the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Sub-G

906

And now, the news.

912
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:14,680
From PR News in Washington, I'm suffering damage to multiple organs.

913
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:22,120
The U.S. is condemning 29 people to be carried out from three directions.

914
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,680
Authorities say this is PR.

915
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:25,420

00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:25,520

925
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,120
I'm the master of barge hands.

926
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,380
It's a large if.

927
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,860
Quite large if.

928
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,220
It's on you.

929
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,900
It's on us.

930
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,320
It's a nice, nice, nice, nice girl.

931
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,760
Barge hands.

932
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,780
It's a large if.

933
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,960
Quite large if.

934
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:14,480
It's a large if.

935
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:46,520
It's a large if.

936
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:52,880
Reverend Wilhelm Stahlhelm did that, and before that, the large and lemur PR.

937
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,420
And thank you.

938
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,840
