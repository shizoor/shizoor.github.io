18
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:43,900
by a strong old bob walkenhorst which i've taken the liberty of lifting from his patreon site

19
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:52,320
where he posts a new song every month uh he too got his shot he's he's one month older than i am

20
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,680
and he was feeling good too

21
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,440
I stay one step ahead of the melancholy

22
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,560
I've been writing ten letters to Buddy Holly

23
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,200
I'm down in steerage on Fulton's Folly

24
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,960
I stay one step ahead of the melancholy

25
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,240
I lift two doors down from the old man on the corner

26
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,820
There's a window next door, somebody oughta want her

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,220
Daddy digs through your trash when the weather gets warmer

28
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,760
I lift two doors down from the old man on the corner

29
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,660
Come a summer, we'll be dancing in the street

30
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,520
Come a summer, down the corner gonna meet you

31
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,200
Come a summer, there's a party on the block

32
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,980
Somebody hit the snooze on the doomsday clock

33
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,940
I'm down in steerage on Fulton's Folly

34
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,380
I'm three floors up from a band on the skills

35
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,880
They practice all night, those goddamn kids

36
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,180
They called the demolition debris and they probably did

37
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,660
They sound like a bus going over a cliff

38
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,540
Come a summer, we'll be dancing in the street

39
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,420
Come a summer, down the corner gonna meet you

40
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,120
Come a summer, there's a party on the block

41
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,720
Somebody hit the snooze on the doomsday clock

42
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,960
Come a summer

43
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,460
I'm four days late from making my rent

44
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,160
My baby gave me the dough but now it's all spent

45
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,920
Born on my bed, had to go to bed, had to go to bed

46
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:58,920

Come a summer, we'll be dancing in the street

50
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,380
Come a summer, down the corner gonna meet you

51
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,080
Come a summer, there's a party on the block

52
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,740
Somebody hit the snooze on the doomsday clock

53
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,880
Come a summer

54
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,680
Come a summer

55
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,420
Come a summer

56
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,100
Come a summer

57
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,740
Come a summer.

58
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,460
Come a summer.

59
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,300
Come a summer.

60
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,560
Come a summer.

61
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,020
Bob Walkenhorst.

62
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,900
A chipper, straight-up rock and roll song there called Come a Summer.

63
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:06,340
Now, I'm going to keep this happy vibe going with a pretty old song from the famous ancient Broadway musical My Fair Lady.

64
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,660
This is from the movie soundtrack, and it happens to be a perfect subgenius anthem,

65
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:20,440
specifically a rewardian subgenius anthem, or what we might call classic so-called slacker anthem,

66
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,980
sung by Stanley Holloway.

67
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,880
Listen to the words.

68
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,260
Or at least try to follow the subtitles.

69
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:36,940
The Lord above gave man an arm of iron, so he could do his job and never shirk.

70
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:45,520
The Lord above gave man an arm of iron, but with a little bit of luck, with a little bit of luck,

71
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,480
someone else will do the blinking work.

72
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:55,280
With a little bit, with a little bit, with a little bit of luck,

73
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,880
you'll never be a man again.

74
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,260
Never work.

75
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:03,980
The Lord above made liquor for temptation, to see if man could turn away from sin.

76
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:12,560
The Lord above made liquor for temptation, but with a little bit of luck, with a little bit of luck,

77
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,280
when temptation comes, you'll keep riding.

78
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:23,080
With a little bit, with a little bit, with a little bit of luck, you'll keep riding.

79
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,220
Oh, you can walk.

80
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,980
Just try to narrow, but with a little bit of luck, you'll run amok.

81
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:38,640
The gentle sex was made for man to marry, to share his nest and see his food is cooked.

82
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:47,240
The gentle sex was made for man to marry, but with a little bit of luck, with a little bit of luck,

83
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,140
you can have it all and not get hooked.

84
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,880
With a little bit, with a little bit, with a little bit of luck,

85
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,040
with a little bit of luck, you won't get hooked.

86
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:05,920
With a little bit, with a little bit, with a little bit of luck, you won't get hook,

87
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,380
Or with a little bit, a lucky one get hook,

88
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:13,560
The Lord was throwing goodness at you, but with a little bit of luck a man can duck.

89
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:21,320
The Lord above made man to help his neighbour, no matter where on land or sea or foam.

90
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,440
The Lord above made man to help his neighbour,

91
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:25,860
No matter where on land or sea or foam,

92
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,940
But with a little bit of luck, with a little bit of luck,

93
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,020
you will come around, you won't be home.

94
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:39,860
With a little bit, with a little bit, with a little bit of luck,

95
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,840
you won't be home.

96
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:48,860
With a little bit, with a little bit, with a little bit of blooming life.

97
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,640
You make a good suffrage, don't you?

98
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,740
It's Rodley to get along.

99
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,200
Get on, get on.

100
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,360
Why, there's the lucky man now, the Honourable Alfie Doolittle.

101
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,420
What are you doing in Eliza's house?

102
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,160
A former residence.

103
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,800
You can buy your own drinks now, Alfie Doolittle.

104
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,040
Fallen into a tub of butter, you have.

105
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,960
What are you talking about?

106
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,080
Your daughter, Eliza.

107
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,300
Oh, you're a lucky man, Alfie Doolittle.

108
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,700
Well, what about Eliza?

109
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,600
Ah, he don't know.

110
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,860
Her own father and he don't know.

111
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,760
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,860
Moved in with a swell, Eliza has.

113
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,120
Left her in a taxi all by herself, smart as paint,

114
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,420
and ain't been home for three days.

115
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,360
Go on.

116
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,660
And this morning I get a message from her.

117
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,260
She wants her things sent over to 27A Wimpole Street,

118
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,500
care of Professor Regans.

119
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,820
Ha, ha, ha.

120
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,920
And what things does she want?

121
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,200
What?

122
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,860
A birdcage and a chocolate.

123
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,800
I mean, it's fair.

124
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

125
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,940
But, she says, never mind about sending any clothes.

126
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,680
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

127
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,680
I knew she had a career in front of her.

128
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,100
Anyway, we're in for a boozer.

129
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,240
The sun is shining on Alfred P. Doolittle.

130
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,320
A man was made to help support his children,

131
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,980
which is the right and proper thing to do.

132
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,860
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

133
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,080
A man was made to help support his children,

134
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,740
but with a little bit of luck,

135
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,640
with a little bit of luck,

136
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,560
they'll go out and start supporting you.

137
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,880
With a little bit,

138
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,880
with a little bit,

139
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,420
with a little bit of luck,

140
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,280
they'll work for you.

141
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,520
With a little bit,

142
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,520
with a little bit,

143
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,080
with a little bit of blooming luck.

144
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,860
Oh, it's a crime for man to go philandering,

145
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,380
and fill his wife's poor heart with grief and doubt.

146
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,320
Oh, it's a crime for man to go philandering,

147
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,900
but with a little bit of luck,

148
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,820
with a little bit of luck,

149
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,720
you can see the bloodhound don't find out.

150
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,920
With a little bit,

151
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,860
with a little bit,

152
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,400
with a little bit of luck,

153
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,420
she won't find out.

154
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,540
Charlie!

155
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,540
With a little bit,

156
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,460
with a little bit,

157
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,560
with a little bit,

158
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,160
with a little bit of blooming luck.

159
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,860
With a little bit of blooming luck.

160
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,360
Hi, Mom.

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,180
We had a game this afternoon, but our side lost.

162
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,620
What do you want at the store?

163
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,140
More sugar, son.

164
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,520
Here's the list.

165
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,360
These are the people I want you to turn in,

166
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,560
and here's the family pocketbook.

167
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,400
I need these things in a hurry, too.

168
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:55,780
Okay.

169
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,060
Okay, Mom.

170
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,240
I'll take my bike.

171
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,700
Hi, Mom.

172
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,100
Say, will you let me trade work tonight?

173
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,800
I was supposed to do the dishes,

174
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,260
but Jane's father is going to show the movies of their trip.

175
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,060
May I get supper?

176
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,800
Well, I think so.

177
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,980
Tonight's the family boon meeting, you know.

178
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,960
I wouldn't want you to be late.

179
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,200
You sure you'll be back in time?

180
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,120
Well, Janie said they were going to have the movies right after supper.

181
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,320
I'll be home by eight.

182
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,360
Well, that's all right then, Heineke.

183
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,040
Suppose you set the table and I'll start making the salad.

184
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,880
I'll dive right in.

185
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,620
Where's the liquor?

186
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,240
Here.

187
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,100
I'll bring you the liquor.

188
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:29,620
Okay.

189
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,820
Come to order over there.

190
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,060
All right.

191
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,900
Now, the chief, shut up.

192
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,540
The chief thing to talk over is our vacation.

193
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,120
Right, Chief.

194
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,580
But perhaps, Mother, perhaps there are some small things first.

195
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,200
Well, they're small, but they're hard, and, John, I know it's hard to be neat,

196
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,120
but tonight in the living room I stumbled over the stiff fingers of a catcher's mitt.

197
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,660
Oh, God.

198
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,200
I see.

199
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,220
Oh, my.

200
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,220


201
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,220


202
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,380
And I had to take Patty's period back to school before she'd study them, and I could sit down

203
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,280
in the big electric chair.

204
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:00,780
Oh, Mom.

205
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,340
Well, maybe we could be more careful where we put things.

206
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
Yes, I think we, I think they ought to.

207
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:12,360
Okay, now, young John, John, yes, anything you want to bring up?

208
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,700
Just my dinner, Dad.

209
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,600
Cute kid.

210
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,740
Gee, he's neat, isn't he?

211
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:17,960
Yeah.

212
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,140
I'd like to bring up our vacation, Dad.

213
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,320
Gee, you should have seen those pictures tonight.

214
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,120
Oh, yeah.

215
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,780
They were in color and everything.

216
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,800
All those colorful pictures.

217
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,460
Well, now, now, now, now, now, last, did it have the dentist in it?

218
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:29,760
Yes.

219
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,480
I love those.

220
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,240
And the nun.

221
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,140
Yes, the Cary Grant mask.

222
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:33,860
Yeah, that's a lot.

223
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,540
I love that one.

224
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,380
That's the same trip I went on.

225
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,460
And the nun with the mole.

226
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,540
Yes, I know.

227
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,060
Dad.

228
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,080
That mole is so small you wouldn't expect.

229
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,160
He lives under the yard.

230
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:42,700
Yes.

231
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,720
Come on, Dad.

232
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,060
What about our vacation?

233
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,760
All right, let's see.

234
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,720
Back to the meeting here.

235
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,220
Yes, well, last time we decided that one of you should go to camp.

236
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,480
And he never came back.

237
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,100
And that the other one would go on vacation.

238
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,200
We decided that he'd go on a trip with us.

239
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,900
Oh, well, gee, let John go to camp this summer.

240
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,600
I went last year and then the rest of us could all take a trip together.

241
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,500
Those pictures sure must have been wonderful.

242
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,900
That mole.

243
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,060
I thought you wanted to go to camp.

244
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,540
I've been camping all morning.

245
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,840
What do you say, John?

246
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,480
Well, gosh, Dad, I'd say I don't know.

247
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,400
Ask Yoko.

248
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,740
Couldn't I do both?

249
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,200
Well, now, the family budget says camp for just one of you.

250
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,060
Now, it wouldn't be fair for one person to do both, would it?

251
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,080
No.

252
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,100
Well, I'm a schizophrenic.

253
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,820
Yeah, and I'm a bisexual.

254
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,760
I'm bored.

255
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,020
Well, now, let's wait until tomorrow and see if that decision is sticky.

256
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,340
Sticks, shall we?

257
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:32,740
Like the catcher myth.

258
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
John, cut it out.

259
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,960
Then we can plan some more.

260
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,820
Well, you see that John and Patty are already full-fledged citizens in their family.

261
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,920
They have a regular share in the family's work.

262
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,040
They help to make the family's plans.

263
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,260
Well, kids, so long now.

264
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,300
Hope you had a good time with the Whisperin' Squash again today.

265
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:01,880
Remember, bye for now, because you may not have a chance to buy for tomorrow.

266
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:02,820
So long.

267
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,620
So long.

268
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,800
So long.

269
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,340
Hooray for the Squash!

270
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,180
Yay!

271
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:17,260
The Firesign Theatre did that, a happy family scene called Family Bund Meeting from the

272
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,700
collection Dope Humor of the Seventies.

273
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:27,440
See thefiresigntheatre.com, but spell theatre the British way.

274
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,080
Now, I've been playing happy songs.

275
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:37,640
Well, here's the happiest song of all from the swinginest, lovinest bunch of corpses

276
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:44,000
you ever heard, the Swingin' Love Corpses, with Dr. Philo Drummond, Colonel Sphinx Drummond,

277
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,260
Ray Hay on guitar, Leif Cowabunga on bass, and Skippy Mojo Butcher on drums.

278
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,420
I think I got that right.

279
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,740
The song, We Are Going to Save the Universe.

280
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,160
Now, is that cheerful or what?

281
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,860
This is a song that I don't know about, because it worked.

282
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,580
It's about the night we saved the universe.

283
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,320
Groupies!

284
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:06,640
Yeah.

285
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,200
You're the best.

286
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,200


287
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,200


288
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,200


289
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,200


290
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,400
I'm the best.

291
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,460
Yeah.

292
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:14,460


293
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:14,460


294
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:14,460


295
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:14,460


296
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:14,460


297
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:14,460


298
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:14,460


299
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:14,460


300
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:14,460


301
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:14,460


302
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:14,660
Yeah.

303
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,080
Yeah.

304
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,600
When we were born

305
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,260
Into this life

306
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,940
We were destined

307
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,700
To make it right

308
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,720
And it's predetermined

309
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,340
And this is our fate

310
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,120
We're singing this song

311
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,920
So you can read later

312
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,360
We are going to save the universe

313
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,140
We are going to save the universe

314
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,000
We are going to save the universe

315
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,340
This time

316
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,660
We are full grown

317
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,320
We are grown up men

318
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,540
We are all masters

319
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,540
We pay to reason it

320
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,960
It is our mission

321
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,800
And it is our task

322
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,600
It's all for us

323
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,340
Yet you still ask

324
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,600
We are going to save the universe

325
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,100
We are going to save the universe

326
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,280
We are going to save the universe

327
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,480
We are going to save the universe

328
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:55,880
This time

329
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,120
This time

330
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:49,120


331
00:17:49,120 --> 00:18:19,120


332
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,320
We are going to save the universe

333
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,120
We are going to save the universe

334
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,020
We are going to save the universe

335
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,420
This time

336
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,960
Maybe when here

337
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,220
Just swang and let gloom

338
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,620
Buy

339
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,800
So long

340
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:16,000
Third video

341
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,440
it yet, or at least not in 22 years. Let's check some of it out. I've realized in editing that I

342
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,900
need to explain this, the scene that's about to happen on the Puzzling Evidence show.

343
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:40,460
Philo and his brother were on, and just as Philo went off to go to the bathroom or something,

344
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:51,760
his dead dog Little Dude called in. Philo had this beloved little dog named Lil Dude,

345
00:19:52,240 --> 00:20:01,760
and every now and then, it was like Little Dude would somehow call the show. Didn't happen often,

346
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,400
but when it did happen Philo missed it.

347
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,780
Philo the Dog?

348
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,000
Dude!

349
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,280
Oh, of course, a new man!

350
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,780
Well, as a person who's a professional telephone pole climber, I must say it is a hazard to

351
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,980
have to battle nails and staples.

352
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,800
They're only at the bottom, aren't they?

353
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,480
Yeah, so if you do fall, you're not going to fall like 30 feet.

354
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,780
That's the good thing.

355
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,680
Just don't hug the pole real tight when you get to that point.

356
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,040
You'll only fall 30, 30, one foot 30 times.

357
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,320
Yeah.

358
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,320
Berlin, Germany, Chicago, Illinois.

359
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:33,940
Who is this now?

360
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,960
That's a real guy.

361
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,760
Wow, little dude from Chicago.

362
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,360
What's he finally called?

363
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,100
Little dude, are you calling from under the ground in Missouri or something?

364
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,100
No, I'm from a different place.

365
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,980
A better place, I think.

366
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:47,720
A better place.

367
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,280
Do you have any words of wisdom for us?

368
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,300
Well, I'd like to talk to Philo.

369
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,960
Oh, boy, that's going to be tough, you know?

370
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,380
What do you want to know?

371
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,220
For reasons the callers can only guess at.

372
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,360
I am Philo by proxy.

373
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,500
Oh, can I talk to Philo's brother?

374
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,080
I'm Philo by proxy.

375
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,840
I lost my career and I cry in my beer.

376
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,260
Yeah, that is the famous Philo's brother.

377
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,480
This show is my only real job.

378
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,620
Also known as Hector.

379
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,200
Remember that time I peed on your leg?

380
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,520
Also, Bavoso.

381
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,140
Remember that time I peed on your leg and you kicked me?

382
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,420
Oh, it's little dude's revenge.

383
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,440
This is getting kind of kinky.

384
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,240
No.

385
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,980
I hate you for that.

386
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,180
No.

387
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:30,980
I do.

388
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,420
I really wasn't kicking you.

389
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,060
What I was trying to do was point you in a direction, in a radical direction.

390
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,060


391
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,060


392
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,120
I was trying to make you feel that I'm not a real person.

393
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,520
You were just trying to pet me with your foot, I know.

394
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:47,940
Yeah.

395
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,520
Just, you know.

396
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:55,240
Where's the book that says you can only pet an animal with your hand?

397
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,480
Oh, here it is right here.

398
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,220
Genteel Guide to Animal Husbandry.

399
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,960
Take it apart and see if it works.

400
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,920
Oh, it's still there.

401
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,040


402
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,040


403
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,040


404
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,040


405
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,040


406
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,040


407
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,040


408
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,040


409
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,040


410
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,040


411
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,040


412
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,040


413
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,800
Are you an animal?

414
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,100
All animal products from Edible, Missouri.

415
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,520
Well, we also have an announcement

416
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,660
that the Big Top 23 Circus

417
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,180
will exhibit its Curiosity Cabinet of Wonder and Oddities

418
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,660
on the 22nd.

419
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,820
Philo's Brother.

420
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,040
Don't see me, Dr. Howland.

421
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,720
I'm Philo's Brother.

422
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,620
Aerial acts are performed.

423
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,140
I'm Philo's Brother.

424
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,180
This is at the Cyclone Warehouse,

425
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,420
1842 Illinois Street.

426
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,040
Man, this little dude guy can talk forever

427
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,440
even though his lungs are probably leathery.

428
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,280
This is a benefit.

429
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,800
There's probably worms crawling out of his bones

430
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,080
between his eyes.

431
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,020
Drug rehab.

432
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,440
That was the best tape ever.

433
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,120
The little dude digging up the backyard tape.

434
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,660
That was amazing.

435
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,000
Because about two months later,

436
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,520
the Times Beach story broke.

437
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,420
In the meantime...

438
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,820
And it is a meantime.

439
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,220
Don't be scared, little caller.

440
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,600
When will we hear from the Book of Bob?

441
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,660
Hyperventilation, verse one.

442
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,380
Oh man, you know,

443
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,920
those have gone off in all sorts of directions,

444
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,740
but I'm sure you'll, you could hear from them,

445
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,660
hell, what am I saying,

446
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,100
in June 10th in Portland, right?

447
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,580
At the lawsuit of Bob.

448
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,040
Man, that's one of the best jams.

449
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,040
At the lawsuit of Bob,

450
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,420
which is now a club in LA.

451
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,940
There was so much money made by all the people in lawsuit

452
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,780
that they all got together as friends

453
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,760
and bought a club in LA,

454
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,160
and it's called Lawsuit O' Bob.

455
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,060
You remember doing this one, Philo?

456
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,240
Good Lord.

457
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,160
Hey, I just got back.

458
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,460
What is that?

459
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,480
What is that?

460
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,220
I didn't miss anything, did I?

461
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,940
No, except little dude called.

462
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,980
You didn't miss anything.

463
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,200
Except little dude called?

464
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,380
Oh man.

465
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,440
And you weren't here.

466
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,240
Oh.

467
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,960
You must have been frapping or driving.

468
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,140
No, I was, well, I was actually answering

469
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,960
to nature's most urgent call.

470
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,440
Yeah, frapping, that's what I thought.

471
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,020
It's nature's voice I hear and I obey.

472
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,140
Frapping.

473
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,140
I'm a brother to Joe.

474
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:10,400
We had to go hiking two miles into the forest today

475
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,100
to do that.

476
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,040
To do that?

477
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,120
To do this.

478
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,600
Oh my.

479
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,080
Now throw that big community-sized towel over it.

480
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,240
That huge towel, yeah.

481
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,820
Yeah, each towel gets larger and larger.

482
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,740
Throw that building, I mean that city-sized towel.

483
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,860
We're just trying to keep it nice and spanking clean here.

484
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,160
Turns into a Richard Bartholomew story.

485
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,880
Yeah, exactly.

486
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,060
Puzzling evidence with Dr. Howland's special guest,

487
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,080
the Drummond brothers, Philo and Sphinx.

488
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,720
And here's something new and slack-imbuing,

489
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:45,040
the latest Dobbstown Mirror, and it's an eight-pager.

490
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:52,980
Check this out, friends, from dobs.town.com.

491
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,400
Actually, this doesn't say the dobs.town mirror,

492
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,980
it just says the Dobbstown Mirror,

493
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:04,040
number 104, volume two, number two, April 1st, 23 A.M.

494
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
That's this year.

495
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,940
Uh, $5, boy.

496
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,480
Well, see, it's an eight-pager.

497
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:17,160
It's got a big picture on the front by Zontar of Dobbstown.

498
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,460
It's a part of Dobbstown.

499
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,720
Here, let's read the first part.

500
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,940
Do you suffer from chronic ringing grin-itis?

501
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,080
Or I suppose you could pronounce that grin-itus.

502
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,020
Can't help but laugh at that.

503
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,640
Can't help but laugh at the horror.

504
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,900
Ready for a religion that considers you equal,

505
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,920
not in your soul or in heaven,

506
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,740
but in that most sacred of all parts of your body,

507
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,460
your wallet?

508
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,880
Us too.

509
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,360
Why must we always wait for future events?

510
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,040
What would it mean to you to wait for now

511
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,640
or wait for the past?

512
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,400
The Church of the Subgenius offers complete satisfaction,

513
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,380
free instructions,

514
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,860
and actions in exchange for money.

515
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,940
The conspiracy is powerful and skilled in deception.

516
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,540
As a member of the Church of the Subgenius moves away from the con,

517
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,640
he or she may move in any direction,

518
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:24,260
including directions that to other subgeniee look strange or even wrong.

519
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,300
The only wrong way to be a subgenius is to never send in your membership fee

520
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,460
to the Church of the Subgenius,

521
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,260
Subgenius Foundation.

522
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,000
Think of it.

523
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,960
A mind control cult that actively does not care

524
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,280
if you conform to its rules.

525
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,820
Can yours say the same?

526
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,780
Last each day as if you live.

527
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,840
Old Bob will sell just about anything to just about anybody.

528
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,800
What's he sold you today?

529
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,280
The conspiracy has over 10,000 nuclear warheads,

530
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
and their arsenals.

531
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,120
The Church of the Subgenius?

532
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,500
Only three.

533
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,200
And yet we dare to challenge them.

534
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,420
The advertisement that all advertisements are based on is

535
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,800
advertising works.

536
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,940
The belief that all beliefs are based on

537
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,540
is the belief that beliefs are real.

538
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:25,280
The Church of the Subgenius is a sinous sacrilegion

539
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,420
and a society of superior mutants.

540
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,540
Bob said,

541
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,660
You can be what you won't.

542
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,860
Adopt the mask of sanity.

543
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,860
Be so lucky that everything that happens is what you wanted to happen.

544
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,040
And treat that as if it were the most normal thing in the world.

545
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:53,860
Self-initiate your future self into your present perfected form.

546
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,120
Prescribe your own script.

547
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,940
Well, that was a nice first section there

548
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,940
from the Dobbstown mirror.

549
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,900
There's so many fine features in here.

550
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,400
Oh, my gosh.

551
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,300
Here's an article on optimism.

552
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,480
But I better not read it because I'm not sure whether I read that one already.

553
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,680
But there's a rant in here

554
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,500
by the late Dr. Katyszczo Legim

555
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,300
from 1999

556
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,300
about rain,

557
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,540
and it's really, really touching actually.

558
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,760
Actually, it's super touchy.

559
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,920
Maybe I should read it.

560
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,860
Rain by Dr. Katahdin Leguim.

561
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,400
Man, I'm tuned.

562
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,460
It's rained maybe twice this summer,

563
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,560
and the news said we might have a thunderstorm tonight.

564
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,600
It's been near 100 degrees all weekend.

565
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,800
I'd welcome rain like a brother.

566
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,960
I told Susie, I'm going out, going to do a rain dance.

567
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,840
She, of course, gave me that,

568
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,100
you're nuts, but I knew that when I married you, look.

569
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,080
I stepped out the front door and shook my meaty butt a while

570
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,740
and said to no deity in particular,

571
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,160
come on, fucking rain.

572
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,860
A drop hit me on my T-shirt.

573
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,200
And another.

574
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,060
In about two minutes, I felt myself begin to tune.

575
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,420
The rain was falling in.

576
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,860
I was in my buckets and I was standing all alone in the courtyard

577
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,680
right in the middle of the downpour.

578
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,000
I was seized up in the now,

579
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,820
feeling the cool wind whipping around me,

580
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,880
the air fresh and sweet.

581
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,720
The rain fell hard and cold on my bald head,

582
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,020
running down in rivulets.

583
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,500
From a nearby vacant apartment,

584
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,320
I could hear Stan, the maintenance man's CD player,

585
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,120
blasting out the 10-minute instrumental intro

586
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,480
to Pink Floyd's Shine On, You Crazy Diamond.

587
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,860
I knew that the other tenants in my apartment complex

588
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,460
were staring out their windows at me, thinking me mad.

589
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,020
I didn't give a shit.

590
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,340
The poor fools didn't know what they were missing.

591
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,740
I stood there for the duration of the storm,

592
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,720
lightning crashing violently,

593
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,420
wind ripping leaves from the trees,

594
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,340
and rain like a deluge on me.

595
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,780
A chubby girl about 10 years old

596
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,520
came out of her apartment and walked me out.

597
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:28,520


598
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:28,520


599
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:28,520


600
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:28,520


601
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:28,520


602
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:28,520


603
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:28,520


604
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,760
She walked over to me grinning.

605
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,920
She knew why I was out there

606
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,700
when all the older and wiser didn't.

607
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,080
Other kids came and stared out their windows,

608
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,360
wanting to come out too,

609
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,580
but their parents wouldn't let them.

610
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,080
Oh, perish forbid.

611
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:47,220
Only fools don't have the sense to come in out of the rain.

612
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,180
But if that rain makes me a fool,

613
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,820
then hand me the pointed hat.

614
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,260
That wasn't rain that fell from the sky on me this evening.

615
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,600
It was just wet slack.

616
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,220
Wow.

617
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,900
By Dr. Legume from the Dobstown Mirror.

618
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,280
Latest edition.

619
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,500
And, uh...

620
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,360
But now this.

621
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,320
This is called The

622
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:35,520
The

623
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:35,740
The

624
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:35,760
The

625
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,160
The

626
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,160


627
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,160


628
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,180
The

629
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:37,180


630
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:37,180


631
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,280
If your body's feeling bad

632
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,520
And it seems too much

633
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:58,520


634
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,580
The only one you have

635
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,000
You wanna take her with a wave

636
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,380
Go on walking in the rain

637
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,700
Watch the flowers go to bed

638
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,200
Ask the man inside your head

639
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,480
You'll never have to leave

640
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,820
All you gotta do is believe

641
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,660
Nothing ever

642
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,360
Amen and hallelujah

643
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,880
I sense sickness in this room, friends

644
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,080
Lots and lots of invalid sickness

645
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,960
And who is fully licensed

646
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,160
By the state of New Jersey, New Mexico

647
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,560
Nevada and Pennsylvania

648
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,900
To fully and completely heal you

649
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,800
By laying hands on you

650
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,080
No one's gonna say no

651
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,020
That's right, me

652
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,800
I can do it

653
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,920
Step forward, friends

654
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,980
Step forward

655
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,820
And let me lay hands on you

656
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,640
All you gotta do

657
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,400
Is dream

658
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,920
Your body's gonna stop the fear

659
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,920
Finger drifts at holding fire

660
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,300
Everlasting sweet desire

661
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,640
If you matter what the doctor say

662
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,900
Heal a man and he'll steal away

663
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,520
Immortality for two

664
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,040
Miracles, they come for you

665
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,260
The fate, hello!

666
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,060
Can I put my hands on you?

667
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,060
Can I put my hands on you?

668
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,720
Yes, friends, it is me again

669
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,600
Like a specter emerging from under a rock

670
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,620
I'm back, I'm back

671
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,600
To make you happy in the name of Jesus

672
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,640
That's right

673
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,800
Come on, come on, come on

674
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,320
I can't hear you tongue-twistering

675
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,220
Wait a minute

676
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,600
I can't control what I'm hearing

677
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,060
I can't control what's on my mind

678
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,120
I can't control what's on my mind

679
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,100
I can't control what's on my mind

680
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,120
I can't control what's on my mind

681
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,980
Faith and hope and charity

682
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,780
Simple relativity

683
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,700
He can make you understand

684
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,180
All you gotta do is take his hand

685
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,660
Remember what someone said

686
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,140
Ask the man inside your head

687
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,400
Finger drips and holding fire

688
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,820
Everlasting sweet desire

689
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,920
The fate, hello!

690
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,160
The fate, hello!

691
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,640
Can I put my hands on you?

692
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,740
Can I put my hands on you?

693
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,940
Friends, I need only your soft touch to do my work

694
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,420
So many of you have sinned

695
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,460
So many of you have sinned

696
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,400
God's not gonna let go

697
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,080
He's gonna punish you

698
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,700
God hates folks who are fat

699
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,080
God hates folks who are safe too small

700
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,080
God hates

701
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,900
God hates

702
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,880
God hates

703
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,320
Where's God's light?

704
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,660
Oh, where's God's light?

705
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,940
Can I put my hands on you?

706
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,300
Can I put my hands on you?

707
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,700
Can I put my hands on you?

708
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,040
Can I put my hands on you?

709
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,400
Can I put my hands on you?

710
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,700
Can I, put my hands on you?

711
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,160
Come on friend

712
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,780
I have said

713
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,820
I have known sin in the back of a car

714
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,980
I've known sin in the back of a barn

715
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,380
I've gone far to know sin, friends

716
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,000
I've traveled miles and miles and miles

717
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,720
I have said, oh, please forgive me

718
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,820
I just need your touch to forgive me

719
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,820
Please, lay your hands on me

720
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,680
That's right, right there, right there

721
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,660
Can I put my hands on you?

722
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,920
Can I put my hands on you?

723
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,240
Can I put my hands on you?

724
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,620
Can I put my hands on you?

725
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,920
Can I put my hands on you?

726
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,940
Amen and Hallelujah

727
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,180
Wait, wait, wait, my light's gone

728
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,980
I can't feel my love

729
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,660
I can't feel my love

730
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,260
Lord, I can't

731
00:36:54,260 --> 00:37:12,720
I can't feel my love

732
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,280
I can't feel my love

733
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:23,280


734
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,420
Uh, in trouble with buttons

735
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,160
What happens if I push that button?

736
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,080
I don't know what happens if you pass that button but

737
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,900
I know if you pass that one

738
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,660
There's these little lights on the phone.

739
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,820
I push these ... I push the red button

740
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:46,100
As you notice over there to the left of the grill

741
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,640
Lie, Crawford, over

742
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,940
We have a dream up ourov

743
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,920
It says speaker and phone

744
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,660
Oh, I'm getting a guess. Thank you, Cruz.

745
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,260
Someone is importantly trying to convocate us, but we can't evacuate the system.

746
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:57,760
Hello?

747
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,200
Hello?

748
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,020
No, I'm good.

749
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,000
Push one and pull the other one at the same time.

750
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,940
Hey, man, you're blowing my FCC qualifications.

751
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,740
Let's quit talking.

752
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,620
Let's not even.

753
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,780
No, we were just kidding about the caller.

754
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:16,360
Let's not use the word blowing anything of anything you have in any contextual situation, please.

755
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,520
For the love of Dobbs.

756
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,360
And whatever happened to Mike?

757
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,960
For the love of Mike.

758
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,740
For the love of Mike.

759
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,860
For the love of money.

760
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,580
For the...

761
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,640
Is she singing about Buddha again?

762
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:35,960
Let's see.

763
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,900
Ima Sumac here.

764
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,780
Buddha's my kind of guy.

765
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,320
This is a song called Akla Taki.

766
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,060
Chant of the Chosen Maidens.

767
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,780
These are your Neanderthal babes, your Yeti girls, your werewomen.

768
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,840
You're going to be taken to the...

769
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,400
A sacrificial rock and rocked by the...

770
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:59,000
And I suppose the priestly class will have some sort of fun with them

771
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,940
because they were captured and enslaved from a local tribe that lost the big bowling tournament.

772
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:05,920
Right?

773
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:06,900
Am I correct?

774
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,780
That's all right.

775
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,520
Yeah, well, that's...

776
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,280
Isn't that the way they used to do it down there in Peru?

777
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,360
Yes, the conspiracy actually echoes down through human history.

778
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,260
Just as today, we suffer under...

779
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,440
It's sometimes subtle jackboot.

780
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
So too did the ancient...

781
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,020
Subtle jackboot.

782
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,000
The Lemurians, the Atlanteans also knew of the conspiracy.

783
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:34,660
But don't you think subtle jackboot would be a delicious name for a band that could perform not one but three songs?

784
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,300
I got a...

785
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,760
No, subtle jackboot is a good name for a band.

786
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,500
Princess, we and I have formed a new band just because we have the name...

787
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,300
Okay, here's the band name.

788
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:47,680
Okay.

789
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,680
Poo Water Towel.

790
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,900
I already thought of that.

791
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,300
Oh.

792
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,640
That's old, man.

793
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,580
Poo Water Towel.

794
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,040
Come on.

795
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,720
I said, I need poo water.

796
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,200
There probably was a band called Poo Water Towel.

797
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,100
There was Poo Water Dissonance.

798
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,260
It was an old 19...

799
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,160
Early 70s Cleveland band, art band.

800
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,200
Poo Water Dissonance.

801
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:05,700
Really?

802
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,220
Yes.

803
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,960
And they played in high frequency dog tones mostly.

804
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,600
But they were bursted by the Society for Refurbishment of the Animal Crew.

805
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:17,740
And...

806
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,660
One man was sent to punishment for, I think, like 40 years.

807
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,580
Poo Water Towel.

808
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,360
But don't let somebody stick your finger in your nose.

809
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,360
Take a imagine.

810
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,720
I don't know how you feel one way or the other

811
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,340
It's an extra happy to wipe it on your brother

812
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,580
He's robbing in your bar

813
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,940
And he's looking at your neighbor

814
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,240
Pining nuggets from his house

815
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,620
He's like a saber in the paper

816
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,080
He's pulling, he's tugging

817
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,200
He's yanking on the stain

818
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,440
It's a long, strabist thing

819
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,840
Still connected to the brain

820
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:08,920
Pick a booger

821
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,260
Pick a booger

822
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,240
Pick a booger

823
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,540
Pick a booger

824
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,760
Everybody's doing it

825
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,080
Picking it and chewing it

826
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,020
Yeah!

827
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:27,260


828
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,300
He's rolling in, he's rolling in

829
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,220
Checking in for hair

830
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,400
He's quick to get away

831
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,820
Still looking at the head

832
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,240
He's got some people on his finger

833
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,600
He can make it every day

834
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,000
Pick a booger, booger

835
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,060
It's a new day today

836
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,660
He's jumping out of who he be

837
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,900
Up from deep inside his sinus

838
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,280
He's a slave to the mascot

839
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,500
Of his royal sinus

840
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,100
Kids all wanna have

841
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,240
Days of infestation

842
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,620
Cause a pick a booger, boogie

843
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,680
Is the new sensation

844
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,980
Pick a booger

845
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,340
Pick a booger

846
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:07,400
Pick a booger

847
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,360
Pick a booger

848
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:08,740
Pick a booger

849
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,360
Pick a booger

850
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,740
Pick a booger

851
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:13,740


852
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:13,880
Pick a booger

853
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,740
Pick a booger

854
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,100
Look at that.

855
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,360
Let's go.

856
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:24,100
Thank you.

857
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,760
Thank you.

858
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,320
Thank you.

859
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,480
Thank you.

860
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:26,660
Thank you.

861
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,860
Thank you.

862
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:31,340
Thank you.

863
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,220
Thank you.

864
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,800
Thank you.

865
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,820
Thank you.

866
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:10,540
Thank you.

867
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,520
More happy music, dear friends.

868
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,680
The happiest ever.

869
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,040
The happiest ever.

870
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:17,040


871
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,880
Pick a Booger by the Swingin' Love Corpses.

872
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,760
Man, I love that song.

873
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,560
And now this.

874
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,060
The Dobstown Mirror again.

875
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,540
What have we here on the Dobstown Mirror coming up next?

876
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:42,740
There's nothing so fiery and self-satisfying as a new hatred.

877
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:47,540
And that's why my advice is to forgive those who do you wrong.

878
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:52,720
When they do you wrong again, you'll have a brand new hate better than the old one.

879
00:47:53,240 --> 00:48:01,140
Holding a grudge runs the danger of letting a good, honest hatred run cold, get ragged.

880
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,380
Thank you, Dobstown Mirror.

881
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:11,040
By the way, most of the Dobstown Mirror is written by Uncle Dr. Onan Canabite.

882
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:12,720
Thank you.

883
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:12,720


884
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,800
Although he did have a Katahdin Lagoon article in here this time.

885
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,800
And there's a Dr. Philo Drummond story.

886
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,620
Boy, there's a whole bunch of this preaching stuff.

887
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,080
Anyway, friends.

888
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,920
And now this.

889
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:37,160
I was watching this new, weird, good movie called Vivarium.

890
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:41,920
And at the end was the spazziest song I've heard in some time.

891
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:46,800
Turns out that it was by XTC from like 1979.

892
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:53,240
And I'd never heard it before because that's how hip I wasn't.

893
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,500
But now I get to hear it again.

894
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,340
I asked myself, should I put my finger to the left?

895
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,260
No.

896
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,520
I asked myself, should I put my finger to the right?

897
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,120
No.

898
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:10,340
No.

899
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:15,220
It doesn't really matter where I put my finger.

900
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:19,320
Someone else will come along and I'll pretend it's always been the same.

901
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,860
It's just a complicated game.

902
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,680
Yeah.

903
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:25,120


904
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:26,820
Mm.

905
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,920
It's just a complicated game.

906
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:31,560
Yeah.

907
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:32,820
Yeah.

908
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:33,480
Mm.

909
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:34,320
Mm.

910
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:37,580
Mm.

911
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:37,680


912
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:37,840


913
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:38,720


914
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:38,780


915
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:39,300


916
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,060
Mm.

917
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


918
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


919
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


920
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


921
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


922
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


923
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


924
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


925
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


926
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


927
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


928
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


929
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


930
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


931
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


932
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


933
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


934
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:40,060


935
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:40,680
On the left

936
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,140
Ah ah ah ah

937
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,920
The little girl asked me should she part her hair

938
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,140
On the right

939
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,080
No ah ah ah

940
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,220
I said it really doesn't matter what you're watching

941
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:56,900
There's something else that comes along with movies

942
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,740
And it's always been the same

943
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,220
It's just a complicated game

944
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,340
Yeah yeah yeah

945
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:05,680
Yeah yeah

946
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,020
Ah ah

947
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,540
This is a complicated game

948
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,420
Yeah yeah yeah

949
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,160
Yeah yeah yeah

950
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,580
Ah ah ah

951
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:20,360
The little boy asked me should he put his thumbtip on the left

952
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,140
Ah ah ah ah

953
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:27,620
The little boy asked me should he put his thumbtip on the right

954
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,200
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

955
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,060
I said it really doesn't matter what you're watching

956
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,800
There's something else that comes along with movies

957
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,800
And it's always been the same

958
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,280
It's just a complicated game

959
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,420
Yeah yeah yeah

960
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:45,880
Yeah yeah yeah

961
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,440
Ah ah ah ah

962
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,480
It's just a complicated game

963
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,780
Yeah yeah yeah

964
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,260
Yeah yeah yeah

965
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,200
Ah ah ah ah

966
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,680
They wanted Charles

967
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,980
They wanted Joe

968
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:03,240
To jump him up and stick him out of that shuttle

969
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,740
They were only arrows in a very fair tale

970
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:07,660
Yeah yeah yeah

971
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,020
It's just a complicated game

972
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:15,980
Yeah yeah yeah

973
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:19,380
Uh mm

974
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:19,580
Uh mm

975
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,140
Uh mm

976
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,440
Uh mm

977
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,080
Uh mm

978
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:27,680
Uh mm

979
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,100
Uh mm

980
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,780
God has been shown to judge upon us what is love

981
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:46,960
No, no, no

982
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,300
God has been shown to judge upon us what is love

983
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:55,120
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right

984
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:58,980
I say, I say the thing that made a man to put you where you were

985
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:03,440
Just look at the camera and it's always, always the same

986
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,040
It's just a complain, a complain

987
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,440
Qualativas

988
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,160
Qual Receipes

989
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,100
Qual Receipes

990
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,860
This is the Сергаврику's again

991
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:31,600
This is your again

992
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,700
Schooled

993
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:32,700


994
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:32,700


995
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:33,100
of this

996
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,480
It's just a complicated game by XTC,

997
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:57,720
and you are listening to the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

998
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,520
All information is at subgenius.com.

999
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:07,740
And this month, the important information is about X Day, 24X Day,

1000
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:13,100
the week of July 2nd through 5th.

1001
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:17,020
It'll be really different this year.

1002
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,860
Number one, it won't just be a drill this time,

1003
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,980
because we're going to save the universe this time.

1004
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:29,220
Number two, the live in-person event is happening,

1005
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,920
but it's grown to two sites.

1006
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,680
Our usual campground in Ohio called Wisteria,

1007
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:40,160
but also a new one, new to us, a resort campground in Florida.

1008
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,760
And number three, it will also be streamed live,

1009
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,340
which is how it happened last year, and it was great.

1010
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:51,960
So this way, Yankees and others who treasure hanging out with old friends at Wisteria

1011
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,680
and are too far from Florida can do so just like in the old days.

1012
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:58,560
And those who want to try the Florida one, sign up quick,

1013
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,420
because only 50 can attend, and I think 25,

1014
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:06,500
and the Florida one is a little bit more expensive.

1015
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:13,960
Those who will await the saucers at home can attend just like last year, virtually.

1016
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:20,440
Up to 50 people were there last time, and it was really, really fun and crazy.

1017
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,480
The Florida event will be live streamed separately,

1018
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,000
and Wisteria might be streamed if they improve the Wi-Fi.

1019
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,500
Here's how you start.

1020
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:31,500


1021
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:31,500


1022
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,500
You find out the details of all this stuff.

1023
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:39,460
Go to subgenius.com, click on events if you're interested,

1024
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,740
and there'll be an X-Day listing.

1025
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:46,720
Or if you just scroll on down the homepage of subgenius.com,

1026
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,900
you'll come to an X-Day link.

1027
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:55,020
Basically, they go to hypercubego.com slash X-Day 2021,

1028
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,480
and it'll tell you about the event.

1029
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,480
The other one will tell you about the Wisteria one.

1030
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,680
I'm going to go to the Florida one only,

1031
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,080
and there'll be a whole bunch of wild bands,

1032
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,560
some of which we've heard, some of which we haven't,

1033
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:19,440
including TTN, Rubik's Cube, Sub-G Kids, and Peas.

1034
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,220
Anyway, friends, so check it out.

1035
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,000
There's also an X-Day Facebook page, and there's links to that on there.

1036
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:31,180
Nobody has stepped up to organize the Wisteria gathering,

1037
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,620
because this is the first time we've mentioned it.

1038
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,680
But I'm not going to be there to set everything up.

1039
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,160
And yeah.

1040
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:47,200
Yep, friends, subgenius.com, and you will then know everything.

1041
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:49,720
Praise Bob.

1042
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:55,760
And here's one reason why you should praise Bob.

1043
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,540
This is a little document.

1044
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,340
It's kind of a flyer.

1045
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:06,540
It's a flyer from the, from Reverend Zeno Fact and the Church of the Unanswered Question.

1046
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,960
It's got some nice clip art on it that wasn't swiped from us.

1047
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,920
And it's basically the conspiracy versus Bob.

1048
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:24,440
The conspiracy wants you to hate yourself, whereas Bob wants you to hate the conspiracy.

1049
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:28,060
The conspiracy wants to take your money.

1050
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:32,160
Bob just wants you to give him your money.

1051
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,860
Totally different.

1052
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:37,760
The conspiracy wants to take your slack.

1053
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,360
Bob wants you to have slack.

1054
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:46,640
The conspiracy wants you to hate sex, whereas Bob wants to have sex with you.

1055
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:51,860
The conspiracy tells you what to think, and Bob wants you to think for yourself.

1056
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:56,520
The conspiracy believes in nothing, but Bob believes in everything.

1057
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,040
Bob is a good guy.

1058
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:58,040


1059
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,520
The conspiracy wants you to trust no one.

1060
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,300
Bob just wants you to trust him.

1061
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,700
The conspiracy controls your time.

1062
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,680
Bob teaches you to control time.

1063
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,200
I keep wanting to say that differently.

1064
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,500
Bob teaches you time control.

1065
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,040
The conspiracy controls your time.

1066
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,040
The conspiracy will kill you.

1067
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,720
Bob will be killed by you.

1068
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:26,920
Bob will be killed by you.

1069
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:29,640
If you're being a good subgenius.

1070
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:34,740
And friends, what are you people waiting for?

1071
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:41,120
Did you know that for less than 10 cents a day for a year, that's less than one thin

1072
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:48,040
dime every day for one year, you too can have eternal salvation or triple your money back.

1073
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:49,780
Nothing else to buy.

1074
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,500
No need for periodic renewals.

1075
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,380
You are saved forever.

1076
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,700
Yes, for a one-time payment.

1077
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,400
One-time donation of a measly $35.

1078
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,860
Could change any minute.

1079
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,020
At subgenius.com, you will be saved.

1080
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:12,080
Even better, there's no need to repent any sins or transgressions.

1081
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:18,400
As a member of the Church of the Subgenius, you'll be issued your very own official divine

1082
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,940
all-inclusive excuse.

1083
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,980
And friends, it's a big document.

1084
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,180
Fancy looking.

1085
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,120
I mean, it's poster size.

1086
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:27,820
So, why wait?

1087
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:33,460
Hurry to subgenius.com and save yourself today.

1088
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:39,060
I think that ad copy may have come from Reverend Zena Fact also.

1089
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:49,740
So praise Bob and let there be slack.

1090
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:54,520
Thank you, Empire Jazz Orchestra in the background.

00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,380
They're not too bad, Bob.

1092
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:01,420
But I think they're not to be missed.

1093
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:02,800
So, I think that's OK.

1094
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:03,420


1095
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:03,480
All right.

1096
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:03,760
Thank you very much.

1097
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:04,680
Have a great day.

1098
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,000
Bye-bye.

1099
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:05,460
Bye-bye.

1100
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:05,480
Bye-bye.

1101
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,560
Bye-bye.

1102
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:07,560


1103
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:07,900
Bye-bye.

1104
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:07,900


1105
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:08,100
Bye-bye.

1106
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:08,840
Bye-bye.

1107
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:08,840


1108
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:08,840


1109
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:08,840
