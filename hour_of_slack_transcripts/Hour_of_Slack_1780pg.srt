00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:13,140
Ah, yes dear friends. This hour of Slack number 1780 is actually a rerun of number

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:26,540
664 from either really late 1998 or early 1999. It includes a devival with Einstein's Secret

3
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:34,260
Orchestra and Lunsum Cowboy Dave and yours truly Reverend Stang at the Euclid Tavern in Cleveland,

4
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:41,320
or at least Clipsa, from November of 1998. And there's some great tunes and all kinds of great

5
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:50,140
stuff. A lot of ESO radio from the late Professor Chas's show. And so, here's Bob.

6
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,080
Bob

7
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,720
Welcome to Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

8
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,300
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

9
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,200
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to

10
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,680
is specially designed only to be played on radio station

11
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,380
and only in the city of...

12
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,680
Yes, dear friends, we're back and it's once again,

13
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,420
it's going to be a solid Einsteinian secret orchestra show

14
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,420
for the simple reason that it's the holidays and I've got to get out of here.

15
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,520
I've got things to do, people to see.

16
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,320
We've got a big...

17
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,740
We've got a big...

18
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,400
Tonight the stars will be out.

19
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,460
Don't you know the goddess Pooh-Bang?

20
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,120
Goddess Pooh-Bang?

21
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,100
Goddess Pooh-Bang?

22
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,800
If you were in a spaceship, you know, you'd keep it pretty clean, right?

23
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,080
And you'd really be very careful about getting your air all dirty

24
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,780
because how would you get clean air again?

25
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,740
Yeah, there's no other air except the air.

26
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,360
You're inside.

27
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,280
It's okay.

28
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,880
When you're outside of a balloon,

29
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,080
you don't think anything about that, you know, pop in that balloon.

30
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,980
But if you were inside the balloon and there was nothing else outside,

31
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,080
you would not want to pop it.

32
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,120
Well, we used to have blimps fly in our neighborhood

33
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,500
and we used to take pot shots at them with our slingshots.

34
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,940
Well, somebody...

35
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,380
We're on...

36
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,900
The Earth is a giant balloon

37
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,360
and who might be taking pot shots at us?

38
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,660
With their slingshots, right.

39
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,340
And are we just developing...

40
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,560
Have we just invented the needle?

41
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,360
We, the people who live inside the balloon,

42
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,220
have now invented the giant needle.

43
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,080
It will pop through and...

44
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,020
So what are we doing?

45
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,720
All the air out.

46
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,640
Hey, let's go.

47
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,120
Let's pop.

48
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,520
Let's go get against our atmosphere.

49
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,380
See what happens.

50
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,220
Yeah.

51
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,180
Well, there's an idea.

52
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,960
Well, when they exploded the first atomic bomb,

53
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,340
they didn't know if it wasn't like Ice 9 or something.

54
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:34,860
Right.

55
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,400
It would just vaporize the whole atmosphere.

56
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah.

57
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,540
Yeah.

58
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,020
Man.

59
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,320
The whole damn solar system.

60
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,280
They weren't totally sure.

61
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,640
They didn't think it would happen.

62
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,420
Right.

63
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,400
You're in a pool without source.

64
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,920
Did they know it would be that big, as big as it was?

65
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,940
Did they predict?

66
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:51,880
No.

67
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,060
No.

68
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,380
They were...

69
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,220
It was about the way...

70
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,040
When they shot off the first atomic bomb,

71
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,680
it was about the...

72
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,700
And then the guy who...

73
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,680
Dobbs, Oppenheimer, Bob Oppenheimer...

74
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:00,840
Right.

75
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,820
...who invented it,

76
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,500
he looked at the first explosion

77
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,240
and he quoted the book of the subgenius

78
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,980
that I am becomes rock.

79
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,420
This is the end of the society.

80
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,200
The slinkies, the slinkies.

81
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,120
The slinkies.

82
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,120


83
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,780
Oh!

84
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,420
They're fun for girls and boys.

85
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,640
From the deepest, deepest points of the universe we can look at,

86
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,420
and there's these waves in the background,

87
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,180
and they kind of look like these rows of pipes.

88
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,820
I can feel those waves washing over me sometimes when I'm real sensitive.

89
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,760
Yeah.

90
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,700
Wow.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,460
What are those waves?

92
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,920
Have you ever laid in bed in a receptive state of mind

93
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,400
and tried to feel the neutrinos washing across you?

94
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:49,780
Yup.

95
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,920
I do it every night.

96
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,420
The cosmic particles zipping right through your body.

97
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,120
Yeah.

98
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,140
You say it like it's something unusual.

99
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,080
It's not.

100
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,080
It always makes me need to go to the bathroom when I have...

101
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,120
I hear them.

102
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,860
Every time they hit my eardrums,

103
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,000
my ear nerves,

104
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,640
I hear them.

105
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:07,940
Bing!

106
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,560
They sound to me,

107
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,280
they sound like the little particles slamming against your hard drive

108
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,640
when you turn your computer off.

109
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,100
Right.

110
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,880
Do you hear like a rain?

111
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,600
Yeah.

112
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,000
The dust is much more efficient than dust.

113
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,720
Dust just degrades.

114
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,200
Whereas the cockroach,

115
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,760
as they reproduce,

116
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,160
they continue your information.

117
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,840
Another reason why the church needs,

118
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,760
you know, more support, friend.

119
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,320
Right.

120
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,640
Because of worthy research like this.

121
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,680
Well, it's a way of sending the pamphlet of Bob

122
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,620
and the word of Bob into the future.

123
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,720
Someday an insectoid species,

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,780
long after man has gone,

125
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,100
will investigate the earth's cockroach.

126
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,780
They'll say, look, encoded in this DNA,

127
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,800
is this completely useless material

128
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,440
that has nothing to do with this creature's life cycle.

129
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,180
Wait a second.

130
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,640
Just eye.

131
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,200
Look, it decodes into a photograph of a hideous monster's face

132
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,120
with a pipe-like, uh, implement sticking from its mandible.

133
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,680
We gotta get going here.

134
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,620
We gotta get going home now, folks.

135
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,380
We gotta get out of here!

136
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,360
We gotta build that rocket ship.

137
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,280
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

138
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,140
You're my only hope.

139
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,960
Do you have the mental power?

140
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,420
Do you have the willpower to take perhaps an old vinyl record

141
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,800
that maybe your grandmother gave you 14 years ago

142
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,000
and view it in your mind as a spaceship,

143
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,600
as a flying saucer that can scissor through the cosmos

144
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,220
and then cop through galaxies like a laser-mute?

145
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:35,920
See!

146
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,560
Cut!

147
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,420
Cut!

148
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,520
Oh, look, your little light's flashing.

149
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:39,980
Who could it be?

150
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,920
Who could it be?

151
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,860
The twin red eyes in the deep.

152
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,780
Who could it be?

153
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,240
Gnashing in the radio.

154
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,120
Who could it be?

155
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,140
Who could it be now?

156
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,540
Which subgenius stalker could it be out there this time?

157
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,600
Who could it be?

158
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,500
Breathing down the backs of our necks.

159
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,660
Who could it be now?

160
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,420
Come on, man.

161
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:05,900
I, I, you, you owe me all them slacks that Bob said I was, was, was, was slacks.

162
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,000
And if I believed, I believed and I planted my seed.

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,520
Who could it be now?

164
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,300
My words, my slacks.

165
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,140
Who could it be now?

166
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,620
I want my slacks back.

167
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,200
Who could it be now?

168
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,880
Could it be, could it be the cute stalker?

169
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,080
The stalker everybody wishes was stalking them.

170
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:25,760
Mm-hmm.

171
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,520
Yes.

172
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,760
Oh, you thought I didn't know about you, did, did, did you?

173
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,500
Well, old, old Bobby, he knows all, sees all.

174
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,540
And he pipes all that information down to us followers here in the tower studio,

175
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,840
uh, headquarters, dungeon, basement, penthouse.

176
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,100
Where we, we, uh, have these, uh, rock stars and, and all those guys.

177
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,460
I've seen it all.

178
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:48,460


179
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:48,460


180
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,800
Taking some of them glass equipment stuff.

181
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,840
Uh, but we, we still need your, your pledge, of course.

182
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,880
And and, and, and you could, you could, uh, you could too.

183
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,900
Come on.

184
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,300
Everybody wants to.

185
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,520
You know Philly wants to.

186
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,400
Everybody wants to.

187
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,140
Don't you?

188
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:07,980
Yeah.

189
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,520
Come on.

190
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,380
What's the matter?

191
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,000
You scared?

192
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,880
You afraid?

193
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,280
You afraid Momo's gonna catch it?

194
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,100
You, you afraid, you afraid you gonna lose your plates?

195
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,100


196
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,100


197
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,100


198
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,100


199
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,100


200
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,100


201
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:29,160
cool. Oh, what's the matter? We might get diseases. Oh, come on, man. Let's go out to the graveyard

202
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:41,020
and desecrate. Make satanic symbols. Make fun of religion. Yeah, man. Sure, kids. Go on. Go on.

203
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:48,900
Do it. See where it gets you. You'll just be one more name in Bob's big book of bubs.

204
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:59,960
Bob's burnt out bubs. Those he leads to experiment with the occult and metaphysics,

205
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:09,260
ufology and Bigfoot and all that superstitious nonsense and parapsychotic phenomenons and

206
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,520
horse mutilation.

207
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:19,460
Crack circles and giant, huge chupacabra monster pterodactyls and scorpion beings.

208
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,020
Oh, yeah, yeah. Monsters. There's real live monsters.

209
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,380
We are young people.

210
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:24,940
Godzilla.

211
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,860
That's a metaphor.

212
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,200
Man is metaphorical.

213
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:36,280
By virtue of the cosmos and all the powers in command.

214
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,480
And virtue of the form and all else that has that power.

215
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,560
We won't go.

216
00:09:50,840 --> 00:10:03,500
You seem a little nervous, my friend.

217
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,080
When the strength is up by your soul.

218
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,780
You're telling me from beyond.

219
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,540
You'd better be ready.

220
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,120
To speak your piece.

221
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,540
You call me from beyond.

222
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,300
You disturb my rest of sleep.

223
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,920
With your childhood games.

224
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,820
You don't know what you're playing.

225
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,620
You're playing with me.

226
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,020
You're playing with me.

227
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,640
You're playing with me.

228
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,220
This is not a game for little boys and girls.

229
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,560
This is your life.

230
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,420
You're not a monster.

231
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,700
You're not a monster.

232
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,420
Look, we're not just another stupid army of elephants.

233
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,280
Listen to the music backwards in reverse.

234
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,540
It's the truth.

235
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,000
They won't.

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,900
It's not like I'll

237
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,780
give it to them.

238
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,340
Nail it them.

239
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,660
No way.

240
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,280
You all came this far.

241
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,780
No walk.

242
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,500
You're to blame.

243
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:40,980


244
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:51,500
And I found the truth is in the taking

245
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,640
A rock through which I will need a life

246
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,260
It's you, it's the pit of your face

247
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,120
But never worry

248
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,620
You're ready for me

249
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,920
Can it be ready to face the consequences?

250
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,060
It's never too late to redeem yourself

251
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,060
One last chance

252
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,500
That's all you have

253
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,540
It's up to you

254
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,600
You're ready for me

255
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,880
No escaping my eyes

256
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,380
You'll see them in every dream

257
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,040
You're ready

258
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,540
You'll never escape me

259
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,700
I'm here

260
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,600
I'm here

261
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:07,600


262
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:17,500
The sun will never shine with me right again

263
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,480
Would you like to make a pact?

264
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,440
You're ready for me from the outside

265
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,680
You've got me ready to face the truth, my friend

266
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,780
I'm here for you

267
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,960
So hang on to me

268
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,940
And I won't do it alone

269
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:44,640
Come on with me

270
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,320
And I'm ready to take on the truth

271
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:45,320


272
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:45,440
Face the truth

273
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,100
Be against me

274
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,240
For fingernails

275
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,020
The sandwiches were forced to eat

276
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,880
And then he said,

277
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,540
He had exactly 24 minutes to get these people to believe somehow.

278
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,280
They must jump the church or they will die.

279
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,460
What button can we push?

280
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,200
The sexual buttons have all been pushed.

281
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,960
The drunk buttons have all been pushed.

282
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,520
How about simple repetition of a word?

283
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:33,520
Bob.

284
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:34,520
Bob.

285
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,500
Bob.

286
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,380
Bob.

287
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,040
Bob.

288
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,980
You say it now.

289
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,380
Bob.

290
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:41,920
Bob.

291
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,820
Bob.

292
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,120
Can you say it, sir, please?

293
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,200
Bob.

294
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,000
Bob.

295
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,760
Now say it like a paralyzed child trying to communicate.

296
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,140
Say, Bob.

297
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,040
Bob.

298
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,480
Bob.

299
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,080
Bob.

300
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,580
Bob.

301
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,320
Bob.

302
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,240
Bob.

303
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,480
Bob.

304
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:02,500
Bob.

305
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:02,500


306
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:02,500


307
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:02,500


308
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:02,500


309
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:02,500


310
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:02,500


311
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:02,500


312
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:02,500


313
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:02,820
Bob.

314
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,140
Now I can't wait to say this.

315
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,240
Now I'm going to get you to do it.

316
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,280
Okay, you and the front row, we are going to do it now.

317
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:16,980
No.

318
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,100
No, I don't want you to say Bob.

319
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,320
I want you to get doing it now.

320
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,620
Thank you very much.

321
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,140
Lets do this.

322
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,380
Perfect!

323
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,040
Thank you, Lonesome Cowboy Dave!

324
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,620
Oh yes, I forgot about that!

325
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,560
Well anyway, I'm sorry that I did that.

326
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,160
I was very unprepared tonight too. Anyway, here's the bottom line of the whole thing.

327
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:52,120
See, I was the guy that almost came up with that internet joke, you know,

328
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,480
the internet joke about Johnny Black when he comes back and everybody wearing ape suits

329
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,280
and stuff. Do you know that joke?

330
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,180
Okay, for those of you who don't, you gotta go and see it.

331
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,420
When John Black comes back and all those guys land, everybody dress up in ape suits

332
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,120
like landing on him. So while I was only the guy who

333
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,980
almost came up with that joke, I did come up with this joke.

334
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,040
Okay, there's this guy. He's got like a regular normal head

335
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,500
and a nice normal body and everything, but he's got this little teeny

336
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,620
tiny growth, a little my growth that looks like a head coming out of his neck

337
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,140
right here.

338
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,960
So the guy walks into a bar, see, and he pulls out a two dollar

339
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,840
bill and slaps it on the counter and he says,

340
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,120
just give me a beer. And the bartender

341
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,240
says, hey buddy, we don't serve freaks in here.

342
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,480
And the little teeny head on the side of the guy's neck pipes up,

343
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,100
hey buddy, cut me some slack! I've been trying to get rid of this asshole for the last

344
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:53,700
three days!

345
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,340
I think we started a little real preaching going on.

346
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,880
I think we started a little real preaching going on.

347
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:37,880


348
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,320
If your body's in a mess,

349
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,180
it's the only one you have.

350
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,700
You wanna take away the flame,

351
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,180
or go out and look beneath the rain.

352
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,620
So once the farmer's gone to bed,

353
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,300
I'll send that ass out ahead.

354
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,680
There's never a thing

355
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,440
all you gotta do is wait.

356
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,920
The Faith in I!

357
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,520
The Faith in I!

358
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,520
Yes friends, I'm not talking about hate.

359
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,160
Yes friends, I'm not talking about hate.

360
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,600
I'm talking about eight! Dinner at eight!

361
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,000
That's right, let's eat!

362
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,600
The glory of the faith!

363
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,680
The glory and communion of food!

364
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,920
The mighty hot dog!

365
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,840
The gigantic falafel stick!

366
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,020
The wonderful hummus and bread!

367
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,160
Oh friends, you could probably be saved by food,

368
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,000
or anything else that you eat,

369
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,740
but believe me now, just one time,

370
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,820
I can only heal your bodies!

371
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,140
Faith and hope and charity,

372
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,460
and simple relativity,

373
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,420
they can make you understand,

374
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
All you gotta do is pray,

375
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,120
All you gotta do is take his hand,

376
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,640
Remember what someone said,

377
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,080
Ask the man in front of you,

378
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,420
He'll never have to leave,

379
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,580
All you gotta do is believe in God!

380
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,680
The Faith in I!

381
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:23,600
The Faith in I!

382
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:31,980
Oh friends, can I put my hands on you?

383
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,980
Strang is a man of supernatural power!

384
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,560
His eyes can see a thousand miles!

385
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,020
Truly a mystic guru genie man

386
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,120
He can see your future

387
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,660
He can see your past

388
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,960
And if you bend over

389
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,580
He can see your up

390
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,420
Oh, he's got everything he needs

391
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,420
To heal or sicken you

392
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,160
Trust the man inside your head

393
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,500
Oh, friends, we want to put our hands on you

394
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,820
We'd like to get down in there

395
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,220
And grope every one of you

396
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,600
Just put our hands all over you

397
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,540
But we just can't do that

398
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,360
But we will someday

399
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,740
Can I put my hands on you?

400
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,720
Can I put my hands on you?

401
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,640
Can I put my hands on you?

402
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,200
Can I put my hands on you?

403
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,460
Can I put my hands on you?

404
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,040
Can I put my hands on you?

405
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

406
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,080
Whoo!

407
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,840
Reverend Ivan Stang, ladies and gentlemen.

408
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,400
I'm Sly Secret Orchard.

409
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,320
Ladies and gentlemen.

410
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,160
Oh, friends, oh, we would like to put our hands

411
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,480
all over every one of you.

412
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,140
Look at this.

413
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,640
According to a Reuters wire service report in August,

414
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,260
lobbyists in Bonn, Germany,

415
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,220
called the Working Group for the Unemployed

416
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,200
held a series of rallies to demand

417
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,120
six weeks annual paid vacation

418
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,360
for people out of work.

419
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,500
Pointing out that those looking for work

420
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,520
often are under greater stress than those with jobs

421
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,440
and thus need a longer holiday.

422
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,640
Praise those unemployed workers of Germany

423
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,400
demanding a longer vacation.

424
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,560
Friends, that is subgeniusness in action.

425
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:42,980
Whoo!

426
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,400
They give you a half an inch and you take 40 miles.

427
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:51,820
Now, this kind of thing can go on a little bit too.

428
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,320
It can get too intense.

429
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,340
In August, a couple from Silver Springs, Maryland,

430
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,160
were arrested for indecent exposure

431
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,700
at an adult cinema in Baltimore

432
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,800
after the husband had arranged for four men

433
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,480
to have sex with his wife on the premises

434
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,620
of this adult theater.

435
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,160
According to the police, several other males

436
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,820
in the theater complained, apparently,

437
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:27,220
because the live sex interfered with their enjoyment

438
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,920
of the sex on the screen.

439
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,040
Friends, I guess you could say there is perhaps

440
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,120
such a thing as too much slack.

441
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,600
I mean, did those guys actually stop and think?

442
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,040
Did they really want the live sex to stop?

443
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,620
So, you know, friends, as they said in Clockwork Art,

444
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,940
the colors of the real world are never so really real

445
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,800
as when you video them on the screen, you know?

446
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,480
And, um, friends, you know, that causes a thing like,

447
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,840
when you read about a thing like that,

448
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,640
you have to ask yourself, what is slack?

449
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,020
Howdy, boys and girls.

450
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,220
I'm Mr. Frolic.

451
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,720
Let's see what's in our mailbag.

452
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,840
Why, it's a shrunken head!

453
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,980
I'm back in institution.

454
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,640
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

455
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,440
Does that mean they're going to keep you in there?

456
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,620
No, I have to stay in a little bit longer.

457
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,180
I don't like thinking about it.

458
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,480
Is that the kind of place, like the show in the movies,

459
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,380
where they hose you?

460
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,740
Just when you're, about once a week,

461
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,420
they put you in a big tank and hose you down with fire hoses?

462
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:39,960
Yeah.

463
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,800
To clean you?

464
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,720
Yeah, they get, that sound goes off, the eh, eh, eh, eh,

465
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,740
and all them guys in them suits come in.

466
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,280
And then after that, then they just, you know,

467
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,040
they come in with them suits and them big thermal things there

468
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,520
and stuff like start poking you.

469
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,620
It feels real hot.

470
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,420
And then you got to get, all get hurried in another room.

471
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,700
Then they just turn the hoses on us and it's not very quick.

472
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,920
You're still staying there now?

473
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,440
Yeah, I can't, I told you, man, I'm in here.

474
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,260
I had a little problem before.

475
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,740
Got into an argument in the bar.

476
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,200
And they said, you know, you're going back here for a while.

477
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,000
And I said, well, what's a while?

478
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,940
And they said, until your attitude changes and you can talk to Vinsky.

479
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,320
Dr. Vinsky about it.

480
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,240
And Dr. Vinsky ain't helping me.

481
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,000
And Dr. Psychopath Finder obviously didn't help me none

482
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,320
or else it wouldn't be in this problem.

483
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,560
And, you know, it's just getting worse.

484
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,480
I don't have to worry about claustrophobia anymore, Dr. Trophobia,

485
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,800
because he's on vacation.

486
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,700
There's people around here, you just wouldn't believe the things they can do

487
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,820
to the human body, the kind of pain they can inflict.

488
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,680
I don't care who I'm talking to on the radio.

489
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,280
I'm talking to you on the radio.

490
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:47,880
I'm talking to you on the phone, you know.

491
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,740
Well, you know, I'm surprised that they let you talk.

492
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,380
Are you sure that you're talking on the phone and not just hooked up to a machine

493
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,040
imagining that you're talking to on the radio?

494
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,440
How the hell would I know right now?

495
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,180
You know, I don't practically repeat my damn brain, Jim.

496
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,680
You know, all I want to do is watch the hearings and stuff.

497
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,940
And then they all come in here, you know, and they start staking me and threw me.

498
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,100
That's okay, man.

499
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,900
I don't blame you.

500
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,400
I mean, all your friends are in the hearing.

501
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,520
It looks like a phone to me.

502
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:14,700
I don't know.

503
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,640
The hearings are about your friends.

504
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,800
And I'm sure that it bothers you.

505
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,760
How does it feel?

506
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,420
How does that make you feel, Dave?

507
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,220
Well, I don't know.

508
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,600
That's a rather difficult question to answer.

509
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,580
You don't mind talking about it, do you, Dave?

510
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,420
Oh, not at all.

511
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,180
People, where are you going?

512
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,520
People, what do you say?

513
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,420
Do you keep falling into little fat lumps of clay?

514
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,300
The TV.

515
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,360
The TV is calling.

516
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,640
Please don't go away.

517
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,520
The children are bawling.

518
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,760
But you can't go out and play.

519
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,880
There's only one sin handed down from above.

520
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:14,680
People dying in guilt's death, living in love, in love, in love, in love.

521
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,620
All of the people, please don't go away.

522
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


523
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


524
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


525
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


526
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


527
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:15,620


528
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:25,560
People, where are you going on each Sunday morn?

529
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,460
While you play to your monster, the kids are watching porn

530
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:35,420
Do they really see beyond those crowns of thorns?

531
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:40,240
The mall after buildings where my brother was born

532
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,500
There's only one sin that I do not know of

533
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:55,020
People dying and killed instead of living in love

534
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,600
In love

535
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,900
In love

536
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,360
In love

537
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,780
In love

538
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,800
In love

539
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:37,500
This is Chaz Smith, Einstein's Secret Orchestra

540
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,820
This is Chaz Smith, Einstein's Secret Orchestra

541
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,220
And there is a werewolf

542
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,980
There's only one sin.

543
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,720
Aaaaaah.

544
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,480
Aaaaaah.

545
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,820
Aaaaaah.

546
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,200
Aaaaaah.

547
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,780
Yes, love is the sin.

548
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,320
Yes, love is the sin.

549
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,120
I guess that means, man, it's probably

550
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,640
extra fun to do it then,

551
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,000
huh?

552
00:28:59,720 --> 00:28:59,720


553
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,560
Extra fun to do it then, huh?

554
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,020
Yeah.

555
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,660
Yeah.

556
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,180
Yeah.

557
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,320
This

558
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,840
is love.

559
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,320
Now, Bob,

560
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,080
there is a man who, uh,

561
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,320
who claims to be channeling God.

562
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,800
Uh, I can't recall what this man's

563
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,480
name is. No, no, no, no.

564
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,360
Uh, he's a secular

565
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,660
guy, and he's got books out, and he claims

566
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,840
to be channeling God.

567
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,080
And I kind of wonder,

568
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,260
um, I know, yeah, the guy,

569
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,200
Van Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,

570
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,520
Bob, my, my, my,

571
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,780
but you do have a soft,

572
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,520
delicate throat.

573
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,340
A candy-colored clown

574
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,980
they call the Sandman

575
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,380
tiptoes to my room

576
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,600
every night

577
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,660
and just as sprinkles stardust

578
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,440
and to whisper

579
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,420
go to sleep

580
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,240
everything is

581
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:55,880
alright.

582
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,380
Cities of the world woke up today to

583
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,220
potential tragedy in outer space.

584
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,760
The vehicle has exploded.

585
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,540
I've just picked up a fault in the

586
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,060
drive unit.

587
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,620
It's going to go 100%

588
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,700
failure within 72 hours.

589
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,940
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,

590
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,600
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,

591
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,160
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,

592
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,000
Bob, Bob, Bob,

593
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:22,440
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,

594
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:22,440


595
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,880
So you feel that you have some conflicts

596
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,480
regarding religion that need to be resolved.

597
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,460
Would you like to

598
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,720
discuss those, Dave?

599
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,980
Yeah, I think that...

600
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,840
How does that make you feel, Dave?

601
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,500
Well, the first experiment they did

602
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,400
was what did it all wrong

603
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,500
to me, trying to teach me God

604
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,620
that way. You know, that ain't right.

605
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,300
Sticking them things up different

606
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,680
places in me, you know, and then making

607
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,620
me pray all these different prayers. I don't know what the hell

608
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,720
they was even talking about.

609
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,560
I'm sorry to hear that, Dave. Tell me more.

610
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,700
Well, the first

611
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,340
they started to implant these little

612
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,260
religious devices, these little

613
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,780
things in my body, crucifixes,

614
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,520
little Madonna's and different

615
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,460
little things like that. There's no bigger than a thumbnail.

616
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,000
Some of them are so small, you know.

617
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,240
So what do you feel about little

618
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,660
Madonna's, Dave?

619
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,420
Well, when they're dancing around my head in my

620
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,400
pig sleep, I don't mind, but when I'm

621
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,420
fully awake and alert and maybe being

622
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,400
prodded around with those big hot thermal

623
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,560
sticks, then that's a whole

624
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,620
different can of tuna.

625
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,920
I hear what you are saying, Dave.

626
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,760
How does that make you feel?

627
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,440
It makes me sad.

628
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,620
It makes me happy. It makes me

629
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,380
filled with kind of a preternatural

630
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,080
delight. I can't explain because I'm

631
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,280
vibrating the whole time. You know what I

632
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:37,420
mean?

633
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,620
I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave.

634
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,200
Ow! Ow! Ow!

635
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,040
Did I screw up some place

636
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,640
along the line to cause this all to happen?

637
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,000
I mean, you have to bring home some evidence saying,

638
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,020
hey folks, it wasn't my fault.

639
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,120
Take a look at this picture.

640
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,260
Something happened back there and I wasn't back there.

641
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,620
Any penetration

642
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,660
penetration of

643
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,720
penetration of the heat shield would have

644
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:09,200
possibly allowed a heat leak plasma leak and eventually a burn through during the process

645
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,920
of entry that would be trippy huh as these are sitting there all these birds are flying around

646
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,460
let's put it this

647
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,460
children

648
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:29,740
children

649
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,240
into the

650
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,260
loves

651
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:49,740
you

652
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,500
god

653
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:00,600
Oh, Bob loves you.

654
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,820
And you love Bob.

655
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:15,820
And if you don't love Bob, you know what happens?

656
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,440
He'll kill you.

657
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,680
He'll Bob you out.

658
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:15,060
He'll Bob you out.

659
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,800
He'll Bob you out.

660
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:17,420
He'll Bob you out.

661
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:38,320
He'll Bob you out.

662
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:09,900
He'll Bob you out.

663
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,200
Drink the Kool-Aid.

664
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,460
Drink the Kool-Aid, children.

665
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:38,140
Doc Smith had a fellow who was working as a chemist at the National Bureau of Standards one afternoon.

666
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,100
Two days later, he had conquered the whole galaxy.

667
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:47,400
I was looking at my crystal ball and it just went completely blank.

668
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,300
I just inserted my crystal ball into the, uh,

669
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,860
into the end of my spaceship.

670
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,540
I didn't insert it.

671
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:59,480
Oh my God, you put the Dynasium's crystals into the hull already, Chaz.

672
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,780
We're there. We're there.

673
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,640
Oh my God, you put the Dynasium's crystals into the hull already?

674
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:09,520
Not only did they build a spaceship in their backyards and take off the next day,

675
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,900
but they didn't stop at the moon.

676
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,720
They were shipping their space.

677
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,120
They were shipping their space.

678
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,560
They were shipping their space.

679
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,340
They were shipping their space.

680
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,820
They were shipping their space.

681
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,320
They were shipping their space.

682
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,680
They were shipping their space.

683
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,480
They were shipping their space.

684
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,920
They were shipping their space.

685
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,340
They were shipping their space.

686
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,640
They were shipping their space.

687
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,060
They were shipping their space.

688
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,060


689
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,320


690
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,080
They were shipping their space.

691
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,780
They were shipping their space.

692
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,120
They were shipping their space.

693
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:33,480
They were shipping their space.

694
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:33,740
They were shipping their space.

695
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:33,740


696
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,220
They were shipping their space.

697
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,420
The first time you could do a kill

698
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,100
being the Reveal Space gentleman?

699
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:38,920
A Sage.

700
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,440
A Sage.

701
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,940
I wanna go.

702
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,680
I wanna go.

703
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,180
New York, old Raja.

704
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,280
New York, old Raja.

705
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,260
New York, old Raja.

706
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,040
Now, what do you call it?

707
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:29,160
What would be the equivalent insult for Greys to the term Tom or Apple?

708
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,180
Tom.

709
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,860
What would you call a Grey who is like a human lover?

710
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,320
Yeah, come on.

711
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:41,820
What would you call a Grey who just, you know, he was, he kind of forsook his Grey heritage

712
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,420
and was a human lover?

713
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:43,900
A human mimicker.

714
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:44,540
Primophile.

715
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,400
Yeah.

716
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,580
Primophile.

717
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,660
That's delicious.

718
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,940
That's a good one.

719
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:50,880
Homophile.

720
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,180
And it's kind of, yeah.

721
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,480
Well, that sounds like something they already got down here.

722
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,860
Yeah, no, I like primophile.

723
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,020
It's kind of poetic.

724
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:58,960
Primophile.

725
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:03,520
Yeah, but you wonder if it has to do with firstness or primacy.

726
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,460
That's the axis that made it.

727
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,720
Number 1797.

728
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,340
Yes, my queen.

729
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,420
You have been found guilty of primophilia.

730
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,900
I cannot resist the lures of the humans.

731
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:21,140
Well, then they would also be attracted to monkeys if they had real primophilia.

732
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:30,300
Cast, cast Grey number 4005 into the mulch pit and paint him on the stomachs of the other

733
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,000
worthy Greys.

734
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,920
Hey, is there someone there?

735
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,300
Yeah, we're going to paint you with maglev paint, buddy.

736
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,360
Hello?

737
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,040
Hello?

738
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,460
I'm a necropedophile.

739
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,260
Oh, that's old.

740
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,560
When everybody slugs his feet, his feet are dead.

741
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,100
Oh, that's old.

742
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,100


743
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:43,420
Oh, that's old.

744
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,000
Oh, that's old.

745
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,760
The two nuclear superpowers and their leaders stood eyeball to eyeball.

746
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:54,080
A sickly, frenzied passion for that wasting form began to obsess me.

747
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,360
No, no, no, no.

748
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,600
No, no, no, no.

749
00:39:59,700 --> 00:39:59,700


750
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,240
No, no, no, no.

751
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,520
No, no, no, no.

752
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:01,840


753
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,000
No, no, no, no.

754
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,060


755
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,060


756
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,120
No, no, no, no.

757
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,300
I've broken through the wall of inertia and reached my goal.

758
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:51,240
The challenge is to bring up a bright sprout from this dry, parched ground.

759
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:51,940
Yes.

760
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,880
Deep inside.

761
00:40:54,020 --> 00:41:02,900
To launch a great seed up into space and carry our kind out into the galactic brotherhood

762
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:07,140
where we'll probably end up being the shoeshine boys of the galactics.

763
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,040
I would not be so sure.

764
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,700
For the first few million years.

765
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,240
No, I don't think we will be lower than when we arrived there.

766
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,620
I think that we are.

767
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:21,480
Yeah, you think the galactics are going to roll the red carpet out for a bunch of monkeys

768
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,520
that just fell out of the tree by galactic standards.

769
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,360
Who don't even have a patron.

770
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,220
Yeah, that's true.

771
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:32,880
All the time.

772
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,320
By ourselves.

773
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,700
Here, just us.

774
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,220
Earth, Earth, Earthers.

775
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,040
Damn two biped monkey face boys.

776
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,180
An atomic bomb.

777
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,000
The most powerful explosive yet developed.

778
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,780
We have the technology.

779
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,780
We have the technology.

780
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,000
We have the technology.

781
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,660
We have the technology.

782
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,240
Sometimes it feels like a night.

783
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,060
We had visited a very alien and very hostile and lifeless planet.

784
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:11,000
And we saw the Earth as the only home that we know of within our near space capable of supporting life.

785
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:18,560
And we recognize the absolute necessity to protect and nurture and take care of this environment.

786
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,720
An invisible being that cannot be disintegrated by atomic fission.

787
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,480
Oh Skipper, that is a scientific impossibility.

788
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,780
There it goes.

789
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,040
There it goes.

790
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,160
Oh, that's the last of that.

791
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,120
The purging last of the bad blood of Bob out of our bowels.

792
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,900
And wasn't that invigorating?

793
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,740
The blabbering bladders of the bad Bob blood.

794
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:48,720
It's the ink or the biolog-

795
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,060
I can breathe again.

796
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,920
I had arrived here by my own choosing and I had no intention of ever going back.

797
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,160
I was going through.

798
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,300
Look, the blasts are increasing.

799
00:42:59,480 --> 00:42:59,920
Doctor, look.

800
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,420
The color of the blasts.

801
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,400
Oh dear God.

802
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,180
What?

803
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:03,580
What?

804
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,940
Doctor, it's nitrogen, isn't it?

805
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:05,740
Nitrogen?

806
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,040
What?

807
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:06,620
The fools.

808
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,600
The everlasting fools, I warn you.

809
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,280
The blasts.

810
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:09,920
More and more.

811
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,440
They started something they couldn't end.

812
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,420
The color of the blasts.

813
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,760
They've set off hydrogen atoms.

814
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,180
I don't know what-

815
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,780
We used uranium, plutonium, and when the initial blast was over, that was all.

816
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,560
But hydrogen, that's part of life.

817
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,480
One reaction sets off the other like setting off an endless chain until-

818
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,580
Look down there.

819
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:28,560
Blast.

820
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,160
Faster and faster.

821
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,360
They're spreading.

822
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,040
The fools.

823
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,680
God help the fools.

824
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,740
The sheet of flame.

825
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,820
Around the Earth.

826
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,460
Doctor, tell me, what is it?

827
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,500
It burned up all the atmosphere.

828
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,620
Burned up?

829
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,420
Reynolds, what does he mean?

830
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,780
The chain reaction burned up all the air.

831
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,260
Now, throughout my relationship with God,

832
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,560
I have tried different methods of sex.

833
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,200
You can have sex with God, and it's okay just as long as you wear a condom.

834
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,760
Those are the aliens that are hiding in plain view.

835
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,260
I mean, they're right out in front of us.

836
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,040
You never actually saw one of them, though.

837
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,060
They had a real face, right?

838
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,660
Well, how would I know?

839
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,240
I mean, we all might have-

840
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,200
They might be around us all the time, and we wouldn't know.

841
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:28,240
Yeah, but you made it sound as if you had heard or had some touch to come on me and-

842
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,580
But you know what's going on, where it's basically saying that they knew what they described their face to you.

843
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,160
And you say it was horrific, like was Gorgonzola in Pegasus and that?

844
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,000
Yeah, exactly.

845
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,140
They were hideous like Gorgonzola, like that thing that drips off of his face.

846
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:41,780
Yeah.

847
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,260
When he gets all worked up.

848
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:48,300
And that's why Medusa had to hang a shield up there,

849
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,360
so he could look at it and say, check this out, man.

850
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,280
You need to say it, you know?

851
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:51,940
Right.

852
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:57,300
It was like Medusa had the super power of turning people to stone,

853
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:02,960
but gorgonzola had that smell that could even kill medusa well that's what you were saying

854
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:08,720
if the cash wanted to be actually decomposed in space he would have to transfer them smells into

855
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,640
the chambers where they make them into different tones whatever they are like if you're playing

856
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:19,480
illuminati new world order on some secret orchestra and you use the plug-in the gorgonzola

857
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:26,080
plug-in you can like if you get that when it's infected that will take your opponent's uh

858
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:33,080
uh chain or device or like him or lonesome cowboy dave or whatever and you know then you can convert

859
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,980
you could you get their powers yeah but if you start double clicking on them things come up i

860
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:45,400
heard that whole civilization disappeared this is dr q ellis here coming to you live from friendly

866
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:26,020
bitter end taped news has been gathered from the conspiracy media's battle

867
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:31,720
all the Bengaliツer news will be back on this gio SRLED 5 squadrabs

868
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,360
meeting where teams in western american market

869
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:35,700
will tell their friends or 식

870
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:00,480
Fatal error. Stack collapse. Memory overlap. 738.

871
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,160
Alright, this one's shot. Activate remote destruct sequence, just in case.

872
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:12,660
Well, somebody was thinking of it. Where else are we going to come up there?

873
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:19,040
Oh, they're all... Well, I mean, as soon as one person thinks of it, then a hundred monkeys are going to start doing it.

874
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:19,880
That won't take long.

875
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,840
If that hundred... If that first monkey ran off the edge of the cliff, would all your hundred monkeys go following it?

876
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:32,200
Definitely. They see one monkey watching their fish in the water, and next thing you know, ten years later, everybody's watching their fish in the water, and they all jump in.

877
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:36,580
They all stand up like lemmings, or like the hundred lemmings.

878
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,280
The hundred and twelve hundred monkeys?

879
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:42,020
The twelve hundred monkeys.

880
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:50,600
Cold, persistent fingers swarmed over my body, tugging at me and sucking me away from the machine.

881
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,140
I held tight to Wiener as a man holds fast to life.

882
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,760
I kicked them away with my feet.

883
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,760
Hurry, Dudley, hurry!

884
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,220
Get these levers quickly, or we're done!

885
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,880
One more turn, and it's...

886
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,740
You touch me, I'll throw the switch.

887
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:15,700
The truth about real sex with God, and that...

888
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:21,420
That will help me gain victory over the power of lust in my life.

889
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:24,000
I mean, you could have the most perverse thought in the world.

890
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:25,160
Pass through your mind.

891
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,680
Perhaps you've tried some of those.

892
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:33,060
Invite that thought into your life, and sit down and have a cup of coffee with it.

893
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,620
Cut a snow down, you're moving too fast.

894
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:41,420
You got a man of morning distance.

895
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,700
Kicking around the cobblestone.

896
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,700
Look for fun and feeling great.

897
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,120
You got a man of morning distance.

898
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,620
Look for fun and feeling groovy.

899
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,160
Got nerve teats that do no promises to keep.

900
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,920
Dabbled in a drowsiness, ready for sleep.

901
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:12,040
Love at the moment, it's in drive-by, with space on the beat.

902
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:16,000
Life of love, you always groovy.

903
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:23,660
La-da-da-da-da-da-da, feeling groovy.

904
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,180
Hello, lamppost, what you knowin'?

905
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:35,140
I've come to watch your flowers growin'

906
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:38,580
Ain't you got no rhymes for me?

907
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:42,780
Do, do, do, feelin' groovy

908
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,540
Feelin' groovy

909
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:54,380
Feelin' groovy

910
00:49:54,380 --> 00:50:06,840
Feelin' groovy

911
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,380
Feelin' groovy

912
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,100
I'm feelin'

913
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,080
groovy

914
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:24,480
God is in his holy temple

915
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,840
Earthly thoughts be silent now

916
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,140
Oh, um, oh, oh, background music.

917
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,160
Dear friends, that was of course Chaz Smith.

918
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:40,180
A lot of Einstein's Secret Orchestra going on tonight.

919
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,440
Chaz actually edited this show.

920
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:42,760
You might have heard of it.

921
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:46,360
You might say most of what was, has been played was, uh...

922
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,240
What?

923
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,800
Every man needs about three.

924
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,740
One to make babies with.

925
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:54,300
One to groove with.

926
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,740
What the hell?

927
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,760
One to chase after.

928
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,340
How about a couple of honest-to-goodness virgins?

929
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,200
Send me about a dozen assorted variety.

930
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,640
How about me for starters?

931
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:06,860
What the hell is this?

932
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,980
What did your mama say?

933
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:12,580
She used to make me take piano lessons from this groovy young guy.

934
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,940
We used to sit just pressing our thighs together.

935
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:23,100
Well, one week we were practicing, and all of a sudden his hand went up my skirt.

936
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,660
Hey, hey, hey, enough of that, kids.

937
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:30,640
Oh, that's, uh, F-Friday Jones.

938
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:31,380
Figures.

939
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,600
Yeah, Friday Jones figures.

940
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,120
She has some good figures.

941
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,260
Anyway, I thought I was putting in...

942
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:39,800
That.

943
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,440
That's what I thought I was putting in.

944
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,720
Uh, but I put in Friday.

945
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,560
Yes, her little Russ Meyer type there.

946
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,200
I haven't really listened to that yet.

947
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,880
Well, now we know what's on there.

948
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,800
Russ Meyer movie soundtracks.

949
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,360
That's some pretty groovy stuff, man.

950
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:01,440
And, uh, you're listening to the Groovy Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, uh,

951
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:08,180
tonight's show, uh, and last, like last week's, all done at the same time, mostly by Chaz.

952
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,780
Uh, uh, the kind of thing.

953
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,720
Chaz Smith.

954
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,200
Not the man heard playing in the background.

955
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,120
Uh, that's the Hell Pope Huey.

956
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,680
He's the Hell Pope, and I'm the Sacred Scribe.

957
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:21,300
But Chaz is the cantor, and he, he can indeed, and he did.

958
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:28,900
Uh, we also heard Bill T. Miller's, uh, song, You Rang, uh, very early in the show.

959
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,520
Uh, that's, uh, Kings of Feedback, Bill T. Miller.

960
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:36,920
And, of course, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, who is part of Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

961
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,760
but he was doing kind of a live, uh, audience show.

962
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:44,100
And, uh, I heard the audience thing, uh, from the Euclid Tavern Devival November 8th,

963
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:48,480
not very long ago, recorded by myself on the donated, uh, deck.

964
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,880
And, uh, boy, this music makes me talk fast.

965
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:57,600
Uh, everything else on there was from Chaz's volume 10, uh, mix, edit, uh, of, uh, stuff.

966
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:06,720
Uh, that we do on the radio, on his radio show, ESO Radio, which you can hear, um, on

967
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,560
the internet no matter where you are, friends.

968
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:15,500
They're out of WCSB in Cleveland, but on the internet, if you go to this address,

969
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:24,620
hurl yourself to this URL, uh, www.wcsb.org.

970
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,500
That's wcsb.org.

971
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:37,840
And, uh, on Sunday, on Thursday nights, 11 o'clock, uh, Eastern Time,

972
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,540
you can find me.

973
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:44,260
You can hear that radio show on the audioactive, uh, internet, uh, thing.

974
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,320
And you can call in.

975
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,240
You can be on the show.

976
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,940
And then you'd be on this show.

977
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:54,020
It's like you call in to Chaz's show, and Chaz sends me the, and we do a thing, a worshipful,

978
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,780
you know, subgenius religious thing.

979
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,700
And then Chaz sends me the tape, or he edits together one of these type things.

980
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:04,040
And then suddenly you're a big, you know, big highly paid star, just like all the rest of us.

981
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,160
So, so, such a great job.

982
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,180
And, oh, gosh.

983
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,560
Uh, yeah.

984
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,480
.

985
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,360
.

986
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:18,360


987
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:18,360


988
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,080
.

989
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:19,340
.

990
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:19,340


991
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:19,360
.

992
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:19,400
.

993
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:19,580
.

994
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:19,760
.

995
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,660
.

996
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,700
.

997
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:29,700


998
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,300
.

999
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,380
.

1000
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,420
.

1001
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:47,540
.

1002
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,180
.

1003
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:53,900
The color of the dream I had not too long ago

1004
00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:03,960
Misty blue and lilac too, never to grow old

1005
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:11,760
There you were under the tree of sun

1006
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,240
Screaming so peacefully

1007
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,500
In your hand a flower plays

1008
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,540
Waiting there for me

1009
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:39,680
I have never laid eyes on you

1010
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,280
Not before

1011
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:45,020
This timeless day

1012
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,200
But you woke and you

1013
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,520
You smiled my name

1014
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,320
And you stole my heart away

1015
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,100
You stole my heart away

1016
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,480
And you left the girl

1017
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,280
Yeah, alright

1018
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,080
Girl

1019
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,880
Girl, come here

1020
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,360
Give me that dream

1021
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,160
Golden rose, the color of the dream I had

1022
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,880
Not too long ago

1023
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,560
Misty blue and lilac too

1024
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:44,980
Never to grow old

1025
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:52,920
Golden rose, the color of the dream I had

1026
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,640
Misty blue and lilac too

1027
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:02,740
Golden rose, the color of the dream I had

1028
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,360
Misty blue and lilac too

1029
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:12,260
Golden rose, golden rose

1030
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:18,380
Golden rose, golden rose

1031
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,840
It's only a dream

1032
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:29,740
it's only a dream

1033
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,000
I would like to tell someone around the street

1034
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,020
if the sky was filled with flowers and stars

1035
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,640
while the sun kissed the mountains blue

1036
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:49,700
There's twelve moons playing across the rainbow

1037
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,640
About me and you

1038
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,000
Golden road

1039
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,400
Golden road

1040
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,860
Got another man in the war

1041
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,900
That's the end of the show

1042
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:23,280
Alright, now close your eyes

1043
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,660
Take a deep breath

1044
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,080
And then

1045
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,700
You have seen

1046
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:38,660
You are slowly

1047
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,300
Sinking

1048
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,700
If any outside thoughts

1049
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,140
Should come into your mind

1050
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:04,100
Simply brush them aside

1051
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,540
And I want to begin

1052
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,900
By having you focus your attention

1053
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,340
Upon the psychic center of your body

1054
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,680
And I want to begin

1055
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,620
None of what you see is real

1056
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,700
It's all a dream

1057
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:45,220
Out of band experience

1058
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,540
Bill T. Miller

1059
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:52,920
His album

1060
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,680
Drum Army
