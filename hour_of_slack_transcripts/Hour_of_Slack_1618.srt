00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,520
ðŸŽµ Everyone needs a strained jacket, pull it tight, let's all slack it! ðŸŽµ

4
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:10,340
ðŸŽµ Everyone needs a strained jacket, pull it tight, let's all slack it! ðŸŽµ

ðŸŽµ Everything is just as it seems, someone else is choosing the teams ðŸŽµ

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,700
ðŸŽµ Are you part of the great machine? Wake up and find you're not in your dreams ðŸŽµ

11
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,980
ðŸŽµ We don't have no time for that! ðŸŽµ

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,400
ðŸŽµ All we want is an hour of slack! ðŸŽµ

13
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,660
ðŸŽµ Do you know where it's at? ðŸŽµ

14
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,100
ðŸŽµ All you need is an hour of slack! ðŸŽµ

15
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,820
ðŸŽµ Everyone needs a strained jacket, pull it tight, let's all slack it! ðŸŽµ

16
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,580
ðŸŽµ Everyone needs a strained jacket, hold on tight, let's all slack it! ðŸŽµ

17
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,040
ðŸŽµ Slack it! ðŸŽµ

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,600
ðŸŽµ

00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,620
ðŸŽµ

23
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,420
Everyone's reaching out, no one is connecting

24
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,520
Does it really matter who we are electing?

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,840
We're laughing at the circus, and the clown stole the car

26
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,140
There's more than enough to jerk us, round and round and there you are

27
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,060
Everyone needs a straitjacket, pull it tight, let's all slack it

28
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,700
Everyone needs a straitjacket, hold on tight, let's all slack it

29
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,680
Let's all slack it

30
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,680
Let's all slack it

31
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,520
Let's all slack it

32
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,680
Let's all slack it

33
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:13,580
Let's all slack it

34
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:58,300
Let's all slack it

35
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,300
Let's all slack it

36
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:36,260
Let's all slack it

37
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:59,440
Let's all slack it

38
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,000
Let's all slack it

39
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:38,820
Let's all slack it

40
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,640
Let's all slack it

41
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:40,660
Let's all slack it

42
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:29,180
Let's all slack it

43
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,680
Let's all slack it

44
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,000
Let's all slack it

45
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:54,540
Let's all slack it

46
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,060
Let's all slack it

47
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:11,320
Let's all slack it

48
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,560
Let's all slack it

49
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,280
Let's all slack it

50
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,280


51
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,280


52
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah

53
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,660
Who the hell said that?

54
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,940
And it says, lonesome cowboy Dave, also known as Dave DeLuca, has been spouting on syndicated

55
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:42,340
subgenius radio for 20 years, and yes, he writes like he talks, only better!

56
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,320
Jeez, oh man!

57
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,880
Then there's a little thing that says you can download all of the hours of slack at

58
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,480
subgenius.com, which is true.

59
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,740
That is so beautiful, compadre.

60
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:12,960
I don't know what to say to remind you that when I did not know that your wife and sister and my beloved mother of your sister and wife were into my town on Tuesday, I believe it was.

61
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:20,460
I did not mean to say, for instance, that I knew your mother before I knew her.

62
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,480
Hey, let's start reading.

63
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,400
Let's just read Dave's book on the air.

64
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,280
We'll do it in sections.

65
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,420
Every show will read one paragraph.

66
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,220
Yeah, like in Bulgarian or something.

67
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:40,760
No, I'm going to read the first paragraph, which is called, it's weirder than the title of the chapter is.

68
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,820
It's weirder than you think.

69
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:51,220
And Dave, I don't know if you know this, but your curly quote at the end of that chapter title is turned the wrong way.

70
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,080
So it is weirder than you think.

71
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:54,620
Yeah.

72
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,240
It's turned the wrong way inside.

73
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,900
Meaning, you mean a left punctuation on the outside?

74
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,320
No, you'll see.

75
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,860
No, it's a fancy trick you did.

76
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,280
Yeah, it's a fancy trick you did.

77
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:14,900
You put open quotes at the end of the thing, at the end of the line, which makes it weirder than you think.

78
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,720
Extra, extra weird.

79
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,840
You look at the sentence.

80
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,640
Oh, there's no closed quote at the very end?

81
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,460
Right.

82
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,500
It has curly quotes, you know, not just straight up and down.

83
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,660
So there's an open quote and a closed quote.

84
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,620
They're shaped different.

85
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:32,260
And the open quote is shaped like a little shovel, two shovels side by side.

86
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:38,780
And normally the closed quotes would be shaped more like musical notes, side by side.

87
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,320
Right, or like 6-6 and the closed ones are like 9-9.

88
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:41,740
Right.

89
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,580
But this one has the 6-6 at both ends.

90
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,960
So it says it's weirder than you think.

91
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,120
And there's something weird about the way.

92
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,620
The way the type setting is.

93
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,720
Well, yes, there is.

94
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,400
And I wondered, Dave, did you do that on purpose?

95
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,820
Because if you did, it was brilliant.

96
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,800
And if you didn't, you should have.

97
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,020
It was so brilliant.

98
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,560
You should have done it on purpose.

99
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,980
But it's the only place that there is with those two different types of quote signatures, right?

100
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,320
That's right.

101
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,800
The very first one.

102
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,600
All the rest of them were consistent.

103
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,780
We're going to have to kill it.

104
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,180
Like an aborted sneaker.

105
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:24,920
Anyway.

106
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,060
Here's how the book starts.

107
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,260
Outside, it was twilight.

108
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,860
Evening stars glimmered in the late autumn sky.

109
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,080
Black clouds poured across the red horizon like puffs of smoke.

110
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,120
And wind howled through the empty glide paths.

111
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,800
It was a beautiful sunset.

112
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,200
But nobody in local 838 saw it.

113
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:52,760
838 neighbors never went outside to zoom the scene or do anything.

114
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,660
That's how it was.

115
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,060
It was in most of Neighbor World.

116
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,560
Doesn't that seem like the way it is right now?

117
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,920
How reclusive.

118
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,820
How reclusive.

119
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,580
You know, not like a spider.

120
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,580
More like a clamatoid or something.

121
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:16,740
Well, you know, it is said that the more time you spend on social media instead of doing things,

122
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,380
the more depressed you are.

123
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:24,640
Because you're reading all these people who don't, who are, who occasionally post about things they actually do.

124
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,480
Because they're not on social media all the time.

125
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,140
They're out in the world doing things.

126
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,200
Yeah, they're out doing things.

127
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,060
When they come back, they explain stuff they did.

128
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,060
And the ones who don't go out because they want to make sure and read everything on social media,

129
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,320
they just go, wow, all my friends are having such lives.

130
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,340
And I'm just sitting here on social media.

131
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,900
What a shame it is.

132
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:54,640
Well, turn off this show and go outside, you nincompoops.

133
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,780
No, not this show, Stan.

134
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,620
Not this show.

135
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,960
They're listening on their phones or their computers or something.

136
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,900
They're still in the Matrix.

137
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,620
This show is just a bunch of part of it.

138
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,320
Well, then that's a good way for them to learn from the show is to use the...

139
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,520
Now, somewhere, there's one poor jogger in Florida listening to the show on his iPod

140
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,340
while he jogs by an alligator-infested pond.

141
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,640
Or a fire-eared water...

142
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,900
And right while he's saying to himself, why not both?

143
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,300
I can be outside doing things and connected to the Matrix,

144
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,480
listening to the hour of...

145
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,820
Ah! This alligator's killing me! Ah!

146
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,360
See, in the neighbor world, an alligator would never kill you.

147
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,180
Well, it would, but you wouldn't really die physically.

148
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,920
He would think you had, and then you would physically die afterwards.

149
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,760
At least if you had...

150
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,620
You look!

151
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,520
This one would...

152
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,280
Boom!

153
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:53,960
Boom!

154
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:54,660


155
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,340
Whatever that means.

156
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,620
Well, it turns out Dave's a regular William Gibson.

157
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,340
Only William Gibson predicted all this stuff a long time before.

158
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,100
But Dave's a lot funnier than William Gibson.

159
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,460
Oh, yes.

160
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,400
Well, who's William Gibson? Is he like...

161
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,960
What's his name? Fort?

162
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,320
No, he's the one that proves that you didn't copy William Gibson

163
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,300
by the fact that you had to ask who he is.

164
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,640
He wrote books about cyber culture before it existed in real life.

165
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,640
Sort of.

166
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,320
And he wrote them on a typewriter.

167
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,080
Oh, I should know about him.

168
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,740
He wrote them on a manual typewriter.

169
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,520
Speaking of which, my daughter was asking for paper to write a note on,

170
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,720
and I said, oh, I've got a big ream of typewriter paper upstairs.

171
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,580
And she looked at her husband, and they looked at me, and they went,

172
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,980
it's not called typewriter paper anymore.

173
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,800
It's called copier paper now.

174
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,640
Printer paper.

175
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,100
Printer paper.

176
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,460
Oh, man.

177
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:53,560
Oh, man.

178
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,900
Old, old, old, old.

179
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,860
Dribble up and die, old man.

180
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,640
Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete.

181
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,040
Dave, you go into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and they have a little...

182
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,820
Oh, I'm there right now.

183
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,160
But I'm in an obsolete kind of mythology.

184
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:13,480
Actually, I am there in simulated andropomorphic time.

185
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,500
One of your bands?

186
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,240
Dave is broadcasting from the mall.

187
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,480
And, well, I can see the Maritime Museum.

188
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,280
Oh, man.

189
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:23,560
What is that?

190
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:23,840
Oh, my God.

191
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,480
There's a big lake steamer that carries iron ore and coal.

192
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,320
And then up the hill there by the Science Center,

193
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,760
who's named after Luigi M. Schwartz, who's a real person, man,

194
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,180
just because he disagreed with the status quo, whatever the hell that means.

195
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,180
Anyway, what I was going to say was in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,

196
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,780
there's a Hall of Technology.

197
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,240
And in the Hall of Technology,

198
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,440
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is a hall of technology,

199
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:53,440


200
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:53,440


201
00:18:53,460 --> 00:19:03,820
Hall of Fame. Only the stuff in the first 10 feet of it is mostly stuff that we owned because that's

202
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:11,600
how old we are. From the place to see Nero. Yeah, right after the wire recorders and before the iPods.

203
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:20,200
That's all the stuff that we had. Little reel-to-reel decks that had four-inch reels of quarter-inch

204
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:28,880
tape. Everything was in inches then, of course, instead of smegments like now. And little cassette

205
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,280
recorders that recorded on microcassettes. Remember those? They were the size of your little fingernail

206
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,660
and they made terrible, terrible recordings. Yeah, and they just split out and split out automatically.

207
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,340
You'd have them for one day and you might as well buy 25,000 of them and throw them out the window.

208
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,600
You know, they just go by so quickly.

209
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:56,400
So what I'm getting at, Dave, is we're old and that's why people will love Neighbor World.

210
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:04,480
It's like William Gibson's novel. It's a novel about, sort of about the internet by somebody

211
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:11,400
who's never on the internet. And therefore, far more paranoid about it than you could ever be.

212
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,400
And also, therefore, probably more likely to be right about where it's going.

213
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,140
That's what I...

214
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,580
Well, part of it is...

215
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:18,580


216
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:18,580


217
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:18,580


218
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,480
My statement.

219
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:31,120
Well, part of it was written before there was such a thing as an internet. And then after that, it was written all the way up to the height of the internet. So that doesn't really have anything to do with it.

220
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:37,960
Well, so what's funny about it is that we thought TV was bad. We thought TV would rot your brain.

221
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:48,500
Oh, no, TV would only rot your brain as many channels as there were. And there was a limited number of channels. The internet can rot your brain any way you want.

222
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:48,560


223
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:48,560


224
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,160
And you want it rotted.

225
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,160
Whatever rot you're addicted to, you can find it.

226
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:53,880
I don't think volition or choice has much to do with it. Do you?

227
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,500
Huh?

228
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,280
I don't think volition or choice has much to do with it. Do you?

229
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,900
Yeah, I do. I think people choose to be lazy.

230
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:17,180
Well, okay, you go channel 129 or something and that rots your brain a certain way. But then, with your self-grooming application there, which you've already decided is deceitful.

231
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,540
And it's had to be...

232
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:18,540


233
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:18,540


234
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:18,540


235
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:18,540


236
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,320
It's had to be put into different bargaining power.

237
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,420
See, you made me forget what I was talking about.

238
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,300
That's okay.

239
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,020
It's not my fault. I didn't do it.

240
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,960
I thought I...

241
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,040
You did. You did.

242
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,700
But I was following you, but now I forgot the beginning of the sentence.

243
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:44,620
I have a plan for how to stop the destruction of America.

244
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,840
But first, we have to stop the Russians.

245
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:55,300
We have to stop the Russians from their BBC and BBW propaganda barrage.

246
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:00,840
The fake news they're putting on the porno internet.

247
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,820
Let me explain.

248
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:13,300
We've been learning that the Russians, wisely, if you're the Russian government, has been meddling in our propaganda.

249
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,740
They've been taking our propaganda and turning it into theirs.

250
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:31,200
And, you know, they had a lot of hired people posting stuff on the internet designed to destabilize American society and keep Hillary from getting elected.

251
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:39,240
And maybe even, God, if their dream came true, get Donald Trump elected, which would make America look really stupid.

252
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,300
So, it worked.

253
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,340
And I have a theory that that's not all they've been doing on the internet.

254
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,460
It's just a foment discontent.

255
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,840
There's a lot of very, very angry racists out there, you may have noticed.

256
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:03,200
And I think that one of the things that's making them so racist and so angry is when they turn on their free internet pornography.

257
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,740
Now, Dave, you may not know about this.

258
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:11,040
I don't know how much free internet pornography you look at, but I check it out every now and then.

259
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,720
And there's a preponderance of images that...

260
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:28,340
I think, I'm beginning to think, are being put there by the Russians to upset the ignorant rednecks and increase racism in America.

261
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,520
I think there's more...

262
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,160
Gee, I wonder how something like that could work.

263
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:42,660
There's more BBC and BBW action on the internet than normal commerce on pornography would call for.

264
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,200
And I speak as an expert, just sociologically speaking.

265
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,760
It's not that I'm sitting around masturbating to pornography all day.

266
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,760
Princess Weekend knows that that's not possible.

267
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:01,240
But I definitely have noticed that the most common...

268
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:12,800
Probably about 50% of the imagery you see on something like RedTube, XHamster, or AlohaTube, that should keep you lads busy for a while,

269
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,940
is a long, dark...

270
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,800
dusky...

271
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,200
tube...

272
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:26,220
in a white, white, white, fat, red orifice.

273
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,160
And I think it's...

274
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:41,340
I think that preponderance is part of a Russian plot to make sad, loser rednecks more jealous and more racist.

275
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,880
And makes them hate women even more, too.

276
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,740
So it's not a misogyny?

277
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:46,820
No.

278
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,360
Having said that, let me explain that...

279
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,120
Say, I hate it when people call other people losers.

280
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,840
And I just call these rednecks losers.

281
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,500
Because they're racist.

282
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,060
Racism is the...

283
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,780
So, you're now the tube with some hatred.

284
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:10,580
Racism is a great... is the excuse that losers use for being losers.

285
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,200
And yet, here's the thing.

286
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,780
We're all losers.

287
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,840
Everybody dies.

288
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,400
Everybody dies.

289
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,920
So, you know, it's such a...

290
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:27,080
It's so tragic and sad that they think of themselves as being bigger losers than others,

291
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:36,180
just because some Russian is making them think that even the ugly girls would rather go out with a black guy than them.

292
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,000
There, I said it.

293
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,640
But that, I think, is the message that the Russian porno posters...

294
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,500
Mm-hmm.

295
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:54,780
...are generally the American lower income, lower education bracket, and generally bitter and unhappy, quote, losers, unquote.

296
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,600
Yeah, I think...

297
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,560
Because it makes things worse in America.

298
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,940
Yeah, I did share that thought with you.

299
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:00,960
You never...

300
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,740
It makes white people jealous of black people.

301
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,400
And I concur.

302
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,400
I see...

303
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,240
Nobody should be jealous of anybody else, but that's just people.

304
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,400
And I gotta admit, there's sometimes...

305
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,820
Sometimes I look at that stuff and go, I'm jealous of that guy.

306
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:23,340
For one thing, he's way better built than I could ever imagine.

307
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,660
But also, he's got that pretty girl there.

308
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,040
I knew it.

309
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,500
Is that fair?

310
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,720
It's like, what?

311
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,920
There's no such thing.

312
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,720
But that's what those poor, frustrated racists are thinking.

313
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,040
Right.

314
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,480
Fair is where you take your pig and hope you win a prize.

315
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,400
Well, what I can't understand...

316
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,220
It's so...

317
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,700
What I can't understand is, like, they'll wake up one morning in the vacuum tube, and

318
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,220
they'll be in one conditioning experiment, and then the next day, you see them at work

319
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,520
the next day, and they'll, you know, be, you know, well, you know about them, you know,

320
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,280
you know how they are, and you know...

321
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,520
Right.

322
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,780
Do I have to spell it out?

323
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,060
And what happened to this person in one day?

324
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,900
Is it because Trump was elected?

325
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:05,680
Right.

326
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,880
Or is it because of the huge subliminal devices that are being implanted in everyone's brains

327
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,200
by the Ruskies, just like in Clockwork Orange?

328
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,020
Why not both?

329
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:19,480
That's why we call each other DvoÅ™kis and Privyet Tovarisks and stuff like that,

330
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,420
and smegmas.

331
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:21,800
Yeah.

332
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,240
Well, we breathe the smegma.

333
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,060
That's the problem.

334
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,180
I don't know if we're...

335
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,840
There's that word smegma again.

336
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,920
Yeah, smegma breeders.

337
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,260
Yeah.

338
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,600
It's one of my favorite words.

339
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,720
I dream of alien smegma pie.

340
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,820
Now, that's a taste of life.

341
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:39,840
Oh, yeah.

342
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,400
I remember, Boatman.

343
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,780
Remember alien smegma pie?

344
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,000
When was the last time you ate alien smegma pie?

345
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,000


346
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,000


347
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,000


348
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,000


349
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,000


350
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,000


351
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,000


352
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,000


353
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,900
You had a great big old steaming bowl of alien smegma pie.

354
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,820
I have not in ages.

355
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,240
Well, that's not long enough.

356
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,380
Yep.

357
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,720
It is good.

358
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,140
Mighty, mighty good.

359
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:07,640
Hey, I'm going to mention some current events that won't be current when any of our listeners

360
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,920
hear this, because this is purely recorded live show.

361
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:19,300
It's tax time here at this time locus intersection.

362
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,820
Tax time.

363
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,860
And it's chigger time.

364
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,680
At this juncture.

365
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,700
At this juncture.

366
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:32,140
One day, I was outdoors all the time and I had no itches.

367
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:37,280
And then suddenly the day came when all the chiggers came to life.

368
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,440
All the new generation of chiggers were born.

369
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:49,520
And they hopped onto my socks and climbed up my pantaloons and got down in the warm places

370
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,920
under my socks and under my belt.

371
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:58,660
And they bit me and bit me in my belly button and my crack, in my ancules.

372
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,120
I left him peppered with little red itchy places that really, really itch.

373
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,580
Oh, do they itch.

374
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,460
Oh, do they itch.

375
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,900
It goes with tax time.

376
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,480
Yes.

377
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,440
It goes with taxes.

378
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,460
Chiggers and taxes.

379
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,380
That's my story.

380
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:17,320
Neither of which you can live without dying because there's nothing quite so certain as

381
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,340
chiggers and taxes and monopoly gains.

382
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:21,680
And Bob.

383
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,460
And taxes and Bob and chiggers.

384
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:33,020
Did you hear our local politician in the Cleveland area, Dennis Kucinich, talking about the so-called

385
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,020
sarin gas attack in the Syrian village?

386
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,160
He came right out and said he thinks it's a...

387
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,460
He's a...

388
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,740
It's a bunch of hooey.

389
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,240
But anyways, that Stang was...

390
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:42,980
Or not Stang.

391
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:43,920
I'm sorry.

392
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,480
What's his name again?

393
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:45,840
Trump.

394
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:45,940
Oh, Trump.

395
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,280
Same difference.

396
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,140
Same difference.

397
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,660
He's a loud mouth jerk.

398
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,860
Big mouth.

399
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,160
That's Trump.

400
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,640
Spoiled, arrogant jerk.

401
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:54,820
Put it here.

402
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,560
Oh, now you're...

403
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,260
Well, what about the chemical attacks and Reverend Ivan Trump?

404
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,440
Well, he thinks that Reverend Ivan Trump was just provocating the whole event so he could

405
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,840
do something to make himself look good.

406
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,860
Reverend Ivan Stump, 2020.

407
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,780
That's it.

408
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,100
I would.

409
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,940
If I had half a hands network with, I would certainly go to you in a heartbeat.

410
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,440
I think Stang knows Stumpy.

411
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,700
Stumpy knows Reverend Stang.

412
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,320
Stumpy is friends with Reverend Stang.

413
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,960
Stumpy gets in the back of the van in little tiny places to go to X Day so Reverend Stang

414
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,960
can stretch his legs.

415
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,080
Because Stumpy's smaller.

416
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,760
Stumpy can fit into small places.

417
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,620
He doesn't mind.

418
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,140
Stumpy doesn't mind.

419
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,820
Stumpy has a stairway over in Stumpy's kingdom.

420
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:37,820


421
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:37,820


422
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:37,820


423
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:37,820


424
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:37,820


425
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:37,820


426
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:37,820


427
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,560
It's a kingdom of stumps.

428
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,640
A little ways down the driveway here from Reverend Stang's house, Stumpy has his own

429
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,000
little place and he's the prince of Stumpy's kingdom.

430
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,320
You might think that I'm just making up a story, but it's all true.

431
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,820
Maybe you have lose your mind or something.

432
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,020
Talk about the Stumpy kingdom.

433
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,220
I don't know.

434
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,820
Oh, Stumpy gets...

435
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,360
Stumpy is just trying to get attention.

436
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:06,020
You can ignore Stumpy and Clonky and all those.

437
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,500
I'll try.

438
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,660
As they're right here in my...

439
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,520
But we do have...

440
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,220
There is a section on the property where we let Stumpy live and it is...

441
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,760
Stumpy the kid.

442
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,220
It is...

443
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,880
By chance, there are a lot of cedar tree stumps in that area.

444
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:31,260
Originally cut down by my son decades ago and that's the kingdom of stumps.

445
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:31,560
What are you, being a bad boy?

446
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,980
We let Stumpy live there and he polishes the Atlantean fossils and ruins.

447
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,420
Yeah.

448
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:37,800
Yes.

449
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,760
Dave, did I tell you that we stumbled onto a treasure trove of Atlantean fossils?

450
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,980
I think I remember you eluding to that.

451
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,840
Well, not fossils.

452
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,520
I mean they're Atlantean statues and alter pieces.

453
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,540
There's a gate, a massive gate left over from Atlantis.

454
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,760
No, you certainly did not tell me that.

455
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,260
Yeah.

456
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:05,680
Our property here, Stang Ranch, is the site of the sunken lost continent of Atlantis,

457
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:16,120
which was built by the Yetis in the Cretaceous era and sank beneath the waves several times,

458
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:16,740
actually.

459
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,580
It's a long story.

460
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,120
Very long story.

461
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,660
Skull Island is involved and so is Monster Hunter, but I don't expect anyone to believe

462
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,320
any of that.

463
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:30,540
However, the Atlantean ruins that we have all over here are real.

464
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:34,420
Because how else would those shapes...

465
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:40,380
Would nature make a triangle shape that always has an eye in it?

466
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,360
I don't know.

467
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,140
You know the eye in the pyramid and the great seal?

468
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:44,940
I don't believe it.

469
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,840
My grandsons know what it is, that thing on the dollar bill.

470
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,620
And the little chepetish.

471
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,280
You're right.

472
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:55,740
Well, that's the symbol of Atlantis, as we know from the George Powell movie Atlantis,

473
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,040
the Lost Continent, and Edgar Cayce.

474
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,540
Atlantis rising.

475
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,880
And all the big bestsellers of today.

476
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:11,080
And we keep finding these triangular or pyramidal rocks that...

477
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,380
Well, the eyeball isn't always mounted on it.

478
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,380
Sometimes the eyeball fell off and we've been putting them back on.

479
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,900
So you go around the ranch and there's these triangles with eyeballs, cyclops pyramids

480
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,460
everywhere.

481
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,160
I mean, little bitty ones, great big ones.

482
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,660
Everything that's triangular has a circle up near the top.

483
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,500
Where the eye would be in the pyramid.

484
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,700
And there can't be naturally occurring.

485
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,440
That's just too big of a coincidence.

486
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,140
It couldn't be natural.

487
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,320
It has to be man-made.

488
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,460
And if we didn't do it, it must have been the Atlanteans.

489
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,280
Atlantean creature made perhaps.

490
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,380
18 million years ago.

491
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,100
That's a long, long time, man.

492
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,660
But I think there's some problems with your theory.

493
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,280
Number one, eye bills.

494
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,400
Not eye bills.

495
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,880
Eye bills, which are vastly different, at least from a dominion standpoint.

496
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,780
Eye balls, eye balls.

497
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,140
Eye balls?

498
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,080
Are much shorter when they come from.

499
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:20,680
So I wouldn't try to involve them too much in your paroxysms or your grand designs.

500
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,400
Well, these are just sculptures that the Atlanteans made.

501
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:24,740
Right.

502
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,500
You'd have to say that before you'd sell anybody.

503
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,660
The high Atlanteans.

504
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,180
This is the high Atlantean culture.

505
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,380
There was a low Atlantean culture that was made.

506
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,740
It was mostly subgeniuses.

507
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,320
Right.

508
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,640
And on their pyramids, the eye is.

509
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:45,980
What's funny is on the subgenius Atlanteans, they built, made their logo pyramids with the eye closed.

510
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,260
Yes.

511
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,160
Winking at you or possibly snapping.

512
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,740
Or just high.

513
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,720
Yeah.

514
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,500
Yeah.

515
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,340
Yeah, that's right.

516
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,240
Princess, we reminded me.

517
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,140
My grandson, age eight.

518
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,140
Talked about the Illuminati.

519
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,180
He said, he said, Oh yeah, I know about that triangle in the eye.

520
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,040
That's the sign of the seal of the Illuminati.

521
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:10,300
Yeah.

522
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,740
He was spitting that stuff out like it was nothing.

523
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,120
Yeah.

524
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,500
He's eight years old and he's saying Illuminati.

525
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,940
He turns on the degenerate television stations.

526
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:22,320
This is common knowledge and it's common knowledge by all, even Stan's grandchildren now.

527
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,320
Well, now you would expect that from Stan's grandchildren, except that they're not around here most of the time.

528
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,620
And I'd certainly never.

529
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:28,780
I'd never.

530
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,500
You know, they hardly, they barely know about Bob.

531
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,880
As they explained that one time they were on the show, they all about all they know is Bob lives in a flying saucer and he's a.

532
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,740
He likes carrots and there was a bunch of stuff that.

533
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:44,880
Carrots?

534
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:45,440
Yes.

535
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,580
Elias or the age six.

536
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,220
Oh, okay.

537
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,220
Age six drew a picture of Bob, his first Bob.

538
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,760
Age six drew his first Bob and he gave it to me.

539
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,400
It was Two-Face Bob.

540
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,400
And he did in fact look like Two-Face from the Batman comics.

541
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:07,200
And it's an anti-Bob with the pipe coming out of the wrong side.

542
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,240
Yeah.

543
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,160
He knew that he got that right.

544
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,880
Well, cause it's a Two-Face Bob.

545
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,980
He's a Two-Face Bob, right.

546
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:18,880
Which as my cousin Crawford said, that's the only kind of Bob that's real.

547
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,420
Two-Face Bob.

548
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,360
Well, that's because he had the cloven hoof, you know, like.

549
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,780
Like when you're a child with a cloven hoof, a lot of the kids are going to make fun of

550
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:29,940
you.

551
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:37,980
But I thought that was real interesting that this kind of normal child knew that eye on

552
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,460
the pyramid was the symbol of the Illuminati.

553
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,700
But how normal can he be being your grandson?

554
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,880
No, that's what I'm trying to tell you.

555
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,180
All kids, all kids that age.

556
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,180
All kids listen to Alex Jones now?

557
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:48,540
Yeah.

558
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,000
Well, it's, and that must be the way they pick up this information, but they, like

559
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,980
my grandson has said similar things to me.

560
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,340
Like, oh, do you know this?

561
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:56,400
I don't know that.

562
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,620
You were not even the glimmering of eye.

563
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,640
Or, how'd you know that?

564
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,520
And he was just laughing at me and saying something like, yee, everybody knows that.

565
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,580
Heh, heh, heh.

566
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,740
Yeah, but the book pills told us that.

567
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,720
They give us a book pill in kindergarten, grandpa.

568
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,180
Book pill?

569
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,780
Yeah, sure, book pills.

570
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,100
I love such a concept.

571
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,320
I love it.

572
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:26,320


573
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:26,320


574
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:26,760
I love book pills.

575
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,680
Mm-hmm.

576
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,940
Well, your novel would certainly go down better in pill form.

577
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,960
It kind of is in pill form.

578
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:41,060
Or if you took a pill before reading, it might make it a little easier to get through

579
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,100
in one piece, so to speak.

580
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,160
Oh, I just did some Stem Sublim before I read about Stem Sublim.

581
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,420
I wish they had such a thing.

582
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,060
He thinks he just made it up.

583
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,040
He thinks, you, Dave.

584
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,340
Well, I mean, in a marketable way, like a chicken or something that you could buy.

585
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,780
They've had Stem Sublim since America Online.

586
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,480
Well, sure, you have.

587
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,460
Why do you think people were paying three bucks a minute to be on the internet back

588
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:14,820
then?

589
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,280
It was the Stem Sublim.

590
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,680
Because your thing with Steve Jobs, the little thing you guys had going in the garage or

591
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,000
something?

592
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,600
Well, it was the stuff that they put in the Flickr.

593
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,040
I don't know.

594
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,040


595
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,120
Actually, it's the interstices between the Flickers.

596
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:36,900
There's the, you know, when the Flickr, the cathode ray or tube or the digital feedback

597
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:42,240
readout tube, any of the tubes, they all have some form of a Flickr or at least alternating

598
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,160
lines or some such thing for the persistence of vision.

599
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:54,860
Well, you can wedge, as you well know, you can wedge other signals in between the Flickr.

600
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,180
There's the dark part and there's the picture part.

601
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,140
They go back and forth real fast.

602
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:06,720
But there's a part between the dark and the picture that's quantum.

603
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:14,900
And that's where you put the Stem Sublim signals, which they only take up, well, it's

604
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,060
not even three-dimensional.

605
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,800
It's a two-dimensional line of code.

606
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:24,140
But because of that, it goes directly into the retina.

607
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:28,860
What one might call then after that, the mind's eye.

608
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:37,160
I would like it very much, my friend, if you were to take what you just said and just put

609
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:43,820
that in a forward somewhere, because that's the most beautiful, most wonderful, beautiful

610
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,440
explanation of Stem Sublim that I've ever heard.

611
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,340
It goes way beyond what I had in mind.

612
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,120
Well, if I said that, then you better pick up on it.

613
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,900
He just did pick up on it.

614
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,320
Unfortunately, it was Jimi Hendrix who said that.

615
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,380
So I guess you better pick up on what he said.

616
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,040
I thought that was you.

617
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,400
And Hendrix had a lot to say about Stem Sublim.

618
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,280
He did?

619
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,780
Yeah, but he did it in between the lines of the song.

620
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,540
So you had to read between the lines, like between the Flickers.

621
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,120
Oh, yeah.

622
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,520
The Flicker rate, yeah, 3.9, right?

623
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,120
And that space, the interstices between the lines.

624
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:31,120
Between the right key and just slightly wrong off the key that Hendrix was an expert at.

625
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:38,600
That's where he could put his conflicting anti-conspiracy Stem Sublim.

626
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,960
And we do the same.

627
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,480
We in the Church of the Subgenius do the same thing.

628
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:51,360
Not in the style of Hendrix, but we still use the acid bath.

629
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,860
Not the LSD.

630
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,500
No, I don't mean LSD acid.

631
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,980
I mean real acid.

632
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,820
The acid bath.

633
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,820
Makes everything pretty clean, that's for sure.

634
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,720
That's the idea.

635
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,000
You know what I mean?

636
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,420
There's nothing...

637
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,900
It's to bring out the definition.

638
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,800
Sometimes, well, you don't want to leave it in there too long, obviously.

639
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,980
You don't want to leave yourself in the acid bath for too long.

640
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,780
But if you just do it in little increments, you...

641
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,260
Then the frog will never know it's being fornicated.

642
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,200
Right, exactly.

643
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,920
Your brain is fooled into accepting it.

644
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,180
And it...

645
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,200
Well, it just burns away the crust.

646
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:37,180
There's a crust, and when that little thin layer of crust goes away,

647
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,720
then you can see the crenulations, the striations,

648
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:44,360
and the little worm tubes.

649
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,980
Tiny, and the little teeny tiny diatom patterns.

650
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,700
All in...

651
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,180
Once you've thrown that organ into the acid,

652
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:53,420
you can see it's been there for a long time.

653
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:53,420


654
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:53,420


655
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,860
The acid bath, again, this is not for amateurs.

656
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,220
What did I read?

657
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,180
I wouldn't...

658
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:05,500
I strongly suggest that no one monkey with the acid

659
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:10,300
unless they have a background, some background in chemistry.

660
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,060
Or at least certification.

661
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:12,800
Yeah.

662
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,720
I don't have any background in chemistry.

663
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,300
So, I took kind of a shortcut,

664
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:21,220
made myself into an expert on the chemistry just of the acid.

665
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,920
Yeah, you could...

666
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,000
And I know what not to put in the acid,

667
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,720
and what you can put in the acid.

668
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:27,880
Yeah.

669
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,160
You could lose a finger just as easily as if you...

670
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,440
if you shot a bird's eye out of a pickle.

671
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,300
You know, if you're like...

672
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,700
Oh, yeah, you could...

673
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:36,940
...like a mean kid.

674
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,500
You could wreck your lungs real easily.

675
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:39,820
Yep.

676
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,600
I got a gas mask, so...

677
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,980
for my acid bath.

678
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,580
I really did.

679
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,580
I went to Home Depot.

680
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,280
I bought the most expensive gas mask.

681
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,040
I bought the most expensive gas mask they had.

682
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,160
It was 60 bucks.

683
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,840
I get...

684
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,320
I wear mine.

685
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,680
I go to the mall and do my elderly mall walk,

686
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,820
and I have a mask on.

687
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:57,300
It's...

688
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,120
The top part of it is actually Michael Jackson,

689
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,560
but the bottom part is actually a gas mask

690
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,860
approved by the Israeli military police forces.

691
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,440
Do you ever moonwalk in the mall when you're...

692
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,320
when you're wearing that mask?

693
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,660
Do I ever moonwalk?

694
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,240
Moonwalk?

695
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:13,920
Oh, of course.

696
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,240
Yeah, when you're mall walking.

697
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,940
You know, like there's little kids around.

698
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,020
They all start cheering.

699
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:17,520
They're applauding.

700
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,440
What am I going to do?

701
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:18,900
Leave them...

702
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,520
You know, let them down and stuff.

703
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:20,820
Right.

704
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,160
I'm not that kind of person.

705
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,920
Yeah, to them, you are Michael Jackson in a gas mask.

706
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,440
Right, and I have to...

707
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,120
There's some things I have to live up to,

708
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,140
and I promote childhoods.

709
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,500
I smoke the little burns,

710
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,960
them little childhood burns that they get when they're younger,

711
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,180
and sometimes the pieces...

712
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,400
Like a little monocle of glass will fall out,

713
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,640
just like part of a brain,

714
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,640
like a human skull, you know?

715
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,280
Right.

716
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,780
But that's not my problem.

717
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,020
You know, I've told all the police officers that I can even remember,

718
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,360
and I can't remember them all.

719
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,720
You know that, you know.

720
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,560
Oh, no kidding.

721
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,020
Well, one reason is...

722
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,520
I mean, the reason they pulled you over in the first place

723
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,400
is also the reason you can't remember being pulled over.

724
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,400
Right.

725
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,380
And that's why we just keep doing it again,

726
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,820
again and again and again.

727
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,720
You don't remember until you get the summons in the mail.

728
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,500
It's, oh, yeah, now I remember.

729
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:12,860
I was arrested.

730
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,420
I got pulled.

731
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,660
God, that's terrible.

732
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,780
Oh, no, I got pulled again.

733
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:17,680
Was that yesterday?

734
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,460
I got pulled.

735
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,080
No, they...

736
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,240
Oh, and then I got pushed.

737
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,920
They pushed me, and then they pulled me.

738
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,600
I wish they'd pushed me again.

739
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,580
Well, one of these days, they're gonna find out it's pulled pork.

740
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,120
I can't have pulled pork anymore.

741
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,760
Neither can I.

742
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,400
You know, we have to just sit and whimper

743
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,980
while everybody else eats their pulled pork and their bacon.

744
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:37,260
And fun food.

745
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,180
I'll have some trail mix and a banana.

746
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,300
Yes, a banana and an apple.

747
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,880
Perhaps a little bit of that couscous.

748
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,800
Perhaps some hummus.

749
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,320
I can't drink wine.

750
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,500
Could I have just a taste of grape juice, please?

751
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,720
Oh, no, it's got too much sugar in it.

752
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,180
You can't have the grape juice.

753
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,020
Mmm, mmm.

754
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,780
I get all the signals mixed up and misfiring in my skull.

755
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,440
I'd show my belly button off like if I was a hot babe or something,

756
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,060
but I'm not.

757
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,500
Don't get me wrong.

758
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:12,400
I mean, I...

759
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,640
You can still show your belly button off, Dave.

760
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:14,900
Yeah.

761
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,480
You're a strapping old man.

762
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,100
Strapping.

763
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,460
Well, I mean, you're not...

764
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:24,580
The last time we saw you, 10 years ago, you weren't fat.

765
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,600
You were real skinny.

766
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,960
That's true.

767
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,980
Girls like tall, skinny guys.

768
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,880
Ladies, Dave, just in case you were ever wondering,

769
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,320
since he's not on the Internet and there's no pictures of him,

770
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,660
he's tall, sort of tall.

771
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,000
Skinny.

772
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,000


773
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:43,580
Yep.

774
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:50,360
His proportions are maybe not heroic, but certainly at least normal.

775
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,600
Almost normal.

776
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:57,540
That's when I had carbon in my skull, when I was just a little tiny, little...

777
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:57,780
Yep.

778
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:04,520
The leading man actor he's most often compared to facially is Chief Dan George.

779
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,180
And...

780
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,820
Yeah.

781
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,280
Yeah.

782
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:11,340
Yeah.

783
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:14,840
So imagine a tall, skinny Chief Dan George.

784
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,320
A tall, Palestinian Chief Dan George.

785
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:18,640
Yeah.

786
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:25,800
Well, go ahead and just try and say that, whatever it was that you just said,

787
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,480
and see if...

788
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,680
I don't care.

789
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,540
My heart soars like a hawk.

790
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,960
It's a good day to die, my uncle.

791
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,160
Yeah, it's a good day to die.

792
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,160
And then he goes and doesn't die.

793
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,580
Well, it's just all television.

794
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,440
Or not television, but the only...

795
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:47,080
The make-believe fairyland of fairyland ink, you know, Hollywood.

796
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,540
Well, actually it was...

797
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,260
Well, actually it was...

798
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:57,320
No, actually, Little Big Man, we were quoting the novel and the movie Little Big Man, which

799
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:05,040
starred Chief Dan George and Dustin Hoffman as Ivan Stang and Lonesome Cowboy Dave, respectively.

800
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:06,460
And...

801
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,240
But it was written by Thomas Berger.

802
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,220
Or Berger.

803
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,700
I don't know how it's pronounced.

804
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,540
Did you know there's a sequel to it?

805
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,280
He wrote a sequel to Little Big Man.

806
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:26,520
Jack Crabb, Little Big Man, after surviving the Battle of Little Big Horn...

807
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:26,540
Big Horn.

808
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:33,540
...goes to work for Buffalo Bill and tours Europe with Buffalo Bill's Wild West show.

809
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:37,680
I had heard that he had really done that, but I didn't know that if he was...

810
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,120
Yeah.

811
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:38,660
Yeah.

812
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:42,740
But again, he meets the crowned heads of Europe and a whole bunch of other celebrities,

813
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:43,440
you know.

814
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,180
That's...

815
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:45,920
Yeah.

816
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,280
I've forgotten all of it, but it was great.

817
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,600
Does he go and sing, accompany, sing with Florence Jenkins?

818
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:53,780
No.

819
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,300
More like Annie Oakley.

820
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,780
Oh, Annie Oakley.

821
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,160
Yeah.

822
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,920
Well, you're been...

823
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,900
Not Florence, not you.

824
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,480
...done and she...

825
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,020
I wish they'd done Jack Crabb meets Le Petit Mime.

826
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,040
But the wrong...

827
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,340
Actually, it's the wrong centuries entirely.

828
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:17,900
Jack Crabb was still alive in 1969 or so when Little Big Man was recorded.

829
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,500
It would have changed the history of explosives though, wouldn't it?

830
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:23,280
I mean, when you think of it that way, think of the Middle East and the problems we're

831
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:23,680
having now.

832
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,520
Think of back in the day, Vietnam and so forth.

833
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,640
I mean, it would have literally changed.

834
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:35,180
A man could walk into a room and see vacuum cleaner for thousands of millions of people

835
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,080
in one 12-foam.

836
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:36,900
Yeah.

837
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,740
Yeah, those different centuries didn't bother Bill and Ted at all.

838
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,680
Yeah, not exactly.

839
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:43,880
Yeah.

840
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,840
Yeah, they were excellent.

841
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:46,960
They were excellent.

842
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,520
I voted for it.

843
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,640
I voted for it 10 times.

844
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:52,060
And then I slapped my mammy.

845
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,220
You voted for Bill and Ted?

846
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:54,920
Yeah.

847
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,920
Then I slapped my mammy 10 times.

848
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,060
Or at least I tried to.

849
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,300
She made me jump back.

850
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,880
But that was the...

851
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:06,880


852
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:06,880


853
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:06,880


854
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:06,880


855
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:06,880


856
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:06,880


857
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:06,880


858
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:06,880


859
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:06,880


860
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:06,880


861
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:06,880


862
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,120
I think it was the charcoal pit eraser.

863
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,680
You have to be at least 15 to get in the room.

864
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,260
And then they had like cock fights and stuff like that.

865
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,440
Charcoal pit eraser?

866
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,040
Huh?

867
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,380
I saw them open for Devo.

868
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:20,980
Oh, yeah.

869
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,920
The charcoal pit erasers?

870
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:23,160
Yeah, they're alive again.

871
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,100
Yeah.

872
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,880
Yeah, the chalkboard erasers.

873
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,640
And yeah, they did the cover of Slap Your Mammy.

874
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,120
Ah, okay.

875
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,240
There's some lyrics to that one I never worked out.

876
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,440
My mother did not like that song.

877
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:36,860
I mean, she was in a bad mood.

878
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:36,860


879
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:36,860


880
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:36,860


881
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:36,860


882
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:36,860


883
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,480
I played that song, Slap Your Mammy.

884
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:38,780
She did not like it?

885
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,180
Yeah, she did not like it at all.

886
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:46,140
I was raised to call my parents Mammy and Pappy.

887
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,260
You've heard us refer to Pappy.

888
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,700
He was...

889
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,420
I'm sitting in his chair now.

890
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,620
We're all in Mammy's house.

891
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,920
This is actually not Pappy's house.

892
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,560
It's really Mammy's house.

893
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,280
Thanks Mammy.

894
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,100
Thanks Mammy.

895
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,640
And so yeah.

896
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:06,840
Mammy's house.

897
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:09,660
Mammy didn't like that song by Devo, Slap Your Mammy.

898
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,200
How could she even hear that lyric?

899
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,060
It goes so fast.

900
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:12,680
It's hard, yeah.

901
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,180
Slap your...

902
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,000
I can't do it.

903
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:14,420
Slap your Mammy out.

904
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:14,960
Slap your Mammy out.

905
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,480
Slap your Mammy out.

906
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,560
Yeah, you can't even...

907
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,960
What are they saying after Slap Your Mammy?

908
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,840
I thought they were saying Slap Your Mammy now and again.

909
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,640
Or now and then.

910
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:24,100
Or something.

911
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:24,820
Slap your Mammy.

912
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:25,520
Slap your Mammy.

913
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:26,840
Slap your Mammy.

914
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,560
Slap your Mammy.

915
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:27,580
Slap your Mammy.

916
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:27,820
Slap your Mammy.

917
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:33,120
But I'm not 18 years old like Devo was at that time, so I can't talk that fast anymore.

918
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:35,520
And neither can they, I'm pretty sure.

919
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,960
Hey, I'm going to be seeing the Devo's in about a month apparently.

920
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,000
The Devo's?

921
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,800
Yeah, or at least some of...

922
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,960
Well, you know, there's not many of them left.

923
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,900
Ladies and gentlemen, wives from Coburg's Cove, it's the Devo's.

924
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:50,660
Yeah.

925
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,680
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

926
00:50:54,680 --> 00:51:01,920
Well, yeah, those documentary people from Austin are going to interview some of the

927
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,180
Devo's about their experiences with Church of the Subgenius.

928
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:08,260
And they wanted me to go out there to Los Angeles with them.

929
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:12,560
And honest to God, Dave, I was going...

930
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,480
What does God have to do with this, Dave?

931
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,300
You know, we're going to just have gotten back to Cleveland and I need to work on my

932
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:18,820
driveway.

933
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,740
I got to work on selling that house.

934
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,160
We got to pack up stuff.

935
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,840
We got to repaint everything.

936
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:27,860
I don't want to go to Hollywood and party with rock stars.

937
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,460
I've got stuff to do.

938
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,140
About the documentary that's being done about my life project?

939
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:32,700
You don't want to fix that hole in the basement.

940
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:37,720
So Princess Wee said, Reverend Stang, snap out of it.

941
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,440
You're going to LA.

942
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,060
They're paying for it.

943
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:49,940
Go hang out with Jerry and Mark and do whatever rock stars do and get that movie made.

944
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:50,620
Better believe it.

945
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,560
With rock stars in it.

946
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,540
Hey, did you know that Reverend Jerry...

947
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:57,420
Actually Jerry never joined the church.

948
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:59,560
He's an honorary member.

949
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:02,160
No, we don't have honorary members.

950
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:02,680
You have to...

951
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,760
You have to spend the 30...

952
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,600
Whatever it is.

953
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,700
And you have to.

954
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,560
Even my kids had to.

955
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:20,520
Anyway, Bob Casale, the late Bob Casale and his wife, is it Lisa?

956
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:21,480
Yeah.

957
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,080
Late.

958
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,220
They were dues paying subgeniuses.

959
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,660
Martin Mothersbaugh did the music for a commercial and other things.

960
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,500
He never sent his 30 bucks.

961
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,240
Yeah.

962
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:34,820
He hired me to do some animation for him, but he didn't pay his 30 bucks.

963
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,700
Jerry hired me to do a bunch of stuff.

964
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,440
He never sent his 30 bucks.

965
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,100
Oh, okay.

966
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,900
They're all doomed.

967
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,580
Just as doomed as a pink boy.

968
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:49,180
As you, the listener, that never joined the church.

969
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,340
He went, oh, I know what they want me to join the church as subgenius.

970
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,880
So I'm not going to go do it because I'm a real subgenius.

971
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:56,980
Okay.

972
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:57,860
Yeah, I get it.

973
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,020
Fine.

974
00:52:58,620 --> 00:52:59,060
But...

975
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,900
Well, no, wait.

976
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,760
Who's late and who's early?

977
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,700
Everyone's late.

978
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,480
No, I thought you said...

979
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,160
Bob Mothersbaugh is late.

980
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,140
Who?

981
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,140
You said late Jerry Casale.

982
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,480
No, no, no.

983
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,440
Bob Casale.

984
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:25,820
Bob Casale died and Alan the drummer died, and Bob Mothersbaugh is still alive, and Mark

985
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:26,940
and Jerry are still alive.

986
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,380
Jerry makes wine now.

987
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,040
Jerry ate.

988
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,280
He owns a winery.

989
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,880
I don't know if his wine is...

990
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,920
I'm going to find out.

991
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,600
I'll probably drink some of his Casale wine or whatever.

992
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:38,280
Yes, he probably will.

993
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:38,720
He probably will.

994
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,280
He has wine in California or in the United Snakes?

995
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:42,600
Yes, he does.

996
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:42,860
No, no.

997
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,520
He has a winery in California.

998
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,680
He was always a wine connoisseur on the side.

999
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,160
That's not the only kind of connoisseur he was.

1000
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:57,680
And what I was going to tell you was he married a subgenius.

1001
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,000
He sure did.

1002
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,740
He married Reverend Galaxina from Indiana.

1003
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:09,580
I love it when all those words all come together and end in vowel sounds, like Vioxxlina,

1004
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,360
Vini, Rana.

1005
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:19,640
Reverend Galaxina, who was a real young subgenius, at least 25 years ago she was

1006
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,140
real young.

1007
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:26,480
She and Jerry of the Devo's got married.

1008
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:32,560
So they can have little Devo subgenius miscegenated spud yetis.

1009
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,700
Devons and devets.

1010
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,280
Little potato yetis.

1011
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,960
A hot and pleasant fight on a Christmas morning.

1012
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:43,520
Santa's hung his stocking with hair, hoping the moon guys will soon be there.

1013
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:51,400
Daddy and old Saint sneak grabbing by the toilet trick, trying to undulate as well as

1014
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,100
they could and back into the neighborhood with a bag of wood.

1015
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:56,460
Wow.

1016
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,200
We just got the Lonesome Cowboy Dave version of The Night Before Christmas.

1017
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:00,700
Yeah.

1018
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,560
And all through the holes, the most accretable food storage.

1019
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,240
Hey, I have to tell you about a subgenius Easter.

1020
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:09,820
Easter?

1021
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:10,380
Yeah.

1022
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:13,060
We have a new tradition here at Stang Ranch.

1023
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:22,040
Every Easter, now that we live here during Easter, the Stang grandkids who live in Dallas,

1024
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,020
only two hours away, come and visit us.

1025
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,020
And they do their Easter egg hunting.

1026
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:37,060
And last year, on Easter Eve, the night before Easter, while Princess Wee and the kids' mom

1027
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:44,260
and dad and I were hiding eggs, damn it, the hound dog discovered a copperhead snake in

1028
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:44,740
the yard.

1029
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:53,040
And I had to brutally slay it, clumsily and brutally slay this venomous snake in the yard

1030
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:56,000
before the kids got up and searched the yard.

1031
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,620
They went out to the field and searched for eggs in his den.

1032
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:05,240
Well, this year, the day before Easter, as we were showing them all our cool hideouts

1033
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:12,760
and things, and the giant serpent sculpture that we have now, we came upon a four-foot-long

1034
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,600
recently-shed snake skin.

1035
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:23,260
I know the snake shed it that day because I'd found a real good fossil in this same

1036
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:24,600
spot the day before.

1037
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,180
Yep.

1038
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,800
prehistoric crocodile vertebrae.

1039
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:34,200
But anyway, the snake, so we looked at the snake skin.

1040
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:36,620
It's four feet long, and we're going,

1041
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:41,880
there's a very shiny, peppy snake running around here right now, nearby.

1042
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,320
Let's go back in the house.

1043
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:49,180
And we did, and we thought, it's the Easter snake.

1044
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:55,200
If you're a stang or a subgenius, you might get the Easter bunny,

1045
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,560
but the Easter snake comes.

1046
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:03,740
If you've been a good subgenius child, he doesn't kill you or bite you.

1047
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,240
Well, how many of those are there?

1048
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,100
And he only steals a few.

1049
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,740
Well, good is all relative.

1050
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:16,980
You get special extra demerit points for stealing when you're a subgenius child.

1051
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:21,600
Anyway, yeah, so the Easter snake.

1052
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:24,800
The Easter snake is a, he comes every year.

1053
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:29,560
The night before Easter, and he gives you a warning or a sign,

1054
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,240
or you have to kill him or something.

1055
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,500
My brother, the man who knows, came and looked at the skin and said,

1056
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,800
that's not a rattlesnake.

1057
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,380
It's wrong proportions.

1058
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,180
That's a no-account chicken snake.

1059
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,180
That's what we call it around here.

1060
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,420
It's really called a rat snake or a pine snake.

1061
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,800
But it wasn't a rattlesnake.

1062
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,100
So then I went, oh, we don't have to wear boots after all.

1063
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:54,400
Right.

1064
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:54,780
Right.

1065
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:54,780


1066
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:54,780


1067
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:54,780


1068
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:54,780


1069
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:54,780


1070
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:54,780


1071
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:54,780


1072
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:54,780


1073
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:54,780


1074
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:54,780


1075
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:54,780


1076
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:54,780


1077
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:54,780


1078
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:54,780


1079
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,880
I went right back outside, scampering through the high grass.

1080
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:02,220
Because if that wasn't a rattlesnake skin, then we have nothing to fear.

1081
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:03,860
Right?

1082
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:04,720
No.

1083
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:05,320
That's logic.

1084
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:09,120
I have everything to fear because there are rattlesnakes here.

1085
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:12,360
You found a baby rattlesnake the other day, if you don't remember.

1086
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:12,740
That's true.

1087
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:13,020
I did.

1088
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,140
I saw my first live rattlesnake.

1089
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,020
Whacked him upside the head with a weed eater accidentally.

1090
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:19,980
Didn't know he was there.

1091
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,820
And then at the last moment he saw him, the rattlesnake was going in one direction.

1092
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:24,780
He was going in the other.

1093
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,080
Right.

1094
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,960
And that's the way we keep it.

1095
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,960
We found a beehive.

1096
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:36,100
Well, actually, my son-in-law found a beehive next to where Princess Wee and I sit in the

1097
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:46,540
woods and talk on a little bench, benches that we have out in a special place.

1098
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:53,020
There's been an active beehive in a tree trunk next to us the whole time.

1099
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,040
There you go.

1100
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,860
And they never did.

1101
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,380
They never stung us.

1102
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,040
They never stung us.

1103
00:58:59,080 --> 00:58:59,840
They never did anything.

1104
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:06,820
I put my face in the beehive today to take pictures of them, Dave, and it didn't bother them.

1105
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,240
You have no real face.

1106
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:12,360
You've been telling me all these years that you have a face.

1107
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:12,940
Oh, come on.

1108
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,000
The camera is my eye.

1109
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,100
The microphone is my ear.

1110
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,500
It's like a face.

1111
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,400
And your nose, too.

1112
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:20,460
Well, no.

1113
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:23,560
I have a little kind of a heat sensor where a nose would be.

1114
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:25,520
Oh.

1115
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,520
Is that you twanging?

1116
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:33,480
But I hear something in the background.

1117
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,960
We turned our music off.

1118
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,220
I'm trying to turn it off.

1119
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,480
I can't hear.

1120
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:41,080
Well, speaking of turn it off, we have to turn this show off.

1121
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,120
We really do.

1122
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,080
It's been an hour.

1123
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,200
We've got to turn it off.

1124
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,860
Well, it hadn't been an hour, but I'm playing six minutes of music and stuff at the beginning.

1125
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:51,180
So that's the time, man.

1126
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:54,320
That's subgenius.com is the way to find out.

1127
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:58,060
We're going to find out about this show, The Hour of Slack, from the Church of the Subgenius,

1128
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:03,680
starring Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Princess We Are Doe, and yours truly, Reverend Stang.

1129
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:09,200
Oh, how wonderful for you to mention that part, especially about me.

1130
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:14,280
And wait until you read Neighbor World by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1131
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:19,840
It's like being told a story by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1132
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:22,800
Only he really thought about it.

1133
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,020
And it's a true story.

1134
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:24,560
Mm-hmm.

1135
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,380
So there you go.

1136
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,320
I don't know where you're going, but there you go.

1137
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:36,780
You can take that and jump in the acid bath with your BBC and your BBW and Dave's book

1138
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,360
and your Atlantean ruins.

1139
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:39,960
Yeah.

1140
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,600
And your Chigga Bites.

1141
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,560
Your Chigga Bites and your tax forms.

1142
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,320
Yeah.

1143
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:44,520
Yeah.

1144
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,780
Your K1 and your 1099s.

1145
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:48,060
Your KY.

1146
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,760
Yeah, your KY and you're ready to go.

1147
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:51,040
Yeah.

1148
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:51,920
162.

1149
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,620
You know.

1150
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,600
So praise Bob.

1151
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,620
Praise Bob and hail Connie.

1152
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,640
Thank you.
