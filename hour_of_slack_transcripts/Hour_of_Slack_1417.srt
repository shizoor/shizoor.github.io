1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,740
Oh, yes, manifest occultation of a thought form.

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:08,480
Yes.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,100
Yes.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,300
They have a tap-dynamic action.

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,520
Oh, to be sure.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,560
And strange.

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,260
You know, that's interesting because, you know, that's really interesting.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,100
Yes.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:33,560
Give them false pride, false ego, false negativity, false power, false kick, and then you destroy them.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,000
So, it wouldn't matter what they would endeavor to do, it would go all wrong.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,620
Yes.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:50,200
And if they personally are not, they have in their employ those who are.

13
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,200
Mm-hmm.

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,280
Keep your sunny side up, up.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,700
Hide the side that gets blue.

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,500
Ah, yes, back in ancient Scythia, they used to perform certain special dances in the temple.

17
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:13,240
Yes, these are what our faithful fans do when they're relaxing on their downtime.

18
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:19,340
They're so tormented by the rigors of following the complicated subgenius religious system

19
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,180
that occasionally they need to break out in orgiastic symphonies of movement like this one.

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,860
Just look at those tensing, flexing, hey.

21
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,180
How come all of them have glasses on?

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,080
Flexing and vexing.

23
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,100
They look like nerds.

24
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,040
Priestess approaches the altar.

25
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,160
You can see the zipper, you better take that out and post it.

26
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,040
That's Pisces.

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,180
Pisces is performing this erotic dance?

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,640
Oh, I am a...

29
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,260
What does her husband do?

30
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,180
Husband Suds, I have to say about that.

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,640
Suds Peshaw.

32
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,700
That's him, behind her.

33
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,940
Oh, well, wow.

34
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,400
I hope all the kids are watching this are in bed.

35
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,220
That gigantic squat idol.

36
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,180
But no, that was Reverend Suds.

37
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,500
It looked like an idol.

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,700
It was squatting, and so it was an understandable mistake.

39
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,440
That's just gold spray paint.

40
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,720
What about that glaring ruby right in the middle of its forehead?

41
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,240
Oh, I see.

42
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,040
Why don't you climb up there and steal it, Dr. Hal?

43
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,060
It's bad skin.

44
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,020
There's not a curse or anything.

45
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:25,660
Go ahead.

46
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,980
Well, I would, but...

47
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,380
Everybody's doing it.

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,980
No, I think we'd better let it be.

49
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,300
What's the matter, you chicken?

50
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,460
Let sleeping idols lie.

51
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,200
I'm afraid your mom's going to find out.

52
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,720
I stole that from David Apocalypse, by the way.

53
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,100
You did?

54
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,480
Yeah.

55
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,920
And he stole it from some movie, I'm sure.

56
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,300
Yeah, you're afraid somebody's going to tell?

57
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,420
We're passing around that.

58
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,760
What is the name of that horrible drink that...

59
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,580
Fernet Branca.

60
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,360
White Ferret.

61
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,240
Yeah, you brought some...

62
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,180
I summoned that to X-Day so that you could have an official ask Dr. Hal.

63
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,620
I did?

64
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,100
Yeah.

65
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,300
I'm so sorry.

66
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,560
No, or somebody else...

67
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:01,780
What did they make that out of?

68
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,480
No, some...

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,100
Really?

70
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,260
They make it out of rancid beets.

71
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,660
Somebody else brought it.

72
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,520
Actually, not true.

73
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,300
Not true?

74
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:08,800
Not true.

75
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,560
Well, let's hear the straight skinny from...

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,640
No, it's made out of secret herbs and spices.

77
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,820
Secret herbs and spices.

78
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,000
There's no beets in it.

79
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,760
The same ones...

80
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,400
That's one of those herbs...

81
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,080
The beets generation.

82
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,720
It's got cabbage or kale or something.

83
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,700
Cavities and kings.

84
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,040
Kings.

85
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,780
Kale liqueur.

86
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,920
Kale liqueur.

87
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,280
That's...

88
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,860
I remember...

89
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,900
Seaweed liqueur.

90
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,300
McHale's Navy liqueur.

91
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,040
The only thing I'm positive about is a little bit of hydraulic fluid.

92
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,980
Ah, yes.

93
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,700
Fusil oil.

94
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,180
Peanut butter liqueur.

95
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,820
Damn, we're going to make a big spillage and get in a heap big trouble if we keep this up.

96
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,220
You know, and even worse, it's like being photographed to take for the board.

97
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,420
And if I'm exceptionally...

98
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,500
You hypocrite.

99
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:52,560
Unlucky.

100
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,700
You hypocrite.

101
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,380
I tried.

102
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,000
I can't stop what is...

103
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,380
It's like the ocean.

104
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,420
So you're just going to give in to peer group pressure, just like that.

105
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,620
Well, if I hold the liquor and I can hold my liquor, I can drink it and then I can't spill it.

106
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,920
If Goofus jumps off a cliff, would you jump off a cliff too, Gallop?

107
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,240
Too late.

108
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,580
I already did.

109
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,040
And this is the result.

110
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,580
Onto a sea of large breasts.

111
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,880
Yes, I gained the treasures of the mysterious east.

112
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:28,080
And I learned what song the sirens sang and the name Achilles used when he hid himself among women.

113
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,660
And I know about the toads and the rice that killed the poppy cockalorum and the cockahoopatrice.

114
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,360
He is Steve, right?

115
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,340
But now I kind of forgot all that stuff.

116
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,120
Oh, I've remembered what my question for you was, Dr. Hanley.

117
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,040
Well, quick, fire it in there.

118
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,400
Fire it in there.

119
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,940
Okay, the other night at that Davey Normal art show, you started hollering and you went on and on.

120
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,920
You were very upset about...

121
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,460
Loxley Castle.

122
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,240
Loxley Hall.

123
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,940
Loxley Hall.

124
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,420
What were you so upset...

125
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:02,960
What did they do to you to make you go on and on like that about wanting the waves to tear it down and the lightning to strike it and everything?

126
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,940
Let it fall on Loxley Hall.

127
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,440
That's the curse at the end where he wants the destruction.

128
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,820
What did they do to you personally?

129
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,700
I never saw you get so upset about something.

130
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,580
That's what I was hired to do.

131
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,460
I was hired to do a long Tennyson rap.

132
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,300
What?

133
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,000
And it was followed by the Lady of Shalott in her beautiful outfit.

134
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,040
What did Tennyson have to do with it?

135
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,320
Tennyson.

136
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,240
Alfred Lord Tennyson.

137
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,840
Yes, he was a lord.

138
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,660
And his name was Alfred.

139
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,300
The splendor...

140
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,180
I thought you were just hollering about this.

141
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,820
You were going on and on about it.

142
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,740
Loxley Hall.

143
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:47,180
Not only is that lengthy poem, which takes 25 minutes to say, about Loxley Hall, but then...

144
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,600
Oh, it's a poem.

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,840
But then Tennyson wrote another one called Loxley Hall.

146
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,540
Loxley Hall, 10 years after, where the same guy comes back and rants for 20 more minutes.

147
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,100
And now it's 10 more years and things have changed for him.

148
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,900
I recommend it.

149
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,320
It's on the Golden Gopher reading list.

150
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,500
Gee, it sounds like a regular iron rant.

151
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,780
Not at all.

152
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,140
Only those rants go on for 25 hours, not 25 minutes.

153
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,420
But they are not in the golden enamelling of poetry.

154
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,860
No, they sound like a bitter old Yahoo comment.

155
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,660
No, they sound like a bitter old Yahoo comment.

156
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,900
A bitter old toad.

157
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,880
Yeah, it's like a kind of a glorified Yahoo commenter going on and on and on.

158
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,820
Well, perhaps if you've been following the news, you saw that there's this bunch of Republicans in Michigan

159
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:40,300
who hate Obama so much that they've decided to secede from America, to live on an island,

160
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:46,080
and on that island to have a government based on Ayn Rand.

161
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,500
I think I read about that.

162
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,440
But they didn't seem to...

163
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,840
They didn't succeed at seceding.

164
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,260
Their succession was not successful.

165
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,680
Yeah, forming a new country is not that easy.

166
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,740
Who's going to take out the garbage?

167
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,580
You know, the biggest bluffers of all the political parties are the libertarians.

168
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,840
All they do is bluff.

169
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,100
We're going to set up our own government.

170
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,140
Yeah.

171
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,940
Knock yourself out.

172
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,520
Yes, and often they are exposed.

173
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,060
Yes.

174
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,820
The buff, too, in their private tweets, Twitters, and communications.

175
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,840
Like George W. Bush.

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,780
The strange story of those paintings that...

177
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,120
Wait.

178
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,780
We have several artists here that comment on that.

179
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,120
Here they are.

180
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:35,820
Take a look.

181
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,460
Judge your peers.

182
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,920
The strange nudes of George W. Bush.

183
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,980
Look closely.

184
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,880
What does this suggest?

185
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,660
Yes, you artists.

186
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,780
Finally, prove your worth by judging George W. Bush's art.

187
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,040
Not bad.

188
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,120
Some wiseacre wrote,

189
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,160
The enormous member, Nancy Drew mystery.

190
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,220
My favorite was, and I think Lies put it up,

191
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,760
was the picture with the reflection in the mirror.

192
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,760
Helen Gurley Brown, indeed.

193
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,820
Was the modified Jesus picture from Europe.

194
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,040
Oh, they modified Jesus yet again.

195
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,660
And that was in the Bush shower scene.

196
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,400
George has been hired to repair that fresco.

197
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,180
Finally.

198
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,780
Finally found his...

199
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,440
His calling.

200
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:20,720
Yeah.

201
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,740
They've given him a toothbrush and a spackle.

202
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,100
A trowel.

203
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,700
And house paint.

204
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,180
Even now, yeah, some house paint.

205
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:29,780
Spackle.

206
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,460
Why, that's...

207
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,820
I noticed one of the important news items this week, also for you artists,

208
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,160
was that, what's his name?

209
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,140
Picasso used house paint.

210
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:39,720
Picasso.

211
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,900
How dare he?

212
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,240
A house painter?

213
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,240
Exterior, or was it glossy or flat?

214
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,120
I think everything.

215
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,600
Whatever.

216
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,540
Whatever was in the cabinet.

217
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:50,700
Like children.

218
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,460
Things are really heating up over here.

219
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,260
But back in...

220
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,320
Bruno's finally where the action is.

221
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,100
But at what period was he?

222
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,260
It was a big night tonight.

223
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,880
It was his house painting period.

224
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,660
He just had a lot of it around.

225
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,320
Yeah, he was just painting houses, I see.

226
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,260
Oh, technicality.

227
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,560
From PR News in Washington, I'm hidden in a secret compartment in the boys' room.

228
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,180
That news has triggered a rally on Wall Street triggered by explosives in New Jersey.

229
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,420
Russia says this is PR News from Washington.

230
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,680
The White House says seven Chinese explosives triggered by a reaction to 17 coastal teenagers

231
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,560
that were to rushing to set off bombs ending the ongoing PR News in Washington.

232
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,760
The White House has seven Chinese explosives triggered by a reaction to 17 coastal teenagers

233
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:49,760


234
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,160
I could snuff him real easy with a pillow.

235
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,680
He must go the way he's expected to go.

236
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,540
Look, I've got a blade.

237
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,980
I could open up a lung.

238
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,640
If you look in the back there, you see I don't have a rug on the floor.

239
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,820
I got linoleum.

240
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,400
That's for puking people like you.

241
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,680
God damn it, who's going to clean up this mess?

242
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,380
I'm going to go clean up this mess.

243
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:19,440
I'm going to go clean up this mess.

244
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:49,740
I'm going to go clean up this mess.

245
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,820
Before the whole fucking world goes into the atomic sewer.

246
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,320
You two have a very abstract thing going here.

247
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,520
I'll flash my cock if you'll burn your draft card.

248
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,100
Worn out, harsh, wrung out.

249
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,740
Hands reaching in the air, grabbing at everything.

250
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,480
A lot of guys with boners.

251
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,960
A lot of girls in heat.

252
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,920
Everybody angry, crying, hard up.

253
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,180
Boners against blue jeans.

254
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,320
I look for rainbows and all I see is pink blue.

255
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,600
Look for flowers.

256
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,500
I see crap all over the oval room.

257
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:19,780


258
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,040
I look for father figures and I get Richard Milhous, Nixon and Spiro Agnew.

259
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,980
I look for love and all I get is napalm.

260
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,800
The lady is a poet.

261
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,520
The mystics could tell us.

262
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,600
The gurus, the medicine men.

263
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,500
They feel we're in the 15th round, the ninth inning.

264
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,160
In the capitals of the world, men who can no longer get their peckers up have found

265
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,700
a new way to get turned on.

266
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,960
They're the butchers of the world with their 18 pound sledgehammers.

267
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,760
The bacon for tomorrow's breakfast.

268
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:49,760


269
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,900
We'll have the peculiar color of ash.

270
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
I could stuff him with a pillow.

271
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,060
No, he must go the way he's expected to go.

272
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,380
Look, I've got a blade.

273
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,660
I could open up a lock.

274
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,800
That's right, he's got a choke on it.

275
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,020
When he prueba-

276
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,820
hold me.

277
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,780
I'm pushy.

278
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:43,780
credit roll

279
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:48,800
music

280
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:48,820
solo

281
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,440
music

282
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:49,720
music

283
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,000
If you look in the back there, you'll see I don't have a rug on the floor.

284
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,100
I got linoleum.

285
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,120
That's for people like you.

286
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,580
Rock and roll is dead.

287
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,120
Ah, yes, dear friends.

288
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:26,740
This is Hour of Slack number 1617, and I waited to do these credits until just after I had dental surgery.

289
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:35,900
My whole left side of my mouth is completely numb, so if I sound weird, that's why I waited until now to do these credits.

290
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:44,060
And I'm going to explain that song there, which was called The Bacon for Tomorrow's Breakfast by the Rudy Schwartz Project

291
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,720
from the newly revised...

292
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,520
The next version of the old album, Gunther Pax a Stiffy.

293
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,940
Reverend Joe Newman sent me this enhanced and reworked version with extra horns and marimba and guitar added.

294
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:04,840
It won't be on CD, he says, but it'll be out on iTunes on June 25th.

295
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:14,060
Anyway, the words of that song, or whatever it is, all come from the Larry Buchanan movie Down on Us,

296
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:22,560
which purports to show how the CIA and President Nixon killed Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison,

297
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,600
who are all played by actors in the movie.

298
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:35,380
The director, the late Larry Buchanan, is best known for sacred bad film like Zontar, Thing from Venus, and Mars Needs Women.

299
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,060
And since he couldn't afford the rights to the real songs and poems of those rock stars, he wrote his own for the movie.

300
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,940
So that song...

301
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:52,320
is me reciting fake Jim Morrison poetry actually written by that fellow Texas bad film maker.

302
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,460
Anyway, the titles and collages are by Leigh Murr.

303
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:05,460
The talking parts of this episode are all from the Ask Dr. Hal show of last February 22nd on Radio Valencia in San Francisco.

304
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:13,120
Other guests include Puzzling Evidence, Lies, McVridie's, Dr. Philodrummond, Pete Goldie,

305
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,020
and the mighty K-Rob.

306
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,220
By the time you hear this, X-Day may actually have already happened.

307
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:27,080
And I have a wish, a wish that this July 5th will prove this year to be the real 1998.

308
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,480
Your wish is granted even before you ask it.

309
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,640
Yes, this is the catbird seat.

310
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,420
You're pooping in the tall cotton now.

311
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,380
Here on the Ask Dr. Hal show...

312
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,900
That means you don't have to bend over, you just walk along.

313
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,300
Yes, let the undocumented workers clean up after you.

314
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,700
You don't even have to wipe.

315
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,700
It's the American way.

316
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,800
You just walk over the cotton.

317
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,280
Sauntering, walking, strolling.

318
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,200
And the cotton drags itself between your legs.

319
00:16:54,540 --> 00:17:02,000
Me and my shadow, strolling down the avenue, all alone and feeling blue, drinking this god awful stuff.

320
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,840
Does anybody want to help me consume it?

321
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,160
No, it's too horrible.

322
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,580
There's a lot of it.

323
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,220
You do the brunette.

324
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,280
Ah, dear.

325
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,680
It was developed to be like one of those snake oil that licks your...

326
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,600
Oh, good god.

327
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,320
The presence of demons resting on my thorax.

328
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,080
Dr. Brunette sold it as a cure-all from the first start.

329
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,820
Those imps are mighty hot stuff.

330
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:27,920
It does have the kind of taste like something you'd sell off the back of a covered wagon.

331
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,940
Well, that's where the rattlesnake heads...

332
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,620
A thousand, ten thousand devils.

333
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,480
...is a snake oil cure-all.

334
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,000
Yeah.

335
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,560
Dunk your nose.

336
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,680
Miracle cure-all.

337
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,720
You won't believe it.

338
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
Christ's blood streams in the firmament.

339
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,400
Grow herons, bald men.

340
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,660
The claws of a thousand devils.

341
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:41,660


342
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,760
Drag me to the pit.

343
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,560
The old barbershops.

344
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,500
The secret is Grandma's rag.

345
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:45,520


346
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,160
It was invented as a stomach medicine.

347
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,340
And it would be full of the liquid.

348
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,860
That's what its original purpose was.

349
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,400
Uh-huh.

350
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,180
Stomach medicine.

351
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,440
That's what it tastes like.

352
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,860
That liquid that they'd use to keep the combs in.

353
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,600
Uh, yes.

354
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,740
That, uh, it's like liquid they keep dentures in on the nightstand.

355
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,500
It's sort of a palliative that prevents bacteria from forming.

356
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,500
Just a hint of mint.

357
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,080
Drunk in the motion picture.

358
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:11,620
According to Wikipedia...

359
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:11,640
Uh, according to Wikipedia...

360
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,620
Clockwork orange.

361
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,160
Let's drop a match into it.

362
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,680
According to Wikipedia...

363
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,320
Nay.

364
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,520
...which is a truthy, kind of a truthy source...

365
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:17,780
Nay.

366
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,980
...it includes aloe from South Africa, rhubarb from China, ginseng from France...

367
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,360
Oh, well.

368
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,060
...gallon...

369
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,320
Would you like some wine, Hal?

370
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,600
Well, this is...

371
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,200
Why don't you just...

372
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,380
Actually, you shouldn't switch them.

373
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:30,720
...come a mile from Italy...

374
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,060
Well, Hal, just finish your Fernet and you can have some wine.

375
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,200
...saffron, myrrh, and elderflower.

376
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,760
This is one hell of a lot of disgusting furniture.

377
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,340
I'll have some of that.

378
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:37,920
I'll help you out.

379
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,980
...alcohol content is from 39 to 40 percent...

380
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,660
Alcohol content is from 39 to 40 percent.

381
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,420
Alcohol content, how many?

382
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,400
You know, from 39 to 40 percent...

383
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:45,400


384
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:45,440
...and...

385
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,480
They're just takers.

386
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,520
...is it 3 percent?

387
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,120
Is that in metric numbers?

388
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,020
They're just takers.

389
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,940
The 40 percent are people who expect the government to give them everything.

390
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,120
Don't they talk about X Day or something soon, or the end of the world, or Bob's word?

391
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,940
Let's talk about monsters and comics.

392
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,700
Don't they talk about water eyes and wattles, Boronia and Koolibah?

393
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,660
Remember the...

394
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:06,660
That's...

395
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,420
Like that, Hal.

396
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,220
Speaking of jokes...

397
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:11,520
...we're going to have a little fun.

398
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:11,560


399
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:11,560


400
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,980
I heard this funny joke the other day about the Y2K bug.

401
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,280
It was this.

402
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:28,180
It went kind of like, hey, did you hear that the Dark Ages were started by the Y1K bug?

403
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,860
Ha, ha, ha.

404
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:34,300
Well, that was a funny joke when I first heard it, but really, if you look into the history

405
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:41,640
of it, friends, the Dark Ages were really started by the Y2K bug.

406
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:41,640


407
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,700
And the Y2K bug is the Y0K bug.

408
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,180
And we don't have anything against it.

409
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,340
It's not really the Y0K bug's fault.

410
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,820
I mean, you know, we don't have anything against insects in this church.

411
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,600
In fact, some of us are insect sexuals.

412
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,680
We're into bug porn.

413
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,300
And, friends, to us, the Y2K bug is just more bug porn.

414
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,360
But the pincoots are running around like a bunch of nannies, threatening their precious

415
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:11,620
lives.

416
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,840
And the false slap devices are all going to get shut down, crash out, and fail to reboot

417
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,180
in the year 2000.

418
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,040
They should be so goddamn lucky, my friends.

419
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,860
Oh, they want the end of the world so bad.

420
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm afraid that what's really going to happen on January 1st, some gas pump in Idaho won't

421
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,220
work, and 150 white supremacists will kill each other fighting over it until somebody

422
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,140
plugs it in.

423
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,320
Oh, my name.

424
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:41,600
Oh, my name.

425
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,180
My name, Bob.

426
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:42,180


427
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,020
We're going to bring it on to the end of the world.

428
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,700
They're musking for the end of the world, friends, because of course when it happens

429
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,440
and they get saved, it proves that all the rest of us were dumbasses.

430
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,700
Isn't it nice that we aren't like that?

431
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:01,000
But it doesn't matter, friends, because we're out of here.

432
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,700
We're out of here on the form of the Y2K bug.

433
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,120
We're out of here on the Y1.999% bug, friends.

434
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,800
That's what Bob really meant.

435
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,600
Before the Y2K bug came along, we were pretty much unstoppable, and now we need to get rid

436
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,360
Before any of those YKs arrive, we're KY'd up.

437
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,300
We're gonna slide home free.

438
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,980
Day after tomorrow, we're gonna slide home free, baby.

439
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,480
On the X X A.

440
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,660
X Y Z.

441
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,720
X gear zero.

442
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,180
Ah yes, spread wide for the final ride.

443
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,360
Because the Xs are coming fast, and you are too.

444
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,940
They didn't take us seriously last time.

445
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,120
Hell, half of you didn't take us seriously.

446
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,340
Didn't take Dobbs' prophecy seriously.

447
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,140
But this time, we've learned our lesson.

448
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,820
We can't rely on invisible monsters from outer space.

449
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,780
We can't even rely on Bob.

450
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,960
We have to learn how to escape Earth

451
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,400
without being dependent on the conspiracy

452
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,080
or any extraterrestrials or salesmen.

453
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,720
Sure, send in your 30 bucks, but

454
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,920
build your own ship.

455
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,140
You may not have to, but just recover your ass.

456
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,420
Build your own ship.

457
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,360
Even better, go buy Hangar 18 or Area 51

458
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,240
or Cape Canaveral or Studio 54

459
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,300
and steal your own ship.

460
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,300
Ah yes, excrete your own fuel.

461
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,320
And while you're at it, friends,

462
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,500
let's swab the deck on the spaceship

463
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,660
that we're already stuck together on.

464
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,920
We're already running out of fuel.

465
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:38,920


466
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,860
We're running out of space ship.

467
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,420
And it's in bad shape.

468
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,440
And it's high time we cleaned it up.

469
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,360
Earth, we must get off.

470
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,800
Whether we leave it or leave it a cinder.

471
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,580
Whether we blow it off or blow it up,

472
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,480
just don't blow it, friends.

473
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,580
And, and, and, and, most, well, here's the thing.

474
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,140
Most circles will show this, but most of them won't.

475
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,360
Uh.

476
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,580
Now, why do some?

477
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:04,860
Yes.

478
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,880
And some of them don't.

479
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,740
We don't know?

480
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,520
We don't know.

481
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,680
But I think there's a number of possibilities.

482
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,360
Unable to think clearly, he loses his judgment.

483
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,880
Um, um, um, but first can I say, um, um, um, um,

484
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,580
and also, um, um, um.

485
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,720
That, that hurts.

486
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,360
After a while, it constitutes a form of duck.

487
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,060
Um.

488
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,360
I mean, why make it more complicated than a duck?

489
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,080
Um.

490
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,600
And, um, and, and, and, um, and, and, and, and, and, but.

491
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,020
Right?

492
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,260
It's getting really quiet around here.

493
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,400
This is the moment of change.

494
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,720
When we might experience.

495
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,340
Now we're coming back.

496
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,140
I think we have to make it go to the end of the character.

497
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,920
We want to go over the face of Bob itself.

498
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,980
Many, many take-el-o-far-see.

499
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,300
An invisible monster approaches.

500
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,300
Uh, uh, uh, giant footprints in the sand.

501
00:23:59,420 --> 00:23:59,640
Ah!

502
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,500
Oh, my goodness.

503
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:06,600
Uh, somebody's, uh, messing around with the, the musical offering.

504
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,380
Let's pay a look with my time.

505
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:08,380


506
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:08,380


507
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:08,380


508
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
We're taking a look at the little, tiny little computer here.

509
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,460
Tiny computers of great computing power these days.

510
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,840
Look at all those tiny cues that call the show.

511
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,560
The show explorer and the show rover.

512
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:19,880
I know.

513
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,620
This small computer has, has more power than the entire, like, strategic air command of

514
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:24,780
1955.

515
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,960
More powerful than a locomotive.

516
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,780
Able to leap over tall buildings at a single bound.

517
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,880
And what with these nuclear codes, which are lying right here over on the table.

518
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,820
You see.

519
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,380
You just put these in.

520
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:35,900
Tick, tick, tick.

521
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,480
Couldn't really fly at first.

522
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,380
He could just jump.

523
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,380


524
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,380


525
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,380


526
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,380


527
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,380


528
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,380


529
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,840
And land.

530
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,920
He, he ultimately ended up to flying somehow.

531
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,480
But he started out just jumping.

532
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,940
And then landing.

533
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,600
That's why it was significant that he could leap over a tall building at a single bound.

534
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,480
If he could fly, where would that be a, a something worth doing?

535
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,840
Or even worth talking about?

536
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:57,940
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

537
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,320
You're telling me he, he just jumped around?

538
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,100
He didn't really fly?

539
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,820
Originally, yes, he did.

540
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,080
His story was based on a World War I veteran named Hugo Danner.

541
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,100
Who, uh, actually was a super.

542
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,040
But of course not as super as Superman.

543
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,200
Nobody could be.

544
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,900
But he was able to leap over a tall building at a single bound.

545
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,880
And be shot at by Germans without being killed.

546
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:28,100
Because of his, uh, strange, uh, molecular and, uh, overall superiority.

547
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,740
I think it would say.

548
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,520
He ultimately ended up a suicide.

549
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,740
When he says angels, what he means is angels.

550
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,200
Uh, .

551
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,060
.

552
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,420
That he's talking about angels that are called angels.

553
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,520
That's not true.

554
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,480
Is because we know what the Bible says.

555
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,460
.

556
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,880
About the importance of important, incredibly sinful human beings.

557
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:50,980
.

558
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,900
He put his disease in me.

559
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,240
Now everything is back to normal.

560
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,060
He put his disease in me.

561
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,980
I'd like to thank each and every one of you for staying with us so far on the Ask Dr.

562
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,800
Howell Show, live on radio.

563
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,520
Uh, certain financial.

564
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:06,640
Thank you, thank you.

565
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,040
It's great to be here.

566
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,840
Take your time, Dr. Howell.

567
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,120
.

568
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,800
I'll have to take a few more considerations, make it.

569
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:08,840
.

570
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,340
How many are there?

571
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,760
It's great to be here, Dr. Howell.

572
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:10,840
.

573
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,180
Well, I, uh, uh.

574
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:12,300
.

575
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,900
Go to the listener's scope.

576
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,800
These people are so full of fun.

577
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:15,820
.

578
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,000
The number has disappeared from the screen, either that or there are none.

579
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:19,920
.

580
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,640
Nobody's chatterboxing anymore.

581
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,500
.

582
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,760
You know, our guests are quite, uh, quite, uh, quite polite and they like the, uh, studio

583
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,000
how.

584
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,140
.

585
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,380
They're following my story of Hugo Danner.

586
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:29,520
.

587
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:29,520


588
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:29,520


589
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,460
But if somebody who also mentions nose hair lint gland.

590
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:32,820
.

591
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,220
Yeah. .

592
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,860
Or NHLG as they call it. .

593
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,680
Really? They call it that?

594
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,540
Yeah, that's their pet name for it.

595
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,520
Nose hair, link lamp.

596
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:41,680
You're kidding.

597
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,900
We have Bruno and Iazel dominating the board.

598
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,980
Oh, I hate those guys.

599
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,220
They just make us sick.

600
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,100
Christian Talk 666.

601
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:59,080
Because now we have hot flashes, sleeplessness, low energy, irritability, and it's your fault.

602
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:04,640
In fact, we promise you'll love your hot sleepless irritability absolutely free.

603
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,120
But you have to call now.

604
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,780
Wow.

605
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,000
And call now.

606
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,560
And when people donate $30 a month to support Christian Talk 666.

607
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,760
Because now we have hormones.

608
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:19,380
I've been saying you're back on the air and every mic works, I think.

609
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,000
I'll take your word for it.

610
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,880
Yeah, we heard you.

611
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,500
Jack it in there.

612
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,460
Can you turn me up a bit?

613
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:24,960
Sure.

614
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,640
And I'm going to turn this down.

615
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,860
Take a turn.

616
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,620
I hear so much better through headphones, you know, when you see the colors.

617
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,860
The colors of the world are not quite as real as when you fitted them on the camera.

618
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,580
Exactly.

619
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,080
Did you find what you were looking for in the minibar?

620
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,220
Reeler than real.

621
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:45,940
Yeah.

622
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,540
Ivan Stang.

623
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,100
I found it.

624
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,320
Of this vintage motion picture.

625
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,080
I found it.

626
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,160
By the way, I can call you Ivan Stang too, right?

627
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,720
Yeah.

628
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,720
Yeah, Reverend.

629
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,420
It's Reverend Stang 1.0.

630
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,700
I don't recognize any religion whatsoever, even your silly one.

631
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,000
So do I have to say Reverend?

632
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,140
I would like to address everyone as sort of like Mr. or Mrs.

633
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,560
Or Dr.

634
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,400
In case of anyone talking to me.

635
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:13,400
So how should I call you Mr. Stang or do I have to say Reverend Stang?

636
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:13,860
No, I hate Mr. Stang.

637
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,380
Captain or Colonel.

638
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,080
Captain, I recognize military rank.

639
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,660
Do you have military rank of any sort?

640
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,620
No.

641
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,020
Maybe you're in the Boy Scouts.

642
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,400
Do you achieve any power?

643
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,000
All my offense is rank.

644
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
First class, tenderfoot.

645
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,520
Smells to heaven.

646
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:29,880
Life.

647
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,900
It hath the primal elders cursed upon it.

648
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,560
Come on.

649
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
Wendy goes Stang.

650
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,920
Do you have any licensing?

651
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,480
Any contractor's license?

652
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,580
I can call you licensed or maybe you're a commissioner of some sort.

653
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,640
Licensed to chill.

654
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,100
How about the honorable if you're in the legal profession anyway?

655
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,100
The right honorable Ivan Stang.

656
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,780
To be wicked, Stang.

657
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,960
There should be some other considerations.

658
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,600
To be witch, to be wathered, and be wicked.

659
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,440
Maybe you're a comptroller.

660
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,440
I've got it all.

661
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,020
Plumber?

662
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,360
No, I'm not really.

663
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,880
Oh, best boy.

664
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,280
Oh, I've always wondered about that.

665
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,680
Best boy Stang.

666
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,840
Yeah, I've actually been a, I've worked as a best boy.

667
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,320
Excellent.

668
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,820
I've always wondered about that.

669
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,220
Now.

670
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,420
And they get to stay in best western motels, don't they?

671
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:25,620
From PR News in Washington, I'm on the rise, increasing by nearly 11% in almost seven years.

672
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,600
President Obama is the biggest sophisticated yukiguchi in all 20 of the nation's largest cities.

673
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,080
PR News.

674
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,840
Can't hurt.

675
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,600
The White House.

676
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:42,840
PR's report shows the White House press secretaries made their case for greater U.S. support under intense pressure from France and anti-aircraft missiles.

677
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,200
Sweden's foreign minister says this is PR News.

678
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,080
Uh, I think it's extremely important.

679
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,620
Uh.

680
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,060
Federal prosecutors are running a $6 billion money laundering operation.

681
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,800
One of the principal means by which cyber criminals around the world distribute, store, and launder.

682
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,160
PR News in Washington.

683
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,140
What is Monster Zero?

684
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,160
The demon of our galaxy.

685
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,040
Monster Zero is the reason we cannot live on the surface, but must forever live underground like this.

686
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,720
Alert all units.

687
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,140
Monster has begun the attack.

688
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,640
Everything is numbered here.

689
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,700
The monster is zero.

690
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,600
Emergency.

691
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,300
Emergency.

692
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,200
The hydrogen oxide plant has been damaged.

693
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,320
Well, here's how it works.

694
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,700
It's just like in Monster Hunter.

695
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,120
Except that I don't think we'll see the gen-prey.

696
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,440
We're in, uh, Valley...

697
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,480
What we...

698
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,240
In the game, it would be Area 2.

699
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,680
Or maybe Area 3.

700
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,400
I'm not sure.

701
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,540
And they call it Valley 2 or Valley 3.

702
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:59,000
But when we go down there towards that exit, it'll suddenly say loading and there'll be some hieroglyphs.

703
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,540
And then we'll suddenly be over in Valley 1, which is...

704
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,020
Leads up to the base camp.

705
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,420
Where the pinks are.

706
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,100
Okay.

707
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,540
The robot people that, you know, the village where you talk to the people and they just repeat the same thing every time.

708
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,020
Yeah.

709
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,140
And it's always the same people every time.

710
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:23,880
And only if you do something really important do they treat you differently and say different things.

711
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,780
But we have become a rank 3 team.

712
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,280
So we should be able to go over...

713
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,360
Back to the village and they'll be treating us all very differently.

714
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:42,260
Because we finished the gathering quest in, uh, Valley 3.

715
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:45,900
Righto.

716
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,200
But we're running out of cool drinks.

717
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:48,820
Oh, yeah.

718
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,960
So our yellow line is getting lower and lower.

719
00:31:54,340 --> 00:32:00,000
And hopefully if we don't knock ourselves out or run into any...

720
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,260
Gendry...

721
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,800
We'll be able to get through okay.

722
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,640
Ah!

723
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,560
Ah!

724
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,520
Ah!

725
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:24,860
Ah!

726
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,820
Ah!

727
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:26,860
Ah!

728
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,020
Ah!

729
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,360
Ah!

730
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:28,220


731
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:28,220


732
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,220
Ah!

733
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,380
Ah!

734
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,460
Ah!

747
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,560
They will create your subgenius video game after all,

748
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,120
and make a fortune which will be denied unto you and I.

749
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:41,660
Grand Theft Planet. I just saw the title.

750
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,480
Boy, you've really still got it, Stane.

751
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,880
Well, I did just now come up with it.

752
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,620
But, no, two nights ago I had the vision of the video game.

753
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,920
I think I described it on the Puzzling Evidence Show.

754
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,880
So two nights passed.

755
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,820
A night so dismayed, saddened and stunned.

756
00:38:59,000 --> 00:38:59,700
The coming day.

757
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,900
You have to do a station ID.

758
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:10,080
You're listening to the Ask Dr. Hal show live on radio

759
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:15,100
in the pulsating heart of San Francisco's Mission District.

760
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,800
Until 1 a.m. we'll be on the air with our merry coterie of roisterers.

761
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,500
Until we finally go our separate ways.

762
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,580
Until the repetition of our efforts the very next week

763
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,100
for Goofball.

764
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:32,460
Radio.

765
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,100
I've just got to say I love all you guys out there.

766
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,040
You wonderful folks.

767
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,060
It's you who keep us going.

768
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,400
And when I say us, I don't just mean some flim-flam fly-by-night radio thing.

769
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,520
No, I mean the entire church of the subgenius.

770
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,340
Every wriggling little subgenius.

771
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,040
Like a maggot-filled body when you cut it open.

772
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,920
Spills out to forward.

773
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,540
There's more than we can deal with.

774
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,180
We see it as life.

775
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,180
Life.

776
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,920
Life in development.

777
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,700
Life and life's effluents.

778
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,100
Okay, Hal, that was pretty good.

779
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,360
Can you do another one for the Japanese audience now?

780
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,240
That's quite a station ID.

781
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,360
All I have to do is say WCSB Cleveland.

782
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:21,560
While eating dinner, this dear little child was choked on a piece of beef.

783
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:29,620
Doctors came, tried their skill a while, but none could give relief.

784
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,260
Did you mention RadioValencia.fm?

785
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,120
RadioValencia.fm.

786
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,260
Yeah, I did, actually.

787
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,380
Yeah, not 87.9 megahertz.

788
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,160
Oh, it really does, too, but I'm just stifling the pain.

789
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,360
Yes, RadioValencia.fm.

790
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,460
And remember, folks, that's real.

791
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,800
That's the D.T. Earle of this.

792
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,060
It's not RadioValencia.fm.com, nor .org.

793
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,860
It's just .fm.

794
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,760
All righty.

795
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,960
Be that way.

796
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,100
Yeah, we're the only one.

797
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,680
We're the only .fm in the whole Internet.

798
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,420
Really?

799
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:10,900
Yeah.

800
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,140
Ah, .'s incredible, ladies and gentlemen.

801
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,500
.'s really fantastic.

802
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,000
Somebody who knows how to work under the hood must have swung that.

803
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,560
The only .fm?

804
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,360
Seriously?

805
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,760
Radio.fm?

806
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,620
Yeah, there's some .s before my eyes.

807
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,060
I can't explain it.

808
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,360
All I have to say is, if it wasn't for that, there wouldn't be a show.

809
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,440
We wouldn't be here.

810
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,520
None of this would be happening.

811
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,040
Can you imagine?

812
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,680
Can you imagine a world, a universe, where we weren't allowed to be on the radio?

813
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,180
What is this, a pledge drive?

814
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,020
Can you just imagine?

815
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,520
Well, pledge your drive now.

816
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,800
Yes, it's time for you to pledge your break.

817
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:00,960
Because I've used that same horny old line on pledge drive every pledge.

818
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,480
I've used that same horny old line on pledge drive a couple of times a year.

819
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,320
Listen, you can't knock success.

820
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:12,000
Now, I'm going to put in a call to the Federation and tell them that you've been doing excellent work out here in the boondocks.

821
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:28,700
But now we're going to go back to the old familiar star systems, and I think you're going to find out that it's changed while you've been out here rusticating, as it were, in the lesser nebular cluster of 112A.

822
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,980
Well, when I signed up, they said it.

823
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,300
It'd be 200 years later when we came back.

824
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:40,980
That's true, but everyone doesn't care about that old business of, you know, dying, they used to call it.

825
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:48,980
So, we're all still here, and you have acquired quite a debt in your absence from unpaid vouchers.

826
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,260
Which I'm going to show you right here.

827
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,180
See, they're massive, the size of a mountain.

828
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:57,260
How much more than 200 years have we been out?

829
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,000
Well, actually, the galaxy has...

830
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,900
Made three quarters of a turn.

831
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:03,380
What?

832
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:09,460
Yes, yes, you won't recognize our old solar system when we get back.

833
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,240
Well, perhaps the stock market, you know.

834
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,840
Stock market?

835
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,940
That's, that's, that's, I mean...

836
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,720
No, I'm afraid...

837
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:18,780
I'm rich, right?

838
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,500
No, not in the material things.

839
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,200
Well, I deposited 15 cents in every savings and loan in America.

840
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,680
That makes you, uh, emperor of this quadrant.

841
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:31,640
Yay!

842
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,900
This jungle is yours.

843
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,040
Yes, their jungle.

844
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,080
Nice holodeck, man.

845
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,620
The entire planet is covered with jungle.

846
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,060
Did you see the, the ads for that movie?

847
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,240
That irritating movie that they...

848
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:44,660
Holodeck?

849
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,000
No, it's a movie where...

850
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,580
Holodeck 2?

851
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,260
Everybody in the... leaves the planet because it's just too dangerous.

852
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,200
Son of the holodeck.

853
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,080
First it was, it was contaminated, then it has dangerous life forms, but one person gets to live there.

854
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,560
Tom Cruise.

855
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,140
Yay!

856
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:00,620
Yay!

857
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:00,940
Yay!

858
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,080
Not Tom Hanks.

859
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,680
The most overprivileged person imaginable, and they give it to him?

860
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,440
The whole Earth.

861
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,100
The whole Earth?

862
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,300
You know, he used to be like the ranger living on the planet.

863
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,180
You know, uh, they showed a whole bunch of strange previews.

864
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:14,480
That was one of them.

865
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,920
Does he have to give tours at 2 o'clock and 10 o'clock?

866
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:21,960
Well, it's supposedly, you know, all the life is dangerous, and they have giant spiders or something.

867
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,040
It's hard to tell that it moves so fast, you can't really see it.

868
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,140
I was complaining about a movie with giant spiders.

869
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,600
Well, not that, but that, that, that one guy who gets to be there...

870
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:40,920
But he's already gotten more than most people ever else will, and so they give him planet Earth to, uh, be cocky and brash upon him.

871
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:41,440
Tom Cruise, all people.

872
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,620
Everybody else has to live in...

873
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,440
But it should have been Will Smith all this time.

874
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:47,380
Everybody else has to be on an asteroid farm.

875
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,820
Well, really, they should just resume Hell in the Pacific with Tom Cruise and Will Smith.

876
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,160
And Lee Marvin and, uh...

877
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,400
No, as Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune.

878
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,900
Yeah, they should just set that up, you know, and it's a, more of a racial tone.

879
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,460
The last two men on Earth.

880
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:00,820
Really?

881
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:06,340
Then we could have the last three men on Earth with Vincent Price, Will Smith, and John F. Wilson.

882
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,260
Vincent Price would be 108.

883
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,800
He'd be in a wheelchair.

884
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:10,460
Yeah.

885
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:12,780
But he would have the mental power of 20 guys.

886
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,840
He's really tired of making movies at that point.

887
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,280
He's really, just looks at his heart.

888
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:20,360
But he still has the mental power of Coral of Pandan.

889
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,220
He lives in Southern California until he died.

890
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:23,640
He didn't even...

891
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,560
Even Old Parr didn't live that long, or did he?

892
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,340
I can't remember.

893
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:27,860
Jack Parr?

894
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:28,880
Old Parr.

895
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:29,960
Oh, Old Parr.

896
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,120
World's oldest living human.

897
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:33,860
Uh...

898
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,660
There he goes.

899
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,460
He, uh...

900
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:35,980
Well...

901
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:36,320
Again.

902
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:44,860
And then what about the giant spider that lived in the church tower that came down at night to drink the oil in the lamp?

903
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:45,940
Well...

904
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,060
But that's where the Beatles got their inspiration.

905
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,580
Yes, uh...

906
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:53,700
Lester, Jeter, and Jinkum Beatle.

907
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:57,300
The Beatles got their inspiration from Bruno's on Friday night.

908
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,240
Well, everybody did in those days, but...

909
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,240
Yes, the Beatles...

910
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:00,320
Bruno's...

911
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:00,940
The Beatles.

912
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:02,980
The four mop tops.

913
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,220
Everybody hang out at Bruno's back in those days.

914
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:04,520
Fab.

915
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,220
And gear.

916
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,740
And all that.

917
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,820
Yeah, just like the...

918
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:08,980
Permission to come aboard.

919
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,020
Yep, there we go.

920
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,740
Well, there they went, jettisoned into space.

921
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,440
Now, was rock and roll a CIA plot?

922
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,000
No, I don't think it was one that escaped the farm.

923
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,520
I don't, you know, I, uh...

924
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,260
I don't know what you feel about it.

925
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:29,100
It couldn't possibly just be a spontaneous outgrowth of old people's countries.

926
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,300
Never say never.

927
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:35,540
Do these people down on the floor here know that the world's going to end in July, whatever it is?

928
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:40,520
I have a growing sense of unease, which tells me that, yes, the world is going to end.

929
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:44,480
But, uh, I expect to be there at the saucer landing site.

930
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,740
Oh, yes, that's right, everyone.

931
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,380
I'm going to ascend into the...

932
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,640
To the zenith.

933
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,520
Yes, this is my desire.

934
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,680
And the very least I can expect.

935
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,000
After so many years laboring in the vineyards of...

936
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:00,980
Bob.

937
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,360
So we're not going to take any chances.

938
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:08,860
This time we're building catapults to send these geniuses from...

939
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,480
Yeah, it looks like the audience eats it up.

940
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,460
Oh, they would love to see other people get catapulted.

941
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,640
If the saucers don't get close enough.

942
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,580
Against the sides of the pleasure saucers.

943
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,260
If they miscalculate, yes.

944
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:22,780
Spangry.

945
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,560
I must head for the, uh...

946
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:26,640
Oh, no.

947
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,720
I missed the...

948
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,240
Oh, no, the crowd disapproves of Dr. Al leaving the stage.

949
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,760
Well, I'm sorry, folks.

950
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,900
I'm only flesh and blood here.

951
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:43,160
One by one, all of the show people are winding up outside in the anti-wind.

952
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,100
Having their bags checked by the lovely space maidens.

953
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,820
Hey, hands off those old bags.

954
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,120
It's warm in here.

955
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,200
It's cold here.

956
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,940
Now, there's windows open.

957
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:54,380
Cool.

958
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,260
They'll keep well wrapped up.

959
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,720
Watch the crowd on TV.

960
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,100
Watch the crowd on TV.

961
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,620
Watch the crowd on TV.

962
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,900
Watch the crowd on TV.

963
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,000
Watch the crowd on TV.

964
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,160
Watch the crowd on TV.

965
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,160
On TV.

966
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,600
Head for the mountains.

967
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,640
Where the beer flows down, boys.

968
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,260
I'm driving.

969
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,060
Drunk like a bum.

970
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,540
Counting up his counts.

971
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,120
Astounding.

972
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,380
The flip effect of a trip.

973
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,700
You rig whatever the set.

974
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,860
It's dissection of the insect intellect, boy.

975
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,480
I tell you.

976
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:49,000
Bug brain go bots.

977
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:53,280
While the anvils, they drop one after another.

978
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,040
That X marks the spot.

979
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,160
Boys, I tell you.

980
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,300
Them go bots.

981
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:03,700
Brains infected with their master's blood.

982
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,300
Out of my face.

983
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,500
With my son, you're headed for destruction.

984
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:14,700
You're living a life through sin and corruption.

985
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:23,080
You can suck a dick for talking that shit about the way I function.

986
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,140
It's all over.

987
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,860
Ha ha.

988
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,300
Come on, child.

989
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,520
You can take my hand.

990
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,360
Blessed is the day you give up your own control.

991
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,980
Over your own lame brain.

992
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,660
Do you love the queen of pussies?

993
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,660
Pretending you know what the game is.

994
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,800
But who really deals the cards?

995
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,880
You as long as me.

996
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,000
We're both retards.

997
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,140
The End

998
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:28,800
Thanks for watching.

999
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:28,860
If you liked the game, give us a like.

1000
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,300
You don't know when to stop and go.

1001
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:30,300


1002
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:30,300


1003
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:30,300


1004
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:38,100
Thank you.

1005
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,640
Thank you.

1006
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,520
Thank you.

1007
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,720
Thank you.

1008
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,680
Thank you.

1009
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,460
Thank you.

1010
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:34,920
Thank you.

1011
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,020
Thank you.

1012
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,400
Thank you.

1013
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,700
Thank you.

1014
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,920
That was the Rudy Schwartz project,

1015
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:51,300
the song This Wind Fallen Wood

1016
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,480
from the album Full Frontal Klugman,

1017
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,840
as was the strange instrumental earlier,

1018
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,660
the evocatively titled

1019
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:00,100
Song of the Coastal

1020
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:06,240
artillery women. In between those, the even crazier music and ranting was by the great groovy Neptune

1021
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:12,780
of Austin, Texas. And much earlier in the show, the X-Day preaching about how build your own ship

1022
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:22,820
was from the 1999 XX Day drill with Einstein's Secret Orchestra doing that music. And now,

1023
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:28,560
for some good closing nerd geek talk, back to the Ask Dr. Hal show.

1024
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:37,440
And someone is mentioning The Human Stain by Philip Roth. Not to be confused with the E.G.

1025
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:45,280
Saburi, a Japanese monster movie, The Human Vapor. Or with the Hunan restaurant, whose spicy collations

1026
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:52,660
often evince a vaporous cloud of their own. No, The Human Stain is an improbable story where Anthony

1027
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:58,600
Hopkins gets to have sex with the much younger Nicole Kidman and then gets run off the road

1028
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,760
fatally by

1029
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,060
a

1030
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:00,080
human.

1031
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:06,780
And it's a movie not without some subgenius attributes.

1032
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,220
What movie is that?

1033
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,140
The Human Stain.

1034
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,680
I missed that one.

1035
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:23,600
Well, it's rather interesting because, well, I don't want to give the plot away, but there are some surprises. Yes, movies are your best entertainment value. So, any questions?

1036
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,600
I can't remember my question. I finally had one question.

1037
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,080
How about...

1038
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:30,540
Ask Dr. Hal.

1039
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:37,140
The movie that Sam Raimi's brother made called Lunatics, A Love Story. Have you ever seen that one?

1040
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,380
Ted Raimi?

1041
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:38,700
Yeah.

1042
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:39,040
Yes.

1043
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,880
Lunatics, A Love Story?

1044
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:41,740
Yeah.

1045
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,320
With all those great stop-motion giant spider sequences.

1046
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,820
I guess I better...

1047
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:48,900
You should check that one out.

1048
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,520
Watch the media ditch and see if that one floats up to the surface.

1049
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:59,100
And K-Rob is considering creating a mash-up of the Crater Lake monster and the climax of Dinosaurus.

1050
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,060
So, there's...

1051
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,420
There is reason to keep living.

1052
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,280
Yeah.

1053
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:12,960
Where prehistoric archosaurs are killed with power tools operated by rednecks, and they splice together in incredibly effortless fashion.

1054
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,360
But they can be brought to life by lightning.

1055
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,920
No, not after they've been hacked by backhoes and steam shovels.

1056
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,440
Nothing will bring them back.

1057
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,520
Only after they've been buried under the ocean for 80 million years.

1058
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:26,560
That's where they were.

1059
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,220
Because...

1060
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,440
A good bolt of lightning will bring a dinosaur.

1061
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:30,040
As you may know...

1062
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:33,380
They never were present on those islands in geological history.

1063
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:33,780
Right.

1064
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,140
But on the ocean bed, you might find them.

1065
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,380
Is that how they got mixed up with that caveman?

1066
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:42,280
Well, the caveman may have been blown far out to sea.

1067
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,100
He wasn't allowed to tell his story.

1068
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:49,680
But he died nobly, holding up the mine timbers like Flynn of Virginia.

1069
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:55,900
Yes, there's much to learn from his humble, simple story.

1070
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:59,040
And he looked like the plastic...

1071
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:07,940
Louis Marx cavemen to an uncanny extent, which themselves were based on a painting by Charles R. Knight called Cavemen of the Neanderthal Race.

1072
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,620
You've seen those little ones.

1073
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,900
You have some down in your basement.

1074
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,160
They've been chewed by a cat, I'm afraid.

1075
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:14,940
I examined them.

1076
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,840
They're covered with punctures.

1077
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:21,340
I saved the one who is napping Flint and put him with my rock collection.

1078
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:24,440
He's wearing a little nappy for decency's sake.

1079
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,080
Anyway, I'd love to get those.

1080
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,080
You can still get them.

1081
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:28,980
They cost like $10.

1082
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,780
$10 a piece on the collector's market.

1083
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:37,020
Didn't we tediously cover the Marx series of toys on one of the last week's shows?

1084
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,600
No, but I'd be willing to.

1085
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:41,820
The Marx series at one time seemed...

1086
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,880
Surely this will get the comment board lit up again.

1087
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:50,580
Well, I'll check and see if they're interested in hearing about the Louis Marx company.

1088
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,820
Not Karl Marx.

1089
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,360
You've been listening to the subgenius,

1090
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,700
radio ministry,

1091
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,780
hour of slack.

1101
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,760
Praise Bob!

1102
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,540
You rats.

1103
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,940
You stinking rats!

1104
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,800
What did you do to her?

1105
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,900
Our actions are controlled by electronic computers,

1106
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,700
not by human emotions.

1107
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,800
When that law is violated,

1108
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,840
the offender is eliminated.

1109
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,040
Commander!

1110
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:49,940
What is it?

1111
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,660
The Earth prisoners have escaped.

1112
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:52,500
What?

1113
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,380
Five hours to go.

1114
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,900
Everything proceeding as calculated.

1115
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,500
That's good.

1116
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,380
We change our plans.

1117
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,040
We begin the attack on Earth now.

1118
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,220
Control, sir.

1119
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,840
Computer shows a discrepancy.

1120
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,040
Why?

1121
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:16,760
Computer five, what is the trouble?

1122
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:17,900
We're checking.

1123
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:20,620
All right.

1124
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,080
We change our plans.

1125
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:25,840
We begin the attack on Earth now.

1126
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:27,640
We begin the attack on Earth now.

1127
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:29,020
We begin the attack on Earth now.

1128
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:29,180
What's the tape?

1129
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:32,020
The tape show, red dots are decreasing.

1130
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:32,820
The red dots on Earth show, red dots are decreasing.

1131
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:33,120
Good.

1132
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:33,660
Good.

1133
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,960
Monster 01 and 02,

1134
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,000


1135
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:37,560
commence the attack.

1136
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:38,940
Monster 01 and 02, commence the attack.

1137
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:41,540
Go!

1138
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:43,640
Go!

1139
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:49,820
Monster 01 and 02, commence the attack.

1140
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:49,820


1141
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:50,700
Go!

1142
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:50,760
Go!

1143
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,060
Thank you.
