1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
And always remember to put the name of the show on the envelope with your...

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,580
A pledge...

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,760
A check...

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,420
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slap.

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,900
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,600
Hoping your time is all time, and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,800
Here is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

8
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,140
Folks, before I bring our star out, you know what the hell, a joke's a joke, right?

9
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:54,460
And, I mean, he kids a lot about religion, you know, and lesbians, and dope, and politics.

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,080
But what the hell, yeah?

11
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,880
He was in the service for three...

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,500
Three years, and, uh...

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,860
They had once attacked him, and felled him to the pavement.

14
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,060
He was taken to the receiving hospital where his wounds were dressed.

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,720
Thanks a lot, Pete. That's all the Laugh-A-While news.

16
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,460
Welcome, dear friends, to the Laugh-A-While news.

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,900
We'll ask you to laugh along with us for a while, while we do the news.

18
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,920
Are you from Fresno?

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,820
Things are getting crazier all the time, Ted.

20
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,820
Crazier and crazier all the time.

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,120
But they're all making news, and it's all news, and it's all informal.

22
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,620
Bah!

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,960
Eternal salvation.

24
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,400
Or triple your money back.

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,680
The Church of the Subgenius.

26
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:50,000
Bring you another 33 minutes of condensed, eraglic function.

27
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:57,240
Over the quality audio-visual techniques exacerbated and complicated.

28
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,200
By the Church of the Subgenius.

Copyright 1985-86.

30
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,620
Oh, Dr. Sproul.

31
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,460
What about the code, Bill? Are we doing all right?

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,040
Well, so far, I've got a copy here of the production code.

33
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,020
I think the talk of murder, Professor...

34
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:25,300
Initially, of course, the code says that the technique of murder must not be presented in a way that will inspire imitation.

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,640
And, uh...

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,260
And, uh...

37
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:27,460
And, uh...

38
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:27,880
And, uh...

39
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,160
Uh...

40
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,340
Uh...

41
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:28,640
Uh...

42
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,500
Brutal killin-

43
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:29,940
Get on with it!

44
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,140
Brutal killings are not to be represented in detail.

45
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,480
That is, revenge in modern times shall not be...

46
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,900
Uh, Ted, I think that you missed an important point there.

47
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,460
Ted!

48
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:39,960
Uh!

49
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,320
Oh, memories.

50
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:55,820
Memories.

51
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:56,100
Memories.

52
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,000
Memories.

53
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:57,860
Memories.

54
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:57,880
Memories.

55
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:57,880


56
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,380
We ain't got no legs.

57
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,780
That means I ain't got no legs, you ain't got no legs,

58
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,920
and them men in there ain't got no legs.

59
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,740
Now, what does that sound like to you?

60
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
The self-genius.

61
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,960
It gets up and kills.

62
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,980
The people it kills get up and kill.

63
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,340
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show,

64
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,580
the listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials

65
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,240
in the event of any material from this radio or other listening device being inhaled during broadcast.

66
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,300
Ah, yes.

67
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,520
Oh, friends.

68
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,200
Good to be back with you, although, you know,

69
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,900
your dear host and prayer partner, Reverend Stang,

70
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,320
may have to admit something to you.

71
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,340
We're kind of in trouble here.

72
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,060
I should say I'm in trouble with the conspiracy.

73
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:05,940
We told the conspiracy we'd have this new subgenius book finished by now.

74
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,900
And, well, actually, we told them we'd have it finished last August.

75
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,060
And then we told them we'd have it finished by now.

76
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,080
And we still don't.

77
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:23,100
And until we finish that new subgenius book, Revelation X, the Bob Apocryphon,

78
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,360
why we can't finish the start, the fifth.

79
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,560
We're going to have to go to the book magazine and can't get any other jobs.

80
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,060
And we don't get paid to look for that.

81
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,660
And can't do a whole lot of our slack preparation when you're chained to that computer.

82
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:49,140
So, but what you do end up with is lots and lots of pages of words.

83
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,040
And those words, I mean, it's going to be a year before you read those words.

84
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,340
So, instead, you're just going to have to hear.

85
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,520
Some of those words from Revelation X, the Bob Apocryphon.

86
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,560
And as it says here on this particular script, dear friends,

87
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:17,680
did you know that through the church of the subgenius, you can learn to live with your sins?

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,500
Oh, yes, dear friends.

89
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:26,080
Because, you know, we in this church, we use promises of sex to lure converts.

90
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,400
And so come and get it, man.

91
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,500
I mean, here we are.

92
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,800
Come and get it.

93
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,480
It's not pornography, officer.

94
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,320
It's empowerment.

95
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:48,240
And my friends, my lady, you can learn to masturbate without going blind.

96
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,720
You can perform astral sex with anyone you want.

97
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,560
You can, you, yes, you can have intercourse.

98
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,640
With beautiful, live, nude, why mine?

99
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,740
Or damn near anything else.

100
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,660
Because Bob, friends, Bob is a sex god.

101
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,980
And he has come, and come again to rationalize your sins.

102
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:19,380
Through the master Bob's patented techniques of astrochemistry.

103
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,460
And B.B. Wow's amazing tantric deviational technology.

104
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,580
You will learn the real secret behind magic.

105
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,560
And you will learn the real secret behind magic.

106
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,940
And freemasonry.

107
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,200
Sex hurts, trademarked, until it feels so good.

108
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,540
It hurts.

109
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,340
Yes, the restrained fury of fornication.

110
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:50,100
It can be re-channeled to release hidden energies which allow communication with higher intelligences from the stars.

111
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,400
Plus, your orgasmotic radiation.

112
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,880
Or aetheric fallout from any sex.

113
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,160
Not for procreation.

114
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,520
Will affect the genes of the normals around you.

115
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,880
Causing their kids to be born subgeniuses.

116
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,100
You now have not only a right, but a duty.

117
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,200
A duty to do anything you want.

118
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,080
With any consenting partner.

119
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,120
And we'll help you find at least one.

120
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,360
Free blessing cloth with every orgasm.

121
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,860
Our women are screaming dimly.

122
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,380
We'll meet you lonely lads and lassies.

123
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,540
And our men are dying to ravish you subgenius gals and guys.

124
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:41,000
We honestly don't care what you look like.

125
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,620
So don't fall for the bashful act.

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,360
Politely state your intentions.

127
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,200
Politely is the key word here.

128
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,620
And then sit back and watch the action begin.

129
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,680
.

130
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,600
It's that simple.

131
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,160
You'll be able to quit or start doing it in a matter of days.

132
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,780
Eases recovery.

133
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,360
Don't bother with old fashioned dowsing rods ever again.

134
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,820
Repels fleas, flies and locusts for seven days.

135
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,740
Superb marital aid.

136
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,300
Keep dry the masculine way.

137
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,120
Satisfy your every fetish.

138
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,920
Your sweetie will never know you used it.

139
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,240
Weight loss.

140
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,400
Hair growth.

141
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,560
Romance.

142
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,980
No ma'am.

143
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,120
You won't care how dumb he is when you see these incredible results.

144
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,480
A purer ooze than drugs, the bible or even TV.

145
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,460
Imagine.

146
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,480
No danger of stained clothing.

147
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,940
Truly invisible.

148
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,040
Won't rustle.

149
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,520
Amazingly comfortable.

150
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,440
All pulp chassis is flexible yet resilient.

151
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,140
No more difficult de-spumming.

152
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,340
.

153
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,480
Name one other religion that can make these claims.

154
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:54,260


155
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,080
Industriosexuals?

156
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,440
Are you guilty of no sex appeal?

157
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,360
You can be more attractive with brain enlargement surgery.

158
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,800
Develop a fuller frontal lobe like Barbie.

159
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:15,240
Overcome shyness and guilt with this perfect replacement for a huge penis or gigantic breast.

160
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,520
Strap it on.

161
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,840
Your subconscious will do the rest.

162
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,600
Why balk at anything?

163
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,660
Lose your pants with amazing slack.

164
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,720
There are worse fantasies.

165
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,000
Take and keep it off.

166
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,060
Get out of the dark.

167
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,460
Drum the peeper and rub the dilation.

168
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,020
We love it too.

169
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,700
Do you go soft too soon?

170
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,100
There's nothing to inflate.

171
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,140
No zippers or snaps.

172
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,120
Just slip it on over your inhibitions and wow.

173
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,700
Don't worry about the abrasions if you start to overheat.

174
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,140
Automatic stake in the heart shuts it right down.

175
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,920
You'll shout hallelujah P-Dawg when you feast your eyes on this little sweetheart.

176
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,240
She jiggles.

177
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,420
She shakes.

178
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,620
She oozes like a prairie squid on a hot platter.

179
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,960
But best of all.

180
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,700
You can be a virgin or an atheist.

181
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,220
And we'll still let you be a subgenius.

182
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:39,520
And thanks to Reverend Gene Oside for that lovely background music.

183
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,040
You are now about to begin.

184
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,940
The Grinch.

185
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:45,940


186
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:45,940


187
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,320
A great adventure.

188
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,400
The journey out of the mild.

189
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,480
Watch out little one.

190
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,520
Don't be scared.

191
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,140
Come sit with me on my favorite fucking chair.

192
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,040
Please tell me a story Mr. Mushroom.

193
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,920
Well then.

194
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,200
Would you like to hear something really scary?

195
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,400
Hmm?

196
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,740
It's right.

197
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,260
Mr. Mushroom smartphones.

198
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:57,300
optic

199
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:12,760
communicate

200
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:12,900
ask

201
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,020
you

202
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:16,620
Thank you.

203
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,760
Oh, yes, baby.

204
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,820
And while, well, shoot, while that little piece of music,

205
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,800
well, that made me think.

206
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,200
I ought to play a song, yes?

207
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,180
I should.

208
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,640
I don't want to have to just preach your heads off all day and all night.

209
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,520
There is a little song that I could,

210
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,760
what am I going to do, get these darn buttons,

211
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,520
you've got to push all the right buttons around here.

212
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:21,480
We got an interesting CD in the mail just recently

213
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,020
from the same guy who does Come Together Productions,

214
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,620
the unauthorized French subgenius psychedelic pop album.

215
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,900
And this is another psychedelic pop album.

216
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,960
It's a CD from Freak Beat Magazine

217
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,160
who has presented this,

218
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,980
this thing called A Psychedelic Sauna.

219
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,020
And I was scanning through it,

220
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,100
and everything good from it you just heard

221
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,840
in that little musical collage I just played.

222
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,500
But although that instrumental part was the middle of a song

223
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,400
called Conspiracy by Mandragora,

224
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,300
however, the words were completely muffled,

225
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,600
and so I didn't try to play the whole thing.

226
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,640
But there was,

227
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,780
out of all these 18 songs,

228
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:20,200
here was one by Poisoned Electric Head called Snobs.

229
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,320
And I thought you might likely to hear that.

230
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,160
Yeah.

231
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,480
So

232
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:05,100
and many others who were listening are as you can tell,

233
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,200
several of whom will someday stand on their own two feet

234
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,880
when they continue to cast All We W 125 anti-esp risen

235
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,720

It's a seven year old

246
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,540
I went to the bank to check out if I had enough

247
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,680
I'm in a pocket with a file of books

248
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,540
You figured in a summer old suit

249
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,980
Thought I was a bum cause I didn't have a little of you

250
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,100
Well, I ain't no money brother

251
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,860
What the hell can I do?

252
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,920
No stop, it's a seven year old

00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,400

guitar solo

259
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,600
We lived in a neighborhood

260
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,520
Where everybody was a man

261
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,680
Everybody has a nice car

262
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,280
But no one says their name

263
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,300
But their relatives are living far

264
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,460
We were walking out with a damn gym

265
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,660
Spun with a train

266
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,020
Find them in the restaurant

267
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,120
So many people get in a wine bar

MKR

269
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,760

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:08,500


275
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,260
It's only a half dollar machine

276
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,260


277
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,260


278
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,260


279
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:09,260

It's a seven year old

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,980
It's a seven year old

287
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,300
Oh that's sort of

288
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,860
Spinkin, the look of the hair

289
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,260
All theywhile bands

290
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:22,580
You gotta little

291
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:22,640
imal

292
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,840
So stay even

293
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,500
All you wear

294
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,040
Oh my God

295
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,680
Oh my God

296
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,020
Oh my gosh

297
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,780
Oh my gosh

298
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:33,660
Oh my God

299
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:33,660


300
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:33,660


301
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:33,660


302
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,480
If the window

303
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:34,860
Wils see me

304
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:42,840
learn to understand the criteria for evaluating the truth or falsehood of a particular concept

305
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:51,300
or statement, you find that there are ever-branching paths that can lead one down in determining

306
00:17:51,300 --> 00:18:00,100
what is reality. Jerry, UFOs are real. They are real. However, the reality of them is

307
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:09,200
so mind-boggling that words that we can understand have not yet been invented for the truth behind

308
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,920
them. And there is much more to be learned. We're just grasping at the first inklings

309
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,340
of what the truth is about these presences in our midst.

310
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,860
These are enlightening keys to the Computer God Worldwide top secret number code, which

311
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,080
stratifies everything. Not only the four billion living people, the computer gods, but the

312
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,720
computer god adopted it for speed and clarity. This set number code is the means to make

313
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,280
possible the computer god worldwide containment policy for stratification.

314
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:44,360
Why did it take one second in time to evolve X particles, quarks, nucleons, neutrinos,

315
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,160
and electrons, but it took one million years to form nuclei and then atoms?

316
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,100
Because Meekie wanted it that way.

317
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:57,060
Oh, what a depressing, paranoid answer. And yet I sense there's a great deal of truth

318
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,720
in it. You know, recently I managed to perform a

319
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,060
science experiment. I was in a lab and I was told that the computer god was a human being.

320
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,060


321
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,240
I had the scientific experiment. And, uh, see, this is my apparatus right here. I managed

322
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,360
to pull in...

323
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,260
Hey, put that apparatus away.

324
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:13,320
I just wanted to show you the actual face of Meekie. I've got it. I captured it and

325
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,900
I made this image and I mailed it to, uh, Ivan Stang just, um, when? Just today.

326
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,500
He didn't. So he won't get it for a while.

327
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,700
He won't get it for a while, no. But when he gets it, it may cause his eyes to squeeze

328
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:30,020
in their sockets and each particular hair to stand on end like quills.

329
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,960
So it's like the Shroud of E.D., then?

330
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,160
Well, it's an image. It's an image. It's created out of multi-dimensional bits of micro-information

331
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,880
beamed through the reaches of interstellar space back from the cloudy and coherent beginnings

332
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
of all time.

333
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,640
It's on an Etch-A-Sketch, right?

334
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:54,700
No, I sketched it on... I mean, I... that is to say, I enhanced the image. I did add

335
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,320
a few details, you know, to make it more sexy.

336
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,860
You were telling us just a bit, didn't you?

337
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:05,260
Well, you know, science is largely interpretation. You have to interpret the data, and so, uh...

338
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,140
Isn't everything largely interpretational?

339
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:14,080
Well, he's smoking a pipe. He's smoking a pipe. His face is a dark mass with a few light

340
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,120
areas rising out of it. The eyes are not the same size and are, uh, sort of round but not

341
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,300
perfect, uh, discs. They seem to be watery with light shining through them. There is

342
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,440
a suggestion of a pupil.

343
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,140
Eww.

344
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,740
It's, uh, the skin...

345
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:28,840
Eww.

346
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:35,140
The skin looks scaly, and there are pimple-like things also on it. Uh, it's shiny on the top,

347
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,100
and, uh, generally, the whole thing is a black mass, but it's smoking a pipe.

348
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,300
Well, it looks very familiar.

349
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,800
It looks devilishly so.

350
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,840
Yes, it does.

351
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,380
Uh, you know, this is what I get from my long-range deep dish antenna.

352
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,360
Now, after one million years, I dreamed that, uh, the galaxies formed.

353
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,060
Really?

354
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,840
Pardon me. I put that the wrong way. I dreamed that the galaxies formed.

355
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,780
The galaxies formed after one million years. After we had, uh, atomic, uh, material.

356
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,840
You've been dreaming for a million years now, and that's a dream?

357
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:11,760
Oh, yes. Deep in dreams, strewn with wandering fancies of the mind.

358
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,660
I had a dream about you once.

359
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,740
And what was in it?

360
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,380
Ha ha ha.

361
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,540
You dreamed...

362
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,140
Well, we can't tell that on the radio.

363
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,120
Oh, really? It has to be classified, eh?

364
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,500
Yeah, classified information.

365
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,360
Well, you get to tell your dreams, but others may not be so fortunate.

366
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,020
Others may not get to hear it.

367
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,820
For to pass that grim gate...

368
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:52,640
With its blackened and undecipherable inscription, passing under the stained teeth of the portcullis, dried blood-red with rust, and venture yet only part of the way across that moldering ridge, to come so far, and yet, through the temerity of timidity, venture no farther, to indulge in withered dithering so that the other side remains unappeasably unvisited, is to fall forever short.

369
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,800
Such a short fall is an eternal embarrassment, and to pull up shorts, sweet as it may feel, still leaves exposed what the dead may have seen.

370
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:58,800


371
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:58,880
And to be so sure of that, you must be prepared to be

372
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,160
dispensation already has revealed.

373
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:06,220
Then, show not your shaking shanks to the prying eyeball of perpetuity, but snap your

374
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,520
digits in defiance before the iris of that glaucous orb.

375
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,600
Yeah, that's right.

376
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:27,660
Indeed, it is Dr. Howell, the good Dr. Howell there, howling away his four philosophies

377
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,660
as best he can.

378
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:28,780
And I'm sure you've heard of him.

379
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:28,780


380
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:28,780


381
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:28,780


382
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:28,780


383
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:34,240
As best any of us can, dear friends.

384
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:46,700
Well, I would like to read to you a little bit more, this time from the Gospel according

385
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,800
to Dr. Philo Drummond.

386
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:58,560
The new book, Revelation X, will feature gospels by those original thirteen apostles.

387
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:58,780
I'm sure you've heard of them.

388
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:58,780


389
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:58,780


390
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:58,780


391
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,780
I've heard of the one who wrote the Bible, the one who wrote the Bible, who knew Bob,

392
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:06,600
who knew the Bob at the time, while he was alive and still talking to us.

393
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,660
And I'm just going to read this little section here.

394
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:17,180
This is kind of difficult for me because these are the remembrances of Dr. Philo Drummond.

395
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:21,700
He's a friend of mine, and I'm not going to try to imitate the way he talks.

396
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,780
That would be pointless.

397
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,760
But, well, I'm going to read it to you.

398
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:28,760


399
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:28,760


400
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:28,760


401
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:28,760


402
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:28,760


403
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,960
I'll just go through it here, friends.

404
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:42,060
As we begin here, Gospel according to Philo, 14.3.

405
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:51,660
Philo is describing after he had risen on the conspiracy ladder.

406
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:58,760
This was in the late 50s when Bob was working for the conspiracy and had started to work

407
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,000
for the conspiracy.

408
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,020
He had succeeded quite well.

409
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,560
He had not yet rebelled from them.

410
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,040
It says here, as Philo says,

411
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:10,500
Dobbs started getting increasingly paranoid about his enemies, the list of whom grew to

412
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:16,860
include his business rivals, his bosses, his customers, his mother-in-law, the IRS, the

413
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,420
communists, and the Venusians.

414
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,520
He certainly had some enemies, but how could they harm him?

415
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,260
But then Dobbs was never known for his logical thinking.

416
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,760
He became something of a...

417
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:33,760
survivalist and constructed an elaborate bomb shelter under his backyard.

418
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,320
One time when he was showing off his anti-personnel gear to me, he said,

419
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:46,480
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.

420
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:53,400
Give a man a gun and others will feed him for a lifetime.

421
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,760
It was in this trough of negativity and despondency that I began to think about the

422
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:03,360
conspiracy that Bob began his wanderings, what we call his lost years.

423
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,680
He quit his conspiracy jobs and dropped out of sight.

424
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:12,440
He told me that during this time, the late 50s, he was hitchhiking boat rides around

425
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,700
Indonesia trying to discover himself.

426
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,880
And that goes through various adventures he had.

427
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,460
Okay, I'll start again here.

428
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,640
1497, for Dobbs, 1497.

429
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,760
His captors sold him into white slavery.

430
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:36,580
And he was used by a wizened old sultan magician as an experimental sex toy.

431
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:42,120
He has never gone into detail about that except to say that he learned a lot about himself.

432
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,280
After a couple of years in captivity, he hustled enough money to buy his freedom.

433
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,860
He then surfaced in Tibet at a place called the Plateau of Chang'e,

434
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,940
where he fell in with the llamas of the Sormaun.

435
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,340
The Sormaun Brotherhood.

436
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:07,760
His arrival was prophesied in their holy texts, which said,

437
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:18,440
He will come to you smoking one pipe and having one solitary eyebrow which blights his face.

438
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,700
Dobbs had indeed lost an eyebrow.

439
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,740
He told the Sultans, the Tibetans, that it was because he had been branded by the sultan.

440
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:34,820
But in fact, he had lost it by lighting the pipe too close to his face while fraternizing with his Burmese captors.

441
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,420
He successfully sued the Jakarta lighter manufacturer in 1960.

442
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:49,280
For a while, I think, Bob got his kicks from flaunting his amoral western ways in the llamas' faces.

443
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,020
But their patience must have been rewarded,

444
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,480
because he ended up swearing off his gamboling and sinning,

445
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,280
and joined their monastery as a fellow monk.

446
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,540
Bob threw himself into the discipline, heart and soul,

447
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:12,320
becoming such a good meditator that he developed calluses on his scalp from standing on his head for so long every day.

448
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,800
He went for two years without bathing, wiping, or changing his clothing,

449
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,580
letting the rain and the urine or spittle of his detractors wash him.

450
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:32,040
He wore barbed wire shirts, put nails in his shoes,

451
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,380
and rolled in thorn bushes every time he had an impure thought,

452
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,400
which he defined as the urge to sell faulty goods just for the hell of it.

453
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,720
He rode through all the villages backwards on an ass,

454
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,700
wearing a dunce cap on which all his sins were listed.

455
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,860
Beset by tulpas of his own creation,

456
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,720
he suffered poltergeist attacks continuously.

457
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,700
He lived in caves and fasted for months.

458
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:10,460
He wanted to levitate himself into the sky to escape the stench of humans, as he said,

459
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,960
but because he was afraid of heights,

460
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,880
stayed inside and let his head bump the cave roof instead.

461
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,960
Eventually, for Bob, there was no longer any difference between meditating

462
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,220
and not meditating.

463
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,180
Every single word, thought, or act became a meditation,

464
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,500
and thenceforth he was able to practice unlimited action,

465
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,900
or not think, trademark.

466
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,360
At this point, he abandoned his severe asceticism

467
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,680
and more or less reverted to his old goatish ways.

468
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,180
As Bob told me upon his return,

469
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,140
one must be totally free from desire,

470
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,700
to achieve true freedom,

471
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,720
and that means acquiring everything you desire.

472
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,500
I am become like a handy wipe.

473
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,240
A handy wipe may clean everything it touches,

474
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,960
but itself becomes soiled.

475
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,320
Yet it can be replaced by another handy wipe

476
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,440
exactly the same as the first one.

477
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,400
The women that were too beautiful for the normals

478
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,500
have let me sleep with them.

479
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,120
The hunchbacked and obese and elderly ones,

480
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,420
and the cripples,

481
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:33,260
and to me, each was the most beautiful woman on earth.

482
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,880
I have made love to ten thousand beings,

483
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:42,940
but not once was the act defiled by lust.

484
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,300
I loved them with all my soul.

485
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,940
Similarly, I loved all the animals.

486
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,040
All animals have the Buddha nature,

487
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,180
more so than humans.

488
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,060
And if one feels affection and lust for them,

489
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,300
they will return it.

490
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,160
Except for chickens.

491
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,900
Oh, yes dear.

492
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,340
Dear friends,

493
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:30,980
some readings from the new unpublishable book of the subgenius.

494
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,160
Yes, unpublishable because it sometimes seems to be

495
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,480
un-finishable.

496
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,100
Ah, yes.

497
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,340
Like this show.

498
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,420
This show that never, never seems to quite go away

499
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,520
and leave us in the peace we so

500
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,500
rightly deserve.

501
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,820
Do we not, my friends?

502
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,420
Oh, yes.

503
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:02,640
And as I wait simply for this side of the show to end

504
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,320
so that I can start the next side of the show,

505
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,220
padding,

506
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:14,760
padding your spiritual emptiness as well as mine,

507
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,080
just to get us through one more week, yes?

508
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,400
Yes.

509
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,160
Some people say they wouldn't be able to go into work on Monday

510
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,660
were it not for this horrible show,

511
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,160
this hour of slack.

512
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,100
And I'm sorry that we may

513
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,040
Are you on drugs, sir?

514
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,080
I bet you use marijuana and all this kind of stuff.

515
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,800
You can come on down from the bathroom, honey.

516
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,500
It's okay.

517
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,740
I've got new brain and a briefcase.

518
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,180
You don't have to agonize on the toilet all morning

519
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,520
trying to organize your thoughts.

520
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,880
Have the skin flaps folded, Margaret.

521
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,060
I'm meeting with the CEO of the company.

522
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,420
The CEO of Ironveld Petroleum.

523
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,080
As long as there's parchment around the mummy's groin,

524
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,660
there'll be plenty of gravy for us white exploiter classes.

525
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
Okay, great.

526
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,040
Then I'll just turn off the oatmeal.

527
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,920
And you can turn them inside out for greater storage space.

528
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,700
There's no floppy disks or software to worry about,

529
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,820
only creased convulsions of pure synthetic brain tissue.

530
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,880
It's more than the party gag sensation of the 21st century.

531
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,080
It's... it's... it's...

532
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,260
Is it paranormal to kill another person?

533
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,520
No, I would say that is quite a... unfortunately, a normal activity.

534
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,320
How so? How can a normal person kill another person?

535
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,800
Well, it certainly happens all too frequently.

536
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,280
It does, but explain to me...

537
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,080
Go ahead.

538
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,320
It is explainable by certainly known laws of physics, however you're correct.

539
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,860
The emotional states that result in suffering.

540
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:54,220
Civil disorder could have an influence from beyond certainly mere physical matter.

541
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:57,640
How can a... how can a person kill a stranger for no reason?

542
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,380
How can they kill a person for... a stranger for no reason?

543
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,040
Collin, you're posing a question

544
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,880
that has baffled mankind for thousands of years,

545
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,000
and I don't know if we can...

546
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,540
It's not paranormal.

547
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,160
As you said yourself, it's normal.

548
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:22,780
You have to, uh... you know, espouse something different, you know,

549
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:28,040
as into, uh... ergonomic qualities or something like that,

550
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,820
or parabolic abnormalities or something, don't you?

551
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,080
Well, I don't know if parabolic abnormalities quite fit into this category,

552
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,340
but, Collin, I thank you for your concern in this matter,

553
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,160
and I hope, uh, perhaps someday on this station you will hear that song,

554
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,960
Cop Killer. Thank you for calling.

555
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,940
You're trying to get off.

556
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,320
That's correct. Thank you.

557
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,820
When I'm around, when I'm around, this bus leaves me...

558
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,320
Food is splendid.

559
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,660
It will pass.

560
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,700
Ten percent said they used it daily.

561
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,480
There's a bank parking lot across the street,

562
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,380
plus there's, uh, parking that end, the Holiday Inn.

563
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,020
Don't you want to be part of that expansion?

564
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,820
Don't stop! Don't stop!

565
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,320
Stop!

566
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,640
Well, it could be your job in life.

567
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,480
I guess so.

568
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:34,480


569
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:34,600
Because food is still there.

570
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,320
Ugh, I'm shopping for that.

571
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,320


572
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,320


573
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,320


574
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,320


575
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,320


576
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,320


577
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,660
Aha!

578
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:38,880
麻 following function.

579
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:38,880


580
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:38,880


581
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,840
pouvez falar...

582
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,140
Why?

583
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,740
Itís I who heat the pizza are,

584
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,180
my你好 great physique is,

585
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:42,640
and pra sucker that woke up.

586
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,340
Place de dança del planes.

587
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,480
Iếu you luv colourat,

588
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
ðæ é umuluni'?

589
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,920
I hate Claudia Lange.

590
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,580
Hater.

591
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,940
You smoked faster, Williams.

592
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,280
Robert Williams is a bizarre painter.

593
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,420
He's painted himself blue, like his mailbox.

594
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,060
He's dancing.

595
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,240
That's a euphemism for dancing.

596
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,720
A mailbox with a number on it, too.

597
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:11,500
Oh, stop cooing like a dove, my dove.

598
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,240
And come close to my bosom.

599
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,540
I mean, bring your bosom closer to me.

600
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,140
And sit here on this swingy step while we have some landamage.

601
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,420
Hello?

602
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,900
Yes, landamage filled with L.S. potatoes.

603
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,580
Drink it, drink it down.

604
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,320
Ha, ha, ha.

605
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:25,840
Drink it.

606
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,800
I'm sorry.

607
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,360
Hello?

608
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,060
Hello?

609
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,440
I have a recipe for you.

610
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,280
Oh, I recipe.

611
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,820
What do you have a recipe?

612
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,660
Yeah.

613
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,800
What is it?

614
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:41,340
You take a recipe for pitted chicken breast.

615
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,340
Pitted chicken breast?

616
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:43,840
Yes.

617
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,880
And how do you prepare this delightful deluxe sheet?

618
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,400
Take chicken breast.

619
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,820
Open up.

620
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,900
Ha, ha, ha.

621
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,960
You take pitted olive.

622
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,380
Pour it down the hatch there.

623
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,880
And you stick them under your armpit there.

624
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,720
And you get some duct tape.

625
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,780
And tape them in real good and nice there.

626
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:11,360
That sounds very, very not, well, let's not say salivary as you have savory,

627
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,240
but probably Granger-like.

628
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah.

629
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,460
Yeah.

630
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,100
Exactly.

631
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:20,060
It's kind of like what a chicken eats when it needs things in its throat to confuse its food.

632
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:20,760
Uh-huh.

633
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,440
Yeah.

634
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:28,020
I see because you can't really digest the food if the chicken digests itself in your stomach for you.

635
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,000
Exactly.

636
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,120
But how do you pass the duct tape?

637
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,280
So then, so then you take a dispatch of duct tape real good there.

638
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:35,820
Yes.

639
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,160
Yes.

640
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,620
And then assuming you have ovens, preheat it 400.

641
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:40,840
Okay.

642
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,760
Assuming you not have oven.

643
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,200
You walk in oven.

644
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,540
You walk in oven.

645
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,860
And stay in there for three hours.

646
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,100
And then you're coming out and chicken done.

647
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,600
Bon appetit.

648
00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:00,300
Well, what a delightful and yet stupid recipe because why would anyone want to stay in a

649
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:06,600
400-pound dung heap for three hours without one of those little digestive devices we all

650
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,080
have to wear?

651
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,500
And it sometimes looks like duct tape, but it's still a hernia device.

652
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,180
So always, always, always, always, always, always, always, always, always, always, always,

653
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,220
always, please.

654
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,840
Remember, this thing is dangerous.

655
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:25,740
It's not something you flip on like a girdle or something that you put on like a taxonomic

656
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,300
dessert that you'd kind of wish to fry on your friends.

657
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,900
You've been unseemly in your behavior.

658
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,360
No, no, friends.

659
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:36,460
These new duct tape corsets are fireproof.

660
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,880
They're osculoresistant.

661
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,980
And they also cause cerebral hemorrhaging.

662
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,720
I'm sorry.

663
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,160
Just, just a little bit.

664
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,160


665
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,160


666
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,160


667
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,940
I had to make that doubly, doubly clear.

668
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,660
And the creator is the one who created you.

669
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,780
Next.

670
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,580
Tra la la, Thrandiere.

671
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,220
I push my pants away.

672
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,340
And while I'm standing there, pull down my underwear.

673
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,980
Tra la la, Thrandiere.

674
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,280
All right, in you go.

675
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,840
I just stand here this way.

676
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,980
Now I wear underwear.

677
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,140
So I go straight in there.

678
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,040
And brains.

679
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,200
But it's impossible.

680
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,540
Yeah, that's right.

681
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,260
Because I should switch to my better copy of what comes up next there.

682
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,360
But first, before that, I should tell you what you heard.

683
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,440
Just then, there was a whole little radio here.

684
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:31,920
Whoa.

685
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,000
There's a golden devil.

686
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:35,880
Jeez.

687
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,780
I'm sorry, friends.

688
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,920
I was really surprised.

689
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,660
We've got this.

690
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,960
I didn't mean to lose myself.

691
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,600
I didn't mean to hurt myself that way.

692
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,740
I honestly didn't.

693
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:49,080
But some of these things are unbelievable.

694
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:49,840
Whoa.

695
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,840
They are very real.

696
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
They are very real.

697
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,220
And they're very frightening.

698
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,080
And I'm sorry.

699
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,400
That just really threw me.

700
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,800
You think it's easy coming in here and doing these radio shows.

701
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,560
You think, oh, yeah, these guys get paid a lot.

702
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,900
They just come right in here and they can cuss all day.

703
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,300
They're like Howard Stern.

704
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
Hey, get away with murder.

705
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,240
I'm sorry.

706
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,120
I'm sorry.

707
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:12,860
But it's true.

708
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:12,940
It's true.

709
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:12,940


710
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:12,940


711
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:12,940


712
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:12,940


713
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:12,940


714
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:12,940


715
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:12,940


716
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:25,700
It's like the end creates a wonder around them.

717
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,380
Yeah.

718
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:26,380


719
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:26,560
ItUp Protect Cool.

720
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,680
Now, yourqui, a lake that's everywhere.

721
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:27,680


722
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:27,680


723
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:27,680


724
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,780
Oh, and the up 다�Ь And you start bringing your flip, and you

725
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,340
get it on the floor.

726
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,980
Oh, and I think this is even better for you afterwards.

727
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:33,480
Just say, gonna use this.

728
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,160
Go over here.

729
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,620

730
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:35,620


731
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,180
Great, man.

732
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,580
I'm going to show you a little bit of practicalść▼

733
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:39,760
I'll give you a little bit of info.

734
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,180
So you decide that you're interveneant.

735
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,640
Obviously, okay.

736
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:42,920
I control my family

737
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:42,920


738
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,140
Well, you can probably imagine.

739
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,900
The recipe, we're so glad to be able to give you a recipe for the pitted chicken.

740
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:59,280
That was the Brain Rot East Coast or East Lake show on WCSB.

741
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,420
Loathsome Cowboy Dave and Scabbly Chaz Daves.

742
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,720
All three of them on that show.

743
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:14,540
And before that was a bit of a ZXQ radio show, Alabama Neptune's show.

744
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,340
And a little Brain Rot.

745
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:26,980
Before that was some media barrages from Brain Rot West.

746
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,740
That's right.

747
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:34,080
And Michael Taylor Duke, don't you see.

748
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,080
But let's go.

749
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,380
I'm sorry.

750
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,240
It's getting just a little bit too surrealistic.

751
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,720
We like to have a linear hour of slack show.

752
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,660
We really do.

753
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,520
And I've got 20 more minutes and there's.

754
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,880
Sure, why not?

755
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,880
I'll go for it.

756
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,520
I'll start into.

757
00:40:55,580 --> 00:41:01,180
This is a nonfiction and really a scientific section.

758
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:06,140
I better shut that machine back there off because it's going to make me cuss again.

759
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,520
If I.

760
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,660
See, how do I handle that for the out of town shows?

761
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,100
You know, I have to cut the cussing out that I involuntarily did.

762
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,800
And yet here I am referring back to it again.

763
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,920
You see, I'll either have to put another sound effect in here, some little piece anyway.

764
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,020
OK, OK, that's quit acting like regular preachers.

765
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:36,420
This is a subgenius preaching here from Revelation X, the Bob Apocryphon, Chapter 11B, actually.

766
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,280
The.

767
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,940
Fall of Mutantis.

768
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:56,380
Because how was it, dear friends, that we, the lowly subgenii, came to fall so far from that Yeti state of glory, that heaven that was Mutantis?

769
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,540
And it was because the Yeti made millions of terrible mistakes.

770
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,780
They called these mistakes.

771
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,180
Humans.

772
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,000
The human is far worse than a mere DNA backfire.

773
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,900
Evolved randomly over millions of years.

774
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:30,520
Everything that makes the human the spiteful, murdering, self-deluding barbarian that it is was carefully installed by peace-loving, well-meaning Yeti.

775
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:37,700
The following is based on material dredged up from Bob's past life regressions under hypnosis.

776
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:42,500
These ancestral memories come to him in non-chronological bits and pieces.

777
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:50,700
Our monks spent many years piecing together his trance statements to reconstruct these most critical events in Yeti history.

778
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:03,820
80 million years ago, the close thing to a soul-bearing primate was the monkeyish, rat-like Primo Anthropocus.

779
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,680
And so this was the raw material which the Yeti fed to the Yeti.

780
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:07,680


781
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:07,680


782
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:07,680


783
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:07,860
They were able to spin this wibble up into the coconut shell and then…

784
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,600
…shed into their evolution accelerators.

785
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:17,400
If ever any creature deserved to be a lab animal, it was Primo Anthropocus.

786
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:29,100
These filthy, perverted, semi-rodent scavengers — when not devouring garbage and stealing the eggs of the great reptiles — senselessly fought and bedevilled each other.

787
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,460
They were the ideal omnivores for the experiments.

788
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:38,720
hardy and tenacious, they could survive anywhere like roaches. These, the Yeti

789
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:46,120
bred step by step into human pinks. The initial attempt produced blank-faced

790
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:52,200
slack-jawed apish pre-humans, more or less like Australopithecus, whose only

791
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:57,900
defense against predators was their unbearable odor. Their weak souls had a

792
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:03,160
tendency to detach and wander away shortly after birth, and worse, they were

793
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:08,600
almost too stupid to copulate. The thick-headed beasts practically had to

794
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,680
be shown how. Their attention spans were so weak that half the offspring they did

795
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:20,140
manage to whelp were abandoned or eaten. With such low imaginations and libidos,

796
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:26,480
they wouldn't procreate fast enough to fill the Yeti's soul quota. The Yeti

797
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,880
scientists were posed a challenge. They were forced to leave the Yeti's home.

798
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:34,140
The challenge? To somehow make the humanoids enjoy coitus, and even to pair

799
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,940
bond, so that parents might tolerate their broods until they reached

800
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:44,900
childbearing age. The bodies required redesigning so that, no matter how they

801
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,880
happened to bump into each other, the creatures would still be able to stumble

802
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,720
upon suitable positions and figure out what went where. The pelvises were

803
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,080
swiveled, uprightness increased.

804
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:03,860
It was found that the degree of roundness and baldness on the rumps of the females directly

805
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:11,380
correlated with male sexual interest. It was theorized that the doltish males would

806
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:19,320
be twice as likely to breed if inspired by a second set of globular sex triggers. The

807
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:25,580
Yeti decided to duplicate these large hind appurtenances on the fronts of the females,

808
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,860
by enlarging the lactating area. The yeti's body was then placed in a cage, and the female's

809
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,540
skin PC.

810
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:36,660
Soft and flexible buttock fetish equally epitomized the female's

00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:04,340
humans a favor to drape them with even more large lactating glands. They tried many combinations,

815
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,560
hanging two in the front and three in the back, one on either side of the head, rows

816
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:15,540
of eight, four on each side. Some humans, they completely surrounded with huge colorful

817
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:23,420
cushions for the tuberosities of the ischium, with openings everywhere. But yet, the yetis

818
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:31,160
found, making it all so easy lowered the anguish content of the livestock's souls. If the

819
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:37,840
souls weren't well-fatted on pain, there was no self-awareness and the soul essence went

820
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:47,480
flat. The exists had no use for flat souls. To increase the pain level, the yeti found

821
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:53,400
ways to make the humans both desperately eager to breed, yet foolish enough to come to the

822
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:53,400


823
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:58,360
fore. These exists caused themselves endless hardships in the process. They amped up the

824
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:03,600
neural connectors between the desire gland and that section of the brain which lights

825
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:11,280
up during sexual excitation. Chromosomes were tweaked, enlarging the desire gland to twice

826
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:17,200
normal size. Most of the logic centers of the brain had to be removed to make room for

827
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:23,400
it. The tiny pleasure receptors were dilated into such gaping catheters that the brain only

828
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:37,340
could achieve aikke chance when touched. Daetz were rundled together at meet As Dcheck

832
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,620
circulating, the sex-hurt energy would snap back and forth spastically between head and

833
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:03,440
groin. Whenever the little brain between the legs was charged up, the head brain was at

834
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:13,120
its most vulnerable and suggestible, rendering their minds laughably malleable. By modifying

835
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:19,660
the reward secretion distributor's trigger configurations, the Yeti discovered they could

836
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:27,320
make other things besides hairless spherical appendages tickle the male human desire gland.

837
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:36,280
Instead of restricting inborn raw need only to unfulfillable breed lust, it could also

838
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:45,500
be sublimated into devotion to some chore or even some mere symbol of a reward. After

839
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:49,640
blanking the whole reward lobe and scouring it smooth for re-examination, the Yeti was

840
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:49,640


841
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,220
able to

842
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:50,540
make a new life.

843
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:56,920
Yeti owners could load their human slaves with directives, false memories, new instincts,

844
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:12,160
and… where's the rest of my page? Boy, where's page two of the Holy Gospel of the

845
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:18,280
Yeti? I don't believe it. Friends, I guess you won't get to find out just what happened.

846
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,620
To make the Yeti's life more enjoyable, you need to make a new life. To make the Yeti's

847
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:19,620


848
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:49,600
life more enjoyable, you need to function eating what Dios would like.

849
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:56,800
were designed, the flaws in those designs, dear friends,

850
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:02,660
and how the great empire of the Yeti, Mutantis itself,

851
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:06,520
came to fall and the humans to escape.

852
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,940
Yes, to escape.

853
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:14,140
Was then the conspiracy an accident, dear friends?

854
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,140
I think not.

855
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:21,400
But no more so than, say, the KPFA radio show in Berkeley

856
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,980
with puzzling evidence and Dr. Howell.

857
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,800
As Moe Factor is punched up.

858
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,320
Who are we and why are we here?

859
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,240
No, of your information, who are we?

860
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,540
Who are you?

861
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,100
Little bits of nothingness?

862
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:33,980
Who are you?

863
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,180
Hmm, that's a good start.

864
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,940
Well, let's look at it in a linear fashion.

865
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,980
As if the show is a line,

866
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,800
then it could be a line without end in a circle,

867
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,960
or it could be that the line has one end

868
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,120
with a circle without end in a circle.

869
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,360
One end with us at it, and another end with you at it.

870
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,480
So when the show travels from point A to point B,

871
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,540
then you receive it and you send it back to us,

872
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,320
back to point A.

874
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,260
Describe it as A, B, A.

875
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,260
Yeah, this is Dr. Here's, the serious business candidate.

876
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,600
Let's just go to...

877
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:58,960
Yeah.

878
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,820
Are you guys going to be...

879
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,460
Thanks for speaking with me this morning.

880
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,340
Yeah, that's what we do.

881
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,120
Okay, now the other caller is talking to you there.

882
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:05,460
Sorry.

883
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,920
Well, I think the main issue is character now.

884
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:10,420
Why do we let characters like this on the air?

885
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:10,980
That's not what we talk about, character.

886
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,160
Okay, now we're at the caller debate.

887
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,500
Now, can you answer that question, caller?

888
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,080
Let me ask the caller, random subgenius.

889
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,080
All right, let's see if Frank Bant wants to know

890
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,240
about the question of character.

891
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,080
Does the audience have a question about the subgenius?

892
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,220
Is there another subgenius caller still there?

893
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,600
I don't know.

894
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:30,940
Bob Liz.

895
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,220
Oh, I think the caller just...

896
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:32,760
Oh, there he is.

897
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,620
I think he just fell off the edge of the podium there.

898
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,320
He's walking around.

899
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,560
Increase the magnification.

900
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,100
Do you feel you're better off now than you were 10 years ago

901
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:40,800
with the subgenius?

902
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:41,420
Can I answer that?

903
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,100
Most definitely, because there...

904
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:45,120
There is...

905
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:45,120


906
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:45,120


907
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,300
Issues are being exposed here,

908
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,820
and finally we're dealing with everything.

909
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,480
Well, you know, it did happen on our watch.

910
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,040
I'm not taking all the credit for it, but...

911
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,440
I'm ready to point the fingers and put the screws...

912
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,360
Put that finger away.

913
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,260
...down to where they...

914
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:59,000
The screw holes where they belong here.

915
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,280
Hey, keep it clean, fella.

916
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,160
But I feel if you know the problems inside out,

917
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,800
then eventually you can solve them.

918
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,500
If you didn't deny them, then sure,

919
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,800
you're going to ignore them and...

920
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,740
No, there's one little thing here

921
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,440
we're neglecting to acknowledge.

922
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,820
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.

923
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,520
Our time is running short.

924
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,480
As far as I'm concerned,

925
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,120
I'm sure...

926
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,980
You had a good thing going there at one point

927
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,160
way back then, but...

928
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,480
Then there was this unfortunate episode

929
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,760
where he got a visit from the Secret Service.

930
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,520
Do you remember that fella?

931
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:25,760
Oh, the Mustafa?

932
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:26,720
Yeah, right.

933
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,900
And they wanted to know, you know,

934
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,220
he just accidentally said a few clumsy things in the book,

935
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,720
and now they were down on his tail,

936
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,400
and he was having to give them subscriptions

937
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,740
and explanations and everything, you know, and...

938
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:37,740
Well, your family's threatened.

939
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,100
Yeah, well, that's just the thing, though, you know.

940
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,180
Like, I can't shake this image.

941
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:45,100
I see him sitting there with his hands in his hands,

942
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,360
just a-knocking, thinking to himself,

943
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,120
well, maybe this was just a joke religion after all, yeah.

944
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,760
Fellow, you worry too much over matters that concern you not.

945
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,920
Leave gourmandizing,

946
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,940
know you not the greatest life you could be than for other men?

947
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:00,980
Huh? What happened?

948
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,140
Uh, the eternal silence of infinite space.

949
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,580
Millions and millions of miles long

950
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,480
are big and wide around the clock.

951
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,760
And there's the impression of going down the wire.

952
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,260
For the first time,

953
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,960
scientists have been able to directly view,

954
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:15,940
a human brain,

955
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,680
human thought processes,

956
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:21,520
tracing the complex patterns of electrical and chemical reactions

957
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,920
to small clusters of brain cells.

958
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,200
Gauss or something?

959
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,020
What's that?

960
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:29,260
A cow?

961
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,740
A gauss-y.

962
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,040
Gow?

963
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:33,020
Gauss.

964
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,100
Gauss.

965
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,000
Oh, degaussing the magnetic minds.

966
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,180
Yes, I have to do it every day before I get out of bed.

967
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:38,980
Oh, God.

968
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,040
Means you're getting old.

969
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,120
Oh, my God, you guys are too funny.

970
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,820
Oh, well, I don't.

971
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,420
I was born that way.

972
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,880
That's why degaussing is so funny.

973
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:49,800
It's something you just have to do.

974
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:50,760
Oh, I know, yeah.

975
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:53,200
Those like Gauss, my uncle has gone through it many times.

976
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,340
We just crack up.

977
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,780
I just, you know, say it's like this.

978
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,200
Right.

979
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:00,680
I just remember by thinking, you know, the gaseous stuff, you know,

980
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,320
and we know, I know what he's talking about,

981
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,060
but he knows, like, the guy that invented it and all that.

982
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,320
Gaseous mineral vegetable animal.

983
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:07,680
I know.

984
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,420
As we wander through life.

985
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:09,960
It hurts.

986
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,300
As we wander through life.

987
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,040
Because we have to keep those bits of antimatter.

988
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,520
We have to keep those bits of antimatter.

989
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:15,080


990
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:15,080


991
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,060
Walled off.

992
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,080
Kept and captivated in a magnetic bottle.

993
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:23,640
And I'm wondering now, do you guys actually tell a comic story during this?

994
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,080
Our lives are a passion or a comic story.

995
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:31,440
Okay, so you don't tell anything out of a book or anything?

996
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,420
A book.

997
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,080
I mean, are you?

998
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:38,220
The only book that we, you know, it's the book of the subgenius.

999
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,820
We're not allowed to plug it on the air because this is listener-censored radio,

1000
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,280
but there is indeed a book.

1001
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,140
A book.

1002
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:44,680
No, you're speaking.

1003
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:44,700
A book.

1004
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:45,740
You can read out of each chapter.

1005
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,840
Every chapter is better than the one before.

1006
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,660
Okay, so it's just the chapters of life.

1007
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:54,540
Yeah, now, we're not actually reading out of it, but there is such a book.

1008
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,220
Well, the book is within your head.

1009
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:56,840
Yes.

1010
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,640
Oh, there was a little sample of it right there.

1011
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,300
That's some of the static between my ears.

1012
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:01,900
Oh, exactly.

1013
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:08,000
All our dialogue, to answer your question, is ad libitum et ex cathedra.

1014
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:13,860
Okay, so some of these dilemmas maybe that you're talking about could be somebody's reality

1015
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:14,960
that they're going through at the time?

1016
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:15,940
Yeah, yeah.

1017
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:16,580
Okay.

1018
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:21,800
It's an interwoven, sort of like one of those hair club for men things.

1019
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:25,720
Yes, I'm not only a show customer, I'm also a victim.

1020
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,960
It could be real, but it could be imitation.

1021
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,280
That's what you're trying to present me.

1022
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:34,140
Well, an imitation only in the sense that all of existence is an imitation of some eternal form

1023
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:39,720
which exists without number or purpose in the infinite darkness of outer space.

1024
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,120
It doesn't matter what time of the day or night this is.

1025
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,960
This can happen at any time.

1026
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,000
What happened?

1027
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,480
Did you have a mishap?

1028
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,060
Did you see a monster?

1029
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,300
Here, let me get my paper out here.

1030
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:51,440
Now, let's go over that again.

1031
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,160
You say you saw some sort of monster?

1032
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:53,840
Monsters?

1033
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:54,880
Oh, I don't know.

1034
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,140
Why don't we say something about monsters?

1035
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,760
Don't you know that science has definitely proved there are no monsters?

1036
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,920
This is the 20th century.

1037
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,220
We've put a man on the moon.

1038
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:03,640
All right.

1039
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,780
Now, the human mind's a funny thing.

1040
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,240
It plays strange tricks.

1041
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:12,220
I'm sure you thought you saw what you said you thought you saw.

1042
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:12,640
Oh, no, no.

1043
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,700
I know about the illusion.

1044
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,880
I know about the illusion.

1045
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,940
Beware of the false fires leading you deeper and deeper into the swamps.

1046
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,940
The dancing lights of deception.

1047
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,080
Yeah, but the dancing chihuahuas I worry about.

1048
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:24,680
Oh, I see.

1049
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,060
I know.

1050
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:26,440
The chihuahuas are deceptive.

1051
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,100
Last year we had them at the show and they made a mess.

1052
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:31,080
Just before, we had the flamenco people that came out right after them.

1053
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,140
How are they supposed to dance with feathers everywhere?

1054
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,560
Those pink lawn plastic flamenco people.

1055
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,420
You can use those as an aid to create your little whirlybird type of maneuvers.

1056
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,580
Or we can just take the seeds of the, whatchamacallit,

1057
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,280
shaped like little propellers that come a-spinning down.

1058
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:47,960
They're hallucinogenic, too.

1059
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:48,180
Yeah.

1060
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,500
I beg your pardon?

1061
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,700
That come a-spinning down.

1062
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:53,420
They come a-spinning down.

1063
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:55,540
A banisteriopsis something-eye.

1064
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,860
They come a-spinning down.

1065
00:56:57,940 --> 00:56:58,420
Yes, indeed.

1066
00:56:58,780 --> 00:56:59,380
Oh, darling.

1067
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:03,920
And so do you, after you brew a tea made of these little things and drink it.

1068
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,560
Woo-wee.

1069
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:06,740
Woo-wee.

1070
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:11,700
In short, we need not follow the foolish fires of novelty for its own sake.

1071
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,080
Let's go adventuring.

1072
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:13,820
Okay.

1073
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,640
Are you guys the thrill-seekers?

1074
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,260
You bet.

1075
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,460
You can call us that.

1076
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:18,940
Oh, yeah.

1077
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,980
When you see us on the road checking out a crank call at some weird early hour of the morning,

1078
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,320
we're in our fully-equipped Land Rover.

1079
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,300
Oh.

1080
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,180
We've got every convenience of modern science.

1081
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,080
Hey, open up the pool, Hal.

1082
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,040
It's dawn.

1083
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:36,540
Well, it's kind of cold, but I'll just reel the plastic cover back off,

1084
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,660
slow down a little bit, and we'll take a dip.

1085
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,400
Right on.

1086
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,340
It's blast off or submerged at any point.

1087
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,260
That's right.

1088
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,440
The flying tub.

1089
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,860
A miracle of modern science.

1090
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:53,460
Well, that's pretty much what my car is, and it's just a 1985 Crown Victoria station wagon.

1091
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,500
Oh.

1092
00:57:56,260 --> 00:58:03,140
And Dr. Howell drives listeners insane.

1093
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:04,640
Ah, yes.

1094
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:13,320
Listeners to his show, his puzzling evidence show there in lowly and heartless.

1095
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,160
Humble Berkeley.

1096
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:19,180
God save those poor men living in that place.

1097
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:20,380
That awful place.

1098
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:25,020
And you're listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

1099
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:33,220
The compendium and compilation of all the greatest subgenius tapes and all that kind of stuff

1100
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:39,120
from the church of the subgenius.

1101
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,800
And I'm going to give you a number to write to that self-same church,

1102
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:48,740
so that you may glean for yourself information about the books, tapes,

1103
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:54,220
and all the marvelous things that you can't know about until then.

1104
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:57,500
And that number to write, just write to, just address it to Bob, friends.

1105
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,360
That way, that's how we know they come from radio listeners.

1106
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:11,920
Just address it to Bob at post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1107
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:12,480
That's.

1108
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,100
P.O.

1109
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:18,540
Box 14306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1110
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:23,820
And even though we're late getting our book out and our magazine, of course,

1111
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:31,480
always takes two years in between, yet we continue to crank out this show featuring

1112
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:38,840
such artists and articles as this fellow coming right up, the great John Martles.

1113
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,320
Oh, thank you.

1114
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,440
Thank you.

1115
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,560
Thank you.

1116
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,380
Thank you.

1117
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,440
Thank you.

1118
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,140
Thank you.

1119
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,120
Thank you.

1120
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:53,880
Thank you.
