member member member member member member member member member member

00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,580
We're sitting together listening to this

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,540
And this is crazy

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,840

Yes sir, I like subgenius

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,160
No sir, I don't like pink boys

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:36,080
yes sir I love Bob no sir no sir I do not want to stop Bob I want Bob I just

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,100
want to give my feet to the thousands in every beat in every leaf in every twig

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:53,660
yes I want to see him everybody saw and everybody a and it was kind of nice for

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,620
all your Bob who floats above the ground I long to hear the mournful sound that's

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,340
made when you emerge from space and come to this my dwelling place dear Bob each

19
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,200
night while I'm asleep I hope to my house you will creep and poke your pipe

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,700
in through the wall so I'll be burned remembering all dear Bob it's time to

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,380
close my eyes remember now it's no surprise if I should be found dead

22
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,380
someday I'll think that you were in the way

23
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:22,660
you

24
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:35,460
Oh gimme Bob confusing that face with my own can't remember my place

25
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,600
you are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,440
mind to the subgenius

27
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:01,220
Bob's role on a profit little return is to see that the earth is not sold on that

28
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,320
that glorious or terrible day we call x-day in 1998 when the men from Planet

29
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,200
X arrived yeah now it may sound ludicrous it may sound ridiculous to

30
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,520
many neighbors out there are you saying that all nuts all those people maybe yeah

31
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:15,980
maybe

32
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,300
You once were telling me about Planet X, Dr. Morbant.

33
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,260
Evil on Planet X is more than you could think of.

34
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,780
Evils, toxin.

35
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,940
Every night and day they wait to see the evil they go through.

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,380
Do they come down in flying saucers?

37
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,860
Flying saucers are bearing on us.

38
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,720
We don't know what to do.

39
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,820
We're here all alone.

40
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,860
The planets are fading.

41
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,340
The blood is running.

42
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,080
The lights were fading.

43
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,760
And they stalked us one by one.

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,720
This is the Man in Black, here for the Roma Wine Company of Fresno, California.

45
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,640
For centuries we have been circling your Earth, waiting for a means to penetrate your atmosphere.

46
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,800
I am the first to come to you.

47
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,160
With death and destruction, go ahead and kill me.

48
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,140
What's gonna happen to your children?

49
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:14,840
What's gonna happen to your children?

50
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,960
What's gonna happen to you when this society we've created,

51
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,780
this society of air conditioners,

52
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,940
of station wagons with wooden sides,

53
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,120
of horses, indeed,

54
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,660
of retired actors,

55
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,640
of orange hail,

56
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,180
of politicians,

57
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,640
what happens when that collapses?

58
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,760
What happens when your daughter ain't worth a damn?

59
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,100
What happens when your daughter ain't worth a damn?

60
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,620
That's when the man from Planet X-9

61
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,120
will come down and save the members of the subgenius jerk.

62
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,600
But until that day,

63
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,720
the power and wisdom of Bob,

64
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,640
can help us break their mind control,

65
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,560
by activating that mutant gland that we all have within us.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,320
You don't like your life?

67
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,740
Straighten it out in a big hurry!

68
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,960
Give your money to the church, not the state!

69
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,920
The church!

70
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,120
Yes!

71
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,500
Give us your children!

72
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,120
Give us your children!

73
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,560
Let us raise them!

74
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,400
You'll have weirder kids than me!

75
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,860
Ha ha ha ha ha!

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,520
That's odd. Very odd.

77
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,360
Meltdown.

78
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,780
And this can happen to you!

79
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,820
This can be yours!

80
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,160
Uh, yes dear friends,

81
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,400
it can happen to you,

82
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,520
it can be yours,

83
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,120
and it will be yours on X-Day 1998,

84
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,740
only two years from now,

85
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,580
and of course, dear friends,

86
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,960
this is our, uh, X-Day show,

87
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,180
it's, uh, July,

88
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,220
by the time you hear this tape,

89
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,620
I will probably be at the X-Day drill,

90
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,860
and, and drilling my way

91
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,640
deep into my own brain,

92
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,740
in preparation for the arrival of those,

93
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,520
uh, gods and goddesses from outer space,

94
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,460
who will come, uh, in 1998,

95
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,720
July 5th, 1998,

96
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,360
you know the story, friends,

97
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,760
and if you don't, well, just keep listening,

98
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,760
because we're gonna have every,

99
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,320
every tiny media barrage clip

100
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,260
that ever had anything to do with X-Day

101
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,740
for this show and the next one,

102
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,200
I apologize for the last show,

103
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,820
uh, but, uh, and, um,

104
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,120
but you know, as Dr. Legume pointed out

105
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,540
in the first edition of the Book of the Subgenius,

106
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,500
the McGraw-Hill Orange cover edition,

107
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,060
it, uh, there was a, a misprint,

108
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,440
uh, that seemed, uh, obviously a mistake,

109
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,820
that at one point made it look like X-Day

110
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,000
would happen in 1996,

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,040
well, what if that wasn't a, a misprint,

112
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,220
what if you're not ready, friend,

113
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,040
what if you're still putting off

114
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,180
that mighty moment when you write that mighty check,

115
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,020
what if, these are all important what-ifs, friends,

116
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,560
and, you know, that movie is coming out,

117
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,400
Independence Day,

118
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,740
god, their ploys are so obvious,

119
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,980
so filthy and so obvious,

120
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,600
that, uh, you know, the pieces are all coming together

121
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,920
for the one world government,

122
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,700
we, we, we can tell,

123
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,940
you can see the story behind the rise of Bill,

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,860
uh, Clinton, Bill Soft-On-Kitty Porn Clinton,

125
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,980
I should call him,

126
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,240
and his little clique rising to the American throne,

127
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,820
yes, it was through the diabolical backroom machinations

128
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,940
of Dobbs that all of these things have come about,

129
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,600
well, thou art but an insignificant insect,

130
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,460
and you'd better speak to the manager,

131
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,640
boy, cause that day is coming,

132
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,640
that day is coming up,

133
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,600
and, well, I'm gonna,

134
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,140
I ain't, I ain't,

135
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,460
I'm just gonna let these tapes carry you on through, friend,

136
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,320
cause it's a cele-

137
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,180
this is the biggest celebration of the subgenius year,

138
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,180
and, uh, I hope that,

139
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,420
I hope that you're readying yourself just as we are,

140
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,280
I, I'm sorry if you can't make it to the X Day Drill in Sherman, New York,

141
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,480
uh, while you're hearing this show,

142
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,300
I really am,

143
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,780
um, but,

144
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,840
in the meantime,

145
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,780
you may commune,

146
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:11,720
yes,

147
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,540
you may commune now with the spirit of Dobbs,

148
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,400
and the promise of X Day,

149
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,380
ah, yes.

150
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,060
Angel splash through the heavenlies!

151
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,020
You know, Ezekiel,

152
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,780
saw a wheel,

153
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,160
but what a lot of us do not realize is,

154
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,760
that in chapter one of your book,

155
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,600
Ezekiel, verse four,

156
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,920
the angels traveled in whirlwind fashion,

157
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,560
not like our jets straight ahead,

158
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,400
whirlwind!

159
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,740
They moved from one end of heaven to the other

160
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,500
like a flash of lightning,

161
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,480
verse fourteen,

162
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,040
and verse fifteen says their color was burl.

163
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,360
Do you know what they put into spaceships now

164
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,940
that are heaved out there?

165
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,820
The only thing that can withstand the heat,

166
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,100
other things that disintegrate,

167
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,320
burl-illium.

168
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,580
It's like some kind of,

169
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,320
some kind of vision,

170
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,560
like I've never seen before.

171
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,660
It was like a wagon wheel coming out of the sky,

172
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,460
and I was sitting on the porch with Aunt May,

173
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:19,760
and she said,

174
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,380
what is it, boy,

175
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,200
what is it?

176
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:21,500
And I said,

177
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,420
I don't know, ma'am,

178
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,160
I swear to God,

179
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,600
I don't know,

180
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,420
but I just said,

181
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,300
praise Bob,

182
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:25,940
and,

183
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,020
you know,

184
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,300
when,

185
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,160
if Bob,

186
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,800
if Bob says something,

187
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,480
that,

188
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,140
wall climbing,

189
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:36,800
wall climbing,

190
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:36,800


191
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:36,800


192
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,620
was it,

193
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,820
wall climbing,

194
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,740
is it,

195
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,040
wall climbing,

196
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,240
well,

197
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,720
I was wall climbing,

198
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,060
I was wall climbing,

199
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,020
and that's what Bob said to do,

200
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,800
that's what Bob told me to,

201
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,800
I was wall climbing,

202
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:49,520
yeah,

203
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:49,960
I,

204
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,620
I get,

205
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,780
I get,

206
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,220
real scared,

207
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,000
Bob,

208
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:55,800
because,

209
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:57,800
I,

210
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,880
I,

211
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,720
I've seen them,

212
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,960
I've seen them before,

213
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,700
but there's more,

214
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,520
more of them now,

215
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,320
and,

216
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,380
because there's lots more,

217
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:10,720
they're,

218
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,560
they're floating,

219
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,800
in the,

220
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,040
in the air,

221
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,120
and they,

222
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,800
they're living in the wood,

223
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,040
and the rocks,

224
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,600
and everything,

225
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,180
and they're,

226
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,560
they're always,

227
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,700
kind of,

228
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,200
laughing,

229
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,140
and,

230
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,580
feeling and laughing,

231
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:26,880
and,

232
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,000
all the time.

233
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:36,280
Duncan Lunan of the British Interplanetary Society has interpreted the signals as a message from a space probe,

234
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:36,680
and,

235
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:36,680


236
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:36,680


237
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:36,680


238
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:36,680


239
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:36,680


240
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:36,680


241
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:36,680


242
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,100
a message from a dying planet in,

243
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,500
where the little green men's way was real head caps,

244
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,240
rocking and a rolling to the crazy flats,

245
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,020
brought out the sax and they started to flow,

246
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,860
brought out the drums and they started to roll,

247
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,560
blind saucer rock and roll,

248
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,260
blind saucer rock and roll,

249
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,820
I couldn't understand it,

250
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,740
a thing they said it was a crazy beat it just stopped me dead,

251
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,180
Joe,

252
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,660
along with Bob,

253
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,940
the pursuit of slack,

254
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,640
and a conspiracy of pigs,

255
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,080
the subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse,

256
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,420
according to church doctrine,

257
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,840
on July 5th,

258
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,380
1998,

259
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,640
when the television signal of Amos and Andy reaches the men from Planet X,

260
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,940
the aliens will unleash their wrath upon the earth,

261
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,100
and the men from Planet X are going to come down and take over earth,

262
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,900
they're going to,

263
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,900
they will put us,

264
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:35,040
they will put us out of our misery unless Bob can explain to them in ways that they can understand,

265
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,660
that there is something wrong,

266
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,240
there is something on earth worth saving,

267
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,840
and only the subgenii,

268
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,660
the dues paying,

269
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,700
book buying,

270
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,540
receipt in the pocket,

271
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,720
paid in full to the church subgenii,

272
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,220
have the tiniest prayer of survival,

273
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,480
the rest of them,

274
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,160
it's a tough world Jack,

275
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,720
the fighting Jesus looked out over the bridge of the excess battle saucer,

276
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,520
blood of Christ,

277
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,300
he looked and laughed,

278
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,380
he laughed and looked,

279
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,320
he looked and looked,

280
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,460
he laughed and laughed,

281
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:12,200
he was finally going to have his revenge on the natives of Dustmote 89 AB,

282
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,100
aboard Jesus's flagship,

283
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,840
dozens of killer theologians,

284
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,700
the shock priests,

285
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,300
were busy at their weapons terminals,

286
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,600
on the power decks,

287
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,060
the proper orgone cycles were being timed by mass fornications between the ritual crew,

288
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,900
and the cancer beings from Theta Z,

289
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,160
an invasion ready state existed in the ship,

290
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,220
and the 900 others floating over the doomed planet earth,

291
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,500
Jesus was in a psychopathically elated state,

292
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:45,080
his face resembled many of the perverse icons the humanoids of the Dustmote painted of him,

293
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,440
they prayed to these for the salvation of their souls,

294
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,660
as if they had any souls to save,

295
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,380
as if anyone would want to save them,

296
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,520
which they didn't,

297
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,680
a whole disgusting religion now centered around his murder,

298
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,760
they had to gall to nail him up like a common criminal,

299
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,120
and then paint pictures of him enjoying it,

300
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,440
and they thought he loved them so,

301
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,720
that he was forgiving,

302
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,800
oh the anticipation,

303
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,280
he was sick to his stomach with glee,

304
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,500
he would show them the true face of pain and sin,

305
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,140
it had taken him 2000 long years to return here,

306
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,420
and now he would pay them back for the scars he still carried in his hands,

307
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,260
sweet stigmata,

308
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,480
even the slightest thought of the scars made them glow red through his fists,

309
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,280
through the boxing gloves,

310
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:32,580
he would show them the true face of pain and sin,

311
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:32,580


312
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:32,580


313
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,880
the hold of the spacecraft was manned with angels of light,

314
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,840
personally lent by Jehovah One,

315
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:47,200
they supervised the demon teams operating on all tangible destruction spectrums,

316
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,600
all in attack mode,

317
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,720
Nagas,

318
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,300
Orzuma,

319
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:50,760
Shiva,

320
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,480
Horus,

321
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,120
Aeons,

322
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,480
the dark bodies,

323
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,540
and at,

324
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,260
at time and a half too,

325
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,520
it was expensive to ravage a planet,

326
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,640
no matter,

327
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,220
that which comes had finally arrived,

328
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,900
and on Jesus's birthday,

329
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,200
what do you think dad?

330
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,580
his second in command,

331
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,240
Jim Jones,

332
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,780
stood by with the final attack coordinate codices,

333
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,120
a whole graphic map of earth rotated slowly next to Jones in midair,

334
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,200
on its surface,

335
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,380
grids of the natives planetary defenses,

336
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,500
were lit up in green,

337
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,040
ones,

338
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,900
some depicting their pathetic communication structures in violet,

339
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,280
all in scale,

340
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,280
quite pretty actually,

341
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,740
a colorful net,

342
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,060
surrounded the sphere,

343
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,280
it would soon enough be dark,

344
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,620
these children wait for us below Jesus,

345
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,520
we will walk among them and we will smile,

346
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,900
at your moment of choice of course,

347
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,880
Jesus studied Jones puffy tired face,

348
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,380
in the pink glow of the neuron banks that ran around the walls,

349
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,500
of the mighty dreadnought and shuttered,

350
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,620
he was no stranger to resurrection of the undead,

351
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,040
but whoever had brought Jones around again had slipped up,

352
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,680
something was missing,

353
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,780
something else was added,

354
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,800
something,

355
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,460
Jones had been forced on him by the gin bankers,

356
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,980
who had financed this angelic war fleet,

357
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,700
damn them,

358
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,880
he never forgot the price they had demanded for this mercenary raiding fleet,

359
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,340
Jones constant reminders of their influence and expectations,

360
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,120
irritated Jesus no end,

361
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,980
not to mention the annoying habit Jones had copied from Dobbs,

362
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,240
the twisted creature insisted on smoking a pipe,

363
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,520
even here near the sensitive nerve relays,

364
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,740
Jones might have been left dead a little too long,

365
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,000
he moved with a constant jerk and always poked at his throat,

366
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,740
he never removed his sunglasses,

367
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,880
and he still took massive injections of methamphetamines,

368
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,860
even though they no longer had any effect,

369
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,120
on his regenerated shell,

370
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,360
you know Jimbo,

371
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,560
said Jesus,

372
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,860
the best part is that they think there's an afterlife,

373
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,140
that's why they strung me up the first time,

374
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,600
they think like bugs down there,

375
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,340
I'm well aware of that commander,

376
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,820
it bothered Jones to be back on earth so soon,

377
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,200
after his failure with the social programming research post,

378
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,140
he had been running there,

379
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,800
it wasn't really his fault,

380
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,920
the administration change at central,

381
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,360
merely,

382
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,980
cut off the funding for it,

383
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,840
he was forced to abort the experiment,

384
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,480
then we'll have to wait before we find out what this is all about,

385
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,580
not entirely,

386
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,400
the papers we found in Harding's laboratory,

387
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,320
explain why they're building the hydrogen bomb,

388
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,880
its explosion was intended to deflect the rotation of the earth enough,

389
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,220
to send it out of its orbit and spinning off into space,

390
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,780
those zombies must have been as crazy as they looked,

391
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,380
it may sound ridiculous,

392
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,740
but it's theoretically possible,

393
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,500
yeah we're safe now,

394
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,580
for the time being,

395
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,420
but there are undoubtedly more of those power mad creatures loose on other planets,

396
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,860
so it'll take constant vigilance on our part,

397
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,120
to ensure the safety of this world,

398
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,280
hello,

399
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,420
I'm a martian,

400
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,940
I hope I speak your language,

401
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,560
this is a recording,

402
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,620
what?

403
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,320
take me to your leader,

404
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,180
take me to your leader,

405
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,180
if this was indeed an extraterrestrial spacecraft,

406
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,220
with living occupants,

407
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,880
it must have been very disconcerting for them,

408
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,200
to cross millions of miles of space,

409
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,020
only to be hit on the head with rotten oranges,

410
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,560
the dramatic advent of such fascinating objects,

411
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,960
as those which were first called flying saucers,

412
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,080
attracted the inevitable attention of those individuals,

413
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,300
who let their imaginations run away with their veracity,

414
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,140
by 1950 some of these characters were beginning to spin their stories,

415
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,940
of fantastic conversations with alleged space people,

416
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:45,020
some of them expanded the stories to include alleged rides in the UFOs,

417
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,920
suddenly everything went black,

418
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,100
and I realized that I'd been cut off and shut off in a little tiny room,

419
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,400
where nobody was listening to me,

420
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,400
and I was talking to this hot little plush felt,

421
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,960
red rubber tip microphone,

422
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,660
not hearing a thing and seeing only little tiny lights,

423
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,260
and wondering why I was strapped to this chair,

424
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,360
and put into the studio that seemed to be rotating very rapidly,

425
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,200
with lights flashing off rhythmically,

426
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,000
and it was a small man with a swollen head,

427
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,940
and hideously deformed eyes,

428
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,340
sitting behind the console pushing the buttons,

429
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,600
while pencils of light and energy flashed across my body,

430
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,380
and I wondered why I was there,

431
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,760
and what did they want of me,

432
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,120
and I couldn't figure out why I was sitting there,

433
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,460
and they didn't say anything,

434
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,360
they just kept flashing those lights at me,

435
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,880
and pumping those strange chemicals into me,

436
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,700
and the man with the funny head,

437
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,200
the leader,

438
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,840
the man with the strange grin and the pipe,

439
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,260
well, I just want to know,

440
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,540
do you want to be in the church,

441
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,800
or out of the church,

442
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,900
and where's your wallet?

443
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,000
The DC9 pushed the button.

444
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,220
Yeah.

445
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,200
I didn't know that I'd been snatched up,

446
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,220
but it wasn't really a dream,

447
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,580
until I saw these sacred nasal tubes,

448
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:46,880
and these little positions,

449
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,520
and suddenly it all came back to me,

450
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,080
and I realized that they'd stolen

451
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,080
four and a half hours out of my life,

452
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,940
when they put me in that tiny room,

453
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,560
and plugged all those wires into me,

454
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,860
and made me talk,

455
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,760
and talk,

456
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,780
and talk,

457
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,340
and talk,

458
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:01,880
and talk,

459
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,220
and talk,

460
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,940
and talk,

461
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,120
and talk,

462
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,760
and talk.

463
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,340
Friends and neighbors of planet Earth,

464
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,900
I come to you from a long, long ways off.

465
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,980
I come from a planet that is similar to yours.

466
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,720
Your many fears,

467
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,060
tensions,

468
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,700
and frustrations are no longer ours.

469
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,280
I hate them with all my heart.

470
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,780
They are inhuman and to be destroyed.

471
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,960
What is your objective?

472
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,320
You are not ready,

473
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,840
but we will still save you.

474
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,180
In your quest for self-destruction,

475
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,680
you will send up more satellites,

476
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,640
and we will be there,

477
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,580
waiting to come again.

478
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,720
I'll be right here.

479
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,580
And we'll be sending that little almond-eyed gray humanoid

480
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,300
around to your door to collect those organs, so...

481
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:55,820
Snappy.

482
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,260
He'll be in a cute little uniform,

483
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,320
so don't be afraid.

484
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
They're your friends.

485
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,580
They're here to help.

486
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,100
They're our brothers from the stars.

487
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,360
You should believe anything they whisper into your ear

488
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,700
in the dead of night as you try to sleep.

489
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,820
Whisper, whisper, whisper.

490
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,920
They're your friends.

491
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,300
They want to teach you.

492
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,080
They want to teach humanity

493
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,160
and lead us into a new age of enlightenment

494
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,040
under their gray jackboot.

495
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,840
Whisper, whisper.

496
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,900
Now listen, now listen, now listen, now listen, now listen.

497
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,120
If you wake up in a vat of poison

498
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,880
with little aliens standing around outside the vat

499
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,260
wrapping, tying napkins around their necks,

500
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,760
sharpening their knives and forks,

501
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,420
be glad, because you've just fell into the hands of the good aliens.

502
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,840
The bad aliens are far, far worse.

503
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,520
Whoa!

504
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,420
Oh, they're not like the Thing.

505
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:59,100
That was a cuddly little Benji of an alien compared to what we're...

506
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,480
They aren't like aliens in that movie Aliens.

507
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,120
Those are silly little werewolves among monsters

508
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,780
compared to what we're talking about.

509
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,940
That descends a box.

510
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,420
What we're talking about is more like

511
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,280
what's growing in your refrigerator right now.

512
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,060
That's what it looks more like.

513
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,180
That's what this is.

514
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:24,740
And the effect is it turns you into the alien.

515
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,260
But man, take my word for it, it's worth it.

516
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,660
It's great, man.

517
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,920
It's cool, you'll love it.

518
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,960
I'm just a bit crummy now.

519
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,660
It's for your own good.

520
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,760
I feel so much better.

521
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,100
I feel so much better.

522
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,300
What's the matter? Are you afraid?

523
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
What's the matter, you chicken?

524
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,760
Come on, man, everybody's doing it.

525
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,600
Go ahead.

526
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,880
Stroke the alien and collect the dew

527
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,100
that builds up on the side of its neck like appendage.

528
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,880
Go ahead.

529
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,060
Now demagnetize your head.

530
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:06,780
Okay?

531
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,460
I think you know what to do next.

532
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,320
I don't think you're the kind of listener

533
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,060
that I'd have to explain that to, now are you?

534
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,320
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

535
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,460
Yeah, I think they know just what I'm talking about.

536
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,320
Oh, they like it too.

537
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,380
Oh, they're first damn good.

538
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,500
I don't know what to do next.

539
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,200
You stand up on the hillside with your bat call

540
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,800
and blow into the bat call.

541
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,320
Don't try to...

542
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,300
It's not like a moose call or a duck call.

543
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,480
You can't hear it.

544
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,620
Yeah, but it's super...

545
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,020
That's a superfluous call.

546
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,440
I give it to you on me.

547
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,420
And just make sure you've got your antidote pudding ready

548
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,260
for when that bat lands on your face,

549
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,460
you're gonna have to use that pudding mighty quick.

550
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,500
That's not good.

551
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,880
But it's worth it.

552
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,160
You'll dig it.

553
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:57,860
Well, I don't know.

554
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,160
I'm kind of scared.

555
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,720
Well, it's always scary the first time.

556
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,900
That's part of the kick, man.

557
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,620
Oh, okay.

558
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,600
Come on, everybody's doing it.

559
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,340
I ain't never gonna do it.

560
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,400
I'm too old to do it.

561
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,380
Aren't you susceptible to peer group pressure?

562
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,580
I'm too old for it.

563
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,000
What are you, some kind of a weirdo?

564
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,640
Yes.

565
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,540
No, I'm not a weirdo.

566
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,400
I want to be like everyone else.

567
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,180
Oh, no, no.

568
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,860
Good, then you'll take this little alien home and...

569
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,680
I am a weirdo.

570
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,940
Hey, stop rubbing your leg.

571
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,120
I can't do the game.

572
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,700
I don't think there's a reason for her to be confused.

573
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,080
There's something you find when you open the door.

574
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,340
You take these keys,

575
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,540
and one of the keys says Bob on it.

576
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,220
You stick it in the lock,

577
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,600
and you open up the door.

578
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,320
And if you're lucky, the green carpet rolls out.

579
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,180
And if you're not...

580
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,920
the red carpet rolls out.

581
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,460
He was communicating with them.

582
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,960
What do you think?

583
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,940
I think Rockefeller was crazy that night.

584
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,840
He got away with the money.

585
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,800
And the...

586
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,960
How can we stop them?

587
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,740
We can stop them by stopping the Pink Boys.

588
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,420
If we stop the Pink Boys,

589
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,080
we can stop them murdering and they're killing

590
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,580
and they're stealing and they're persifying us.

591
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,560
But it's so difficult.

592
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,460
Oh, Jerry, don't let the boy...

593
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,680
Be brave. Be brave.

594
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,000
Oh, always be brave.

595
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,860
Because the women saves us.

596
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,080
Greetings to you Earthlings.

597
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,840
I am Princess Dragomum.

598
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,940
I have taken over this planet.

599
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,860
Now I own the Earth,

600
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,680
and you'll be my slaves for all eternity.

601
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,860
The disasters you experienced are just

602
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,420
small examples of our great power.

603
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,580
Either surrender to me or I'll destroy all humans.

604
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,740
I've spoken.

605
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,000
It's early warning you're going to get from me.

606
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,960
You'll be destroyed.

607
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,480
They don't sleep either.

608
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,640
They're not emotional.

609
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,200
Angels don't have any emotion.

610
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,320
Another and worse war will break out.

611
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,360
When you see a night with a strange light in the sky,

612
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,660
you will know it is a sign that the world

613
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,800
is about to be punished for its crime.

614
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:12,720
By 1998, every normal man,

615
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,460
mediocrity, pink boy, admin,

616
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,640
Trekkie and hippie is going to be trying to get on board

617
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,260
with the good ship dogs.

618
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,180
Or they're going to fry along with everybody else

619
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,400
when those aliens get here.

620
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,720
Of course, such a prophecy immediately arises our cynicism.

621
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,880
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999?

622
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,800
Perhaps.

623
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,720
Or is it just another of those prognostications

624
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,700
which have haunted mankind?

625
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,120
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom

626
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,840
could generally be dismissed out of hand.

627
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,840
But for the fact that many of Nostradamus's other prophecies

628
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,880
have already been fulfilled.

629
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,140
But the old ones are coming back.

630
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,380
I'm going to let them through.

631
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,880
The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs

632
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,440
and explosions and fallout.

633
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,740
On July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m.,

634
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,700
when we all had the courage to go to the moon,

635
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,540
we had hangovers.

636
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,180
Wu-Tang's judgment will take place in the form of

637
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,360
what the pre-scriptures call the advent of the angelic host.

638
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,480
Happy, happy Independence Day.

639
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,080
Happy real Independence Day, my friends.

640
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,200
Because here in Dallas, Texas,

641
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,460
which is in its own time zone, you know,

642
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,440
all the cities that get the hour of slack

643
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,740
are in different time continuums.

644
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,920
And in Dallas, yesterday was July 4th,

645
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,540
the day before real Independence Day.

646
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,400
You see, for subgeniuses,

647
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,440
July 4th is like the day of disappointment

648
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,120
and shattered dreams.

649
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,780
It's a day of lies and rushes to judgment

650
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,600
of drunken pinks and car crashes

651
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,320
and depressing desert storm parades.

652
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,520
And we mope around and think about things

653
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,700
like Wounded Knee and JFK and assassination

654
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,200
and the Spanish-American War and Vietnam

655
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,580
and Iran-Contras and Watergate and so on.

656
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,020
But, dear friends...

657
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:29,520
Dear friends, July 5th...

658
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:36,560
July 5th, that is a day of hope and promise

659
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,300
for the subgeniuses.

660
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,760
Yes, friends, the day when the true America,

661
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,000
the Bob's America,

662
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,240
the America of our Masonic subgenius

663
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,860
Patriot forefathers and foremoms and foreslaves.

664
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,680
Today, July 5th, in Dallas, anyway,

665
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,920
is the first day of the end of the world.

666
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,000
The end of their world, dear friends,

667
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,080
because it's the first day before the beginning

668
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,960
of our world.

669
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,480
Our subgenius planet.

670
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,840
Uh, yes, yes, yes.

671
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,260
It makes me feel so good, so good

672
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,880
to have a subgenius holiday.

673
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,840
We need more subgenius holidays.

674
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,680
Of course, every day is Bob's birthday,

675
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,240
but, you know, that gets unrealistic after a while.

676
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,380
And so we call, well, July 4th,

677
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,680
what the pinks call their Independence Day,

678
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,220
we call July 4th X Day Eve.

679
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,540
And, uh, uh, X Day Night, of course,

680
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,360
we call X Day Eve, sort of like Halloween.

681
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,020
But X Day is our Independence Day.

682
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,180
Not July 4th, not Juneteenth, but X-est-mas.

683
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,600
X-est-mas, dear friends.

684
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,840
And, you know, the night before X-est-mas,

685
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:58,620
the whole family, the subgenius fully extended nuclear family,

686
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,220
goes out and watches fireworks

687
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,700
or else illegally sets them off

688
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,640
in their backyard.

689
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,980
And then everyone, the kids and everyone,

690
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,860
go in and watch Freddy Krueger's

691
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,960
Nightmare on Elm Street videos around the fireplace.

692
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,140
And, uh, the kids are tucked in, of course,

693
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,480
about 1 o'clock in the morning.

694
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,180
And the grown-ups stay up all night

695
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,140
frobbing and frobbing and dooning

696
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,060
and gleaning

697
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,260
and, uh, doing X Day chants

698
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:31,340
about how the time is nigh for their arisal.

699
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
And, uh, songs, you know,

700
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,480
X Day holiday songs like

701
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,720
Take Me Off to Space, which we'll be playing soon.

702
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,040
And, uh, on X Day morning, of course,

703
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,840
well, the grown-ups have been up all night,

704
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,200
but the kids get up real early

705
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,160
because on X Day,

706
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,480
the children are allowed to eat breakfast.

707
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,640
And, uh, just before 7 o'clock,

708
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,900
all the grown-ups and everybody sit outdoors

709
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,580
on their easy chairs like I did this morning

710
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,360
with beers or whatever in their hands.

711
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,780
And, uh, and they do a countdown up till 7 a.m.

712
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,160
And then since it's not really X Day yet,

713
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,600
they meditate, friends, on what it's gonna be like

714
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,220
when those men from Planet X come down

715
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,960
and destroy the normal people on this planet

716
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,240
and take the weird abnormals and eccentrics

717
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,240
and those of us who have to live in disguise as a human

718
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,620
and lift us up, up and away

719
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,780
into the escaped vessels of the sex goddesses.

720
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,900
I mean, that's what our religion is all about.

721
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,700
But, you know, anyway, on X Day,

722
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,380
after thinking about all that,

723
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,060
we sing hymns more about how the humans are all gonna die.

724
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,480
And, uh, then there's some rock and roll

725
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,120
and dancing and so forth.

726
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,280
And then everybody goes to bed,

727
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,440
usually fairly early in the day,

728
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,680
because you have to sleep.

729
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,140
I've been up all night on X Day Eve.

730
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,260
And, uh, they need to have energy for X Dayeen.

731
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,520
So on our... X Dayeen, when...

732
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,580
the night of X-mas,

733
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,980
when everybody dresses up in costumes,

734
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,580
dress up like angels or devils or God

735
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,600
or Jesus or Bob or even Negi.

736
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,200
And, of course, you can get those Bob and Negi masks

737
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,420
from your favorite subgenius vendors at Frat Tin Company.

738
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,420
As seen in your start fist.

739
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,500
Ah, yes.

740
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,400
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

741
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,940
Shalikandala dabasoya.

742
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,200
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

743
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,180
Oh. Oh.

744
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,220
You have to go?

745
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:32,680
Oh, no.

746
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,020
Scary monsters get the shock of a lifetime

747
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,760
when they close and counter

748
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,180
the third time for the first time.

749
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,960
...will descend with their scientifically magic implements.

750
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,780
There'll be stalls of technology

751
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,820
that will be too much for us to handle.

752
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,940
In one instant, all the hangovers will disappear,

753
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,720
along with all pollution and nuclear weapons.

754
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,960
But in return, the human race will have to take on

755
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,480
living machinery so complex that though it is peaceful,

756
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,360
the end result will be...

757
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,520
...the equivalent to letting toddlers play with a nuclear arsenal.

758
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,220
Bob, and not some conspiracy world government,

759
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,940
must be there in a position of world leadership

760
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,580
to explain humanity's behavior to the Exus

761
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,060
in ways they can understand

762
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,700
so they don't put us out of our misery

763
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,220
with a snap of their cosmic finger

764
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,860
like they did the dinosaurs.

765
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,180
The right people, us, must be the ones

766
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,460
that the Exus make into superhuman overmen.

767
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,340
And even then, things will be different.

768
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,600
And we'll be damn tough for the rest of this period,

769
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,280
which is called the time and half time.

770
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,280
The Exus have landed

771
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,020
Earth's under their control

772
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,320
Dobbs' vision

773
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:02,840
has proven

774
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,100
the city's

775
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,860
radioactive holes

776
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,920
We don't know

777
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,860
what their game is

778
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,600
But their name is

779
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,480
unpronounceable

780
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,300
We don't know

781
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,220
what they came for

782
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,980
But what they aim for

783
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,960
Is impossible

784
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,440
But is there not any peace

785
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,860
In the second year before the millennium

786
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,900
On the day of God come Wednesday

787
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,340
As in the twinkling of an eye

788
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,720
They will come among the Yakutism

789
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,100
Which are likened to thy great white brothers

790
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,240
They come as men

791
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,680
As graven images

792
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,840
As the whirlwind

793
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,180
And as the clock

794
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,260
And beyond all the heavens

795
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,180
Where people will be

796
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,720
The Exus have landed

797
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,180
Their machines

798
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,740
Following our tracks

799
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,600
Dobbs' vision

800
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,040
Stands proven

801
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,440
A world

802
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,600
Without slack

803
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:45,100
And a lost dream

804
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,460
Sabines

805
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,320
are leaving the planet

806
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,780
yeah

807
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,100
You keep it in your

808
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,100


809
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,100


810
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,780
classroom

811
00:33:59,780 --> 00:33:59,820
shock

812
00:33:59,820 --> 00:33:59,820


813
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Br��

814
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,780
and suns in the earth, blood-bellages from the earth,

815
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:09,360
my lights in the sky rebuke thee, the children of heaven,

816
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,680
and the angels from heaven are among thee,

817
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:17,400
spreading lies and deception, they turn not as they go.

818
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,180
But who cares, dear friends, who cares?

819
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,660
Because the end times are coming up.

820
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,240
You know, it's the first day of the end of the world.

821
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:37,840
And we've been given, Bob has given us to see signs

822
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,360
and portents of what will bring this end,

823
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,000
what will trigger the day of judgment.

824
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,920
And what it's gonna be, of course, we know when.

825
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,040
The exes will, of course, arrive July 5th, 1998

826
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,480
at seven o'clock in the morning all over the world.

827
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,780
But what triggers the end

828
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,440
of the world is the end times for the other alien beings.

829
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,340
The Yakatizma and so forth is this one moment

830
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,780
when the world, when America becomes so decadent

831
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,180
that it no longer deserves to live.

832
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,220
And that sign of the end times, dear friends,

833
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,900
is the royal jelly enema.

834
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,420
At a time, 1998, 97, doesn't matter when, might be now,

835
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,420
may have already happened.

836
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,560
A time when beggars are crowding the streets

837
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,680
and children, poor children are out starving.

838
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,340
Celebrities and lawyers in Hollywood will be indulging

839
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,860
in the latest hedonistic health, the crackpot health fad.

840
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,860
Getting enemas with pure royal jelly,

841
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,580
the honey fed to queen bees,

842
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,980
which costs $1,000 for enough royal jelly to get the average,

843
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,220
shaded swinger, you know, off or whatever.

844
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,000
And so at this time when the homeless are selling

845
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,680
their babies to procure used, leftover ambergris

846
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,520
and royal jelly enema byproducts,

847
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,240
when a Hollywood star, the moment when a Hollywood star

848
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,300
spends $60,000 in one night on that,

849
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,820
and his used jelly is sold on the streets

850
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,620
for $200 for a half a pint,

851
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,060
this so disgusts the aliens that they

852
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:31,980
decide to trash the earth before the exes arrive.

853
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,280
Friends, it's gonna be a rough time,

854
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,380
and I'm gonna, this is gonna be an all ex day night,

855
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:47,140
a night of celebrating, yes, that time when Bob will come

856
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,900
and hose down the streets and clean up this crooked

857
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,980
and perverse nation.

858
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,860
So we're gonna hear from Father Joe Mama as he delves on

859
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,040
into this as well.

860
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,400
Praise Bob.

861
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,300
Hello friends, and welcome.

862
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,840
You know, most of you out there must be feeling

863
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,260
pretty smug with yourselves.

864
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,420
After all, you're alive, you're healthy,

865
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,320
your life's insured, there's a little money set aside

866
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,260
in case of accidents.

867
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,880
What more could you ask for?

868
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,820
These are good times.

869
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,860
Easy money, easy sex, VCRs and Nintendo to keep your minds

870
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,220
occupied.

871
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,540
You know, they say that the golden age is never the present

872
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,840
age, they really do say that.

873
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,300
But we look all around us everywhere, and what do we see?

874
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,260
Golden opportunity.

875
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,340
Well, friends, that's just calm before the storm,

876
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,020
because tonight's sermon is entitled Ex Day 1998,

877
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,420
Day of Reckoning.

878
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,400
We all know vaguely what Ex Day is.

879
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,920
Bob told us himself that it shall occur July 5th, 1998,

880
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,440
the Exes shall land and whisk the good subgenies off

881
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,520
to never-ending pleasure cruise of the cosmos.

882
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,140
But what of the pinks that remain on earth?

883
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,520
What will happen to the a-holes that are left behind?

884
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,680
Well friends, as much as I hate to gloat over those

885
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,520
less fortunate, the fact is they'll get exactly

886
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,280
what they deserve.

887
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,100
Now to any real subgenie, giving a normal what he deserves

888
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,020
is about the cruelest fade a normal could ever receive.

889
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,900
After all, that's what the world is all about.

890
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:29,400
These are the same normals that have supported the conspiracy for centuries.

891
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,400
These are the same normals that have tortured us with their ignorance and defiled the name of Bob.

892
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,700
These are the same normals that have taken the most free country in the world

893
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,520
and turned it into an ever-growing bureaucratic governmental monster

894
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,460
that feeds on taxes, committees, laws, statutes, buck-passing, and fill-in-the-blank.

895
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,340
Then, once the creature's rot-filled gut sprues out the digested combination of all the vashes

896
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,660
before mentioned by the lawyers and liars that created this filth,

897
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,800
what's the result?

898
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,380
Why, the conspiracy, of course!

899
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:06,040
And this pile of stinking defecation we're supposed to kneel before and worship and serve?

900
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,160
Never!

901
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,760
Bob will avenge us for the years of conspiracy rule

902
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:15,100
on that most dreaded of subgenius holidays, X-Day 1998.

903
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,180
Dreaded by them, but not by us.

904
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,580
Let us look at Bob's prophecy

905
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,880
and see what the normals have done.

906
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,360
Let us see what the normals have in store for them, shall we?

907
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,680
Bob's word comes in many mysterious ways,

908
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,180
not all of which are immediately recognized as divine in origin.

909
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,560
Indeed, since Bob transcends time, so does his word.

910
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,080
This revelation popped up in a 1938 radio drama.

911
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,240
In this story, the Martians, then a synonym for aliens,

912
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,160
later to be known as X's,

913
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,640
have landed and started to round up the normals.

914
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,880
Two of the unlucky survivors meet to discuss the future,

915
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,460
the future of mankind.

916
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,100
The smarter one asserts, quote,

917
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,060
I've thought it all out.

918
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,100
Right now, we're caught as we're wanted.

919
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,440
An X's only has to go a few miles to get a crowd on the run.

920
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,540
But they won't keep on doing that.

921
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,660
They'll begin catching us systematic-like,

922
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,860
keeping the best and storing us in cages and things.

923
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,740
They haven't begun on us yet. Not begun.

924
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,320
Later he goes on to say,

925
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,880
All those little office workers,

926
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,800
that used to live in these houses,

927
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,600
they'll be no good.

928
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,520
They haven't any stuff in them.

929
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,940
They used to run, run off to work.

930
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,120
I have seen hundreds of them running,

931
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,860
and catching their commuter trains in the morning,

932
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,740
afraid that they'd get canned if they didn't.

933
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,840
Running back at night, afraid that they wouldn't be in time for dinner.

934
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,180
Lives insured and a little invested in case of accidents.

935
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:55,880
Yea, and on Sundays, worried about the heroines.

936
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,180
Well, the X's will be a godsend for those guys.

937
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:05,540
Nice roomy cages, good food, careful breeding, and no worries.

938
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,780
Yea, after a week or so of chasing around the fields on empty stomachs,

939
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,660
they'll come and be glad to be caught.

940
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,520
Now this is 1938, mind you.

941
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,600
He goes on to say, finally,

942
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,140
That's not all.

943
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,100
These X's are going to make pets of some of them,

944
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,780
train them to do tricks.

945
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,880
Who knows, get sentimental over the pet born.

946
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,800
There's a boy who grew up and had to be killed.

947
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,440
Yea, and some maybe, they'll train to hunt us.

948
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,380
Yes, they will.

949
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,100
There's men who will do it gladly.

950
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,780
Well, friends, how much more obvious does Bob have to be?

951
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:44,200
When he gave this brief preview of the future in 1938 on CBS,

952
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,740
it sent millions of normals into the streets screaming for a reprieve.

953
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,320
They repented, they begged forgiveness,

954
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,800
and yet, just a few days later,

955
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,980
after Bob,

956
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,140
Orson Welles,

957
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,260
and the War of the Worlds broadcast was described by the conspiracy

958
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,440
as nothing more than a joke,

959
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,080
the normals went back to the conspiracy way of life

960
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,160
as if nothing had ever happened.

961
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,800
They came so close to getting a second chance in mending their ways,

962
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,740
but they blew it.

963
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,000
They went back to the conspiracy masters,

964
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,340
and for their loyalty,

965
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,960
they were geniously rewarded with yet another world war.

966
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,120
There's a strange sense of poetic justice to it, isn't there, friends?

967
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,240
Well, they haven't seen nothing yet.

968
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,300
Just wait till the real McCoy comes.

969
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,880
It's only a few miles down the road, pink boy,

970
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,360
and like Dr. Howe prescribes to his patients,

971
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,140
if you're caught in the nuclear holocaust and your skin begins to melt,

972
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,220
don't panic.

973
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,940
This is perfectly normal.

974
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,920
Yes, friends, just another normal way to die for the normals doomed to die.

975
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,240
Did I say doomed to die?

976
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,140
I should have said lucky to die,

977
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,860
for blissed are the dead after X-Day arrives.

978
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,100
The doomed are the dead.

979
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,240
The unlucky are pink survivors

980
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,880
who must live out their wretched existence under the cruel and merciless exes.

981
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,940
Cruel to them, but not to us.

982
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,100
Not only will there be no more bowling alleys and golf courses for the pinks,

983
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,840
but there'll be no more subgenies to kick around anymore.

984
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,340
We'll be surfing the celestial stars,

985
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,900
smoking our frock,

986
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:14,920
unweaving our slack,

987
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,700
and sexing our anti-virgins like there was no tomorrow,

988
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,520
because in space, friends, there isn't.

989
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,360
Only back on Earth will it be a tomorrow,

990
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,640
and then the next day,

991
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,080
and the next day,

992
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:24,380
and the next.

993
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,640
It'll be an eternal hell without end,

994
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,620
and we'll be enjoying it all in the heavens on closed-circuit TV,

995
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,320
because we won't want to miss a single revenge film minute.

996
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,900
Praise Bob!

997
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:36,880
Amen.

998
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,460
Take me off to space

999
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,880
Take me off to space

1000
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,680
Calm down, you saucer man

1001
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,460
Take me off to space

1002
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,800
Take me off to space

1003
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,020
Take me off to space

1004
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,740
Come on down, you saucer man

1005
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:58,640
And take me off to space

1006
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,880
Take needles in my belly

1007
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,000
Take samples of my skin

1008
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,280
I don't care as long as I can live with saucer man

1009
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,960
I know that you don't take requests

1010
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,740
But I'm a special case

1011
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,300
Come on down, you saucer man

1012
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,020
And take me off to space

1013
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,340
Take me off to space

1014
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,300
Take me off to space

1015
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,920
Come on down, you saucer man

1016
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,700
And take me off to space

1017
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,720
Take me off to space

1018
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,880
Take me off to space

1019
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,500
Come on down, you saucer man

1020
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,320
And take me off to space

1021
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,480
Hey, cow mutilators

1022
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,600
Let me join your crew

1023
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,140
Give me a knife

1024
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,800
You bet your life I'll cut up cows for you

1025
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:45,980
I don't care if you're some kind of ghastly beast without a face

1026
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,340
So come on down, you saucer man

1027
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,000
And take me off to space

1028
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,140
Oh, take me off to space

1029
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,500
Take me off to space

1030
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,860
Come on down, you saucer man

1031
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,680
And take me off to space

1032
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,060
Take me off to space

1033
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,800
Take me off to space

1034
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,520
Come on down, you saucer man

1035
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,120
And take me off to space

1036
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:09,220
Come down, you tiny robot

1037
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,300
With your little nipper claws

1038
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,640
You pale and bug-eyed aliens

1039
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,520
With white and clammy paws

1040
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,000
Life is just a sucker's dream

1041
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,540
And death is a disgrace

1042
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,040
So come on down, you saucer man

1043
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:22,900
And take me off to space

1044
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,800
Take me off to space

1045
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,000
Take me off to space

1046
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,820
Take me off to space

1047
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,720
Oh, take me off to space

1048
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:28,720


1049
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:28,720


1050
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:28,720


1051
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:28,720


1052
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:28,720


1053
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:28,720


1054
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:28,720


1055
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:28,720


1056
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,360
Come on down, you saucer man

1057
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,460
And take me off to space

1058
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:31,840
Take me off to space

1059
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,860
Take me off to space

1060
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,920
Take me off to space

1061
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,940
Take me off to space

1062
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,440
Come on down, you saucer man

1063
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,060
And take me off to space

1064
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:40,860
Space!

1065
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:41,740
Yeah!

1066
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,680
Oh, friends, you know,

1067
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,340
oh, I should mention that was

1068
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,480
Horton Nenslow singing

1069
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,940
Take Me Off to Space, that wonderful old hymn.

1070
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,920
That's one of the hymns that we like to

1071
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,000
sing on our subgenius

1072
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,380
holidays.

1073
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,900
A lovely, lovely

1074
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,060
old-time gospel hymn.

1075
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,560
Yes, yes, yes.

1076
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,040
This is Doctors Forb

1077
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,420
Ob in the background.

1078
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,320
They do it

1079
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,440
their way.

1080
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,980
As the mutants move,

1081
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,680
that leaps up

1082
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,160
Tibetan Tiger Man.

1083
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,520
What about

1084
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,480
this reputed

1085
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,120
Jesus Starfleet that was

1086
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,440
supposed to have shown up?

1087
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:48,100
As you see, they have just left the hangar deck

1088
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,120
at Lunar Central and have cleared

1089
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,720
the airlocks into the colony.

1090
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,980
The crowd of scientists and technicians

1091
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,240
are going wild. What a space

1092
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:56,880
ovation!

1093
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,300
Now let's feel another.

1094
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,660
Now in celebration of this great

1095
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,980
occasion, we have planned a lunar party.

1096
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:06,120
We hope all young people

1097
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,960
throughout the solar system will be

1098
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,800
joining us in celebration of this

1099
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,420
great day in outer space.

1100
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,240
.

1101
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:13,240


1102
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:20,300
.

1103
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,000
.

1104
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,280
.

1105
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:23,280


1106
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:23,280


1107
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,900
Late that Saturday night before retiring,

1108
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,080
I took out the snapshot picture of the

1109
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,880
sailor and studied it until I could close

1110
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,880
my eyes and see this man's face as though

1111
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,960
he was standing in front of me.

1112
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,140
.

1113
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:37,320
.

1114
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,920
.

1115
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:48,940
.

1116
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:48,960
.

1117
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,520
.

1118
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:50,600
.

1119
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:50,800
.

1120
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:50,800


1121
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,800
.

1122
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:51,840
.

1123
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:51,840


1124
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,460
.

1125
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:53,500
.

1126
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,240
.

1127
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,000
.

1128
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,320
.

1129
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:17,400
.

1130
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:17,420
.

1131
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:17,460
.

1132
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:17,660
.

1133
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:17,660


1134
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:29,200
It's difficult to get laid on a Friday night because you have to go to 27 separate singles farms in order to score an entire union.

1135
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,920
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Drew Pearson.

1136
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:39,380
We bring you this special radio television broadcast in order to give you the very latest information on an amazing phenomenon,

1137
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:42,280
the arrival of a spaceship in Washington.

1138
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:49,800
The rumors of invading armies and mass destruction are based on hysteria and are absolutely false.

1139
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,080
The UFOs are picking us up.

1140
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,520
The UFOs are picking us up.

1141
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,920
The UFOs are picking us up.

1142
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:27,980
The part of your soul which is attached to your dollar rises up with the smoke

1143
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:34,560
and it is received by our interplanetary exes, guardians, and you will be saved.

1144
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,440
And in some cases, we don't want the money.

1145
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,980
We throw the money in toilets and flush it down.

1146
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:41,600
But.

1147
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:51,440
Our intra-sewer sponge nine-inch worms receive the part of your soul which is attached to the money again

1148
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,160
and you can be saved by the nine-inch worms also.

1149
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,280
You need Bob following you around.

1150
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,280
Bob can see through all those Bob hands.

1151
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:04,680
The nine-inch worms are the only force which can encounter the exes maggots

1152
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:08,700
and protect humanity from the exes maggots in 1998.

1153
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,980
The exes are going to leave Earth.

1154
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,440
Oh yeah, we'll be completely free to do whatever we want.

1155
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,840
They're just going to leave us alone.

1156
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:24,620
But they're unmentionable, unnameable, horrible maggots will remain.

1157
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,940
We will be dogs to them in more ways than you can ever imagine.

1158
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,520
Unless, unless the nine-inch worms are preserved.

1159
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,700
No eight-inch worms aren't going to help you.

1160
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,000
No ten-inch, ten and a half-inch worms are going to do anything.

1161
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,900
Oh yeah, ten-inch worms will show you a good time.

1162
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:42,160
Oh yeah, ten-inch worms will take you out on the town all night.

1163
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:42,260
Oh yeah, ten-inch worms will take you out on the town all night.

1164
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,660
Compared to those nine-inch worms.

1165
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,500
You know, people are sitting there going, exes, end of the world, 1998.

1166
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:56,200
If they don't buy the book, when 1998 comes and the world is a nuclear wasteland,

1167
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,860
when we're all slaves or ground beef, they're going to go,

1168
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,700
oh, I guess these guys weren't kidding.

1169
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,740
Yeah, I should have read the start fist a little more carefully, he said,

1170
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:12,160
while digging through nuclear holocaust, looking at the third hand growing from his,

1171
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:12,640
stomach.

1172
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,060
Why doesn't it go away?

1173
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:15,480
Oh.

1174
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,920
Heliopters are what brings them.

1175
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,780
You can put it in your pipe and smoke it.

1176
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:28,040
Heliopters are a, this is a legend that's, that is going to be revealed right now in media for the first time.

1177
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:35,140
Heliopters are these quasi-mechanical, leather-clad, demonic, uh, they kind of look like helicopters at first glance,

1178
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:42,260
but they are alive and they're employed by a, uh, I hate to use the term minor deity, but this guy's named Heliopters.

1179
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:48,040
His name is Gabrogfran, and he's right up there with Bob, I'm not kidding, he's right up there with Odin and Arnold Palmer.

1180
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,680
If you ever see anything that says, approved by Gabrogfran, buy it.

1181
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,540
And, and these Heliopters are, uh, are how Dr. Bob equipment has arrived,

1182
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:01,820
and oftentimes there are tons of, of Bob pills on these Heliopters,

1183
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:06,140
these special compartments that were designed for the transport of these sacred, uh, anointings.

1184
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:09,360
It was the Heliopters that originally brought our minds to Dobbs.

1185
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,560
The rattlesnake manure.

1186
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,080
A stench of the spirit.

1187
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:16,240
The spirit is like bone to a million slaughtered swine.

1188
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,800
And in these times thy planet is wreathed in foul vapors of night.

1189
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:28,360
Hold on a minute, the conspiracy has put a slight detour in front of us here, I must change lanes.

1190
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:35,100
But there are other things, other evil, dark, shadowy forces at work in this solar system of ours,

1191
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,560
in this galaxy, in this corner of our universe.

1192
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:41,280
...Nigi by imposing his twisted will...

1193
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:48,540
...upon the trajectories of Jehovah's neutrinos, is able to deflect those trajectories.

1194
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,280
Feasibility study ended.

1195
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,380
Abduction of human race, infeasible.

1196
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,080
Warning, warning.

1197
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:04,280
Psychics applying to Puppers Life have discovered secret Nazi UFO bases in the Antarctic.

1198
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:07,840
The truth that President Truman never told us.

1199
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,420
Dobbs, bless his boring soul.

1200
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:12,940
Superbrow.

1201
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:16,620
See, they called him Wellman when he was a human.

1202
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:20,840
Before the Brow took over. Before the Brow took over.

1203
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,440
This is what I do to all your deities.

1204
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,320
...second until they slow me down.

1205
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:35,620
Therefore, there is a God. End of quote.

1206
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,260
I said you're gonna have to get yourself in discernment here,

1207
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:41,060
and be able to discern the spirit of God,

1208
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,460
from the spirit of Hinduism.

1209
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,840
I said people in Haiti, I said when the Holy Ghost hits them,

1210
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:48,600
they think it's Buddha.

1211
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,200
Because Buddha hits them like the Holy Ghost hits them.

1212
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:59,340
People in America think that when the Holy Ghost hits somebody, it's witchcraft.

1213
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,480
Yes, witchcraft.

1214
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,240
Throws people down. They see demonic visions.

1215
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,080
And the devil uses them.

1216
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:08,440
Buddhaism.

1217
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:10,420
And witchcraft.

1218
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,040
And the powers of the pagan gods.

1219
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,900
The powers of the pagan gods produce its lying signs and wonders.

1220
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:24,100
But I want you to know that the pagan gods and their false religions

1221
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,000
can do what they're doing in the war.

1222
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,540
Bless God, what can we do with a true God,

1223
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,220
with a true Christ, with a true Holy Ghost?

1224
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,680
We ought to be able to do more than what they're doing.

1225
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,160
Hallelujah.

1226
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:36,380
Hallelujah.

1227
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,560
How would God take the scales off your eyes,

1228
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:44,220
and open your eyes to behold that the Lord's coming is at the door,

1229
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,960
and that all that's happening in the world is getting us ready

1230
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,680
for Jesus Christ to dwell in the fullness of God in the saints.

1231
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,760
That we will come forth with revelation and manifestation of the Holy Ghost,

1232
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,760
revealing Christ to the world.

1233
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:03,940
That we will possess in our temples the very fullness of the Spirit.

1234
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,780
That we'll be filled with the Spirit.

1235
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,300
We'll be filled with it.

1236
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,420
We'll have oil in our lamps burning.

1237
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:13,500
That we will not stop until our lives have been complete.

1238
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,420
I don't care.

1239
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:17,920
They can talk about me all over Brownwood and Baines and around here.

1240
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,940
Call me anything, but I'm preaching the truth.

1241
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,080
They can talk about me and turn on this minister and say this ain't real.

1242
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,820
But you let one of them hypocrites come and show where I'm wrong,

1243
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,400
and take the Bible and prove that this ain't God,

1244
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,540
and this ain't the Word of God to the people,

1245
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,020
and I'll leave tomorrow.

1246
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,240
Hallelujah.

1247
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,220
But I'm not leaving tomorrow.

1248
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,400
You say, why?

1249
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:41,880
Because ain't nobody in the state of Texas and the state of Alabama, Florida,

1250
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:45,500
anywhere else can take the Word of God and prove this is wrong.

1251
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,500
They may lie.

1252
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:47,720
They may accuse.

1253
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,700
They may tell old man of evil.

1254
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,960
But they cannot touch this Spirit.

1255
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:54,740
They cannot touch this Word.

1256
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,700
This is the Word of the Holy Ghost.

1257
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,160
This is God's promise.

1258
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:59,620
This is God's Word.

1259
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,740
God's truth to you.

1260
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,900
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1261
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:12,040
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1262

1263
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,640
Got your pencil ready?

1264
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:22,060
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1265
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:29,220
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1267
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,620
Bob Dobbs, Pastor, The Church of the Subgenius

1268
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:40,520
The back is evil.

1269
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,420
I don't know why.

1270
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,900
My wife, she fell down and they've had to pick her up.

1271
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:46,520
Her leg's okay.

1272
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,460
And something, you can't get something for nothing.

1273
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:50,740
If it ain't one thing, it's another.

1274
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:51,500
It.

1275
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,440
You know what I'm talking about.

1276
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:52,660
It.

1277
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,060
It.

1278
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:53,520
It.

1279
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,540
Ain't one thing.

1280
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,320
It.

1281
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,440
It's gonna be another.

1282
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,500
It may be coming back on that opposite reality chain.

1283
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:02,080
The one coming back the other way, it's like a big eight.

1284
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:02,900
It's like a big eight.

1285
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:07,380
And if it weren't for nothing, in contrast, you know, we'd be like nothing too compared to it.

1286
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,860
And you can't know nothing unless you know everything.

1287
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:13,720
But you can't know everything unless you know nothing.

1288
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,540
I mean, people say I'm crazy and they get in there and they say,

1289
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:21,160
but the Hades, the Hades and the unseen world and the abode of the lost.

1290
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:22,120
And they say that ain't real.

1291
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,500
And I seen it down there on the seventh level and I...

1292
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,080
The mystery, the mystery, the mystery, it just tears us apart, the mystery.

1293
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,180
And if we can just say...

1294
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:33,520
I know.

1295
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,640
I know.

1296
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:43,320
We'll say it's shades in the sky and...

1297
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:47,940
Just, yeah, it feels like we're...

1298
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,080
We're...

1299
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,660
Yeah.

1300
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:58,860
it feels like a Nameless, It feels like an Bizim enfim...

1301
00:57:58,860 --> 00:57:59,740
No!

1302
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:02,160
It feels like the point is that it's empty wise for the people I'veああ this revolted

1303
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:02,160


1304
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:02,160


1305
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:02,160


1306
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:07,060
Don't you feel it sometimes you just have to let one go.

1307
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,180
Yeah.

1308
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,960
I catch in a big old blow.

1309
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:13,400
Hi, Jim.

1310
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,440
Hello there, Irving.

1311
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,980
Oh, man.

1312
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,060
Dr. Irving's day.

1313
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:19,920
Hi.

1314
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:20,980
Hi, you guys.

1315
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:21,960
Hi.

1316
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:22,640
How are you doing?

1317
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:22,980
Good morning.

1318
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,940
Well, here's another one.

1319
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,440
And we like to listen to your takes, sir.

1320
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:32,980
And another one.

1321
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:33,620
We've heard this.

1322
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:34,400
This is the fourth one.

1323
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:34,440
Yeah.

1324
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,800
I mean, you guys are so good all over.

1325
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,520
Feel alive.

1326
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,320
We're breathing.

1327
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:42,900
What's this?

1328
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:44,760
I'm eating.

1329
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,140
I'm eating.

1330
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,000
That's living food.

1331
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:49,900
Big laugh.

1332
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,060
Want to hear me chew?

1333
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,420
I don't know.

1334
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,920
Are you any reliable?

1335
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:00,340
What's your relation to?

1336
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,840
Bulldog Drummer?

1337
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:02,100
Arnold Stang?

1338
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,360
Arnold Stang?

1339
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:09,060
Let me talk to those subgeniuses.

1340
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,320
I gotta talk to those subgeniuses.

1341
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,920
I'm getting a deep backwards.

1342
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,580
The devil spoke to me.

1343
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,160
Many birds.

1344
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,540
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

1345
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:24,080
If this day in beautiful North Texas comes to an end, we hope we've been a pleasant

1346
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:24,980
part of your day.

1347
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,920
We strive for quality and are happy to display this National Association of Broadcasting

1348
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:29,920


1349
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:29,920


1350
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:29,920


1351
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:29,920


1352
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:29,920


1353
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:29,920


1354
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:29,920


1355
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,020
Broadcasters seal of good practice.

1356
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:35,260
We hope you've had a good day and that you'll join us again tomorrow.

1357
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:36,240
Good night.

1358
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,520
Good morning.

1359
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:45,940
This is Doug and I'm here in the laboratories and this 90 minute cassette has not been totally

1360
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:46,540
filled up.

1361
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:51,760
Unfortunately, since I edited all that stuff, some new junk came in.

1362
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,920
So, yeah, right.

1363
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:59,900
Some of these people I have been told can get high off of human blood or can get high off

1364
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,020
of animal blood.

1365
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:05,360
But they feel very strongly that the blood from certain animals at certain points in

1366
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,160
time and the things that are done at certain points in time give them strength.

1367
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,300
Give them power over certain things.

1368
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,100
Tommy Roy Bland of Louisville.

1369
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:13,980
This man says no.

1370
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:14,860
It's all a myth.

1371
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:19,700
A crazy hoax dreamed up by somebody and built into a national fixation by a sensation seeking

1372
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:20,040
press.

1373
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,300
I can't get out of the car.

1374
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,180
It's not there.

1375
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,680
It's nothing in the sky.

1376
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,920
Dr. Travis, get a hold of the wheel.

1377
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:28,680
I can't.

1378
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:29,600
I can't.

1379
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:29,880
I can't.

1380
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:29,880


1381
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:29,880


1382
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:30,460
And where is my 써k?

1383
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:30,460


1384
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,920
Get out.

1385
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,400
This is Antron.

1386
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,380
This is Antron.

1387
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:50,760
Attention, humans.

1388
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:54,000
I am speaking to the medium of...

1389
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,160
I've been staring to you humans.

1390
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:03,400
We planted the seeds of life on this planet 10 billion years ago.

1391
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,560
Seize all atomic testing.

1392
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,220
Shut up, Pink Boy.

1393
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:15,140
Shut up, Pink Boy.

1394
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:15,920
Shut up, Pink Boy.

1395
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,580
Shut up, Pink Boy.

1396
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:17,640
Shut up, Pink Boy.

1397
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:18,020
Shut up.

1398
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:19,760
Shut up, Pink Boy.

1399
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,480
Shut up, Pink Boy.

1400
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:20,840
Kill me.
