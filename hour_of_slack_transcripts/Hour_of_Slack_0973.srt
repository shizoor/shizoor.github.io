1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:10,020
and now in theory if I push this one little button I won't have to do much for anything

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,800
else except listen for lonesome cowboy Dave who we hope will arrive here at some point

3
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,460
Bob has given us great insight and wisdom

4
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,460
so it is again with a heavy heart that I see

5
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,980
Bob rendering poems

6
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,900
public service to the people of this country for some period of time and it is a hope that

7
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:18,480
we are going to be able to help Bob fulfill one of his whims which is to sit down and write a book

8
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:29,000
he will not because that book is entitled Bob Matters and I am much richer for it

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,460
you

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,640
Mr. President I yield the floor

11
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,500
wait a minute what about Bob

12
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,780
well what about him

13
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,120
if we can capture him alive

14
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,680
what

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,120
why you're crazy

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,740
yeah

17
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,800
yeah

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,660
yeah

19
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,680
yeah

20
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,320
yeah

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,080
yeah

22
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,360
yeah

23
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,540
hey look out

24
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,460
Bob is coming

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,700
it's fake

26
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,940
stop it

27
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,540
what's the matter

28
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,280
do you dare sit here and watch Bob

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,840
and ask me what's the matter

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,500
Bob

31
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:56,900
Bob

32
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,320
Bob

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,040
Bob

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,420
Bob

35
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:58,700
Bob

36
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,060
Bob

37
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,480
Bob

38
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,700
Bob

39
00:01:59,700 --> 00:01:59,820
Bob

40
00:01:59,820 --> 00:01:59,880
Bob

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,520
Bob

42
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:00,520


43
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:00,840
Bob

44
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,780
Bob

45
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,840
Bob

46
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,060
Bob

47
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,820
well

48
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,220
it

49
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,260
it

50
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,300
OK

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,400
good

52
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,460
so

53
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,060
uh

54
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,560
Bob?

55
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,480
Bob?

56
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,900
Oh, my.

57
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,100
Bob?

58
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:46,840
Oh, my.

59
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,780
I'll tell him.

60
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,160
Bob?

61
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,000
Of course.

62
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,320
Oh, my.

63
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,280
Oh, my.

64
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,560
Oh, my.

65
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:56,560


66
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:56,560


67
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:56,560


68
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:56,560


69
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:56,560


70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:56,560


71
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:56,560


72
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,420
Oh, my.

73
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,820
Oh, my.

74
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,300
Oh, my.

75
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:00,400
Oh, my.

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,420
Oh, my.

77
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:00,620
Oh, my.

78
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:00,620


79
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:00,880


80
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:00,880


81
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,540
Oh, my.

82
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:12,360
God seems to be a recurring problem, and all he wants is for you to realize he's mad at you.

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,500
You're saying, oh, God.

84
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,980
Can't seem to get rid of God to date.

85
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,640
And God is going to give you red scaling patches in Jesus' name.

86
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,640
God has just come on your skin.

87
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,380
He seems to come seasonally, and that skin is going to leave you right now in Jesus' name.

88
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,680
Someone else, you have a problem with the gut right now.

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,820
It seems to be a recurring problem and a long-lasting problem for you.

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,140
You've had it for a long time.

91
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:45,360
And you're saying, oh, Lord, deliver pain on the right side underneath your eye.

92
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,660
God's piercing your left eye as well.

93
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,600
You'll not have it anymore.

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,280
God is able to deliver headaches.

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,240
It's for you.

96
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,120
And, Lord, we just ask again that you just leave right now.

97
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,960
Today, Lord God.

98
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,880
In Jesus' name.

99
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,360
Amen.

100
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,060
As Jefferson once commented,

101
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,360
Dear, I had a cheese sandwich and a cup of coffee sent in for lunch.

102
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,820
Oh, that's one of those grown-up jokes you wouldn't understand.

103
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,420
As Jefferson once commented,

104
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,520
You don't frighten us English pig dogs.

105
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:52,660
So now, little man, you've grown tired of grass, LSD, acid.

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,980
You've grown tired of cocaine and hash.

107
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:02,700
And someone pretending to be a true friend said,

108
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll introduce you to

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,420
The Self-Genius Powerhouse Watch.

110
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,260
From PR News in Washington, I'm safe and accounted for.

111
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,980
Following an attack by Vice President Dick Cheney,

112
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,880
and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in a parking lot,

113
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Cheney would be the most senior U.S. official to attack PR News.

114
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,220
Saudi security forces say gunfire and explosions have been put in place.

115
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,520
And U.S. police are being used to search for American culture in Washington.

116
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,700
When you've had a bath, a ring belongs around the tub.

117
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:52,200
I stand silently looking through the windows of my mind at the world outside.

118
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,860
Wanting to belong, yet knowing it can never be.

119
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,960
I am different from those around me.

120
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,800
They have their own small worlds, complete cells,

121
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,660
interlocking one with the other, where they live and die

122
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,240
with nothing ever disturbing the wheel of life they circle around.

123
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,100
I fly among the stars.

124
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:22,960
My world encompasses eternity and reaches back to grasp the dawn of time.

125
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,660
Who needs the world?

126
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:31,840
I have the subgenius power of SWAT.

127
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,560
Now here's something to think about.

128
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,280
Your mouth won't be happy Tuesday.

129
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,300
In obtaining this record,

130
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,960
you have taken the first step to the future.

131
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,740
The first step towards self-improvement,

132
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,640
toward attaining those goals that are important to you.

133
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,840
Not that this or any other record contains any magical powers,

134
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,680
or that any spoken words have the power to transform you in any way.

135
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,140
The power is within you, within your mind.

136
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,620
And more specifically, within that part of your mind of which you most likely are unaware.

137
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,660
The subgenius power of SWAT.

138
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:28,540
From ER News in Washington, I'm saying it would yield nothing.

139
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,280
Ukraine's Supreme Court collided with a parking lot on a dairy farm

140
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,260
after firefighters struggled to remove opposition candidate Victor Veneman.

141
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,600
The National Hockey League must go forward since early September.

142
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,280
President Bush reports.

143
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,960
President Bush told reporters on the ground that it's time for the Iraqi troops of soldiers...

144
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,500
A society of tyranny and torture and mass graves

145
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,160
to be raised at the ballot.

146
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,420
President Bush also confirmed the White House.

147
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,420
PR News, Washington.

148
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,280
Uh, yes, dear friends.

149
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,960
Well, this is the first time I've been on the air in a while.

150
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,120
And you're listening to some wonderful collages

151
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,640
from the artistes of alt.binaries.slack.

152
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,140
Which probably about 60% Fernanda Nde-Limer

153
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:36,020
and about 30% Artemia Salina.

154
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,220
And there's a little bit of Mr. Sister thrown in.

155
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,080
Throwing himself into the mix.

156
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,420
And very little of yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

157
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,420
Although we are actually here in the studio waiting for lonesome,

158
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,080
lonesome Cowboy Dave.

159
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,560
Who I should mention.

160
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:04,480
Just try that downstairs special door.

161
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,640
Dave, forget the upstairs.

162
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,180
Special.

163
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,380
Oh, yeah!

164
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,920
Well, look who's here.

165
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,400
It's the subgenius.

166
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,840
Our own.

167
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,380
Old School

168
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,840
One, two, three.

169
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,240
The devil's after me.

170
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,320
Four, five, six.

171
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,360
He's always throwing sticks.

172
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,520
Seven, eight, nine.

173
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,820
He misses every time.

174
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,820
How do you like that?

175
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:45,820


176
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:45,820


177
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:45,820


178
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:45,820


179
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:45,820


180
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:45,820


181
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,280
Hallelujah, hallelujah, amen.

182
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,120
Nine, eight, seven.

183
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,280
I'm on my way to heaven.

184
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,300
Six, five, four.

185
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,640
I'm almost to the door.

186
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,700
Three, two, one.

187
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,940
The victory now is won.

188
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,460
Hallelujah, hallelujah, amen.

189
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,980
The End

190
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,320
The End

191
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,660
The End

192
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:52,140
Because in the end, the people want another dictator, a strong-arm leader, who's going to have the secret police.

193
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,660
You know, why wouldn't they?

194
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,300
The new leaders of NATO walk in the room.

195
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,040
The greasy pole and all the rest of it.

196
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,660
I'm all for conferences, just as long as the conferences produce a nuclear weapon.

197
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,940
Mr. President, first, the Prime Minister is your poodle.

198
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,540
I was wondering if that's the way you may see your relationship.

199
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,300
Let's see here.

200
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:21,660
Yeah.

201
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,740
Yeah, I mean, that's absolutely right.

202
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,420
Right.

203
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,540
Absolutely.

204
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,120
Good job.

205
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:27,920
Thanks.

206
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:40,920
The minute you walked in the joint, I could see you were a man of distinction, a real big spender.

207
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,700
God seems to be a...

208
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:50,040
a recurring problem, and all he wants is for you to realize he's mad at you.

209
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,880
He wants to deliver migraine headaches and red scaling patches.

210
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,060
And Lord, we just ask again that you just leave right now.

211
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,820
Today, Lord God.

212
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,780
In Jesus' name.

213
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,640
Hallelujah.

214
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,720
Hey, shut up.

215
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,740
Hallelujah.

216
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,100
Hey, shut up.

217
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,740
Oh, shut up.

218
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,020
Just shut up.

219
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,320
Oh, my God.

220
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,000
Oh, my God.

221
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,560
Oh, my God.

222
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:18,560


223
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:18,560


224
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:18,560


225
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,020
Is she dead?

226
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,040
Oh, my God.

227
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,780
Oh, my God.

228
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,680
Oh, my God.

229
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:23,720
Oh, my God.

230
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:23,720


231
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:23,720


232
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:23,720


233
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,080
Yes, sir.

234
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,400
Just shut up.

235
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,460
Mr. President, Congress can't afford to be threatened.

236
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,400
The United States, in its formative years, never chose the free access of information

237
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,820
of their citizenry.

238
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,880
The founding fathers of this great nation of ours knew the value of repressive measures,

239
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,440
such as the censorship of published material.

240
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:43,680
Oh, my God.

241
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,160
to protect the government from their citizens.

242
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,380
As Jefferson once commented,

243
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,320
when the people know only what the government wants them to know,

244
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,420
all is safe.

245
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,020
Let me be clear if I can here.

246
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,640
The legislation that I've submitted today for inclusion in the record

247
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,820
isn't about protecting freedom of press.

248
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,320
Instead, Mr. President, this legislation is used as a tool for propaganda,

249
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,860
whereby nothing could get published without the government's consent.

250
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,420
From PR News, I'm in an animal in Little Rock, Arkansas.

251
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,540
American farmers still face another animal in Ames, Iowa.

252
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,320
A Senate panel dragged it from the market.

253
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,100
A USDA spokeswoman did not enter the nation's food supply last year.

254
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,080
The Agriculture Department has stepped up federal disease this summer.

255
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,500
Scientists in an unidentified American herd may be infected.

256
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,640
For PR News, I'm being tested in four to seven days.

257
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,280
This is PR News.

258
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,120
The Labor Department reports President Clinton made claims for unemployment

259
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,660
in the United States.

260
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,220
Even when the U.S. hunt for other former presidents who escaped will continue.

261
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,180
I'm washing diseased animals in Washington.

262
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:03,040
One, two, three, four, five.

263
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:13,080
One, two, three, four, five.

264
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,420
One, two, three, four ,five.

265
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,700
Two, three, four, five.

266
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,500
One, two, three, four, five.

267
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,100
One, two, three, four, five.

268
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,240
One, two, three, four, five.

269
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,860
One, two, three, four, five.

270
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,440
One, two, three, four, five.

271
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,700
One, two, three, four, five.

272
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:32,880
One, two, three, four, five.

273
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,940
From PR News in Washington, I'm preparing large amounts of uranium

274
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,640
and sending cement to insurgents in Washington.

275
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,040
In this PR Business Update Alan Greenspan,

276
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,220
We can further as a banking group pleaded guilty today to dumping several bodies on his bloated uterus

277
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:55,440
and sending the Federal Reserve Chairman to their loved ones instead of Jordanian militant Aboumous Greenspan.

278
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,540
Greenspan said to avoid PR news by purchasing assets without abroad.

279
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:06,520
For PR news, I'm expected to receive 787 discarded bodies, which would have cost $2 million.

280
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,280
That process could be used to make nuclear bodies on his property.

281
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,700
U.S. troops have come across a large sign saying PR news, Baghdad.

282
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:29,760
From far beyond the galaxies, I've journeyed to this place to study the behavior patterns of the human race.

283
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,400
And I find them highly illogical.

284
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,680
Girl meets boy.

285
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,200
They fall in love.

286
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,080
She says he's everything she's dreamed of.

287
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:51,780
But when they get married, before he's aware, she changes his habits, the way he combs his hair.

288
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:58,380
She changes him to someone he's never been and then complains he's not like other men.

289
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,100
Now really, I find this most illogical.

290
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Take the case of your automobiles.

291
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,120
Greatest invention.

292
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,260
Since 19...

293
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,060
Man discovered wheels.

294
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,360
High dramatic overdrive.

295
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,300
Floor on the floor.

296
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,020
Push-button windows.

297
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,700
Push-button doors.

298
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,240
Double-barrel carburetors rush you anyplace.

299
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,400
But you never can find a parking space.

300
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,000
Highly illogical.

301
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,060
Take the case of modern man.

302
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,320
He works all his life.

303
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,820
Gives it all he can.

304
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,680
Saves all his money.

305
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,940
Works overtime.

306
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,000
Pinches every penny.

307
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,560
Banks every dime.

308
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,300
All he can think about is money.

309
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,200
But you know that he can't take it with him where he's going to go.

310
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,980
Now I find that fascinatingly illogical.

311
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,460
Now is the time to journey home.

312
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,280
To tell of what I've learned.

313
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,200
My people, I believe, have every right to be concerned.

314
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,740
For in spite of computers and advanced psychology,

315
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,060
behavior patterns are still a mystery.

316
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,260
I believe.

317
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,840
I predict the future of this earthly human race.

318
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,120
Is that having made a mess of Earth, they'll move to outer space.

319
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,240
Well, there goes the neighborhood.

320
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,780
Totally.

321
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,120
Completely.

322
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,500
Absolutely.

323
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,560
Irrevocably.

324
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,700
Highly illogical.

325
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:39,880
From PR News in Washington, I'm producing a guest that could be sent to the president from Washington.

326
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,240
Presented by the President of the United States.

327
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,460
President Bush ambushed a Polish woman today with small arms and rocket-propelled policemen.

328
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,520
Officials appealed unsuccessfully for popcorn.

329
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,920
Police say they've identified most of the prosecutors by watching videotapes.

330
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,160
Elsewhere in the capital, an Iraqi police station appeared in Warsaw today.

331
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,260
Police in suburban Detroit said it was the ugliest thing recommended by the September 11th Commission.

332
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,460
Perky photos are on our website, PR.org.

333
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,940
Hey, Forky.

334
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,300
What?

335
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,960
Fork job.

336
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,600
Pork chop.

337
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,440
Pork chop, Forky.

338
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,160
Pork chop.

339
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,440
Forky.

340
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,240
Pork chop.

341
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,880
Pork chop.

342
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,140
Oh.

343
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,060
Come on back and eat your pork chop.

344
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,800
No, no, I don't think so.

345
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,880
Oh, pork chop.

346
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,780
I'll have a ebb-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e blue

347
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,180
Christmas

348
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,080
Without you

349
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,640
Oh, if you feel so ebb-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e blue

350
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,640
Ain't he just thinking?

351
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,160
... Murray?

352
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,220
Billy?.

353
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,440
Well, you're an idiot.

354
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,620
Good night, sir, thanks for watching.

355
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,660
Very bow-well, everyone.

356
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:52,660


357
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:52,660


358
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:59,080
Oh, cen생 came last year and all the holidays must beake the same air that we all happy

359
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,080


360
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,720
It's okay.

361
00:19:59,720 --> 00:19:59,760
Bye-bye.

362
00:19:59,760 --> 00:19:59,760


363
00:19:59,760 --> 00:19:59,760


364
00:19:59,760 --> 00:19:59,760


365
00:19:59,760 --> 00:19:59,760


366
00:19:59,760 --> 00:19:59,780
Oh, away you.

367
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:08,120
With switch guys.

368
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,120
Start falling

369
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,800
That's when those

370
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,480
Blue memories

371
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,680
Start calling

372
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,780
You'll be doing

373
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,600
All right

374
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,260
With your Christmas

375
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,200
With your white

376
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,800
But I'll

377
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,000
Have a blue

378
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,440
Have a blue blue blue Christmas

379
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,220
I'll be

380
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,220
I'll miss you

381
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,040
You'll be

382
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,780
Doing all right

383
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,780
With your

384
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,260
Christmas

385
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,420
With your

386
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,360
With your white

387
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,300
But I'll

388
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,220
Have a blue

389
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,720
Have a blue blue blue Christmas

390
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,640
Oh yes

391
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,060
Dear friends

392
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,360
We guessed that that was Mel Blanc

393
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,780
But we've drawn a blank

394
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,780
Otherwise we just don't know

395
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,480
All of this came down the pike

396
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,400
From

397
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,000
The

398
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,000


399
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,400
The

400
00:21:37,420 --> 00:22:07,420


401
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:37,420


402
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:37,660
the

403
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,440
The island

404
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:39,560
Flores

405
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,220
And the island

406
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,020
The island of flowers

407
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,400
Off of

408
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,420
Well whatever

409
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,840
It's certainly

410
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,980
Some place we'll invade soon no doubt

411
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,540
Get more of those cool skeletons

412
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,520
Yep that's what we're looking for

413
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,120
Cool skeletons

414
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
Cool skeletons

415
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,180
Groovy skeletons

416
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,520
With the brains still intact

417
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,980
With the brains like a tiny shriveled mushroom

418
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,140
Awaiting for the coming of Zyra

419
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,240
And the world beyond

420
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,540
DUM

421
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,140
I..

422
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,680
I wasn't ready yet

423
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:11,720
I'm a gay

424
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,200
I'm a gay

425
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,100
Don and Grand ma entregas

426
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:16,680
Jenwood

427
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,140
And you sleep

428
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,000
Youness

429
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,320
And as sheís done

430
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,380
And as we did

431
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:18,420
It all

432
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,640
Now we

433
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,460
Season one

434
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:22,780
And you and me

435
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,620
We all

436
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,440
Gotta hope

437
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,100
You get

438
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,800
A new

439
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:32,740


440
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:35,860
disfr處

441
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:35,860


442
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,000
Your Front

443
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,220
House

444
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,520
So many new people coming in now, and they just don't know the ropes.

445
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,900
First of all, you have to pay for your food, okay?

446
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,100
I know a lot of people didn't know that.

447
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:52,480
Second of all, you have to pay for your armaments and your toes and your little slappers and your dingers.

448
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,020
And I don't know, just a lot of things you've got to be aware of.

449
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,300
But anyway.

450
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,160
Bulletproof jackets, too, eh?

451
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,420
Yeah, of course.

452
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,820
And we've got them on sale here in the back.

453
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:06,320
So if you want to just come on around after we do a few numbers here, we're going to smoke one right now.

454
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:06,700
Okay.

455
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:16,880
Everybody knows that Santa's going to blow right up in some new guy's face.

456
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,160
Holiday outages, they ain't a pretty sight to see.

457
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,820
But I'm almost out of this place.

458
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,700
And it's Christmas in Bad Dan.

459
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,460
What a festive place.

460
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,660
What a festive place to be this Christmas in Bad Dan.

461
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,920
We'll put that in a body bag under the Christmas tree.

462
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,780
And it's Christmas in Bad Dan.

463
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,720
Magic fills the air this Christmas in Bad Dan.

464
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:55,720
Is the magic in the air or the burning in my hair in Bad Dan?

465
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,360
What a festive place to be.

466
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,440
What a festive place to be.

467
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,440


468
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,440


469
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,860
It's Christmas in Bad Dan.

470
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,140
We'll put that in a body bag under the Christmas tree.

471
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,080
And it's Christmas in Bad Dan.

472
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,460
Magic fills up the air.

473
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,260
Christmas in Bad Dan.

474
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,340
Is it the magic in the air or the napalm in my hair?

475
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,480
Everybody knows that Santa's going to blow right up in some new guy's face.

476
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,160
That's all right with me.

477
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:39,980
those Santa IDs cause I'm almost out of this place. And it's Christmas in Baghdad. What a

478
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:48,960
festive place to be this Christmas in Baghdad. We'll put dad in a party bag under the Christmas

479
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:59,540
tree and it's Christmas in Baghdad. Magic lights up the air this Christmas in Baghdad.

480
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:06,200
Is it the magic in the air or the napalm in my hair? Okay, just remember that because you're

481
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,840
gonna have to remember that. God. You have to remember that. Well, after the foreshortening

482
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,200
and the removal of the brain pan, you're not gonna remember much at all. Actually, yes,

483
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,360
you're right. I'm sure you are right. And after we fill the brain pan with the bedpan,

484
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:24,880
you're not only gonna feel everything, you're gonna pee it. And you're gonna be it. Cause

485
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,000
it's time to pee it and be it. Yes.

486
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:49,560
Christmas in Baghdad. What a festive place to be this Christmas in Baghdad. We'll put dad in a party bag under the Christmas tree and it's Christmas in Baghdad.

487
00:26:51,400 --> 00:27:00,140
Lights up the air this Christmas in Baghdad. Is it the magic in the air or the napalm in my hair?

488
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:06,820
I'm burning my hair. We just won't know until we find out. Are you going to Germany soon? Oh,

489
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:11,600
no, it's actually much too soon to go right back. Actually, not if you're an amputator.

490
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:17,660
You know, many young amputators have to go right back. It was funny. Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

491
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:24,300
while we were in Germany, we got to experience the compassionate Germans saying things like,

492
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,620
feel very worried about this fascism rising in America. Are you building

493
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,340
camps yet? We have some experience with this. We could show you.

494
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:41,520
Well, you know that the funny irony of that never seemed to occur. These were 20-year-olds we were

495
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,040
talking to. Youthful people who were, their idealism was shook up a bit.

496
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:52,120
Too young now to remember how things were. But yet at the same time, they're so foolish in their

497
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:59,320
discontent for what others do. No, no, no, no, wait, let me take that back. I think we should all be pretty discontented

498
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:08,340
with what our others do. The others are significant ulteriors. They are the reason why we must wear

499
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:21,640
these masks. But our day will come when we will rise up. Maybe we won't rise up. Maybe we'll just

500
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,920
sort of make some phone calls and get on the internet or something. Maybe we'll have another

501
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,560
snack.

502
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:35,540
This knob and we'll, and this knob genius must have snacks.

503
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,080
No, genius must have snacks.

504
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:45,700
From the toxic waste and the spent plutonium, Santa drove his elves and

505
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:53,820
tiny reindeers on forward through the dripping snow. The wind was ripping through his flatulence

506
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,160
and his shirt was red with blood. He cared not. His hands stayed

507
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,080
steady on the reins,

508
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,240
because he knew peace was coming to the earth.

509
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,000
Yes, peace would come to the earth.

00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:36,020
Bringing lots of toys and presents, bringing us some peace.

515
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:42,740
Teaming up with his friend Jesus to start a mighty band.

516
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,480
Playing in Nazareth and Jerusalem with his mighty...

517
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,600
Santa's coming.

518
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,200
Santa's coming.

519
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,140
Coming, coming, coming.

520
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:03,720
Bringing peace and presents to the merry...

521
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,060
Peace and presents.

522
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,060
That's a spooky Christmas song. Santa told me that one.

523
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,760
I like the peace and presents part.

524
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,800
He taught me. Santa taught me the song himself.

525
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,620
We saw some strange Santas overseas.

526
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,840
They have long, like, shovel beards.

527
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,680
They're like bishops.

528
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,960
Well, in the Holland Headland.

529
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,180
Like pups.

530
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,380
In the Neanderthal lands.

531
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,160
He's still a Saint, Nicholas.

532
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,140
And he looks like... He wears a Pope hat.

533
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:40,620
And he has a little cartoon black man mascot named Black Peter.

534
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,960
Black Peter.

535
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:49,220
When you travel around Amsterdam and other cities in Holland Headland,

536
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,580
you see all these Santas or Sintas.

537
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,300
With Black Peter.

538
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:57,080
And Black Peters. Yes, a lot of big fat Santas with little Black Peters.

539
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,400
Well, the reason...

540
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:58,400


541
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,060
Yes, do you know of little Black Peter?

542
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,460
I know why Santa has a little Black Peter.

543
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,120
It's because he drinks too much.

544
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,060
Far, far too much.

545
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,080
We were told that...

546
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,860
That...

547
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,100
It was liver disease.

548
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,800
The Dutch Santa, rather than working from the North Pole using elves,

549
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,560
has little slaves in Spain who work in mines.

550
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:27,060
And make... Either they make toys or they mine the gold and Santa buys the toys.

551
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,060
I don't know how it works.

552
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:33,100
But Black Peter is this little Dutch black fellow who has...

553
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,060
Or Dutch dressing, anyway.

554
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,460
Who is the leader of the slaves.

555
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:42,660
He's the head slave or the foreman of the elf slaves in Spain.

556
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:47,760
In Spanish mines that Santa Claus uses to make toys for the good children.

557
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,800
For the Dutch children.

558
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,200
Because the Spanish children get nothing.

559
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,100
They are slaves.

560
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,100
No doubt.

561
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:59,740
Do you remember 400 years ago we were enemies and so they're still going to go to Spain to steal the presents.

562
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,200
No, that is not true. Not true.

563
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,260
Spanish children are very, very well fancied and get many, many presents at Christmas.

564
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,140
They make good presents too sometimes.

565
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,620
The ones in the mines make the presents and the ones in the big house on the hill get the presents.

566
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:20,620
Just like it's always been and probably always will be if the man has his way.

567
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,400
Well, sometimes the...

568
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,080
And the man and his big black...

569
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,320
The black Peter are going to make sure they have their way with all of us, I'm sure.

570
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,400
Did you know that in Italia a witch delivers the presents?

571
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:31,920
Really?

572
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,960
La strega.

573
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,420
No.

574
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,820
Benfana, si.

575
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,420
An old, old lady, an old crone delivers the presents.

576
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,520
Well, what does Santa Claus do?

577
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,240
There is no Santa Claus.

578
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:41,500
But...

579
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,680
He's just another saint.

580
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,380
Just like Anthony or, you know, Francis...

581
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:53,540
Well, I know he was based on Saint Nicholas who was a backdoor man in Asia Minor.

582
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,080
But...

583
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,700
He was a backdoor man back in the day.

584
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,620
Well, you mean backdoor man in that he entered from the rear flap or do you...

585
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:07,760
Yeah, to deposit his big red sack, his load of gifts for the lonesome widder gals and so forth.

586
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,160
That's where he shook his black Peter.

587
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,060
Yeah.

588
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:15,180
You guys can contort the most rosy, beautiful story, can't you?

589
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,260
Yes, it is a rosy story too.

590
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,500
Well, it was because of that scary Santa song he was doing, man.

591
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,180
That was creepy.

592
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,640
He is coming to the...

593
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,120
And has ironed, and has ironed toward the Middle East.

594
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,920
Teaming up with his friend Jesus, bringing presence and peace.

595
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,600
That's really gonna happen too.

596
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,200
I pray every night and day not to Dobbs, either, for crying out loud.

597
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:41,900
Well, yeah.

598
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:48,640
Well, you don't really want Dobbs or his friends noticing your prayers, because then they'll

599
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,360
know just...

600
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,180
You'll be cursed.

601
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:50,280
You'll be cursed.

602
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,820
If you pray to Dobbs, I've done it before, and every prayer that you offer up to Bob

603
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:00,380
Dobbs becomes a curse upon your mortal soul and your immortal shoes.

604
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,680
And that's the truth.

605
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,320
Yeah.

606
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,200
Oh, listen to this, Dave.

607
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,380
You'll like this song.

608
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,220
Let us begin.

609
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,600
Let us begin.

610
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:17,760
Let's begin.

611
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:18,900
Let's begin.

612
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,760
A new beginning.

613
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,940
Let us begin a new, begin a new...

614
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,640
Remembering.

615
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,600
Remembering, remembering...

616
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,080
Lemme hear you.

617
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,480
...는데.

618
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,520
...nice.

Instead of belaboring those problems

Divide us

624

Let both sides for the first time

For the first time

626
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,500
Formulate proposals for the infection and control of hearts

00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,720
Let us begin

00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,000
Stability is not a sign of weakness

637
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,400
Stability

638
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,840
Is not a sign of weakness

639
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,760
Sincerity is always subject to proof

640
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,860
Sincerity is always subject to proof

641
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,000
Subject to proof

00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,620
Let both sides

643
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,160

Explore what problems unite us

645
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,640
Unite us

00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,340
Instead of belaboring those problems which divide us

647
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:09,740
Problems that divide us

648
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,860
And let both sides

649
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,740

Formulate proposals for the infection and control of hearts

651
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,220
That's a pretty strange tune there.

652
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,780
Now I thought that guy was dead too.

653
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,860
Now is that, what's his name, the impersonator, the impressionist, Von Meter?

654
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,380
Or was that the real president of the United States 40 years ago?

655
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,920
I don't know.

656
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,560
I cannot.

657
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,540
Elvis Kennedy.

658
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,280
In all sincerity, not answer that question.

659
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,200
Do you remember when...

660
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,020
I know nothing.

661
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,140
I don't want to get into it.

662
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,060
I know nothing.

663
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,820
Yeah, you're not...

664
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,680
You're not allowed to know anything.

665
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,000
Do you know why, Sting?

666
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,980
I think I do.

667
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,940
Do you really understand why you're not allowed to know anything?

668
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,640
I try not to think about it or not do it.

669
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,620
You are disrupting the cast.

670
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,420
That's why.

671
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,740
What do you have to say?

672
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,000
I don't want to mess the hive up, man.

673
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,480
I don't want to be different.

674
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,000
I want to fit in.

675
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,260
You are different.

676
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:08,880
No!

677
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:13,040
Your tail feathers reek of cheese and bad onion dip.

678
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,480
No, no, they're real.

679
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,780
They're real chintail feathers.

680
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,860
Yes, of course, they're real.

681
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,940
I'm a real rooster.

682
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,860
You dress yourself up that way so you look like the cock of the walk,

683
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,160
but everyone knows that you're as lonesome as pudding.

684
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,100
Look at those...

685
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,200
Oh, my God, the lacerations on your head.

686
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,080
Why?

687
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,940
I thought Bob would like it.

688
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,860
He does.

689
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,600
Bob wanted me to have those cuts and scars and scabs.

690
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,580
He does.

691
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,000
He does.

692
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,540
Doesn't he want us to...

693
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:43,940
To...

694
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,360
To...

695
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:44,400
To...

696
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,180
To suffer for him?

697
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,660
Yes.

698
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,880
That way he gets slack, man.

699
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,780
But you haven't suffered enough.

700
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,020
The cuts must be deeper.

701
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,360
Like Zimbo's here.

702
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:55,720
Oh, good.

703
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,560
And like Wee's.

704
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,580
Look at Wee's cuts.

705
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,300
Yeah, she's got deep ones.

706
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:00,600
It feels good.

707
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,700
I like her slits in her...

708
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,840
It feels really good.

709
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,220
It does.

710
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,040
They're deep and tight.

711
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,280
And here's the salt.

712
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,260
Here's Thang take the salt.

713
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,580
If I have cuts like that, will Bob stick it in my head, too?

714
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,460
Oh, little boy.

715
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,520
Black Piotr will come and stick it in the rear flap where it belongs.

716
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,260
Don't worry.

717
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,100
In my exit wound?

718
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,440
Yes, in your exit wound.

719
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,640
And Bob and his Peter will get in my exit wound?

720
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,120
Yes, yes.

721
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,620
And everything will...

722
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:28,440
If I'm a good boy or a bad boy for Christmas and Existlessnessmas?

723
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,920
Yes, yes.

724
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,020
Everything will be just fine and rosy.

725
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,600
Oh, Wee.

726
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:40,660
I've noticed you haven't prepared yourself for the nuptial surprise.

727
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,700
Sorry.

728
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,000
Sorry.

729
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,780
That's all right.

730
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,240
You sit down there and put your hands on the manacles.

731
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,900
I expect you to do it yourself.

732
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,840
Is she going to use the duck on me?

733
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,260
No, she's going to use nothing on you.

734
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,000
We're going to use the radioactive Zycron stope on her neck.

735
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,220
I'm not going to use Zycron stope.

736
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,000
Maybe it'll be something a little bit more meaty than a little punch dort.

737
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,980
Yeah, we're just going to use this taser here for...

738
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,280
And, uh, friends,

739
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,640
this is what you can expect more of here on the Hour of Slug.

740
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,060
No, you cannot.

741
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,380
Because as long as Jesus wounds are bleeding,

742
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:29,920
a new man awaits in the puddle below to drink and become better than he was.

743
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,920
I have a good...

744
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,700
Actually, I should have a good Jesus cut up here.

745
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,000
Let's try this Jesus cut.

746
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,860
I guess you're capable, all right, but somehow or another,

747
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,460
it just don't come as natural to us as it does to you.

748
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,500
The human male never seems to progress.

749
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,740
Past adolescence.

750
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,720
Retailers have been fighting for years to keep Christ in Belmont, California.

751
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,320
As a Christian, I believe Jesus prostituted the baby in the manger.

752
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,160
Fine, but making a buck.

753
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,540
Well, I'm out to change Christ from an adult.

754
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,620
Like, oh, say, keep the jingle Jesus doodads should trivialize entirely.

755
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,800
And this is a person on frump.

756
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:31,060
This background music here, this is a person, an example of someone,

757
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:36,700
a frump user singing a Jesus religious song.

758
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,580
Oh, sorry about that.

759
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,560
No consonants involved.

760
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,520
He is 43 years old.

761
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,320
Is that correct?

762
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,540
Yes.

763
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:51,580
This was formerly a rocket scientist, a subgenius who used frump for the first time.

764
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,360
Are those scars, the lobotomy scars on his...

765
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:54,720
No.

766
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,920
No, those are trepidation?

767
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,720
He came with those.

768
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,360
Okay.

769
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,820
The frump is all it took.

770
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,620
One hit.

771
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,620
One hit.

772
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,240
One hit.

773
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:05,120
He was a baritone rocket scientist, and now listen to it.

774
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,300
I noticed most of all the distension of the pubis dragging on the floor.

775
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,860
Yeah, it does turn you into a horn dog.

776
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,400
Oh.

777
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,540
Makes you really, it hangs you like a horse, you might say.

778
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,360
Oh, this song.

779
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,180
Check this out.

780
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,340
I'm like a horse flying.

781
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,380
Wind and cold of the Himalayan snows.

782
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,760
There's a creature there I can't forget no matter where I go.

783
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:32,520
I was a mountain climber many years ago, and there wasn't a place I wouldn't go.

784
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:38,760
But when I saw that strange creature in the snow, it made my blood run cold.

785
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:41,860
Abominable.

786
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,680
Abominable.

787
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,360
Abominable.

788
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,620
Snow creature.

789
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,160
Hiding in the snow.

790
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,040
Abominable.

791
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,920
Snow creature.

792
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,180
Snow creature.

793
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,200
You'll haunt me wherever I go.

794
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,600
Ha ha.

795
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,620
This is a great song.

796
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,480
It stood upright like a giant man, and it had a long white mane.

797
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,620
It had red eyes.

798
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,480
It had pointed ears.

799
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,060
And great long sharp fangs.

800
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,380
I was heading up towards the mountain peak when I saw it coming my way.

801
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,140
I grabbed a rope, and I started to go.

802
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,960
Then I felt that mountain sway.

803
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:32,360
He hit me hard with a fist of steel, and I went a-rolling in the snow.

804
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,800
And I didn't stop till I hit a rock a thousand feet below.

805
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,060
Oh.

806
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,500
Abominable.

807
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:43,900
Abominable.

808
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,240
Snow creature.

809
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,460
I'm hiding in the snow.

810
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,540
Abominable.

811
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,380
Snow creature.

812
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,660
You'll haunt me wherever I go.

813
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:09,780
Now I'll never climb another mountain, and I'm gonna watch where I go.

814
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,680
Cause I'll never know when I'm gonna meet you.

815
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:12,680


816
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,940
Meet that strange creature of the snow.

817
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,640
Away up high on a windy ridge where a mountain goat wouldn't go.

818
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,380
I saw that strange creature in the snow.

819
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,000
That strange creature in the snow.

820
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:31,880
Abominable.

821
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,000
Abominable.

822
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,460
Snow creature.

823
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:35,860
Snow creature.

824
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,720
High in the snow.

825
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,300
In the snow.

826
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:42,920
Abominable.

827
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,160
Abominable.

828
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,700
Snow creature.

829
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:46,960
Snow creature.

830
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,080
Help me wherever I go.

831
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,620
Ah, the Yeti walks.

832
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,980
The Yeti walks, dear friend.

833
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,020
Are you a child of the Yeti?

834
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,260
That was Marlon Wallace, by the way.

835
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:07,480
Sounded like Marlon Perkins before he took his last breath from being raped by one of those abominable snow creatures.

836
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,700
One of the least understood and misunderstood.

837
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:24,180
And poorly told stories of the late 1970s was the death by defecation of, or not defecation, by fornication, excuse me, of Marlon Perkins, who was, well, back when I was a little child, he was the zoo man.

838
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,880
He loved critters of the wild.

839
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:32,100
And one day he brought back to the Chicago Zoo a wonderful, wonderful female snow Yeti.

840
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,240
And they fell in love.

841
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,900
It wasn't very long before they fell in love.

842
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,600
They decided to get married and do whatever it is they could.

843
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,000
And they did what they could do to have a family.

844
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:47,180
And as you know, they were fairly well unequipped to go the one way.

845
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,480
So they had to take the runway the other way.

846
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:54,680
And that meant that Marlon was that snow bitch's bitch.

847
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,480
Things didn't last too long.

848
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,040
They called for some attendance.

849
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:05,060
They said they were going to keep the doors locked just for privacy's sake.

850
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,900
But it ended up being a horrible carnage.

851
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,280
And we're selling some of that.

852
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,400
Horrible carnage here today.

853
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,140
Wow.

854
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,180
Praise Bob.

855
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,640
Praise Marlon Perkins.

856
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Praise Bob.

857
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,000


858
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,640
Praise Marlon.

859
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,160
Praise Refai Shankar who did this.

860
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,380
There's not enough praise to go around.

861
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,740
Organ music with his mighty organ in the background.

862
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,280
Yeah, France.

863
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,280
Do you like people?

864
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,040
No, I don't.

865
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:34,600
No, I don't.

866
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,820
You like all kinds of people.

867
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,480
No, I don't.

868
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,120
No, I don't.

869
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:38,540
That's wonderful.

870
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,580
Do you like adultic animals?

871
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:40,580


872
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:40,580


873
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:40,580


874
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:40,580


875
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:40,580


876
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:40,580


877
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:40,580


878
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:40,580


879
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:40,580


880
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:47,940
You like twisty things?

881
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:47,940


882
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:47,940


883
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:47,940


884
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,760
I'm still seem too male free.

885
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,060
I know, man.

886
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:52,100


887
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,400
You were blessed enough to come back to me like that when I came over there to the

888
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:55,820
hospital.

889
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:55,820


890
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,440
on TV.

891
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,380
Chenamania.

892
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:03,380


893
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,280
Yes, if she made a mistake, confzes, magnificent, but, again, we're not the ,

894
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:05,280


895
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:05,280


896
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,920
A Kyle Chasler nod cannot put a man in a position, like after dis Catch Grumpy's

897
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:07,800
first playthrough with a post-set Canadian��고 Wal利 Ele mittlerweile

898
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:07,880
and pessimism twelve.

899
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,480
Bloody hell.

900
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,780
Yes, doctor. Here it is.

901
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,940
From ER News in Washington.

902
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,320
Wow, Noral Pref did that.

903
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,400
That was lovely.

904
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,020
Absolutely marvelous.

905
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,800
We don't want to abrogate our responsibilities as criers in the night, though.

906
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,360
We have to be the ones who point the snake out when we see it under the rock.

907
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,060
Isn't it true?

908
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,960
Let us not abrogate.

909
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,180
Let us not abrogate.

910
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,840
We shall abrogate not.

911
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:37,060
We don't want to assume because we don't want to,

912
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,320
but we want to take on these responsibilities.

913
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:43,320
I've been artificially neutralized.

914
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,720
I've taken the big vow of silence.

915
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,040
I'm never going to say another stinking word again,

916
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,300
but I am going to make some noise.

917
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,840
I don't know if it's going to be intelligible.

918
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,120
I'm sure your noises will not be.

919
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:59,240
You have to shout, to quote the great Jeroen van Bram,

920
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,700
you have to shout and make a lot of noise or whatever,

921
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:06,060
because when you die, you shut up like hell.

922
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,460
And that is why when you go to a hamburger

923
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,640
and you finally find that perfect hamburger,

924
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,280
you don't just eat it, you eat the hell out of it.

925
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,440
The very hell out of that burger, my friend.

926
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,440
Then you walk up and down the Reaper-ban.

927
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,180
Yeah, you walk up and down the Reaper-ban.

928
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,260
We did actually walk up and down the Reaper-ban.

929
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:33,960
In fact, I went to the whorehouse, the Walmart of hookers.

930
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:34,600
Ah, the Walmart.

931
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,100
Along the Reaper-ban.

932
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,040
And there was a...

933
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,380
Was that the place where I was not allowed to go?

934
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,380
Yes, Princess V was not allowed to go unless she was selling herself.

935
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,280
She was not...

936
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,620
I thought that was kind of sexist, actually.

937
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,420
Oh, yeah, yeah, that is sexist, but that's the way we had it.

938
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,960
Yeah, what about three ways?

939
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,460
Three ways?

940
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,540
You can only have it one way on the Reaper-ban.

941
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,300
On the Reaper-ban.

942
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,200
I'm sorry to sound like the guy who sings,

943
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,640
I just go nuts at Christmas on the daily holiday.

944
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,580
Anyway, so you had big sexy fun on the Reaper-ban in Hamburg.

945
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,360
You went back, you went to Brighton Beach. What was that like?

946
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:20,580
Actually, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, it turns out that for years now, for decades, there has been a subspecies of subgeni living in Brighton,

947
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:24,980
who were cut off from the rest of the subgeniuses, even the ones in London, the rest of Europe.

948
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:29,180
And these Brighton, you know, Brighton is like the San Francisco of subgeniuses.

949
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,120
Very foggy and sandy.

950
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:36,500
We had been hearing for years that there were these huge raves in Brighton with gigantic,

951
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:40,580
gigantic bob banners bedecking whole dams and bridges.

952
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,100
We'd heard that there were stickers everywhere.

953
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:51,660
And sure enough, as we approached Brighton, we saw a pipe of halftone bob pipes, a decal on a street sign.

954
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,000
That is amazing.

955
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,460
And we were driven to a place called Upfront Screen Printing,

956
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:01,760
and we walked inside and defecated.

957
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:02,820
Of course.

958
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:06,480
For what we saw was more dobbly.

959
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:06,620
Dobsheads.

960
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,280
And more mutated dobsheads.

961
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,580
Portraits of our guru and slack master, JR Bob Dobbs.

962
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:17,700
Portraits as far and deep into this building as the eye could see.

963
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,620
Every wall, every chair.

964
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:24,480
The chair seats were covered with intricate, tiny, little, wonderful dobsheads.

965
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,360
Taken from our books and invented by them.

966
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:32,740
You couldn't sit down, in other words, without getting a dobshead up your wazoo.

967
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:36,480
So you're saying these are the most dobsheads you've ever seen in one single place?

968
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,540
It was actually true, yes.

969
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:48,540
This is the most, actually the most numerous dobsheads I've ever seen that were not on a screen of the new dobs video, Dobsadeliastis.

970
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:55,220
So as a species, would you say that these Brighton beechers are, to a man and woman, all saved or unsaved?

971
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,940
Well, that's the funny thing about it.

972
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,560
They obviously have slack and understand slack.

973
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:06,020
But they know little of the wordage or verbiage of dobs.

974
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:09,300
They know mostly his face, a few of his slogans.

975
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:19,080
They know of the books, but as mysterious documents, shunned tomes, you know, kept hidden by an ancient priesthood.

976
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:19,780
The search begins. Yes.

977
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,380
For those ancient tomes.

978
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:28,420
They could be hidden somewhere near the crown of Piccadilly or near the Stonehenge, any place around there.

979
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,580
Now here's another weird thing, Dave.

980
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,000
Okay.

981
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:35,460
This party in Brighton, it was going to be a devival, but it never turned into a devival.

982
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,420
Because everybody just danced the night away.

983
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,620
But they had a theme.

984
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:49,440
And the theme was, all these Brighton hipsters and weirdos were to dress as pink suburban rednecks of the English kind.

985
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,160
Which are called chapsters or chavsters.

986
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:52,980
Chaps.

987
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:53,960
I don't remember those.

988
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,560
Yes.

989
00:50:54,560 --> 00:51:00,220
And so we were told now, our friends are going to be dressing up as British rednecks.

990
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,980
Well, in walked all these British people.

991
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:06,760
But they looked to me like they were dressing like American pinks.

992
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,120
Ordinary middle class pink Americans.

993
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,620
Not your cowboy.

994
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:11,860
The state is spread.

995
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:23,800
But yet in the British redneckery form, it's kind of like a cross between ghetto black stuff and silly pink suburban...

996
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:29,680
Princess, we could probably describe it better than I, for I know nothing of these norms.

997
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,480
Well, it's the warm ups.

998
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,740
These outfits.

999
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:35,220
These are the outfits that you wear to warm up for sports.

1000
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,540
I wear them frequently, of course.

1001
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,980
And then of course it's the Burberry plaid.

1002
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,260
What's a Burberry plaid? I forget.

1003
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:48,480
A Burberry plaid is a beige, black and thin red striped plaid that indicates a certain status.

1004
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:48,720
So do I.

1005
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,940
Except that over there it's quite a joke.

1006
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,940
Everyone wearing it over here is a joke.

1007
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,300
It's a joke to them.

1008
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:02,120
They were dressing as Americans in order to look like British dumbasses.

1009
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,420
Well, that was what...

1010
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:09,180
And it was perplexing to me because I couldn't tell where the acting began and where the dumbassery ended.

1011
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:19,800
Why wouldn't they perhaps dress like Alex and his droogies with their jock straps on the outside and like the strange noses and bowler hats and white things and the gobbles and the yarburs and the other things?

1012
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,120
They might.

1013
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,900
But here's what they discovered.

1014
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:27,780
That when they threw a theme party about British rednecks, the thing filled up with actual British rednecks.

1015
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:31,040
But the ambulance and cops had to be called twice.

1016
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:31,680
Oh, mate.

1017
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,560
They said, next time, man, next time the theme's going to be San Francisco hippies.

1018
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,260
He's loving hippies.

1019
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,460
Yes, but really...

1020
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,080
Tree huggers.

1021
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,300
Tree huggers, yes.

1022
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:50,540
Truly, the subgenius European revival Lost and Found Tour was a great success.

1023
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,940
We did Amsterdam, which we cannot remember.

1024
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:56,240
Hamburg, Brighton, two London shows.

1025
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:00,640
We also did Princess Wee and I on Thanksgiving did a special show.

1026
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,240
Drinking publicly in the British Museum.

1027
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,260
Just because you can over there.

1028
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,660
They close the bars at 11 o'clock, but you can drink in public.

1029
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,300
On the buses.

1030
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:11,440
On the trains.

1031
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,820
It was astounding, yes.

1032
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,300
In the park.

1033
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:16,440
Strike up, James! Strike up!

1034
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,700
They're becoming more like America.

1035
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,360
They're banning everything.

1036
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:28,960
Smoking will not be allowed in any public place in England nor in Holland, which will affect the coffee shops quite a bit.

1037
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:30,620
Probably which...

1038
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:33,840
And generally, I'd say it's all going downhill.

1039
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:42,060
The freedoms are going away, but the Starbucks, the Woolworths and the McDonalds are getting stronger and more plentiful.

1040
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:51,440
You'll go to a little town in Germany and it will look like a storybook fairy tale land with an ancient cathedral and a Starbucks next door.

1041
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:56,300
And an ancient apothecary next to a radio shack.

1042
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,140
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1043
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,280
It's all...

1044
00:53:59,280 --> 00:53:59,940
Buggy balls.

1045
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:06,240
It's the Pax Americana has them worried about fascism in America.

1046
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,480
Pax Fiduscom?

1047
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:07,860
There in Germany.

1048
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:12,820
We Americans sure do have a lot of sack putting up all those things, friend.

1049
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,280
Well, you know, it could be worse and it could be better.

1050
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,400
Yeah!

1051
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,460
It could be a lot better, baby!

1052
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,880
It's Christmas in Baghdad.

1053
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,340
Magic lights up the air.

1054
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:30,200
Oh, yeah.

1055
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,920
There's Christmas in Baghdad.

1056
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,060
Isn't the magic in the air?

1057
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,000
Or the napalm in my hair?

1058
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:40,000
There's Christmas in Baghdad.

1059
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,620
What a festive place to be.

1060
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,940
There's Christmas in Baghdad.

1061
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,320
We'll put Dad in a body bag under the Christmas tree.

1062
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,060
It could be much worse.

1063
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:58,080
It could be much worse.

1064
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,020
Fighting began today in North Olmstead.

1065
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,060
A mosque was invaded.

1066
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,500
Three or four or...

1067
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,160
Well, there are no numbers yet.

1068
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,360
Also, there was fighting in Brook Park.

1069
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:10,020
There was fighting also in Euclid tonight.

1070
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:12,140
It could happen.

1071
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,000
It could happen.

1072
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,020
I mean, people could get pissed off and just start, like, smacking each other.

1073
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:17,280
Oh, yeah.

1074
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,200
Like, say, you're far enough away, you know.

1075
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:19,820
Oh, yeah.

1076
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,820
I could smack you.

1077
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:21,320
Yeah, right.

1078
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,500
And then I'd smack you back.

1079
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,080
You know, like the people, the maintenance people.

1080
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,960
And some of the people in the other rooms start smacking.

1081
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,520
From PR News in Washington, I'm suffering from hunger and poor health.

1082
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:31,920
President Bush reports.

1083
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,020
Nothing is going to change.

1084
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,260
And it's very important to understand nothing will change.

1085
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,400
The president wants trillions of dollars.

1086
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,500
There was no change.

1087
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:45,360
Four Palestinians were wounded in a humiliating process after the failure of PR News.

1088
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,680
One of the wounded was 36-23-32.

1089
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,520
In Washington State,

1090
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,200
the Children's Republican Army dropped their plans for photographic proof.

1091
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:59,260
An unmanned Israeli spokesman jumped out along the border in two separate incidents.

1092
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,780
Scientists have found bacteria that are resistant to PR News.

1093
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,620
President Bush reports.

1094
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,520
Farmers often add germs that become resistant to PR News.

1095
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:15,080
A woman accused of giving swine deadly bacteria that are resistant to PR News has been arrested.

1096
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,160
Wow, man.

1097
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:18,940
Wow, man.

1098
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:22,080
I'm glad at least we're keeping track of what's happening.

1099
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:24,580
Because, you know, with world events going the way they are,

1100
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,460
anybody could change into any form or shape at any time,

1101
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:31,920
and the whole thing would be, you know, all over.

1102
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:41,080
Well, we're lucky on this show to get PR News from Fernand and Andy LeMers' news organization.

1103
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:44,280
That's where all those little news reports come from.

1104
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:48,160
And he's actually out in the field gathering the information himself, I heard.

1105
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:48,700
Yeah.

1106
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,700
He's outstanding in his field.

1107
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,240
Hunting and gathering.

1108
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,300
Way outstanding in his field.

1109
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,940
Did you hear about during hunting season here, I know you were gone,

1110
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:01,700
but in the United States during hunting season a bunch of hunters decided to take it upon themselves to eliminate each other.

1111
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:04,340
To get better huntings and so forth.

1112
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,540
Really? No, I didn't know that.

1113
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,680
Oh, yeah, yeah. There were a lot of them this year.

1114
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:08,340
Accidents?

1115
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,280
No.

1116
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,360
Murders?

1117
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,380
A murder, yes.

1118
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:12,860
Serial hunters?

1119
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:17,420
Well, they got into an argument about whose hunting land it was.

1120
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:18,460
Serial mountain hunters.

1121
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:20,260
Well, that's true, yeah.

1122
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:28,580
So, they collected their stuff and took it upon themselves to eliminate both artists.

1123
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:28,580


1124
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:29,600
A wintering in which they decided not to shoot any more with

1125
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:34,540
a revolver against the thyr ihšangani.

1126
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,520
But, when they decided to kick it up, they didn't get down.

1127
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,060
They might have to play really hard shot.

1128
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:47,840
You know, itית 얘Lor m queen.

1129
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,480
peanuts here.

1130
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,580
They'll what you for a bag of peanuts?

1131
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,340
They'll shoot you. Oh, shoot.

1132
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,360
I thought you said...

1133
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,440
Zoot, yeah. Well, no.

1134
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,800
It's pretty hard to get them to zoot you. You have to bribe

1135
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,600
them. They'll knee crap you for a bag

1136
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,100
of peanuts.

1137
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,060
That's one way to put it.

1138
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,260
And I roll the bag.

1139
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,060
There's like two and three and four other

1140
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,180
ways of putting it.

1141
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,520
If you don't really get into it.

1142
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:13,380
Or so.

1143
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:19,040
Oh, and I might mention, by the way,

1144
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,380
incidentally, in passing,

1145
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,540
that

1146
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,620
there is a subgenius revival

1147
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:27,080
coming up in Detroit for those listeners

1148
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,960
far, far, far

1149
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,960
away in

1150
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,920
Detroit. There will be a subgenius

1151
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,840

the Magic Stick.

1153
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:38,880
Involving the

1154
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,200
amino acids

1155
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,740
heard here in the background, as

1156
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:43,680
well as

1157
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,080

00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,940

subgenius preachers.

1162
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,020
And I

1163
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,060
just thought I'd mention that.

1164
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:00,840
That is

1165
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,240
in Detroit on the 19th.

1166
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,660
And that's about all

1167
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,560
we know. Oh, by the way, for people

1168
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,820
interested in seeing horrendous photographs

1169
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:10,720
of subgeniuses

1170
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,280
on the loose in Europe and some

1171
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,080
very, very tediously

1172
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,360
detailed reporting on all that,

1173
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,320

00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:26,220
practicing my slick radio way of

1177
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:26,980
saying our address.

1178
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:30,240

or on the radio can

1182
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,120
write to us and get a little booklet or

1183
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:38,440
something.

1184
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,140
Here's that address.

Huh?

1195
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,640
Well, we'll leave this

1196
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,620
This is a cut from the new Amino

And, uh, and we will let, uh...

1201

The entire duration of my stay

1202
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:35,580
with the aliens.

1203
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:38,600
They never once turned off the TV.

1204
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:58,440
I don't know why they have to

1205
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:58,660
You too, dude.

1206
01:00:58,660 --> 01:00:58,660


1207
01:00:58,660 --> 01:00:58,660

Bye.
