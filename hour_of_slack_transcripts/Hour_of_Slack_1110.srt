1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,860
Take this gang something very very personal from the subgenius

2
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,720
Actually, there's something I need to tell you you're seeing someone else

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,740
Yeah, how did you is it Bob? No does Bob look like the kind of person I'd go out with

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,680
I see

5
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,420
Yes

6
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:10,220
Dear friends this hour of slack number one thousand one hundred and ten finds us back

7
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,020
from

8
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:19,780
X-Day back from Starwood back from my daughter's wedding and back from both of Mickey Defchick's weddings to Bob

9
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,040
And almost but not quite everything in this hour was recorded live at brushwood

10
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,620
Folklore Center on X-Day or at the

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,520
Starwood Festival

12
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:36,780
Such as this music in the background by five-fisted tales of Connie

13
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:44,220
Which was everybody who wanted to play on stage at X-Day on Friday night and this particular episode?

14
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,980
may be good for beginners because the preaching was either to the

15
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:55,060
Unsaved or by the great dr. Howell or the great Carter LeBlanc

16
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,080
But first to set the mood as some steps

17
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,100
from a recent X-Day show from WR

18
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:12,440
Atlanta and their very own Bob slack time fun house with this collage by Reverend

19
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,440
Susie the flu

20
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,120
Teleportation

21
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,800
People have come from the future to visit us

22
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,380
Using the Earth Union's time machine

23
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,420
We've been sent back here to warn you all we wish to change incidents that are about to take place here

24
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,360
Things that have caused catastrophe in the 23rd century

25
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,820
We came here to warn you all about your country's gloomy future

26
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:54,840
Because in the century that we come from there's no longer a Japan. Why how could that possibly be and why what's the reason for it?

27
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,920
You want to make an omelet you got a break some eggs?

28
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,800
See that the humans remain entertained

29
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,580
Yeah

30
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,920
Telling us watch friends of an evil

31
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,840
Don't be veal number four

32
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,420
Doing our sign of evil count down here's

33
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,140
Our things going here doesn't look so hot

34
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:20,120
We'll be broadcasting in a few minutes the mobile unit is also getting ready good. Keep it up. The world's depending on us, okay?

35
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,380
The one question that I heard ask more than any other the question is man going to destroy himself

36
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,800
Are we coming?

37
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,460
to the end of the world oh god no is today the fifth

38
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,920
is god outraged with all of this i don't know and he hears the rattling sabers and sees the

39
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,700
spewing rockets he sees the atomic bombs that are buried beneath the sandia mountains close

40
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,600
to albuquerque new mexico with enough detonating force and destructive force to completely destroy

41
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,100
it the entire world he sees the lethal snouts of atomic submarines that plow their way through the

42
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,020
waves of the mighty oceans levitians of the deep that could completely destroy mankind with just

43
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:14,680
the push of a button he sees that he sees the mighty saturn missile belching its black smoke

44
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,280
and flame of fire taking its cargo of flesh to the moon he sees it he also knows that madmen's

45
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,380
in spite of their front of civilization and intellectualism

46
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,400
and getting along and peaceful coexistence that have but one desire that's to destroy

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,040
and take over this entire world he sees this he knows this okay bob god's living avatar slack has

48
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:44,740
informed his spokes clerk reverend stang that's me that's all i am i just work here don't mistake me

49
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:53,080
for bob if you see me on the highway don't shoot me you know uh ask me if i wanted a drink or

50
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,840
something that's a good way to do it

51
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,960
now according to blah blah the time has come for certain dire and marvelous secrets of the church

52
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:09,500
of the subgenius to be revealed and what secret is any good if it isn't both dire and marvelous

53
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:16,540
you know that's why we're all here we're looking for the dire and the marvelous what had been

54
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:22,840
privileged and classified occult knowledge will be shared with any who are willing to uphold the fib

55
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,940
or faith in bob

56
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,940
friends have can you keep the fib going

57
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,700
it takes a lot of well not faith exactly

58
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:40,520
we're not teaching faith we're teaching that we're trying to give you the gift of disbelief

59
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:48,440
think if those heavens gate people had only met bob first and been a little bit disillusioned

60
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:55,580
before they went and cut off their nards and wore the nikes and took the piss

61
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,000
The bad pills waiting for the end of the world.

62
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,700
Friends, Bob predicted that the world would end July 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.

63
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,740
And by those stripes we know that we don't know what year this is!

64
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,320
But it sure ain't 1998 yet.

65
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:20,140
And Bob's message, in fact the reason the diehard subgeniuses gather right there,

66
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:26,220
right outside this building every July 5th at god-awful time of 7 in the morning,

67
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,820
is to prove that we really know that the end could come any second.

68
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,400
A big asteroid could just flop down upon all of us.

69
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,660
They never see them coming.

70
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,780
They only see them after the near miss has just happened.

71
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,260
They don't even make the papers most of the time.

72
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,460
But you know, time could be up any second.

73
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,720
Are you ready to meet Bob?

74
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,860
Now if you happen,

75
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,840
you need to have that subgenius membership card in your pocket,

76
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,580
the one that makes you an ordained minister,

77
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,680
so that you could perform marriages just like I do.

78
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,000
And if those aren't real marriages, a lot of money's been wasted on divorces, friends.

79
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,440
If you have that membership card in your pocket for sale over there for 30 bucks,

80
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,220
with that huge beautiful packet of important-looking documents,

81
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,120
you'll be lifted up by the aliens when they come to destroy you.

82
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,680
And you'll be the one to destroy the world.

83
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,720
And we call it the rupture, the time of the rupture,

84
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:29,740
when the faithful will be brought up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

85
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,880
We're not talking about these little pathetic sexless greys

86
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,580
that have to eat by painting food on their stomach.

87
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,360
They don't even have teeth! They don't have hair!

88
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,280
From what I've heard, sex with those things is not worth it.

89
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,280
That is the future.

90
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,000
Those greys, those kinds of aliens,

91
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,600
those are ourselves in the future if the conspiracy wins.

92
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,880
If Bob's people win,

93
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,740
ourselves in the future will look just like the Bigfoot,

94
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,260
only even more colorful.

95
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,600
And weird-looking.

96
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:13,080
You know, we're trying to hold on to that sweaty grunting and hunting

97
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,120
and, you know, the rock chips.

98
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,060
Being if you have to get off, you know.

99
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,080
That's close to drumming, whatever.

100
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,400
We're into that primate stuff.

101
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,040
The true subgeniuses are the descendants of the Yeti,

102
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,680
Bigfoots that raped humans.

103
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:35,460
The humans were actually invented by the super-intelligent Bigfeet of Mutantis

104
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,100
80 million years ago as lab rats.

105
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,220
And they got loose.

106
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,820
And that explains a lot, doesn't it?

107
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,260
Uh, so...

108
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,540
Bot, bot, bot, bot.

109
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,380
Certainly, I went to Princeton with Bot.

110
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,440
You see, Bot, you see, Bot.

111
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't know what Bot's politics are exactly.

112
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,640
He's never told me how he voted.

113
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:03,320
Bot, love apple, sinister reputation of this rich, round, red, pompous mass.

114
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,840
Highly excited, love apple.

115
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,980
Are you there?

116
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,780
BS takes you back 129 years to an amusing but significant moment

117
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,660
in the unceasing struggle against ignorance and superstition.

118
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,160
There.

119
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,400
You are.

120
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,440
You are there, Bot.

121
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,720
Just who is this man?

122
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,580
He's a much-travelled man.

123
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,720
The largest and most attractive love apple.

124
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,620
Johnson, eat one.

125
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,040
The things people will do these days just to get attention.

126
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,280
Bot, got a wide grin on his face.

127
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,780
Love apple.

128
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,320
Biggest surprise of my life.

129
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:31,800
Big man.

130
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,540
You see this love apple?

131
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,160
Yes.

132
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,820
Bot, ain't no ordinary man.

133
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,840
He's got the constitution of a horse.

134
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,980
He's a big man.

135
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,860
He's a big man.

136
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,100
He knows what he's doing.

137
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,460
He's quite a character, you know.

138
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:42,880
Really?

139
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,520
Oh, yes.

140
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,060
Most amusing man.

141
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,300
Very eccentric.

142
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,360
Oh, I tell you, the man is incredible.

143
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,400
There's simply no telling what he'll do next.

144
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,320
But whatever it is, it'll be gay.

145
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,160
That's it.

146
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:53,820
Johnson.

147
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,720
Large, rough-skinned, misshapen growth.

148
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,780
Coarse, hairy, scraggly, ill-smelling.

149
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,180
It yields no nourishment, of course, to the body.

150
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,340
Very good, that you cared, man.

151
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,480
I like to hear him talk.

152
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,420
They call me crazy.

153
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,380
I have conspired to cause you to congregate here.

154
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,920
I'm going to eat one right now.

155
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,100
He has raised the love apple to his lips.

156
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,120
He's bitten into it.

157
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,280
He's eating it with evident relish.

158
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,300
He's taken another bite.

159
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,740
Again, he's biting into the love apple.

160
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,180
And the fight against ignorance and superstition goes on.

161
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,420
First course, small cubes of a sandwich.

162
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,160
Next, the main dish.

163
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,240
And our suggestion is white floating swan soap.

164
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,080
Now, a grand salad.

165
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,560
Press two halves of a Boy Scout together with a tasty center filling of nicotine.

166
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:55,960
And for dessert, cigarette pie served with fiberglass insulation for a new high in appetizing goodness.

167
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:01,760
And you'll find dozens of other exciting ways to surprise your family with this nourishing, wholesome food.

168
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,600
Oh, and the weirdest one of all.

169
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,680
What is Bob smoking?

170
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,420
This is always the big surprise for me.

171
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,380
I have to come up with one.

172
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,280
Six months before the event, they ask for a description of my workshop.

173
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,440
And I have to come up with one real quick.

174
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,120
And then I completely forget what it is until the workshop starts.

175
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,300
So, yeah, what is Bob smoking?

176
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,380
The enigma explained.

177
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,400
The tomb opened.

178
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,540
The zip lock unsealed.

179
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,640
And it promises.

180
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:41,020
Well, friends, actually, the question is not what is Bob smoking, but what isn't Bob smoking?

181
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,400
And in fact, I'm going to tell you this.

182
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:52,500
In fact, I could just do the entire workshop just explaining the sentences in the workshop description.

183
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,080
J.R. Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Slack.

184
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,820
Well, that's old pipe face there.

185
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,960
That's the way he looks to me a lot of the time.

186
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:07,760
And people are always asking us, I read that book of yours.

187
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,380
Now, what were you guys smoking?

188
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,340
Now, come on.

189
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,520
What were you on?

190
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,720
Friends, with the faith in Bob, you don't need false drugs.

191
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,320
Bob is the drug, friends.

192
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,660
Bob is drugs.

193
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,280
Bob is sex.

194
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,760
Bob is money.

195
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:30,340
And with Bob, you don't need sex, drugs, or money, although they help you appreciate Bob that much more, I suppose.

196
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:41,500
Well, really, the living avatar of Slack, well, we know he's alive because as Bob does, he's alive.

197
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:41,500


198
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,160
And Bob said, the Buddha also said this, if you see me on the highway, kill me.

199
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,620
And we did that.

200
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:56,480
Every time Bob showed up, we, some fundamentalist subgenius would pull a gun out and shoot him.

201
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,760
And that's why you don't see him up here preaching anymore.

202
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:05,620
But like a cartoon character, he always comes back with just a Band-Aid on.

203
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,160
You can blow him up.

204
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,020
And yet, there he is again.

205
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,100
He's like the ever-recycling savior.

206
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,720
You've probably heard of those.

207
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,500
There's a lot of them around, I guess.

208
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,240
They're handy that way.

209
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,340
So he is the living avatar of Slack.

210
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,140
What is Slack, friends?

211
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,240
Only you know what your Slack is.

212
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:35,180
The conspiracy, oh, every little branch of the conspiracy, every mini-conspiracy within the overall conspiracy of the normal people,

213
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,780
which is the conspiracy we're talking about.

214
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,000
And I'm afraid of that.

215
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,780
I'm afraid it's even inside most of you.

216
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,520
Because it's, you know, what is normal anyway?

217
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:51,300
Out here, the weirdo is the guy in the business suit trying to sell encyclopedias.

218
00:13:52,920 --> 00:14:03,840
It's all relative and, but there's not, this moral relativity is a bunch of hogwash.

219
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,860
There is a solid line where you can decide,

220
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:14,620
where good and bad, warm and cold and hot, or cold and hot, rich and poor start.

221
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,720
And that line is Bob.

222
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,640
You can zero your meter on that man Bob.

223
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,480
Because he's a mystery.

224
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,400
And that way you don't really have anything to compare your own misery or happiness with.

225
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,460
You're just going to have to interpret it for yourself.

226
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,880
And figure out what gives you Slack.

227
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:36,320
As I said, one part of the, I guess the Reynolds Tobacco Company and Miller Beer and so forth,

228
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,880
their idea of Slack is when you're, when boy, you're at the party with all your buds.

229
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,680
And your team just won the game.

230
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,860
And you're drinking that whatever product.

231
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,380
And you're good looking and rich.

232
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,120
And well, at least you have a good job that you're dutiful at.

233
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,200
And you know, other people's idea of Slack is,

234
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,760
well that's stupid man.

235
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,340
Real Slack is just smoking dope and watching TV all day dude.

236
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,740
And that may be Slack for you.

237
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,720
For some of us, Slack is working at what we most like to work on.

238
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,060
Until we drop.

239
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,220
And in fact we,

240
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:25,100
our friend Reverend Allie said she had worked, she had been volunteer labor on Starwood for so long.

241
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,400
No it wasn't Allie, it was Baz Otherwise.

242
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,780
Reverend Baz Otherwise said she had been up all night long.

243
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,040
But, and was completely,

244
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,720
completely,

245
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,420
sunk on lack of sleep.

246
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,060
And that's the greatest drug for, well it's the second greatest drug to sleep.

247
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,020
Sleep is the greatest drug.

248
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,300
And anti-sleep is the next best one.

249
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,700
Because you can come down from it by sleeping.

250
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,780
And it doesn't really hurt you that much.

251
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,060
Rationalization is more important than food.

252
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,040
Because you can go for as long as several days without eating.

253
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,780
But you can't

254
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,520
do this with rationalization.

255
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,700
Because every single minute of every single day,

256
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,960
you spend your time justifying your actions,

257
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,280
either to yourself or to someone else.

258
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,820
Or you spend it justifying someone else's actions to yourself or someone else.

259
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:34,680
There exist only two varieties of individual that carry the capability to willfully suspend this perpetual,

260
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,880
perpetual need for self-justification.

261
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:43,520
Those two individuals are the psychopath and the overman.

262
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,380
And be mindful that the distinction between those two and the rest of the human race

263
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:56,240
has nothing to do with the achievements of the psychopath or the overman,

264
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:02,440
but rather with the deficiencies on a planetary level and on a species-wide level

265
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,900
as far as homo sapiens sapiens is concerned.

266
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,420
Because this, this is the thing.

267
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:15,440
Every single morning from the minute you get up until the minute you go to bed,

268
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,600
you are lying to yourself.

269
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:26,080
Your mind and your body and your soul are at such odds as to their perception

270
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:32,420
that it is necessary to lie to every single person.

271
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,980
Every single aspect of your own existence simply to go about it.

272
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:44,300
Gurdjieff said the only way any human being can make any sort of progress on their own spiritual being

273
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,860
is by refusing to lie to themselves.

274
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,140
That's right.

275
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,940
He said the first step is getting up, looking yourself in the eye and saying,

276
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,600
today I'm not going to lie to myself.

277
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,360
All day.

278
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,680
This is of course a lie,

279
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,460
but it should be remembered that there is a second order of removal.

280
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,040
If you can't not lie to yourself,

281
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,660
at least don't lie to yourself about lying to yourself.

282
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,980
This is what we call pulling the wool over your own eyes.

283
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,280
Now,

284
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,520
I've had to revise the rant that I intended to give at X Day 10.

285
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,840
It was,

286
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,820
it was,

287
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:49,260
it was actually not too far removed from the rant I did last year about aliens and sex and reproduction and evolutionary destiny.

288
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,340
But look,

289
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:51,800
let's,

290
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,620
let's not talk about aliens right now.

291
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,920
Let's talk about something else.

292
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,240
Let's talk about the C.O.N.

293
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,860
The Conspiracy of Normals.

294
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,320
The Con.

295
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,880
Let's talk about the things that affect you every single day.

296
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,920
And what is it that we,

297
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,380
the sub-genii,

298
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,740
can do about that?

299
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,040
Because when it comes to fighting the conspiracy,

300
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,940
it's a lot like standing in front of tanks in Tiananmen Square.

301
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,400
It looks good on paper,

302
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,820
but the outcome tends to be messy.

303
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,380
But that is not even the point.

304
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:47,960
The point is that the conspiracy is stealing your slack every single moment of every single day.

305
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:57,760
And you are spending those same moments of those same days lying to yourself about it.

306
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,740
So what you have to do is,

307
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,440
when you get up,

308
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,480
you have to set yourself to the work of the sub-genius.

309
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,220
And that is a three-fold work.

310
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,440
First, you gotta get your own slack back.

311
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,720
Then you gotta get some slack for your friends.

312
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,800
And then you gotta make sure you got some slack for the rest of the yetizens.

313
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,040
The rest of the sub-genius world is in desperate need of slack.

314
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,680
And if you don't get it for yourself,

315
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,080
you can't get it for them.

316
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:31,720
And the thing about getting your slack back from the conspiracy is that it's gonna be some of the hardest work you have ever done.

317
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,420
That's right, I've said it before,

318
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,840
you can't get slack just by slacking off.

319
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:45,620
Rescuing your slack from the conspiracy is like rescuing a baby from a pit bull.

320
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,040
It's ugly work, it's hard work, it's bloody work.

321
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,500
And you better make sure once you get the baby from that pit bull,

322
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,040
the pit bull doesn't turn on you.

323
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,920
Because the conspiracy does not like to relinquish slack.

324
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,700
They don't even know why they have to.

325
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:01,700


326
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,940
Or what to do with it.

327
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,460
They sure as hell don't want you taking it from them.

328
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,680
And let me tell you, you're gonna take it from them.

329
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,140
And how are you gonna take it from them?

330
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,820
Well that's what I'm here to talk to you about right now.

331
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,860
That's right, I'm talking about making war on the conspiracy.

332
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,720
Marching into battle.

333
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:31,700
Pitched battle against the conspiracy of normals that seeks to discredit and disavow your true yetis.

334
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,560
Your yeti nature.

335
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,780
How does one do that?

336
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,660
How?

337
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:51,540
How do you march into war against a many-headed, amoeboid, hydra, endlessly cycling vortex of suck and oppression

338
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,300
that is the conspiracy.

339
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,040
Something that has no center.

340
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,460
Something that has no organs that you can pierce.

341
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,160
It has no arms that you can sever.

342
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,120
It is amorphous and non-corporeal.

343
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,840
It is clouds without water.

344
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,120
It is coffee without caffeine.

345
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,200
It is a million eyes and no head.

346
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,460
It is beer without alcohol.

347
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,440
It is tits without ass.

348
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,860
So how can we battle this?

349
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,420
How can we fight against the conspiracy?

350
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,560
We can't use normal weapons.

351
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,720
Of course not.

352
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,480
Because they have all the normal weapons.

353
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,460
They make all the normal weapons.

354
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,480
And they sell the crappy ones to us.

355
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,740
And they keep the good ones for themselves.

356
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,040
Just in case we get any ideas about funny things to do with the crappy ones.

357
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,100
If there's a weapon you can get your hands on, you can be damn sure it's not going to be a threat to the conspiracy.

358
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,700
So don't think just because you've got a trap door with an RPG and some plastic guns, that you can't do anything about it.

359
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,860
And you've got a lot of explosives hidden somewhere, that you're going to actually have any success fighting the conspiracy.

360
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,540
Because those weapons are conspiracy weapons.

361
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,760
You cannot fight the conspiracy with conspiracy weapons.

362
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,340
Okay.

363
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,160
You say, okay Reverend Carter LeBlanc.

364
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,340
You sure talk a nice game.

365
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,400
So we can't fight the conspiracy with conspiracy weapons.

366
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,000
We get it.

367
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,680
So what do we use to fight the conspiracy?

368
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,260
We have two weapons.

369
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,680
Mockery and perversion.

370
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:52,900
Mockery and perversion are the twin swords in the subgenius scabbard.

371
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,780
And every subgenius should be able to wield them both.

372
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,580
Singly or as a pair.

373
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,740
For both mockery and perversion can be used to defend or attack.

374
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,120
You can use mockery to pierce the heart of your enemy.

375
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,600
Even when he has none.

376
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,720
And you can also use mockery to defend yourself against the onslaught of the enemy.

377
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,480
By diminishing and reducing his attack to nothing.

378
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,420
To nothing that can affect you.

379
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:31,680
And in the same way, perversion can be used to decimate your enemy.

380
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,380
To defame your enemy's defenses.

381
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,680
By exploiting weaknesses in his cultural assumptions.

382
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,680
But it can also be a tool of defense.

383
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,320
Perversion can be a shield and a source of strength.

384
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,460
When the grindstone is wearing you down.

385
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:53,260
Perversion is the key to lateral thinking.

386
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,240
But heed this warning.

387
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,720
Choose your perversion well.

388
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:08,080
Or you will hand the tools for your own destruction over unto the people who seek your destruction.

389
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,960
Now, I'll get back to mockery in just a moment.

390
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,060
But let me just talk about perversion.

391
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,260
Let me explain to you why perversion is such a valuable tool.

392
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,420
Particularly in this, the digital age.

393
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,880
It's simple really.

394
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,580
The reason why perversion is so valuable.

395
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:46,280
The reason why perversion is so important in this day and age.

396
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,380
Is because everyone is a pervert.

397
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,800
Man.

398
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,880
Everybody's.

399
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,220
Got a closet.

400
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,700
And everybody's skeletons look a little bit different.

401
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,540
If you don't care who sees your skeletons.

402
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,800
You have power over all the people that care.

403
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,160
I'm not just talking about sexual perversion.

404
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,900
Perversion applies to emotions that have nothing at all to do with sex.

405
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,000
And perversion can apply those emotions to sex.

406
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:42,500
Perversion is useful because if you are comfortable with manifold forms of perversion.

407
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,500
And your opponent is not.

408
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,220
Your opponent is off balance.

409
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,040
And if your opponent is off balance.

410
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,700
It is easier to strike at your opponent.

411
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,220
Weirdness generates the fall.

412
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:58,220


413
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,380
The fog of war.

414
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:12,340
Weirdness ensures that your enemy has no idea what to do next.

415
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,580
And perversity is weirdness writ large.

416
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,160
Weirdness has its own section in the bookstore.

417
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,200
Perversity has its own section in the bookstore.

418
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,700
And it has to have its own bookstores.

419
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,240
Weirdness can be dismissed as eccentricity.

420
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,300
Perversity.

421
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,640
Perversity permits no such thing.

422
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,680
So there's perversion.

423
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,220
Now.

424
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,820
On to mockery.

425
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,680
Now there's a.

426
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,000
Uh.

427
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,860
There's an essay.

428
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,580
A little short couple paragraph thing I threw together that ended up in the Bobby Arkholtman

429
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,860
new subgenius book on why we mock.

430
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,960
And it's sort of an incomplete thought.

431
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,820
It's decent.

432
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,920
I'll stand behind it.

433
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:20,400
But the thing about mockery is mockery is such an important tool.

434
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,000
It's particularly a tool of the disenfranchised.

435
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,580
If you look through history.

436
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,740
People who have been disempowered.

437
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,080
Or never were empowered.

438
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,240
Inevitably.

439
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,180
Fall back on mockery.

440
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,300
When do we learn mockery?

441
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,180
I think we learn mockery very young.

442
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:56,360
I think it begins when you're placed in a position of subordination.

443
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,700
To an authority figure that you do not respect.

444
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,320
Usually kindergarten.

445
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,800
Maybe a little earlier if you're ornery.

446
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,540
Maybe a little later if you're stupid.

447
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,360
But frankly.

448
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,980
When somebody that's not your parents.

449
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,060
Is telling you what to do like your parents do.

450
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,580
Well.

451
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,540
You can't do much about it.

452
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,640
But you can sure as hell make fun of them.

453
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,420
And let me tell you.

454
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,400
We all know.

455
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,520
Nothing pisses.

456
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,340
A teacher can't piss.

457
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:26,340


458
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:26,340


459
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:26,340


460
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:26,340


461
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:26,340


462
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:26,340


463
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:26,340


464
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:26,340


465
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:26,620
Teacher off.

466
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,500
More than mockery.

467
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,640
Because mockery.

468
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,920
Mockery is a challenge to authority.

469
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,700
That demands.

470
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,320
No actual substantive rebuttal.

471
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,000
The best rebuttal you can come up with to mockery.

472
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,800
Is more mockery and teachers aren't allowed to mock their students.

473
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,320
Because mockery is.

474
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:56,320


475
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,560
Teachers can punish their students, but all that does is make them look like thugs.

476
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:10,380
Because every other student knows it's completely unfair what the teacher did when the student was just making fun of them.

477
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,440
This applies to governments as well.

478
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,780
You make fun of the president, he can't do anything to you.

479
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,580
Of course in this day and age, that's about as easy as dynamiting fish in a barrel.

480
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:37,580
But really biting, incisive mockery, I mean something that goes beyond the you're stupid, you're ugly, you smell funny.

481
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:46,600
Oh, if mockery is done well, it is a beautiful and devastating weapon.

482
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,760
Particularly when it is driven by a gun.

483
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:56,200
When it is driven home with a force derived from absolute undeniable truth.

484
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,920
Or conversely irrefutable falsehood.

485
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,840
Well, that's pretty much all I have to say at this point.

486
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,640
Mockery and perversion.

487
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,820
Let those be our weapons.

488
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,700
Let us use them well.

489
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,820
This is Reverend Carter LeBlanc.

490
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,280
Praise Bob.

491
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,200
Hail Connie.

492
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,340
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

493
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,320
Don't let the bastards drag you down.

494
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,300
And if you do, drag them down with you.

495
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,760
Their joy completely believing in publishableawan.com

496
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:19,760


497
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:19,760


498
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:21,740
Superman.

499
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:23,560
Superman.

500
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,720
You're all in bad shape.

501
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,280
You're right.

502
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,500
Oh, Superman.

503
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:28,840
No.

504
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,440
Meanwhile, Superman capsized.

505
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,860
Unaware, Superman continues his search of the area.

506
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,060
Where can they be?

507
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,800
I must find them.

508
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,080
I must.

509
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,880
Now that Superman has gone into action,

510
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,360
there's excitement ahead in this mysterious story.

511
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,820
Smith, the next episode.

512
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,200
And remember, for breakfast,

513
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,640
it's the adventures of Superman.

514
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,480
Superman is the copyrighted feature

515
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,300
appearing in Superman comic magazines

516
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,520
and is brought to you Monday through Friday

517
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,520
by Bob.

518
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,240
Superman by Lee Murr

519
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,100
and before that, Reverend Carter LeBlanc,

520
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,580
who will be with Priestess Pisces

521
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,740
and yours truly and the amino acids.

522
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,560
At a Baltimore revival in an old church

523
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,740
on November 10th,

524
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,220
10 days before the Amsterdam Frop Cup,

525
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,780
which will feature preaching by Dr. Howell

526
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,560
and we, I, Stag.

527
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,680
Before Carter, we heard some preaching

528
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,880
from Starwood 27,

529
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,000
revival collages by Reverend Norrell Preff

530
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,140
and also Fernanda Nande Lee Murr,

531
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,780
some background music by,

532
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,640
well, what we're hearing now,

533
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,520
is by Five-Fisted Tales of Connie

534
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,440
and soon, Dr. Howell at X-Day

535
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,600
with Gorillas and Dreams.

536
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,120
But first, this news.

537
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,840
What time?

538
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,760
Where are we at on time?

539
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,940
Two hours to go.

540
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,340
5.20?

541
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,040
That's all?

542
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,140
6.20.

543
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,740
I was thinking, man, we're going backwards.

544
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,180
6.20.

545
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,020
So it's almost time for the Q&A.

546
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,880
Oh, I should...

547
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,500
Here's something else we learned.

548
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,040
Oh, no, here's another miracle.

549
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,960
Another miracle and this is no crap.

550
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,120
We've been selling ordainments

551
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,840
in Subgenius and Universal Life Church.

552
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,520
Kind of go hand in hand,

553
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:32,080
just in case the cops don't believe the subgenius part.

554
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,160
We've been selling these ordainments for a long time,

555
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,020
but as far as I know, Bob himself never...

556
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,780
He wasn't going to spend 30 bucks on his own thing.

557
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,460
But we got a membership order

558
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,040
just before we came here

559
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,480
from Robert Dobbs

560
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,600
in...

561
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,000
Carolina.

562
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,600
Now, it didn't say J.R. Bob Dobbs,

563
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,540
so I know it's not THE Bob.

564
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,280
It's just A Bob.

565
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,920
But if you see him,

566
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,240
you know what to do.

567
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,220
Poor guy.

568
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,000
I really feel sorry for him.

569
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,600
Now, later on, when we get a quorum here,

570
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,780
we're going to ask you about

571
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,240
the gorillas and demons in your life.

572
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,220
Something that every subgenius should be glad

573
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,300
to put down in black and white.

574
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,960
So we've created a gorilla and demon form,

575
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,140
which we're going to be passing out

576
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,920
and asking you to describe your own

577
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,800
personal, hideously embarrassing,

578
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,120
and just plain hideous gorillas and demons.

579
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,460
But not yet, because we have,

580
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,100
plenty more in our broadcast

581
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,340
before we get to that point.

582
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,860
Eh, Reverend Stang?

583
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,160
Yeah, I might mention that that flyer

584
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,880
about the gorillas and demons

585
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,640
originated in an elementary school.

586
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,780
Oh, yes, it was meant to

587
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,940
warp the minds of little kids,

588
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,040
but we have our own uses for it out here.

589
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,040
There's a subgenius who found it,

590
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,960
happens to work at a Kinko's.

591
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,900
Now, I'm just encouraging...

592
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,200
Well, maybe I should read that

593
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,280
when they're...

594
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,680
Oh, you've got some.

595
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,720
You can read already.

596
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,100
This is an example of gorilla and demon submission

597
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,480
that we have, and we're now going to read.

598
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,460
Yeah, it has a place where you can,

599
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,760
where the little boy or girl can fill out

600
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,080
the information.

601
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,040
Whether they're a gorilla or a demon or both.

602
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,260
Well, in this case...

603
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,980
And what does it say?

604
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,560
We need somebody to pass these out.

605
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
Well, I thought we would wait

606
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,700
until we got a bigger crowd,

607
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,940
but maybe we should pass them out.

608
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,660
Is there anyone who would like to come up?

609
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,300
And pass out our gorilla and demon forms.

610
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,380
I thought you said pass out.

611
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,000
No, no.

612
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,720
We want you to pass these forms out,

613
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,080
and as far as pens to fill out the blanks,

614
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,700
you can use the colored pens

615
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,280
at the foot of the whiteboard

616
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,720
if you don't happen to have a pen.

617
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,880
And participate in our survey

618
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,980
as to what comprises your personal gorilla

619
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,660
and or demon.

620
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,980
Or perhaps both.

621
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,780
Think carefully and choose your words wisely.

622
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:14,940
I...

623
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,800
I've managed to fit mine perfectly

624
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,820
into the space provided.

625
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:19,900
Well, let's hear it.

626
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,680
Without cramming.

627
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,480
See, we do not ask others to go

628
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,520
where we do not go.

629
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,400
Stang will now describe for you

630
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,420
his own personal gorillas and demons.

631
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,360
This is my confession,

632
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,320
you might say.

633
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,300
Michael Alcandor is a mean man,

634
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,240
and he said I'm a bad, satanic Jew mason,

635
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,080
and that at X-Day,

636
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,520
I mind-control all the people

637
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,000
and make them stay out

638
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,380
in filthy tents

639
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,340
while I stay in the big house counting money.

640
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,900
And that made me feel bad because it's true.

641
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,340
The king was in the counting house

642
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,820
counting all his money.

643
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,940
Now, there was a second...

644
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,300
That was what the gorilla said.

645
00:37:59,440 --> 00:37:59,860
Michael Alcandor was my gorilla.

646
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,340
Okay, let's hear the demon now.

647
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,320
The gorilla was good,

648
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,740
but now we're going to hear the demon of Reverend Stang.

649
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,520
Doc Frop is a mean man

650
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,960
because he gave me cookies

651
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,200
and said they were good,

652
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,700
and I ate them, and they were bad.

653
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,400
And he said, ha-ha, I laid my balls on them.

654
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,880
So you see how it works, folks.

655
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,860
You put down your worst possible,

656
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,760
least noble thought on these blanks,

657
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,560
and then later on, we'll all have a lot of fun

658
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,680
by reading it out loud in front of everybody.

659
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,120
It's all part of our concept of subgenius therapy,

660
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,900
which you'll see more of later in our program.

661
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,800
I don't care, you don't care.

662
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,740
That's subgenius therapy.

663
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:37,560
Yeah.

664
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,380
And we'll hang these up.

665
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,040
It's called resilient therapy, stoic,

666
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,880
like coating yourself with...

667
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:44,980
Yeah.

668
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,940
...a spiritual styrofoam.

669
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,720
Now, at one point, I thought of setting up

670
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,380
a confession booth up here that would be public.

671
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,060
Oh, I don't think that would...

672
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:54,760
Well, maybe I...

673
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,540
Well, the thing is,

674
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,360
I realized it had been done before many times.

675
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,860
Yes, by Chick and John, among others.

676
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,400
Well, no, in subgenius land,

677
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,080
Reverend Nikki has traditionally dressed up

678
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,600
in a S&M nun outfit and had people...

679
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:14,080
And slavering subgeniuses fought to confess to her.

680
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,420
Yeah, they come up here and they would confess.

681
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,660
And it was usually things like,

682
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,700
oh, I have a job,

683
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,560
as if that was some terrible sin.

684
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,540
We understand.

685
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,760
We all know that we all have to have jobs.

686
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,200
I have to have a job for Bob.

687
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,680
I can't quit my job and slack off.

688
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,920
And my job, of course, is avoiding having a job,

689
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,320
which occupies all my time.

690
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:36,640
That's full time. Yeah.

691
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,260
Either eternal work or eternal vacation,

692
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,880
depending on how you look at it.

693
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,020
Oh.

694
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,220
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

695
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,920
as we go along,

696
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:50,020
we're going to explore some of the inner things of subgenius.

697
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,300
You'll be drawn into the deeper things of Bob.

698
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,020
Just keep listening as we make these historic recordings.

699
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,100
Well, they know they can just download this stuff later.

700
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,320
Well, of course they can.

701
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,640
I mean, talking to the people...

702
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,460
In an air-conditioned spot.

703
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,180
...who are listening to the recordings.

704
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,660
You know, we're not speaking to people present,

705
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,140
but to future generations.

706
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,620
Well, it looks like Modemak has an announcement.

707
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:13,960
Oh.

708
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,420
He's just got a...

709
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:20,280
He's just making sure we know where the bull horn is.

710
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,980
Yes, the biggest bull horn of the woods.

711
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,960
Is that an ear trumpet?

712
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,980
I could use that.

713
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,180
I could take off these headphones.

714
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,140
Nay, that is a celestial trumpet

715
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,640
as blown when the wakeful trump of doom shall...

716
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,140
Senator Speck has brought Gabriel's horn.

717
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,160
This is what we were missing at 7 a.m., apparently.

718
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,420
Well, with Modemak, who needed...

719
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:41,360
You see that, sir?

720
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:42,600
...a solid horn sound?

721
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,580
Yes, I wonder if that would make sense.

722
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,460
Wouldn't it be a little better with those?

723
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:58,460


724
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:58,460


725
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:58,460


726
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:58,620
First, it is the end of the rice.

727
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:58,740


728
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:58,740


729
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,020
...you know how long he's got?

730
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,580
...forget往khas.

731
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:00,900
No munchhyun.

732
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:00,980


733
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,080
Well, that's why reflected that there are massive

734
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,640
generated Uniw chia.

735
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,540
The thing is, the only kind I ever talked about

736
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,340
and second is a rather useful

737
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,880
щagóum called the...

738
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,140
A bird, so...

739
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,340
Now, let's see.

740
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:17,240
Did we have some sort of a roster of slack appreciation scheduled?

741
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,900
A roster of slack appreciation?

742
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,440
Certainly.

743
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,580
Well, that's the schedule for this, which says that at 4 o'clock,

744
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,600
the beer and liquid frop and so forth tasting.

745
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,220
Yes, joy shall be unconfined.

746
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:38,880
That's the most important event of probably all X days since the saucers didn't get here.

747
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,480
We will rejoice in communion in the free fall of sin.

748
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:49,580
We can put ourselves to sleep and dull the pain of remaining behind on earth.

749
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,400
As we remember what Dr. Johnson said,

750
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:58,180
that a man acts like a beast to escape the pain of being a man.

751
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:04,980
That was also quoted without credits in the movie Cafe Flesh.

752
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,440
That wonderful pornographic science fiction,

753
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,920
epic about mutant sex.

754
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,120
That helped my marriage at one point.

755
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,760
Oh, it's a fine film, educational.

756
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,680
It should be shown in schools, churches,

757
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,640
all places where free-thinking people gather.

758
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,160
Yeah, actually, I wonder if I have a copy of it with me.

759
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,880
You can project it right now.

760
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,940
Then you can shut up.

761
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,000
Actually, I should turn on the friends, radio listeners, what you're missing.

762
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,240
You can't see the video portion of our program.

763
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:38,860
But that was...

764
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,360
In that respect, it's like the puzzling evidence show

765
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,180
where they watch a television show that you can't see.

766
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,940
Well, sometimes we watch television

767
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:51,420
and sometimes they say the television watches us.

768
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:55,680
We have the first of the gorillas and demons papers.

769
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,260
Shall we immediately share it with our audience?

770
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,180
Very well.

771
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:04,300
First, the gorilla of this bald subgenius.

772
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,200
My gorilla likes to try and destroy

773
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,120
American Tourister brand luggage.

774
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,220
Oh, we all remember that commercial, friends,

775
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,800
with the ape leaping up and down on top of the suitcase

776
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,340
and unable to put even a dent in this fine American manufactured...

777
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,120
In this case, I believe that the subgenius who turned in that paper,

778
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:30,380
Reverend Skull, is the gorilla that does that to the luggage.

779
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,640
Now, the demon has something different to offer.

780
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,540
He says,

781
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,800
I am strong.

782
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:49,020
He's saying myっck is a little more first,

783
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,020


784
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,020


785
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,380
In fact, that's true.

786
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:49,860
But he seems to think that per little head,

787
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,900
the gorilla had their hand up high before heightening,

788
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,420
the gorilla had their hand up high before heightening,

789
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:08,180
and the demon had their hands down early,

790
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:08,180


791
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,820
Right now, this will be deposited in our special file.

792
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:17,140
The World Bulletin Board will have all these confessions on it.

793
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,680
Hey, the Swag Shack is now open.

794
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,660
That's right.

795
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,320
You can toddle on over to the Subgenius Swag Shack over by the pool,

796
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:31,100
and there, under the watchful beady eyes of Modemak,

797
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,480
select whatever subgenius treasures are left

798
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,820
after the frenzied fistfights between Doc Frop and Seafoo.

799
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:39,740
Reverend Seafoo.

800
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,100
Seafoo, yes, over the subgenius tchotchkes.

801
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,580
But there still are some there,

802
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,880
and you wouldn't want to retreat ignominiously from Brushwood

803
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:57,640
without your own monogrammed Bob Mushtash cup or earwax remover.

804
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,060
Condoms.

805
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:58,940
Yes, condoms.

806
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,300
We've still got a few of the Bob and Connie-doms over there.

807
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,700
Now we've received another.

808
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,300
Another.

809
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,120
Another gorilla and demon form.

810
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,000
From Senator Speck this time.

811
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,060
Well, he even identified himself.

812
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,400
We allow the pleasures of anonymity,

813
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:17,160
but we're exceptionally gratified if you choose to tell us who you are.

814
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,700
Well, this gorilla says,

815
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,080
One time I ate some bad snake, and I got very sick.

816
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,300
Bad snake.

817
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:27,900
Wow.

818
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,340
Well, you know, chimpanzees do eat small pieces of meat,

819
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,160
and so perhaps even the forest giants.

820
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,140
The gorillas occasionally indulge in a little snake snack.

821
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,240
Good God.

822
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,100
The demon, on the other hand, says,

823
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:47,760
The voices in my head tell me to bake cookies for strangers.

824
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,860
Yeah, well, I wouldn't want to eat those cookies.

825
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,800
Thanks a lot.

826
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:57,780
That's the second form that we've received of the gorilla and demon fill out.

827
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,620
I don't know if there are any more forms available,

828
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,340
but if anyone wants to share

829
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,080
his or her own gorilla and demon...

830
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,620
I bet we get a devil one from Doc Frop that says,

831
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,480
The voices in my head tell me to lay my balls on cookies for strangers.

832
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:18,740
That might happen if he chose to be so naked, open, and revealing

833
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:22,280
in describing his gorillas and demons.

834
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,960
We have trouble making him stop.

835
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,240
But the thing is, you have trouble making him stop acting,

836
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,740
not reflecting on it or revealing it.

837
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,880
This is a different process.

838
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,320
We're not actually...

839
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,040
We're not actually performing these things here.

840
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:39,020
We're simply talking about them or, if you will, gloating over them.

841
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,300
So we're waiting for the rest of them to come on up.

842
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:46,940
And while we do, we're continuing to record for future hours of slack.

843
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,360
Oh, here come...

844
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,240
An anonymous one.

845
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,540
All right, let's check it out.

846
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,800
Shall I do this one?

847
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,780
Sure, go ahead.

848
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,200
The Gorillas and Demons in Your Life by Anonymous.

849
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,260
First, the gorilla, our simian friend.

850
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:21,260
And so the inner gorilla.

851
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,760
Now, the inner demon.

852
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,980
Clams, you cannot.

853
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,040
Less than.

854
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:28,980
Less than.

855
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:29,840
Eat yourself.

856
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,120
Yes, run out of money.

857
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:36,220
clams, old people, soup, catheters, catheters.

858
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:45,100
So these are what the gorillas and demons in the head of this sad little boy say constantly.

859
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,680
Nothing could be more healthful than bringing this out in the open,

860
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:55,720
in this therapeutic environment where we can all relax in the divine benevolence of slack

861
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,320
by laughing at you.

862
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:01,480
So continue to fill them out and send them on up.

863
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:08,060
Friends, as Bob said, I'd rather have the right people laughing at me

864
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,840
than the wrong people laughing with me.

865
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,700
Yes, an important distinction.

866
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:17,020
Those are the blank forms, are they not, Princess Wee?

867
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,960
Yes, if you wish to fill out a gorilla and demon form,

868
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,840
they're right here at the base of the table.

869
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,120
We have another one, and I believe it's your turn to channel it, Reverend Stagg.

870
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,160
Oh, this one's credited by reverence.

871
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,880
Saint Reverend Alex.

872
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:38,340
That's very good, and he is a saint to identify his gorilla and demon for us all.

873
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,640
You think you have problems?

874
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,320
My skin is crawling with parasites.

875
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,080
Shades of pea bear.

876
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:51,460
And the demon on the other hand, yeah, that's might gorilla.

877
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,880
The pea demon on the other hand says,

878
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:00,520
Garg, John Milton never wrote a poem about me.

879
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,720
Oh, that's not true.

880
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,560
You'd be surprised.

881
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,980
I might recite it, but it would take a long time.

882
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,480
Yeah, Dr. Howe can recite a poem about dang near anything,

883
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,740
even if he has to make it up on the spot.

884
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,200
That's the training that we get in Dobbstown.

885
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:22,080
If you can't come up with the song or poem on the spot,

886
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,700
Bob takes away your slack.

887
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,200
Yes.

888
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,440
Until you somehow transcend the panic enough to, once again,

889
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,460
let your creativity go.

890
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,300
Let your creativity flow.

891
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,160
Believe me, it's not easy.

892
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:42,400
Naughty kitty.

893
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,120
Naughty kitty.

894
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:04,320
Naughty kitty.

895
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:04,320


896
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:11,860
Naughty kitty.

897
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:11,860


898
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:11,860


899
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:11,860


900
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:11,860


901
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:11,860


902
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:11,860


903
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:11,860


904
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:11,860


905
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:11,860


906
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:11,860


907
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:11,860


908
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:13,880
bEEEEEEEEE

909
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,000
j premiers

910
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:17,920
As i did

911
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:17,920


912
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:19,960
In the beginning

913
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:19,960


914
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,480
What's the point?

915
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:26,740
These are useless questions you're going to have to answer.

916
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:26,740


917
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:26,740


918
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:26,740


919
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:27,320
That's it!

920
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:27,320


921
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,540
My�

922
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:30,660
subtitles

923
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,440
end

924
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:31,440


925
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:31,440


926
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:31,440


927
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,600
Naughty Kitty.

928
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,980
Naughty Kitty.

929
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,340
Naughty Kitty by the Chuck Hestons.

930
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,080
And now back to Starwood.

931
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:03,900
Yeah.

932
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:08,300
I was kind of a natural partner from Texas.

933
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,400
Do you have an accent?

934
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,460
My partner from Texas?

935
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:12,740
What?

936
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:15,580
Well, Philo Drummond was my original partner.

937
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:16,860
You're talking about Jesus.

938
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,480
Jesus?

939
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,280
No, Jesus is from Youngstown.

940
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,200
He sounds like a mafia guy.

941
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:22,700
Jesus.

942
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,040
Jesus?

943
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,100
No, no, no.

944
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:27,260
There's a lot of guys, but it's just a common name.

945
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:27,820
It's like Bob.

946
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,800
It's not magic every time somebody's named Bob.

947
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,320
I want you all to understand that.

948
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,100
It is the most common name in the English language.

949
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:38,440
There's always this moment when you become a subgenius at first.

950
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:41,940
It's like, oh, my God, I met three people named Bob today.

951
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,040
Man, something's happening.

952
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,300
There must be something to it, dude.

953
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,320
Maybe they're right.

954
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,820
I better go ahead and max out my credit cards and wait for the saucers.

955
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,160
No need to go overboard.

956
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,420
There's such a thing as a coincidence.

957
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,160
Believe it or not.

958
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,800
I mean, I know that sounds crazy, mad, and superstitious.

959
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,780
But really, there are superstitions.

960
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,860
There are such things as just simple coincidences.

961
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,640
They're more magical that way when there's nothing magical about them.

962
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,160
Because they happen by accident.

963
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,160
That's even more astounding.

964
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,480
There's no intelligent design at all.

965
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:20,280
God knows if Bob's running things, it would have to be a connect the dots design.

966
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:22,960
What else?

967
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,440
Anything else?

968
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,900
My main thing is selling.

969
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,240
Okay, one more.

970
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,780
What's Bob's take on the third eye, the second mouth, and the second ear?

971
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:30,780


972
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:30,780


973
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,120
The second ear and the second anus.

974
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:38,160
The third eye, the second mouth, and the second anus?

975
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,740
You'd have to take that one to Bob.

976
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,680
Praise Bob.

977
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,500
Yeah, whatever you said, praise fucking Bob.

978
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,720
Whatever that guy said, praise Bob.

979
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,120
Whatever anybody says anywhere, praise Bob.

980
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,600
Even if Bob kills us all and steals from us, praise Bob.

981
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,820
Ours is not that.

982
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:00,600
Wonder why?

983
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,480
That's what religion's all about.

984
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,100
You don't think about it.

985
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,880
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.

986
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,000
That messes it up.

987
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,140
Then it starts making sense.

988
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,720
That ruins everything.

989
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,240
You just got to believe.

990
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,980
Keep up the faith in Bob.

991
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,680
Keep the FIB going.

992
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,740
Irrationalize the hell out of it.

993
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,040
Bob understands, I see.

994
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,580
No, was one question up here?

995
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,420
No, Bob understands.

996
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:29,980
All right.

997
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,780
Friends, I've about had it.

998
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:32,400
What time is it?

999
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:33,000
Quarter of six?

1000
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,040
Quarter of seven, I mean.

1001
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:41,360
Yeah, that means it's time for me to fly and you to buy, baby.

1002
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,440
Because we've got the new subgenius book, the Bobliographer.

1003
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,500
And I know you all have Book of the Subgenius from the 80s.

1004
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:53,800
I know you've all got a dog-eared, well-worn, pages-stuck-together copy

1005
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,920
of Revelation X in your bathroom.

1006
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,960
But do you have the subgenius book?

1007
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,800
Do you have the subgenius cyclopedia of Slack?

1008
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:05,620
The Bobliographer, the brand-new one.

1009
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:12,540
No reprints from this, well, just last year I read the sneak previews and glued pages

1010
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,320
from it all over the camp last year.

1011
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:20,260
It is here and I've got lots of copies and I think it's only $18 or something like that.

1012
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,980
You can color the pictures.

1013
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,640
It's got thousands of pictures.

1014
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,620
We know our audience.

1015
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,240
And they're black and white and you can color them.

1016
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,780
So I think that's about it.

1017
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,760
It's not Frank Barney's birthday today anymore, is it?

1018
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,300
Or your mom's birthday?

1019
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,060
That was yesterday.

1020
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:48,940
Well, belated happy birthday to Frank Barney and the queen mom of outer space.

1021
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,620
And anybody else's birthday it is now or later.

1022
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,700
Happy birthday.

1023
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,280
And praise Bob.

1024
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,540
You're all ministers now.

1025
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,560
Dominie, dominie, dominie.

1026
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,360
You're all Catholics now.

1027
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,300
I'll hire our fire sign theater crew.

1028
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,240
Thank you very much.

1029
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,540
See you on the flip side.

1030
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,660
What kind of radio show is this?

1031
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,800
This has been a test of the subgenius early warning system.

1032
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,680
This was only a test.

1033
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:50,840
If it had actually been our sweet prophecy next day Armageddon, you would have been advised to tune to JR Bob Dobbs for help by sending out a quick letter to the subgenius foundation at P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1034
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:55,480

1036
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:09,990
And you had better do it fast, seekers, because July 5th is zooming up on us for yet another drunken chicken run with apocalyptic destiny.

1037
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:19,830
And you know I got a feeling in my bones and yours that this is the year that, yes, it's all gonna burn.

1038
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:23,470
Yes, this is it.

1039
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:25,590
And the good news gossip.

1040
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:32,110
The gospel of this ministry is that you can buy your way onto the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

1041
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:32,950
Yes.

1042
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:37,110
Oh, but you gotta have the right stuff, seekers.

1043
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:44,210
You gotta have that subgenius membership card in hand when you're standing in that line for the pleasure saucers.

1044
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:49,410
Even if you're only booked for a sky kennel in the cargo hold.

1045
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:53,670
So don't say you weren't warned.

1046
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:55,570
And you've had the privilege of being a part of the P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1047
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:59,790
And you've had the privilege of getting an advance tip off of things to come.

1048
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:04,150
See you on the saucer, seekers.

1049
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:08,750
Boy, you're hotter than a firecracker on the 5th of July.

1050
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:10,150
Oh, yeah.

I would like to.

1060
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:37,550
Come on, shake your body.

1061
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:41,710
Come on, shake your body.

1062
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:49,630
Everybody, everybody, everybody, shake your body.

00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:09,870
Come on, get up and move.

1064
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:13,930
Come on, get up and move.

1065
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:17,950
And shake your ass to this slap-roll groove.

1066
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:19,610
Come on, shake your body.

1067
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:49,530
Come on, shake your body.

1068
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:49,610
Come on, shake your body.

1069
00:58:50,570 --> 00:59:01,430
Everybody, everybody, everybody, shake your body.

1070
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:09,870
Praise be to Priestess Pisces, Reverend Vailor Trucks, and Reverend Angry Larry and others

1071
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:12,290
in Five-Fisted Tales of Connie.

1072
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:14,730
Thank you.

1073
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:19,610
But now for the Internet listeners of the Internet.

1074
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:19,610


1075
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:19,610


1076
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:19,610


1077
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:19,610


1078
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:19,610


1079
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:19,610


1080
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:19,610


1081
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:20,530
own friends.

1082
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,950
This is the kind of thing we don't

1083
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:25,350
allow the regular radio

1084
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:27,370
station copies to have

1085
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:27,870
on it.

1086
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:31,170
We're going to play the

1087
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:32,990
really rude and foul

1088
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:35,210
rant from 10X

1089
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:36,990
Day by the good

1090
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:39,610
Reverend Jimbo

1091
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:41,350
who I think had just come back

1092
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:42,070
from Iraq.

1093
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:44,010
Reverend Jimbo.

1094
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:55,810
You know everybody, it's been a little

1095
00:59:55,810 --> 00:59:57,890
while, not too long since the last

1096
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:58,930
time I was here.

1097
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:01,030
Not up on stage, of course.

1098
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:03,710
And, you know,

1099
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:05,750
I've spent a lot of time in

1100
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:07,230
the pinkest parts of the earth.

1101
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:09,750
I mean the very, very

1102
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,090
pinkest where

1103
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:13,790
where spirit

1104
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:15,850
and soul and slack just mean nothing

1105
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:18,050
to people. But I'm

1106
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:19,470
here to tell you that

1107
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:21,210
slack exists in those places.

1108
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:23,050
You can do it.

1109
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:24,310
I mean I did it.

1110
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:26,510
And I've considered myself

1111
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:28,250
one of the pinkest people here.

1112
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:32,890
But I did it.

1113
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:34,250
And you can do it too.

1114
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:35,530
All it takes

1115
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:36,810
is

1116
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:40,470
it takes

1117
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,550
a certain single-mindedness

1118
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:44,430
at times to just

1119
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:45,750
break through the barriers

1120
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:48,490
and realize that you have

1121
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:49,450
more slack now.

1122
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:51,670
than you probably will tomorrow.

1123
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:53,270
Unless,

1124
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:54,250
unless,

1125
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:56,790
unless you realize it.

1126
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:59,130
And appreciate it.

1127
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:02,030
When you, uh,

1128
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:04,730
all you really got to do is just

1129
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:07,670
grab life by the neck

1130
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:09,290
and then throttle it

1131
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,230
until it's,

1132
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:12,250
until it's just, you know,

1133
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:13,330
dead, dead, dead.

1134
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:14,910
And, you know,

1135
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:16,830
friggin'

1136
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,970
then you rape its corpse.

1137
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:21,610
You know, get your, get your kicks.

1138
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:23,230
Whatever, whatever gets you off.

1139
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:24,010


1140
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,090
Well, you know, I, I've,

1141
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:30,170
I've seen the living and I've seen the dead.

1142
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:31,390
And the dead don't put up a fight.

1143
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:31,870
So.

1144
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,670
Exactly, exactly.

1145
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:38,510
Yes.

1146
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:40,850
Uh, you know,

1147
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:42,830
and, you know, the warm,

1148
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:44,430
moist areas

1149
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:46,570
are warmer and moister.

1150
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:48,090
In the early stages of decomposition.

1151
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:49,790
Uh,

1152
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:53,250
and you can make your own holes, even.

1153
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,770
Fuck strange areas of the body

1154
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:57,850
that you never once thought were fuckable.

1155
01:01:58,550 --> 01:01:59,430
Nose fucking.

1156
01:01:59,650 --> 01:01:59,750
Nose fucking.

1157
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:02,430
Back fucking is, back fucking is easy

1158
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:04,550
if you, if you have the right sized knife

1159
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:05,650
and a good twist.

1160
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:06,990
Um,

1161
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:11,150
I, I, I have discovered on the internet,

1162
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,310
actually, uh,

1163
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:14,730
leg stump fucking.

1164
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:16,030
Now, I had previously heard of

1165
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:17,490
neck stump fucking.

1166
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:19,850
Leg stump fucking is slightly different.

1167
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:22,170
It involves amputee, amputees

1168
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:23,810
and, and orifices

1169
01:02:23,810 --> 01:02:25,150
and what have you.

1170
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:27,690
Is that anything like bug stump fucking

1171
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:29,830
when you take the bug porn where they get really

1172
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:31,390
like, sort of, kinda

1173
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:32,810
bad, kill the bug.

1174
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:35,070
Oh, it's slightly different, slightly different.

1175
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:36,990
It involves two humans.

1176
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:39,810
Tell us about how the worms feel on your testicles.

1177
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:41,710
The worms, oh, well,

1178
01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:43,710
it takes a special kind of person for

1179
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:45,290
that to get you off, you know.

1180
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:48,070
It's, uh, exit wounds

1181
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:49,910
are especially fun

1182
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:51,730
because it's, well,

1183
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:53,930
you know, do you like loose pussy

1184
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:55,710
if you're a male or, uh,

1185
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,730
or really tiny dicks

1186
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:00,210
if you're a female? I know that's an odd one, but, uh,

1187
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:02,130
the exit wound usually, you know,

1188
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:03,950
it's a bit wider than the entry wound.

1189
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:06,090
So, if that, if that gets you off,

1190
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:07,250
that's available as well.

1191
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:08,290
Um,

1192
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:12,090
I don't have any more callbacks. It's a lot easier

1193
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:13,350
for me to talk when you guys call back.

1194
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:15,330
You got bone chips at the exit wound.

1195
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:17,210
Oh, yeah, bone chips, you know, for that

1196
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,550
little extra tickler sensation.

1197
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:21,250
The, you know, you had the

1198
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:22,930
French tickler before, but now it's the

1199
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:24,330
Afghanistan tickler.

1200
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:27,130
But does it, do you buy the corpse flowers

1201
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:29,310
after you're done? Oh, not if you don't

1202
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:31,030
want to. They don't really care, you know.

1203
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:33,030
I mean, uh, it's nice if that, uh,

1204
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:35,010
if that, you get your kicks by

1205
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,270
acting nice to somebody who really doesn't

1206
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:39,190
care, which some people do. I mean,

1207
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,270
um, a long period of my

1208
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:43,110
life was, uh, a whole story of

1209
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:45,370
unrequited love, and no love is more unrequited

1210
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:46,310
than with a dead person.

1211
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:49,350
Um, but I've gotten into this whole necrophilia

1212
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:51,270
kick here, and, uh, I mean,

1213
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:53,130
I haven't, I mean, I'm going off on a tangent.

1214
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:55,470
That's, that's what I meant to say. He's trying to say

1215
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:56,970
he's not really a necrophiliac. Well,

1216
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:59,350
not, only on weekends. But, ambiguous sound

1217
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:00,010
by backup.

1218
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:06,810
Ah, yes.

1219
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:08,490
That's an exit wound sound. Exactly, if,

1220
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,250
yes, yes, uh, so. So you're

1221
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,270
not the only person who knows about this. Oh, no, definitely.

1222
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,450
Definitely not. It's huge all over the world.

1223
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:17,310
I mean, but to get

1224
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:19,130
back to my original point, you know,

1225
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:21,070
if you can find slack in death,

1226
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,190
you know, then you can

1227
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:25,090
find slack anywhere, Bob damn it.

1228
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:28,070
Um, Bob damn it. Praise Bob.

1229
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:28,930
Praise Bob.

1230
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:31,430
Give me another one. Praise Bob.

1231
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:33,170
Amen, brothers and

1232
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:35,210
sisters. Well, uh, that's really

1233
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:37,170
all I can think of for now, but, uh,

1234
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:39,390
You said too much, brother.

1235
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:40,150
Excuse me?

1236
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:41,870
All right.

1237
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,290
I'll leave this open.
