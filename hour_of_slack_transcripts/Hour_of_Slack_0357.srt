1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:05,660
Mr. Cooper, how do you find our little corner of this world?

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,960
Heaven, sir.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,520
Well, this week, heaven includes...

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:18,200
... arson, multiple homicides, and an attempt on the life of a federal agent.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,600
Heaven is a large and interesting place, sir.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,340
Are you looking for secrets?

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,960
Is that what all this is about?

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,900
Well, maybe I can help you.

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,880
Do you know what the ultimate secret is?

10
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,460
You want to know?

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,320
Laura did.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,180
The secret of knowing who killed you.

13
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,740
No. No.

14
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,420
You want to know?

15
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:38,420


16
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:38,420


17
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:38,420


18
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:38,420


19
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:38,420


20
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:38,420


21
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,300
I've got an idea, ma'am.

22
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,480
You took me for a walk...

23
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,160
... under the moon.

24
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,220
Under the sycamore tree.

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:08,120
The dark trees that blow, baby.

26
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,920
In the dark trees that blow.

27
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,020
And I'll see you...

28
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,020
... and you'll see me.

29
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,100
And I'll see you in the branches that blow.

30
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,600
In the breeze.

31
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,020
I'll see you...

32
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,000
... in the breeze.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,120
In the trees.

34
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,580
I'll see you...

35
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,020
... in the trees.

36
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:22,120
Under the sycamore tree.

37
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,980
Under the sycamore tree.

38
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,940
And welcome to the subgenius hour of Gorman Bosian.

39
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,420
This is the Will of Dobbs speaking to you tonight, coming more or less live from the Black Lodge.

40
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:56,680
And even though tonight's show is devoted to the work of David Lynch, we're not going to talk about Judy.

41
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,260
In fact, we're just going to leave her out of it.

42
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,180
This is the legendary Jimmy Scott from Fire Walk With Me.

43
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,740
And I'll see you

44
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,660
And you'll see

45
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,660
And I'll see you

46
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,140
In the branches

47
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,480
That blow

48
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,940
In the breeze

49
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,060
I'll see you

50
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,180
In the trees

51
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,960
I'll see you

52
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,420
In the trees

53
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,860
Under

54
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,400
The Sigamore

55
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,840
Tree

56
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:35,000
And again, that was the legendary Jimmy Scott from the soundtrack of the fine new motion picture, Twin Peaks, Fire Walk With Me.

57
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:49,400
It was in honor of that motion picture and the disgusting critical disacclaim it has received from people who dislike it for the same reason they like it.

58
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:49,400


59
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:49,780
If you looked and read the show

60
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,460
If youdaid it

61
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:53,720
I wanted you to understand

62
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,800
And you know, you could, now that you watch review two episodes of Twin Peaks

63
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,580
You might think it's high quality

64
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,460
You could be really lucky

65
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,560
Daringly

66
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,640
You could, now that people can't even own it

67
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,020
And try doing it

68
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,360
The fact of the matter is

69
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,560
That it's something you have to do

70
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,940
To reach it

71
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,140
And you can do just that

72
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,140
Dear listeners

73
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,940
We live inside a dream

74
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,680
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash

75
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,520
Three months later

76
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,620
While he was holidaying in Myrtle Beach

77
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,280
They still got way too much traffic there for my taste

78
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,260
Have you been noticing the buildup in traffic?

79
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,160
Here she goes again

80
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,400
I'm sorry, sailor

81
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,340
But that ozone layer's disappearing

82
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,840
One of these mornings

83
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,220
The sun's gonna come up and burn a hole

84
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,120
Clean through the planet like an electrical X-ray

85
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,180
Well, that ain't never will happen, honey

86
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,880
At least not in our lifetime

87
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,940
By then they'll be driving Buicks to the moon

88
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,600
Uncle Pooch

89
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:16,600


90
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,840
You okay, honey?

91
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,460
Oh, that woman's laugh creeps me out

92
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,300
Sounds like something I heard before

93
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,640
Sounded like the wicky witch

94
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,720
Just sounded like an old gal

95
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,540
Having a good time

96
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,420
I'll be at the lab, gentlemen

97
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,080
Anything we should be working on?

98
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:51,780
Yeah

99
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,500
You might practice walking

100
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,020
Without dragging your knuckles on the floor

101
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,660
Albert, let's talk about knuckles

102
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,960
For the last time, I knocked you down

103
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,740
I felt bad about it

104
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,780
The next time's gonna be a real pleasure

105
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,760
Listen to me

106
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,580
While I will admit to a certain cynicism

107
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,900
The fact is that I'm a naysayer and hatchet man

108
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,920
In the fight against violence

109
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,760
I pride myself in taking a punch

110
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,940
And I'll gladly take another

111
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,600
Because I can't do it alone

112
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,620
I don't choose to live my life

113
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,500
In the company of Gandhi and King

114
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,700
My concerns are global

115
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,400
I reject absolutely revenge, aggression, and retaliation

116
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,300
The foundation of such a method

117
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,160
Is love

118
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,040
I love you, Sheriff Truman

119
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,260
Albert's path is a strange and difficult one

120
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,760
There

121
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,420
Now the itching becomes burning

122
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,240
Heat upon heat upon heat

123
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,840
Silence! Silence!

124
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,800
I must not fear

125
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,920
Fear is the mind killer

126
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,580
Fear is the little thing that Next Generation has To Pay for this

127
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:16,580


128
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,480
Death brings total obliteration.

129
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,220
I will face my fear.

130
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,000
I am permitted to pass over me and through me.

131
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,280
I must not fear flesh.

132
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,580
I do feel a crispy ear.

133
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,320
Death brings total obliteration.

134
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,220
I will face my flesh.

135
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,820
I will be of.

136
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,600
Fear.

137
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,160
Fear is the little death.

138
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,500
I must not fear.

139
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,240
Fear is the little death.

140
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:46,860
I am.

141
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,020
The pain.

142
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:49,660
No.

143
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,760
Enough.

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,180
No woman child ever withstood that much.

145
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,020
Take your hand out of the box and look at it.

146
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Young human.

147
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,980
A more of your mother than we.

148
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,960
You will be.

149
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,580
No.

150
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,020
No.

151
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,820
No.

152
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,500
No.

153
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:40,900
No.

154
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,180
No.

155
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,700
No.

156
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,840
No.

157
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,060
It's a sunny, woodsy day in Lumberton, so get those chainsaws out.

158
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,780
This is the mighty W-O-O-D, the musical voice of Lumberton.

159
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:19,640
At the sound of the falling tree, it's 9.30.

160
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,200
There's a whole lot of wood waiting us here, so let's get going.

161
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,900
I thought I heard a stranger.

162
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,940
We've got chicken tonight.

163
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,480
Strangest damn things.

164
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,640
They're man-made.

165
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,900
Little damn things.

166
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,760
Smaller than a chicken.

167
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:13,760


168
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,320
They're bigger than my fist.

169
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,620
But they're new.

170
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,920
I'm Bill.

171
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,560
Hello, I'm Henry.

172
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,520
I'm Henry.

173
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,100
In the faraway world,

174
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,900
in the world of Pinky's Bubble Cake,

175
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,140
things changed.

176
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,600
I knew one thing.

177
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,420
I wasn't alone.

178
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,180
I could hear you.

179
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,100
I wasn't alone.

180
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,960
I could hear you.

181
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,140
I could hear you.

182
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:27,340
I remember you holding off on anything

183
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:27,340


184
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:27,800
but I kidded.

185
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:27,800


186
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:27,800


187
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:27,800


188
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:27,800


189
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,740
The time has farther gone than age.

190
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,380
I've been amazing to that world

191
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,380


192
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,380


193
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,380


194
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,380


195
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,380


196
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,380


197
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,800
You left everything anyway.

198
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:30,800


199
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,860
As he left, I remembered a piece of information I unique.

200
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,300
So, I have a couple common things for you to keep in mind Heartбуwer andạo,

201
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:41,980
see you tomorrow.

202
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:41,980


203
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,160
Good night.

204
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,080


205
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:17,820
Heart was stuffed in a truck

206
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,460
Beating like hell

207
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,820
Like I said before

208
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:57,820


209
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:57,820


210
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,180
Fat constitute

211
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,100
At theั่

212
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:06,900
Traits

213
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:06,920
Light

214
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,360
At the 00

215
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,880
The twins spoke.

216
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,520
The twins spoke.

217
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,920
Why is there so much trouble in this world?

218
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,180
I don't know.

219
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,020
I had a dream.

220
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,960
In fact, it was the night I met you.

221
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,720
In the dream, there was our world.

222
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,880
And the world was dark because there weren't any robins.

223
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,120
And the robins represented love.

224
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,580
And for the longest time, there was just this darkness.

225
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,920
And all of a sudden, thousands.

226
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,080
And all of a sudden, thousands of robins were set free.

227
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,800
And they flew down and brought this blinding light of love.

228
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:57,940
And it seemed like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference.

229
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,600
And it did.

230
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,500
And it did.

231
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:10,940
And it did.

232
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:12,340
And it did.

233
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,340


234
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,340


235
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,340


236
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,340


237
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,340


238
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,340


239
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,340


240
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:12,340


241
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,700
So I guess it means...

242
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,120
there is trouble till the robins come.

243
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,760
You're a neat girl.

244
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,360
So are you.

245
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,720
Come on in there, San Antonio, Texas.

246
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,000
What's on your almost perfect mind this evening?

247
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,540
I just had triple bypass open heart surgery.

248
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,180
And I want you to know it's people like you that made me want to get out of that hospital.

249
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,600
Hey, how can you out listen to this crap?

250
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:40,940
I'm sorry, Al.

251
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,680
For her recent divorce, shot and killed her three children aged seven.

252
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,600
Shot right between the heinous...

253
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,760
A local judge praised defendant John Roy,

254
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,920
but was dismayed to learn that Roy had had sex with the corpse.

255
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,220
What?

256
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,340
Roy's lawyer was quoted as saying...

257
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,060
Murder.

258
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,160
State authorities last October released 500 turtles into the Ganges

259
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,780
to try and reduce human pollution.

260
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,580
And now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floating corpses.

261
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,000
No!

262
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,660
What's that, peanut?

263
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,360
I can't take no more of this radio.

264
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,880
Sailor Ripley, you get me some music on that radio!

265
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,620
This is instant! I made it!

266
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,840
He was victim of a sexual assault.

267
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,400
Mutilation, right?

268
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,180
Who is this armed dog and fiksh?

269
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:00,540


270
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:00,600
He didn't go to jail because he couldn't lie like they did August of former president Ernie R이� Jewish.

271
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:00,600


272
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:00,600


273
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:00,600


274
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,780
Now, he's close to his death, we believe.

275
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,280
And?

276
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,480
He has two child chronic drug addict feels,

277
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,040
Rancho Rojo lapsed beam tables,

278
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,640
again a close pair of walkingitches.

279
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,080
And then he asked what I knew.

280
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,820
I thought maybe he didn't want a woman.

281
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,040
We'll be right back.

282
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,540
We'll be right back.

283
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:39,100
We'll be right back.

284
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:50,860
We'll be right back.

285
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,480
We'll be right back.

286
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,320
We'll be right back.

287
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,800
We'll be right back.

288
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:52,760
We'll be right back.

289
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,320
We'll be right back.

290
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,660
We'll be right back.

291
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:10,880
We'll be right back.

292
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,360
We'll be right back.

293
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,840
We'll be right back.

294
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,420
We'll be right back.

295
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:22,980
We'll be right back.

296
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,060
We'll be right back.

297
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,480
We'll be right back.

298
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,120
Mentally, you picture my dog,

299
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:55,980
but I have not told you the type dog which I have.

300
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:05,140
Perhaps you might even picture Toto from the Wizard of Oz.

301
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:17,980
But I can tell you my dog is always with me.

302
00:27:54,460 --> 00:28:09,660
I can tell you my dog is always with me.

303
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,140
Everything is alright.

304
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,420
I close my eyes.

305
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,220
Then I drift away.

306
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,000
Into the magic night.

307
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,460
I softly say.

308
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,300
A silent prayer.

309
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,620
Like dreamers do.

310
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,460
Then I fall asleep to dream.

311
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,980
My dreams of you.

312
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:58,220
In dreams I walk with you.

313
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:07,420
In dreams I talk to you.

314
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,740
In dreams you're mine.

315
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,600
All our lives we live together.

316
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,980
In dreams.

317
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,540
In dreams.

318
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,800
In dreams.

319
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:37,280
But just before the dawn.

320
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:46,680
I awake and find you gone.

321
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,300
I can't help it.

322
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,640
I can't help it.

323
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,720
If I'm not.

324
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:04,780
I remember that you said goodbye.

325
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,340
It's too late.

326
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:09,800
It's too late.

327
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:09,800


328
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:09,800


329
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:09,800


330
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:09,800


331
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:09,800


332
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,880
It's not that I need it.

333
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:12,880


334
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:12,880


335
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:12,880


336
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:28,320
Rain andны I think I am alone.

337
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,600
T Taiyihi.

338
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,760
It's too late if I didn't know.

339
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:36,760


340
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:36,760


341
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:36,760


342
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:36,760


343
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:36,760


344
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,140
And you're a Manly ghost.

345
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,140


346
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:39,780
And no woman.

347
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:39,800
Rain is timing.

348
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,840
For real

349
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,480
And right this second, you're listening to the theme from the new David Lynch film,

350
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,900
Twin Peaks, Fire, Walk With Me,

351
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,440
and try to catch up here on some of the other stuff you've been listening to.

352
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,060
Betwixt all the clips from the films, which...

353
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,660
most of which I hope you recognize,

354
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,760
some of the...

355
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,840
some of the less recognizable musical items.

356
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,900
We heard a little bit of Pinky's Bubble World from the Industrial Symphony No. 1

357
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,560
by Lynch and Angelo Badalamente,

358
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,800
who basically will be doing most of the music you're hearing tonight,

359
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,920
except for anything you hear from the film Dune,

360
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,620
which had music by Toto.

361
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:02,900
Toto!

362
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,940
We'll get to that little scene later on tonight.

363
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,060
And then Power Mad,

364
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,700
with a song,

365
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,820
that could only be called

366
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,620
Slaughterhouse

367
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,740
from Wild at Heart.

368
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,820
And we heard the poem that

369
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,960
the Hayward girl wrote for Laura Palmer.

370
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,480
Before that, introducing the poem was

371
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,740
the creepy girl

372
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,080
from...

373
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,600
Well, she was pretty creepy in Twin Peaks.

374
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,940
She was only in that one episode.

375
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,760
But years before, she played the creepy little girl

376
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,680
in Dune,

377
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,060
little Aliyah.

378
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,180
I think she may be in the mix here somewhere.

379
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,360
And then just a few seconds ago,

380
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,880
we listened to In Dreams by Roy Orbison.

381
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,640
That was the recent version which Mr. Lynch himself produced,

382
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,100
not the original version,

383
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,320
but from, of course, a blue velvet.

384
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,200
And we're going to continue on in this vein,

385
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,740
since no one's...

386
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,880
has been able to stop me yet.

387
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,980
I'm going to keep on, so stay tuned for more lynchness

388
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,360
on your Hour of Slack.

389
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,920
I mean, gormanbozia.

390
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,620
Move up.

391
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,660
Put the pick in there, Pete.

392
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,080
And turn it around real neat.

393
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,400
Mm-mm.

394
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,800
You are so beautiful, my Baron.

395
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,140
Your skin, love to me.

396
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:34,440
Your disease is lovingly cared for for all eternity.

397
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,740
Yeah!

398
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,700
Yeah!

399
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:17,140
Because spread diseases are the result of a juicy rat.

400
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,180
Yeah!

401
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,900
What do you want to do?

402
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,960
I'm doing it.

403
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,080
Are you a bad boy?

404
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,460
What do you mean?

405
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,560
Do you want to do bad things?

406
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:42,940
Anything?

407
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,000
Anything?

408
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,680
What do you want?

409
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,920
I want you to hurt me.

410
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:53,880
No.

411
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,100
I don't want to hurt you. I told you I want to help you.

412
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,960
Dorothy, I know something's happening.

413
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,420
Frank has your husband and son, doesn't he?

414
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,720
If you're going to do something, go to the police.

415
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,360
No police.

416
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,820
No police.

417
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,140
Don't hit me!

418
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,400
No! No!

419
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,360
Get away! Get away from that bed!

420
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,320
Get away!

421
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,920
Seven anxious men have died, but it isn't the night before...

422
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:53,920


423
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:53,920


424
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:53,920


425
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:53,960
There's no reason for you to fear the coxswain.

426
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:53,960


427
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,560
Bob I like Boise.

428
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,660
If demons allowed itself to get out, the Prient will исome.

429
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:55,700
His son.

430
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:02,240
all i know for sure is there's more than a few bad ideas running around loose out there

431
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,200
you know there's something i ain't never told you about sailor

432
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:17,020
and this here's a story with the lesson about bad ideas

433
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:24,320
what was that well my cousin dale was always fighting bad ideas

434
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:34,640
see dale loved christmas we used to call him jingle dale he wanted christmas to last all year long

435
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:42,020
he sure would scream out when his mama told him it was summertime and christmas was six months off

436
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,560
and also

437
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:53,900
he would say that he felt those men with

438
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,300
you know

439
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:54,300


440
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,400
Black rubber gloves was following him around.

441
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,320
Dale said that trust in the spirit of Christmas

442
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,380
was destroyed by ideas being controlled by aliens wearing black gloves.

443
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,480
These aliens would get Dale to do all kinds of things.

444
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,820
Then he'd carry on about the weather.

445
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,740
Talk about how rainfall is controlled by aliens living on Earth.

446
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,460
Aunt Rudy told Dale that one day he would realize

447
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:32,160
that the alien wearing the black gloves was him and him alone.

448
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:41,580
Well, sounds like old Dale's more than just a little bit confused, ain't it?

449
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,480
Well, Dale was learning a hard lesson.

450
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,480
He got so he'd stay up all night making sandwiches.

451
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,920
Dale, what are you doing?

452
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,900
I'm making my lunch!

453
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,180
Mama told me Aunt Rudy, this is Dale's mama,

454
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,080
found cockroaches in Dale's underwear.

455
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,060
One time, she found Dale...

456
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,780
putting one big cockroach right on his anus.

457
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,700
Hell, Peter.

458
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,880
It ain't so funny now, though.

459
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,740
Dale disappeared.

460
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,780
Nobody's seen him since.

461
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,520
It's too bad he couldn't...

462
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,640
visit that old Wizard of Oz and...

463
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,840
get some good advice.

464
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,100
Too bad we all can't, baby.

465
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,920
Did you and Mary have sexual intercourse?

466
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:20,440
Why?

467
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,250
Why?

468
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:21,910
Did you?

469
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:27,150
Why are you asking me this question?

470
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,810
Oh, there's still not sure it is a baby.

471
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,090
.

472
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:37,550
.

473
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:37,550


474
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:37,550


475
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:37,650
.

476
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:38,190
.

477
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:38,190


478
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:38,270
.

479
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:39,770
.

480
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:39,950
.

481
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:58,250
.

482
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:58,570
.

483
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:58,570


484
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:04,950
I'm alone.

485
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,070
.

486
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:07,170
.

487
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:07,610
.

488
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:07,750
.

489
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:07,830
.

490
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:07,890
.

491
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:07,930
.

492
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:07,950
.

493
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:07,970
.

494
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:07,990
.

495
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,010
.

496
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,450
If ever something don't feel right to you,

497
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,050
remember what Pancho said to the Cisco kid.

498
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:16,170
Let's went before we're dancing at the end of a rope

499
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,470
without music.

500
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,850
You've been doing fine without me, Pina.

501
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:39,470
There's no need to make life tougher than it has to be.

502
00:41:58,810 --> 00:41:59,250
Zahler!

503
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:04,290
Zahler!

504
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:04,830
Come on!

505
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:05,210
Come back!

506
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:08,250
Zahler!

507
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,090
What do you faggots want?

508
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:05,230
Zahler!

509
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:07,990
Zahler!

510
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:12,450
She's a good witch.

511
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:14,490
Zahler Ripley,

512
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:17,130
Luna loves you.

513
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:21,610
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer,

514
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:24,930
and I haven't had any parental guidance.

515
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:28,050
She's forgiven you all these things.

516
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,110
You love her.

517
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,790
Don't be afraid.

518
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:35,870
Don't be afraid, Zahler.

519
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:40,170
But I'm wild at heart.

520
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:43,550
If you're truly wild at heart,

521
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,650
you'll fight for your dreams.

522
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:54,390
Don't turn away from love, Zahler.

523
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:58,670
Don't turn away from love.

524
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,270
You'll be out of much trouble living without one

525
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:23,830
else by no extracted professional Cola drink.

526
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:26,030
All done.

527
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:30,490
Have you got anything to do with rinse,

528
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:30,770


529
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,770
Here's the face of aNTander for your Lebanon woman.

530
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:34,770


531
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:37,890
I apologize to you gentlemen for referring to you as homosexuals.

532
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:40,610
I also want to thank you, fellas.

533
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,510
You've taught me a valuable lesson in life.

534
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:46,970
Lola!

535
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,570
Lola!

536
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:38,850
Lola!

537
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,010
Lola!

538
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:41,010


539
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,070
Lola!

540
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:17,710
Sailor.

541
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,250
I just met the good witch.

542
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,110
Sailor!

543
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:39,630
Sailor.

544
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:57,750
Sailor.

545
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:59,410
Sailor.

546
00:46:59,910 --> 00:46:59,950
Sailor.

547
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:01,270
Sailor.

548
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:30,230
my dreams fulfill. For my darling, I love you and I always will. Love me tender, love

549
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:55,210

550
00:47:55,210 --> 00:48:00,210

552
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:30,210
love me dear, tell me how I feel. For it's where then I belong and I always will. Love me

553
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:30,890
tender, love me true, love me true, love me true, love me true, love me true, love me true, love me true.

554
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:55,770
Tell me you are mine, I'll be yours through all the years till the end of time. Love me tender, love me

555
00:48:55,770 --> 00:49:00,210
true, all my dreams fill.

556
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:01,230
fulfilled

557
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:05,410
For my

558
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:06,610
darling

559
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:09,870
I love you

560
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:11,690
And

561
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:14,510
I always

562
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:16,550
will

563
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:30,090
Does Leland know what you

564
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:32,050
have done? Leland is a babe

565
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,190
in the woods with a large

566
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:35,950
hole where his

567
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:36,910
conscience used to be

568
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:40,030
And when I go children I will

569
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:41,630
pull that ripcord

570
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:43,870
And you watch Leland remember

571
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:44,990
Watch him

572
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:46,810
But not for long

573
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:55,690
Now this Bob

574
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:58,050
can't really

575
00:49:58,050 --> 00:49:59,930
exist I mean Leland is just

576
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:00,270
crazy

577
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:02,730
Through the dark

578
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,190
a future's past

579
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:06,870
A magician longs

580
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:07,310
to see

581
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:10,410
One chance out between

582
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:11,650
two worlds

583
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:14,230
Fire! Walk with me

584
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:18,530
I'll catch you

585
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:19,750
with my death bag

586
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,250
You may think I've gone insane

587
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,050
But I promise

588
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:25,790
I will kill

589
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:26,610
again

590
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:26,890
Hey!

591
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:38,810
Just like a

592
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,750
woman

593
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:40,930
You gotta

594
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:40,930


595
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:40,930


596
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:40,930


597
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:40,930


598
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:40,930


599
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:42,010
a vile

600
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:42,030
and killing

601
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:42,350
Nine hundred

602
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:44,470
foot difference

603
00:50:59,570 --> 00:50:59,910
a冠 pode

604
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:30,750
I killed her!

605
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:32,550
Oh my god!

606
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:34,750
I killed my daughter!

607
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,030
I don't know!

608
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,230
Forgive me!

609
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:40,890
Forgive me!

610
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,430
Oh god!

611
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,150
I... I was just a boy.

612
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,890
I saw him in my dream.

613
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:55,850
He said he'd walk by

614
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:56,330
to play.

615
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:59,530
He opened me

616
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,390
and I invited him

617
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:03,350
and he came inside me.

618
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:05,190
He went inside?

619
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:06,870
When he was inside

620
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,770
I didn't know.

621
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:11,910
And when he was gone

622
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,550
I couldn't remember.

623
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:17,310
He made me do things.

624
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,350
Terrible things.

625
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:21,970
He said

626
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,850
he wanted lives.

627
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:25,630
He wanted others.

628
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:26,310
Others to be loved.

629
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:26,310


630
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:27,710
Others that they could use.

631
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,670
Like they used me.

632
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:32,470
Like Laura.

633
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:34,510
They wanted her.

634
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:35,950
They wanted Laura.

635
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:37,830
But she was strong.

636
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:40,110
She fought them.

637
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:41,810
She wouldn't let them in.

638
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,410
Oh god.

639
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,610
They had me kill that girl,

640
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:48,010
Teresa.

641
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:52,330
And they...

642
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:53,630
They said

643
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:56,730
they'd have me kill her too.

644
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:57,210
Then give Laura.

645
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:00,110
They'd have me kill her too.

646
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:03,610
But she wouldn't let them in.

647
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:07,990
They said she'd die

648
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:10,430
before she left.

649
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:14,770
Then they made me kill her.

650
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:18,310
Oh god.

651
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,070
I have mercy on me.

652
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:23,310
What have I done?

653
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,310
What have I done?

654
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:27,010
Oh god.

655
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:29,650
Oh god.

656
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:32,330
I love her.

657
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:34,430
I love her

658
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:35,950
with all my heart.

659
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:39,230
I hate you.

660
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:40,250
I hate you.

661
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,330
I hate you.

662
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:47,890
Leland.

663
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:55,350
Leland.

664
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,430
I'm scared.

665
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:03,010
Oh.

666
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,790
I don't know what I'm saying.

667
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:03,790


668
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:03,790


669
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:04,170
You're just appearance.

670
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:04,170


671
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:04,450
senhor o verbo.

672
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:07,370
Baronよ blind.

673
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:10,350
Vłodek otmarł swał.

674
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:14,190
We should go.

675
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:15,490
No.

676
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:21,290
Not to go.

677
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:22,750
Nah.

678
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,710
and abide in that state.

679
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:29,310
Look to the light, Leland.

680
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,030
Find the light.

681
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:34,690
I see it.

682
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,210
Into the light, Leland.

683
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:39,810
Into the light.

684
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:43,530
I see her.

685
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:47,370
She's there.

686
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:50,130
Into the light, Leland.

687
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:53,050
She's beautiful.

688
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:55,730
Into the light.

689
00:54:59,430 --> 00:54:59,810
Laura.

690
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:02,850
Don't be afraid.

691
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:50,050
Don't be afraid.

692
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,910
Laura, of course, when I say of course.

693
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:56,030
The end of Wild at Heart

694
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:58,750
and Leland Palmer's death

695
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:02,450
and redemption from Twin Peaks

696
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:06,290
are two scenes that always bring a tear to my eye.

697
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:09,490
And I think the reason why

698
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:13,110
the only happy endings in films

699
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:16,590
I really sort of can identify with

700
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,830
and think feel...

701
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:25,730
plausible are lynch ones because I guess because his people have to go through so

702
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:31,650
much to reach that happy ending and I think that's ultimately the reason why I

703
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:38,990
so enjoyed fire walk with me because it has at least in my to my interpretation

704
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:45,710
a happy ending for Laura Palmer which I would imagine no one really deserved

705
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:51,850
more than her unless it's me well thank you so much for listening to tonight's

706
00:56:51,850 --> 00:57:01,850
subgenius hour of Gorman Bosia sort of an experiment really just sort of see if

707
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:09,410
see if we could do a show based primarily on the work of just one guy a

708
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:13,010
lot more here I could have done and so don't forget

709
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:15,690

710

And it's too late.

722
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,410
It's too late.

723
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:15,270
It's too late.

724
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:43,150
It's too late.

725
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:10,530
It's too late.

726
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:17,030
It's too late.
