1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,560
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius hour of swag.

2
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,360
What were those noises?

3
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,780
Well, here's the recording studio.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,920
Well, let's get out of the traffic.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,120
No way, that's all it was.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,540
The session's about to start.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,700
Foreign matter that happened to wind up in your head.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,340
As we enter, we can hear the last minute instructions.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,560
We can hear the voices of artists, musicians, and engineers coming from the different parts of the room.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,680
Now listen.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,580
You walked in the crash, ran in a car, drove to L.A.

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,360
Why?

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,140
What a way to invade the earth.

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,380
How would you feel if tomorrow a flying saucer would drop a atomic bomb on every city in the United States?

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,380
This place is driving me nuts.

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,300
You and I are giving out a brain.

17
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,700
That's top secret information.

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,580
Nobody knows that.

19
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,020
What is that?

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,680
Top 40?

21
00:00:59,700 --> 00:00:59,980
I don't know.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,640
There's a lot of activity over there.

23
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,900
Let's do it.

24
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,440
Oh, sure.

25
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,080
Happy with a khaki sweatband, boat goat pot-bellied barnyard that only he noticed.

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,080
The old fart was smart.

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,640
The old gold cloth Madonna.

28
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,880
Dancing to the fiddling saw, he ran down behind the knoll and slipped on his wooden fish head.

29
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,560
The mouth worked and snapped all the bees back to the bungalow.

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,860
Mama was fattening lard with her red enamel rolling pin.

31
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,980
When the fish head fell, the fish head fell.

32
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,760
The fish head broke the window.

33
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,660
Rubber eye erect and precisely detailed.

34
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,360
Hair holes from which breath should come.

35
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,100
It was now closely fit with the chatter of the old fart inside.

36
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,200
An assortment of observations took place.

37
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,680
Mama licked her lips like a cat.

38
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,420
Packed the ground like a rooster.

39
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,100
Pivoted like a duck.

40
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,980
Her stockings down caught dust and dough balls.

41
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,520
She cracked her mouth.

42
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,180
Glaze caught one eyelash.

43
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,480
Rubbed her hands on her gorgeous gingham.

44
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,240
Her hands grasped.

45
00:01:59,380 --> 00:01:59,960
Sticky hands like a duck.

46
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


47
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


48
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


49
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


50
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


51
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


52
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


53
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


54
00:01:59,960 --> 00:01:59,960


55
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,380
Sticky metal intricate latchwork.

56
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,640
Opened to the room.

57
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,320
Ugh.

58
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,920
Smell cold mixed with bologna.

59
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,440
Rubber bands, crumpled wax paper bonnets, fat goose legs and special jellies.

60
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,960
Ignited by the warmth of the room, the old fart smelled this through his important breather holes.

61
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,580
Cleverly he dialed from within.

62
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:29,280
From the outside we observed that the nose of the wooden mask where the holes had been

63
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,300
just a moment ago was now smooth, amazingly blended.

64
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,240
Camouflaged in with a very intricate rainbow trout replica.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,960
The old fart inside was now breathing freely from his perfume bottle atomizer air bulb invention.

66
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,920
His excited eyes from within the dark interior glazed.

67
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,100
Watered in appreciation of his thoughtful preparation.

68
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,140
Oh man, that's so heavy.

69
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,660
And he was just like a little baby.

70
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,180
There he comes.

71
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,460
And it's time for us to go.

72
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,460
Alright, we'll see you later.

73
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:08,600
See you next week.

74
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,360
Just the show.

75
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,420
Yeah, I know.

76
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,860
Unfortunately, there are many people at KPFA who have been here 5, 10, 15, 20 years.

77
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,980
From now on we'll stay on the air continuously until this crisis is over.

78
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,260
And no one leaves.

79
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


80
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


81
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


82
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


83
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


84
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


85
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


86
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


87
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


88
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


89
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


90
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,460
We now resume our regularly scheduled program.

91
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,980
Everybody say, hold on to each other and say, praise Bob!

92
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,760
Praise Bob!

93
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,220
I don't hear that! Say that again and say it like you've got a pair!

94
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,780
Praise Bob!

95
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:53,060
And all the children are in sin.

96
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,780
Watch out! Someone's coming!

97
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,340
Quick, hide behind the throne.

98
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,680
Hey, Mo, can you see anything?

99
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,800
Not yet. Wait a minute. There's a man coming.

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,720
He looks like a king.

101
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,580
A king? Oh, good. Kings are smart.

102
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,420
Maybe he can tell us how to get home.

103
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,640
Uh, sorry, Curly Joe, but I won't tell you how to get home

104
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,040
unless you're a king.

105
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,400
Unless you're willing to go home to Bob.

106
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,100
Yes, yes, yes.

107
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,640
Friends, a small taste there of the 10,000 great new tapes

108
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,200
that have come in since the last show we did.

109
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,800
Including, by the way, a Trout Mask replica live.

110
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,560
Yes, that was Captain Beefheart in a rare bootleg live recording

111
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,440
from 1978, I believe, live at my father's place.

112
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,020
You won't be hearing that one all the time on your local radio station.

113
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,100
And a wonderful little opening barrage there by Puzzling Evidence.

114
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,960
Oh, but friends, you know something?

115
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,160
I need more me's!

116
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,060
That's right.

117
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,520
I need one to do 500-hour of Slack radio ministries

118
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,900
and work on the subsequent CDs.

119
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,400
I need one to preach on all the preaching tours.

120
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,080
I need one to do the internet.

121
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,420
One to do the Stark Fiddlesticks.

122
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,300
One to do this church magazine.

123
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,840
One to work on the CD-ROM game

124
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,740
and about three to do business.

125
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,480
And one to be a secretary.

126
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,360
And one to be a good dad.

127
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,400
And one to service all of the church groupies.

128
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,800
But, you know, more me's isn't really the problem.

129
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,780
The problem is they all have to work for free.

130
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,320
And if they were me's, they'd all be fighting with each other.

131
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,000
In a way, they already are.

132
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,000
The radio me was the low man

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,300
on the totem pole lately.

134
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,980
But I had to take him out of mothballs for this show, friends.

135
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:03,940
Yes, yes, this one show is hour of Slack number 500.

136
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,480
Can you believe it?

137
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,080
500 hours of Slack.

138
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,520
Not devival, nor internet, nor jobs,

139
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,820
nor months of debilitating sickness

140
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,060
will stay our blabbering mouths.

141
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,980
Friends, even if all those debilitating diseases

142
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,980
affect our minds,

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,200
we'll still be able to keep our mouths.

144
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,300
So let's lean back and enjoy this lovely, lovely

145
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,020
hour of Slack number 500 commemorative hymn

146
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,720
by the great subgenius, radio subgenius up there

147
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,040
in Portland, Maine.

148
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,980
Dad and the Seventh Day Opportunists.

149
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,140
Oh, yes.

150
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,560
, I'm a radio subgenius.

151
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,320
Well, there's a great old show on the radio,

152
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,320
and it's called the hour of Slack.

153
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,980
It's been on the air since like 85,

154
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,840
man, you'd think the host would crack.

155
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,060
He goes by the name of Reverend Ivan Stank.

156
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,280
He's a rants-fueling creature for Bob.

157
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,020
And if it worked for the show on the radio,

158
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,200
he just might have a conspiracy job.

159
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,900
Well, I've got one hundred two,

160
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,920
three hundred, three hundred, four hundred,

161
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,900
five hundred hours of Slack.

162
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,920
And if it worked for the fact that I got them for free,

163
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,060
I'd probably ask for my money back.

164
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,700
If I played them all like back to back,

165
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,540
it'd probably take me about three weeks.

166
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,660
I'm talking 24 hours for 21 days without a sick break

167
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,860
or taking leaps.

168
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,860
I hear all about the word of Bob

169
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,340
and the church of the subgenius.

170
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,400
And Connie and Jinger and KPFA

171
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,420
and all kinds of really weird stuff.

172
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,860
Well, I've got one hundred two,

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,740
hundred three,

174
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,400
hundred four,

175
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,240
hundred five,

176
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,860
hundred hours of Slack.

177
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,860
And if it worked for the fact that I got them for free,

178
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,980
I'd probably ask for my money back.

179
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,740
Well, five hundred shows in ten or so years

180
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,660
is a whole lot of radio.

181
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,740
But on the fifth of July, 1998,

182
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,560
they say the whole thing's gonna blow.

183
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,060
And when they take me up on those play-ships

184
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,380
and they pass out the bags of the prop,

185
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,420
I sure hope they claim them old-hour Slack tapes

186
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,640
so we can listen to them all the time.

187
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,700
Now, what's the matter?

188
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,260
Oh, I'm sick and I need a check.

189
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,520
We all know that fire loves me

190
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,740
Get up the next day and get up the second orange Heppi

191
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,960
out of the voit,

192
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:11,960


193
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,280
Get up the next day and get up the second orange Heppi

194
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,880
out of the voit,

195
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,940
and get up the next day and get up the second orange Heppi

196
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,280
out of the voit,

197
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,500
2100, 2200, 2300, 2400, 2500 hours of the slide.

198
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,820
2600, 2700, 2800, 2900, 3000 hours of the slide.

199
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,880
3100, 3200, 3300, 3400, 3500 hours of the slide.

200
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,980
3600, 3700, 3800, 3900, 4000 hours of the slide.

201
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,220
4100, 4200, 4300, 4100, 4500 hours of the slide.

202
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,200
4600, 4700, 4800, 4900, 5000 hours of the slide.

203
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,380
The nerves are starting to crawl.

204
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,120
Therange EVERYWHERE

205
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,500
THOMAS MORTON

206
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,060
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

207
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,060


208
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,480
CHRIS unfinished

209
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,980
Lами

210
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:36,940
You wouldn't believe me.

211
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,240
You wouldn't believe me.

212
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
You wouldn't believe me.

213
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,600
You wouldn't believe me.

214
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,220
Your nerves are starting to crawl.

215
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,360
Look, I know you're awake.

216
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,480
I want to apologize.

217
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,600
Or at least I thought I did.

218
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,080
How do you like that?

219
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:04,800
You don't care?

220
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,360
You don't care?

221
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,360
You've got to believe me.

222
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,040
Pardon me while I cry.

223
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,160
I don't see nothing funny.

224
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,140
Maybe I better slap your face.

225
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,480
You know what I mean?

226
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,880
Now wait a minute.

227
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,360
There have been a lot of mistakes made.

228
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,800
And we're going to do something about it.

229
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,540
But I'm not going to go back without heads dropping in chickens.

230
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,560
I mean it.

231
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,320
I'm already in trouble.

232
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,940
A couple of hours here, a couple of hours there.

233
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,120
Feels good.

234
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,760
Thank you, Time Master.

235
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,840
Who said that?

236
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,580
Hey, Ray?

237
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,080
I've got to talk to you.

238
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,720
I get the feeling there's a message here.

239
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,520
I'll get back to you.

240
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,760
Cool it.

241
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,500
What do you got on your mind?

242
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,440
I'm sure you have a dandy reason for being here.

243
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,720
So look.

244
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,000
You're looking me straight in the eye again, and that means you're lying.

245
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,880
What are you trying to do to me?

246
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,000
Cool it.

247
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,680
Stop trying to help me and mind your own business, huh?

248
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,700
Look, I've got to have the money.

249
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,700
One for you and one for me.

250
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,360
It might take a whole day.

251
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,600
You don't know the half of it.

252
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,160
Pardon me while I cry.

253
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,260
Hey!

254
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:27,920
Hey!

255
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,380
Hey!

256
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:28,700


257
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,260
Oops.

258
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,660
Too much.

259
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,080
Well, do it again.

260
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,340
Wait a minute.

261
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,460
Something's not kosher here.

262
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,340
Oh, now I get it.

263
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,380
My feet hurt.

264
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,520
I think I'm seeing things, too.

265
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,580
What does that mean?

266
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,200
Everybody has weaknesses,

267
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,140
and that means you are going to have

268
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,000
weakness problems.

269
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,100
Me?

270
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,300
You've got to be kidding me.

271
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,220
Who's got problems?

272
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,280
Have you?

273
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,620
Okay, then. Maybe not.

274
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,700
A gag on Spanish rice?

275
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,160
Yeah, I'm loving every minute of it.

276
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,140
Let her rip!

277
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,640
How do you like that?

278
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,620
Is that good?

279
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,060
Hey, how do you keep from frying your tonsils?

280
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,320
I don't like to sound like I'm bragging,

281
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,940
but I'm not bragging.

282
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,300
I almost got killed.

283
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,960
I don't want to go through it again.

284
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,200
Your nerves are starting to crawl.

285
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,360
What?

286
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,240
I never give up.

287
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,120
What?

288
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:50,740
I never give up.

289
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:50,740


290
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,820
Do you think this is art?

291
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,820
I thought it was a gag.

292
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,580
Well, you wouldn't believe me.

293
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,680
I'm not a gay.

294
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:58,680


295
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,900
You wouldn't believe me.

296
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,960
You wouldn't believe me.

297
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,320
You wouldn't believe me.

298
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:10,720
You wouldn't believe me.

299
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:10,980
You wouldn't believe me.

300
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:10,980


301
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,320
Your nerves are starting to crawl.

302
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,940
There's no sense in going on.

303
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,320
Thank you, Thighmaster.

304
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,660
Well, thank you.

305
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,300
As soon as I'm finished, I'm getting out of here.

306
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,220
Thank you, Thighmaster.

307
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,240
Oh, knock it off, will ya?

308
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,840
What are you trying to do to me?

309
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,960
Why don't you tell me the truth?

310
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,760
Your nerves are starting to crawl.

311
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,180
Your nerves are starting to crawl.

312
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,820
What do you think you're doing?

313
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,460
I'm not giving you the satisfaction of kicking me out.

314
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,480
I'm not giving you the satisfaction of kicking me out.

315
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,820
I oughta break you in half.

316
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,780
You just want to admit there's another side.

317
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,400
You just want to admit there's another side.

318
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,260
My side.

319
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,680
This whole thing is ridiculous.

320
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,840
Better watch those.

321
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,160
Better watch those.

322
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,220
Speak up, baby.

323
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,780
Are you telling me you don't love me?

324
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,960
No, what the hell are you talking about?

325
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,140
Huh?

326
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,840
Huh?

327
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,340
Huh?

328
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:06,340


329
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:06,740
That's a...

330
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,840
That'll be back.

331
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,880
I said my baby.

332
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,640
I said my baby.

333
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,340
I said my baby.

334
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,060
I said my baby.

335
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,060


336
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,560
Yes, dear friends.

337
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,100
A marvelous little mix there

338
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,180
by

339
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,840
Ray Brunel.

340
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,560
Yes, Ray Brunel's tape number two.

341
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,340
The Elvis rap.

342
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,040
And this is Ray Brunel's

343
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,360
synthesizer

344
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,560
twiddlings in the background here as well.

345
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,460
And let me give you Ray Brunel's address.

346
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,080
He's a media junkie.

347
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,320
It says here, and you can write to

348
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,340
Ray Brunel, B-R-U-N-E-L-L-E

349
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:47,860

351
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,180

03801

356
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,260
Yes, dear friends.

357
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
Once again, that's

358
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,100
212 and a half

359
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,520
Miller Avenue Portsmouth

360
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,380

And you'll be...

362
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,900
There's a bunch more cool stuff on this tape.

363
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,500
Wait until you hear the Tom Vu rap.

364
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,320
We'll save that for next week.

365
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,460
There's next week's stack.

366
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,160
And

367
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,680
yes, friends, as I was saying earlier,

368
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,660
the devil, the devil,

369
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,760
the devil has been trying to

370
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,880
stop our tongues from a flapping,

371
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,660
friends. Well, him or Jesus

372
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,640
has been. And, you know, the

373
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,240
most important organ

374
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,440
in a subgenius's body

375
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,720
is that long, thick,

376
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,600
red,

377
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,500
bloated, stiff,

378
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,700
about nine and a half

379
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,740
inches organ,

380
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,720
the tongue and the flapping

381
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,940
lips. And that's just where the devil

382
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,520
or the angels struck.

383
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,240
At first it was

384
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,080
just the recurrence due to overwork

385
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,440
on the internet, I'll admit it,

386
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,760
of preacher's lip.

387
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,600
Believe me, you don't want preacher's lip,

388
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,900
especially if you're a preacher.

389
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,960
Which struck just in time

390
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,560
for a month's worth of

391
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,860
public ranting appearances on the part

392
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,400
of your dear friend and prayer partner

393
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,800
Reverend Ivan Stang, yours truly.

394
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,220
Then, when I finally got that licked,

395
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,600
so to speak, it was the superflu.

396
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,660
Tube neck, Captain Trips,

397
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,700
and then, after that, the ultimate

398
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,800
sore throat. But I'm a-healin', my friends!

399
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,680
I'm a-healin' up!

400
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,620
Because I did what

401
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,680
Bob said to do. I cut myself

402
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,580
some slack. I ignored

403
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,760
everything for two days. Two

404
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,660
whole days, friends! And now, praise

405
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,780
Bob, I can croak

406
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,200
again.

407
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,580
So, uh, oh, the conspiracy

408
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,920
tried to stop me. They threw

409
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,400
a car at me.

410
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,200
They tried to distract me.

411
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,840
The conspiracy sued me. Then they

412
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,880
overcharged me for all the cures. But by

413
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,040
gobs, we bounced back

414
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,360
to fight the conspiracy

415
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,940
again! Yes! Yes, somehow!

416
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,180
But you know, as, uh,

417
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,860
as they say

418
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,460
that Moses

419
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,260
parted the Red Sea,

420
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,760
that Oppenheimer

421
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,200
split the atom.

422
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,660
But as our friend here in Atlanta, Steve

423
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,860
Van Jack, once said,

424
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,740
Bob Dobbs cut the crap!

425
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,900
Oh, oh, before I get

426
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,400
going, speaking of cutting the crap,

427
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,880
I have to make up, we made a little

428
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,820
bit of money at the, uh, sacred sales

429
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,880
table today. And in order

430
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,920
to, uh, justify these things, we always

431
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,060
have to start off with a

432
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,900
sacred burning of the almighty dollar.

433
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,880
Yes. We burn

434
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,920
if we kill Bob, we burn our

435
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,900
God. This is a real dollar here. I'm about

436
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,960
to commit a misdemeanor, probably.

437
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,740
I don't think you're supposed

438
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,000
to do this, but friends!

439
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,240
My friends!

440
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,780
As long

441
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,280
as the smoke

442
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,860
from this dollar bill is going up

443
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,920
to heaven, those aliens from

444
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,560
Planet X know that there's still

445
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,020
one soul down here worth saving!

446
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,520
Ha!

447
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,880
And unfortunately, that's probably

448
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,400
not your soul, dear friends.

449
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,580
But, uh, that's the,

450
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,620
from the thin recording of the,

451
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,840
the, uh, Atlanta Devival Tape List.

452
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,820
We have been, uh, traveling and

453
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,460
doing things, um,

454
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,820
uh, you know, they tried

455
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,600
to silence me.

456
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,540
Uh, permanently. Yes,

457
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,400
they did. Uh, uh,

458
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,660
and to foil their plans,

459
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,020
I had to silence myself.

460
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,540
Uh, temporarily. See, tricked them.

461
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,860
Because Niki will forget

462
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,620
you if you clam up for a while.

463
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,500
See, you can beat them

464
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,820
if you're sneaky enough. That's what it

465
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,780
all amounts to. And we did

466
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,800
manage to fly in under the radar

467
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,900
anyway. I mean, sure, it made me

468
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,980
a, a sickly nervous wreck

469
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,660
and it took about a year, but my gobs!

470
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,840
I mastered the internet.

471
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,720
Yes. I'm a

472
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,700
regular internet god now. Since

473
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,880
the last time I talked to you live, dear friends,

474
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,880
I finished the official

475
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,380
subgenius worldwide

476
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,840
website. And get your pencils

477
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,700
ready, because I'm gonna hurl you that

478
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,680
URL, that URL, that web

479
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,740
address for all ten

480
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,820
of you who happen to be connected well enough

481
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,920
to see that stuff.

482
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,420
Now get this, um,

483
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,580
I hate to

484
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,720
put it this way, but, uh, we

485
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,380
have finished and published

486
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,520
a 5,000 page

487
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,980
stark fist of removal magazine

488
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,440
in full color.

489
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,380
That's right, I said

490
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,460
5,000 pages

491
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,960
in color. It includes

492
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,320
the updated high

493
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,620
weirdness by mail, uh,

494
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,640
in progress, um,

495
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,920
with the secrets of all our rival cults

496
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,600
and terrible sarcastic comments

497
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,700
about them. Um, it, it has

498
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,840
new rants, it's got secrets, tips,

499
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,840
a hundred pages of interviews, it's

500
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,840
got recipes. The only problem

501
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,780
is, it's on

502
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,920
the internet. You can't take it into

503
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,840
the bathroom with you unless you have

504
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,980
a portable computer and a phone

505
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,940
line. You can't hand it to your pals

506
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,980
unless you print it out, and that would take

507
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,880
days and ten reams of paper

508
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,820
and three toner cartridges.

509
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,580
But

510
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,660
if you have that

511
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,600
computer and

512
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,660
decent non-America online

513
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,520
type net access, well it's free.

514
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,960
5,000 pages of new subgenius

515
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,800
everything. Yo, you can even

516
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,180
download games like, uh,

517
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,760
Kill Bob and

518
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,080
the Dobbs Oracle. You can watch

519
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,120
little Dobbs head morphing

520
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,940
cartoons and listen to

521
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,820
weird Dobbs hymns, and I

522
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,700
know that at least one in ten of you

523
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,280
have web access.

524
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,460
So, that web address

525
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,540
of the sub-site. Now this is almost,

526
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,760
this, in the future, this will be as important

527
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
to you as the sacred P.O.

528
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,820
box or the call-in

529
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,660
letters of the station you're listening to.

530
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,520
That website is

531
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,980
as they all say,

532
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:57,980
http://

533
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,780
They all start with that.

534
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,540
Sunsite.

535
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:04,960
That's,

536
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,940
this is all in small letters, friends.

537
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,400
S-U-N-S-I-T-E

538
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,640
Sunsite.

539
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,380
That's the first word. Period.

540
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,380
U-N-C

541
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,380
Period.

542
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,380
E-D-U

543
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,460
Slash.

544
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,820
Subgenius. And it's all in

545
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,920
small letters without the giant S and the

546
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,880
giant G. And subgenius does

547
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,940
not have an O in it, my

548
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,080
friends. Okay. That's

549
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,280
sunsite.unk.edu

550
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,840
slash subgenius.

551
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,680
And that's all you need to know.

552
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,640
Check it out. If you possibly can't,

553
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,820
don't forget to click

00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,140
Dobbs smack dab in the face

555
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,180
because if you don't do that, I don't

556
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,040
know if it'll work or not.

557
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,200
And that, by the way,

558
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,100
and that doesn't mean to point

559
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,040
your finger at the picture of

560
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,500
Bob on your computer's

561
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,400
screen and click your tongue.

562
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,380
That means you have to use the mouse

563
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,840
to move the cursor over

564
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,500
Bob's nose and

565
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,380
click the mouse button.

566
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,800
Okay. Um, anyway,

567
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,060
dear friends, uh,

568
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,880
we have been

569
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,560
in, in, ranting in Atlanta,

570
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,760
in Chicago, and in Cleveland, and

571
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,660
even in Dallas. Even in

572
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,860
Dallas, friends. And hung out with

573
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,440
the horrible rock band

574
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,700
GWAR. Um,

575
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,520
and hatched schemes

576
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,720
with them. Did tons of live

577
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,680
radio. Oh, oh, one thing else about

578
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,840
the internet I should mention.

579
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,600
Pretty soon people all over the whole

580
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,740
world will be able to hear the Hour of

581
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,640
Slack when WCSB

582
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
in Cleveland takes

583
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,780
the Hour of Slack and all its other

584
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,640
wonderful shows. Uh, Reverend

585
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,020
Cole's show and Lonesome Cowboy Dave

586
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,620
and Sadie's Pagan

587
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,320
Show and all that stuff

588
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,800
will be, um, on the internet for anybody

589
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,880
who's got real-time audio connection

590
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,920
can pick it up. And I understand that stuff.

591
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,260
It's working pretty good now.

592
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,860
Even on a 14.4 modem,

593
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,800
you know? Um, anyway, uh,

594
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,420
friends, um,

595
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,920
yeah, we, uh, we're, uh,

596
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,900
we made so many new friends

597
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,680
and new contacts, and

598
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,840
we glommed onto unheard of

599
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,120
new Jimi Hendrix bootlegs

600
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,820
and, and had record sales at

601
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,920
the sales tables and even made a buck or two.

602
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,580
So you can quit your saying,

603
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,860
oh, Reverend Stagg, that snob,

604
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,780
all he does is mess with the internet

605
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,620
like a geek. No, sir.

606
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,800
Since I got that website up to snuff

607
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,840
and made it public, I haven't hardly glanced at

608
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,880
alt.slack and have barely

609
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,940
skimmed my email. I've finally

610
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,860
gotten to the point that, for me,

611
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,760
the internet is only

612
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,940
another tool, like a

613
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,360
chainsaw or a

614
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,620
one-inch video editing suite

615
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,720
or a screwdriver.

616
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,560
I didn't go off the deep end. No!

617
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,060
Almost, sure. Made myself a physical

618
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,080
wreck, but I didn't let it get my soul, friends.

619
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,840
Instead, the

620
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,680
internet got Bob's soul.

621
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,580
In the genre.

622
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,820
Um, that, uh, no, that's,

623
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,100
that's computer music there in the background.

624
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,940
Where is this, kick-button

625
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,920
rock-and-roll stuff? This is for me.

626
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,460
What?

627
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,540
Yeah, that's

628
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:09,940
what we're doing here.

629
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,720
This is only the beginning.

630
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,360
This is only the beginning.

631
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,940
This is only the beginning.

632
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,440
This is only the beginning.

633
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,700
Pardon me?

634
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,820
I was afraid of...

635
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,880
I was afraid... I was... I'm sorry.

636
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:31,400
This is only the... This is only... This is only... This is only... This is only... This is only... This is only... This is only... This is only... This is only... This is only... This is only...

637
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,560
Well, anyway, dear friends, we do have...

638
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,020
Man, I've got so many wonderful new bands in.

639
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,460
Tapes of strange, unheard-of bands.

640
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,640
This one here is the great Jimmy Ryan.

641
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,800
Just pounding away with this heavy metal stuff.

642
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,560
In the background.

643
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,940
Something called Gut-Wrench Stew.

644
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,260
Jimmy Ryan also from Dr. Bizarro's band.

645
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,980
And friends, we've got takes in from the likes of bands you've never heard of.

646
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,840
Like, we've got Red Snapper and the Catfish.

647
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,180
We've got Abdul the Mad Convenience Store Clerk.

648
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,880
We've got... Let's see.

649
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,820
The Acres of Shankers. That's a great band name.

650
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,380
Ad Nauseam.

651
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,020
The Adolph Jesus Experience will be coming up.

652
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:21,940
Uh...

653
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:22,920
Uh...

654
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,360
After the Blast.

655
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,940
The Agent Cooper.

656
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,220
Aggressive Sheep.

657
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,240
Almost Drunk.

658
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
The Alternatives.

659
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,900
The Alzheimer's Parkinson Band.

660
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,940
The Amateur Professionals.

661
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,960
The Amazing Soda Bottles. Alright.

662
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,340
The And Then I Said.

663
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,060
The Android Gigolos.

664
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,620
The Angry Little Men.

665
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,860
They're kind of a strange punk band.

666
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,080
Uh...

667
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,060
Anna Otto and the Palindromes.

668
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,580
Anti Any and All Things.

669
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,720
Armhole and the Rusty Syringes.

670
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,520
Armchair Sadists.

671
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,780
Arnie Cooper.

672
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,760
Arsenic and Old Lays.

673
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,380
Art Deco and the Architects of Desire.

674
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,820
And Attack of the Five Foot Woman.

675
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,880
And those are just in the A's.

676
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,020
I had to... We got so darn many new types in,

677
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,840
we had to stack up the band names alphabetically just to keep up with them.

678
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,720
And that was just the A's.

679
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,920
Actually, that wasn't.

680
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,160
That was from the, uh...

681
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,640
That was a list of band names that you could buy for a buck.

682
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,300
If you're having trouble thinking of a band name for your band,

683
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,320
send a buck for one of those names to the Swingin' Love Corpses.

684
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,920
I took that off the Swingin' Love Corpses Internet website.

685
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,480
How about them apples?

686
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,360
Which you will connect to very quickly if you start poking around

687
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,800
in the Ears of Bob section of the Subgenius sub-site.

688
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:50,700
Uh...

689
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,680
Thank you.

690
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,200
Oh, for background noise here,

691
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,700
we have, uh...

692
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,380
The band tonight is called Limp Node.

693
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,380
I think they'll probably be called something else tomorrow night.

694
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:13,260
And we have no idea what is going to happen here.

695
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,000
That's the important thing.

696
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,200
Sometimes that works out for the worst, frankly.

697
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,380
Other times, it's the best thing in the world.

698
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:26,180
But we do have tonight some of the most powerful, hate-filled subgenius preachers.

699
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,080
We have Dr. Kitani LeGue, the most dangerous subgenius preacher.

700
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:36,700
We have Father Papa Joe Mama, the most, uh...

701
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,560
insulting subgenius preacher.

702
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,920
We have Sister Susie the Floozy, the sexiest subgenius preacher.

703
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

704
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,040
Whoo!

705
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,020
Praise Sister Susie the Floozy.

706
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:56,220
And we have the strangest subgenius preacher, Saint Janor Hypercles.

707
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,640
There will be a head-launching tonight.

708
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,820
We shouldn't...

709
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,720
We might even have...

710
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,400
Hell, maybe we ought to have the wedding ceremony right now.

711
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,120
Usually, we have the wedding ceremony at the end, but, you know, we might...

712
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,360
Maybe we need more...

713
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,300
We're going to get into some serious hating.

714
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,840
I wonder if maybe we shouldn't be sweet at first.

715
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,460
Oh, by the way, here's a suggestion someone sent in.

716
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:25,100
Um, you know, a lot of people like to have Bob Gobs' face tattooed upon their body,

717
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,700
which is, uh, wonderful.

718
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,080
I mean, you're going to be a very expensive lampshade in about three years.

719
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,280
But, uh, there's a cheaper way to do it.

720
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,980
Uh, you can have that actual face tattooed upon you.

721
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,980
Of course, the... your old royalties to the Subgenius Foundation.

722
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,420
The cheaper way to do it is just print the words...

723
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,720
I mean, the letters B-O-B.

724
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,460
Have those tattooed.

725
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,330
It's a lot easier for the artist.

726
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:53,450
And you can save money if you have it done on your butt.

727
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:57,130
You just put a B on either cheek, my friends.

728
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,250
Save you some money.

729
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,610
Never let it be said we were just money grubbers.

730
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,530
I don't know. What do you think? Should we have a wedding?

731
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,510
Should we have a...

732
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:12,970
Oh, no. Everybody's heard the wedding a million times.

733
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:18,430
Instead, I think we'll just pause for this word from your local amazing radio.

734
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,470
You're gonna pick it up and only watch TV?

735
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:19,590
When dad gets in a Raven's house on the T seetheyal.

736
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,830
Oh yes.

737
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,190
HARRIET'S CHILD

738
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:28,510
Use freedom and love for brotherly pleasure.

739
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,790
Theuffen

740
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,270
Alright, Cortes

741
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:45,290
Dear friends, it looks like I am now in control...

742
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:47,970
...finally. It's about time.

743
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,950
That old stupid show is over.

744
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,190
God, it was an old show.

745
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,130
And it's been so long.

746
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,670
At least it's not you talking anymore.

747
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,010
Now it's you talking.

748
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,890
Yeah, it drives me crazy to hear that.

749
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,190
But it's so good to be in control of a radio station again.

750
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,330
It's ours now.

751
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,650
They tried to keep me off the air in Dallas.

752
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,850
The fools.

753
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,090
They wouldn't let me finish my experiments.

754
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,730
Put this pre-recorded stuff on.

755
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,390
Yeah.

756
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:12,830
Like this.

757
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,330
You can tell that other stuff is old, but this stuff, this stuff's real old.

758
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:17,810
Yeah.

759
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,230
No, what do you mean old?

760
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,570
They just weren't cooking in the studio, so they put this tape on.

761
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:23,610
This was recorded before that last recording.

762
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:28,310
And it's only because we know that other recordings are going to be played in the future that we can make references to it.

763
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,830
The secrets of time control allow us this power.

764
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,750
The great power of the church of the subgenius.

765
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,750
We can even put music in the back of our voices.

766
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,450
Such is our strength.

767
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,330
Such is our power.

768
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:47,210
Such is our total in control of your control mechanism.

769
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,870
Oh, yes, that's right, dear friends.

770
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:54,990
It's a serious abuse of power here on the church of the subgenius.

771
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:57,690
Bob's lifetime fun house show.

772
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,850
Forget where the hotel room is.

773
00:31:59,270 --> 00:31:59,790
Geniuses.

774
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,350
Subgenius geniuses.

775
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,550
Yes, we've been at the, uh...

776
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:05,290
I'll bring the free food if you'll bring the botulism.

777
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,190
Geniuses.

778
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,650
Subgenius geniuses.

779
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:12,070
I'll forget my lines if you'll forget where the ballroom is.

780
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:12,930
Geniuses.

781
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,270
Subgenius geniuses.

782
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,770
I'll bring the fans if you make sure they're all geeks.

783
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,090
Geniuses.

784
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:19,310
Geniuses.

785
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,370
Subgenius geniuses.

786
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,210
Now, come on, you guys.

787
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:26,090
Let's not make fun of those nice science fiction fans over there at the, uh, Dragon Con Sci-Fi.

788
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,850
I mean, that's the reason we're all together here.

789
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:32,670
They thought that they were gonna get some sort of showbiz out of the whole thing.

790
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:37,170
Get some, some, uh, extra fanboys over there at their fan convention.

791
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:41,190
I'll bring the voluptuous vivid if you'll make sure they're talking to peni.

792
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:42,410
Geniuses.

793
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,590
Subgenius geniuses.

794
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,610
Now, let's not make fun of the geeks and the fans.

795
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:45,950
I'm...

796
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,490
No, we did that last year, actually.

797
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:47,770
I...

798
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:53,890
I kind of enjoy looking at those mutant girls on display showing a lot more skin than they would ever dare anywhere else.

799
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:53,990
They're not all girls, Stang.

800
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:55,770
Well, if I...

801
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:56,710
They are the third sex.

802
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,630
Highly illogical, Captain.

803
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:02,250
Well, if you can't tell the difference, what, what is the difference?

804
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:02,950
Uh, duh.

805
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,070
I mean, like, Romulan is no longer the official language in that sector.

806
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,090
I mean, come on.

807
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,110
Everybody knows that.

808
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:09,610
Uh...

809
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:10,910
Uh, duh.

810
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,750
All right, maybe I should explain what's going on here, dear friends.

811
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:13,970
That was, that was 1967 version.

812
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,950
This is your, your, uh, host for the night, Reverend Ivan Stang.

813
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,470
Uh, with, uh, special...

814
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,250
This is your host for the night, Reverend J.N. Hyperclay.

815
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,250
I'm gonna pull your volume down, J.N.

816
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,190
This is your host for the night, Reverend Joel...

817
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,610
I'm trying to keep some kind of control and make this a...

818
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,670
...a linea...

819
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,510
Down, J.N.

820
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,250
That's right. It's a radio station.

821
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,770
I've been up for five days.

822
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,830
Yeah, we know.

823
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,470
We've been talking about that for five days.

824
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,410
Look, um...

825
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,890
And I'll keep talking about it...

826
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,710
Now, wait a minute. On the fourth day, he was talking about how you've been up for four days.

827
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,010
I was over the last day in the dogma, you guys.

828
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,430
We're supposed to be doing a religious radio broadcast.

829
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,150
Doctor, like, you and Stang...

830
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:46,250
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

831
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,950
He was talking about how you've been up for second days.

832
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:53,370
The first day, he was only talking about how you've been up all day long, and that wasn't unusual at all.

833
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:54,090
It doesn't work.

834
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:56,890
No, when I turn up your mic, I just get this cute music.

835
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,770
I know that's not you, Doctor.

836
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,550
That's me. My voice is too murky.

837
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,450
That's the music in his brain.

838
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:08,150
I talked to Dave Martin, and we started talking about a skull farmer, and we didn't kill her hard, and we ran over his face...

839
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,790
Don't let's not turn this into another one of those kind of radio shows.

840
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:12,630
...any other radio...

841
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:17,770
Martin?

842
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:19,630
Hm?

843
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:26,830
Now, friends, during our last lesson, we discussed the conspiracy and the fall of New Manta.

844
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:32,050
And I'm sure you remember, kids. I'm sure that someone here can get up here and recite that lesson.

845
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,890
Am I alone up here, or are there other subgenius preachers?

846
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,130
Father Joe Mama?

847
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,530
Psych Changer Hypercleans?

848
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,790
Dr. Katana Le'Vue?

849
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,550
Is anybody here?

850
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,410
There's hope. Not much.

851
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:07,610
A subgenius came up to the dealer's table today and said,

852
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,950
Reverend Stang, I'm starting a new schism.

853
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:16,070
You know, you can't really be a good subgenius unless you immediately split from the church,

854
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,470
or a heretical schism.

855
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,290
But the only heresy in this religion is orthodoxy.

856
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,530
This guy came up to me and said,

857
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:28,150
I'm the high priest, my name, his name was Jesus. That was his real name.

858
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:33,890
He kind of looked the part, too, and he said, I'm the high priest of the Church of the Anti-Bot.

859
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,650
And our slogan is,

860
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:40,470
Slack can only be sold, it cannot be bought.

861
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,770
And I thought, wow. I immediately went, wow!

862
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:46,990
That's a great slogan.

863
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,450
Let me write that down.

864
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,490
And I did. Here it is.

865
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,830
But then I realized,

866
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:54,910
Plight, man. That's a horrible concept if you think about it.

867
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:58,650
That totally contradicts the doctrine that we've always had,

868
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:02,330
that slack is the one thing that cannot be bottled and sold.

869
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,930
And because of that, because slack is individual to you,

870
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,510
conspiracy can't tell you what your slack is.

871
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,030
We're not going to tell you what your slack is.

872
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,410
The conspiracy will try to tell you that slack is,

873
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,610
you know, towing the line,

874
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,750
going playing by the rules,

875
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,670
going to work, coming home, getting drunk, watch TV,

876
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,710
party with the boys,

877
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:30,350
and have a good time as long as you're good looking and your team wins,

878
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,070
and you're drinking Miller Lite.

879
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:39,430
But think about it. The idea that slack can only be sold, it cannot be bought.

880
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:43,010
Why, that would put a religion in a damn good position.

881
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:44,850
In other words,

882
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:48,150
you can't buy it, but we can sell it.

883
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:55,470
Isn't that how they took early Christianity and slightly turned it the other direction?

884
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:59,750
You know, all of a sudden, the slack wasn't greed.

885
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,550
You had to pay for the slack.

886
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,190
I'm talking about Christianity-style slack,

887
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,050
which, you know, I mean, that's good for some people

888
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:11,750
if you like sitting around on a damn cloud playing a harp over eternity.

889
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,350
Shit.

890
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,030
But there's a man here,

891
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,830
well, we think he's a man,

892
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,170
if he was at one time,

893
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,070
someone who can give me relief,

894
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,030
who can give me slack, finally.

895
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,190
Friends, I want you to prepare yourselves

896
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:32,970
for the horror,

897
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:37,190
the sheer cantankerous horror of

898
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,490
Father Joe Obama!

899
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,870
Praise Father Joe Obama!

900
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:05,490
As the dark cloud of subgenius destiny

901
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,550
descends upon the shaking world,

902
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,870
beaks, normals, and mediocritons

903
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:17,050
must come to grips and confront the one thing they fear most,

904
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,090
the face of death.

905
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,690
Hello, friends, and welcome.

906
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,430
The sermon tonight is entitled

907
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,430
In Doubt of Darkness.

908
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,970
Because there is a place, dear friends,

909
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,770
in the house of Jehovah One,

910
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,730
where dogs and his overmen

911
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,770
peer down upon the earth for them and watch us at work.

912
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:50,470
They keep track of every sin and transgression.

913
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:53,150
They record every conspiracy crime

914
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,070
and document every peak offense.

915
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,530
These unforgettable acts

916
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:01,110
are carefully recorded in a 500-ton ledger,

917
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,790
the dreaded register of works.

918
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,790
Our next date, 1998,

919
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,370
this book will be towed through space

920
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,530
along with the exosauvada

921
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:14,070
emplaced in orbit around the planet.

922
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:17,530
The mile-wide hands of Jehovah,

923
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:20,430
the so-called left hand of removal

924
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,270
and right claw of retrieval,

925
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,050
will appear alongside the book,

926
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,910
one turning the pages, the awesome pages,

927
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,270
while the other running along each line

928
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,430
to point out every sin and sinner.

929
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,890
The third hand of Jehovah,

930
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,070
the feared star, this shall appear,

931
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,530
holding a giant magnifying glass

932
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,710
between the earth bomb and the orbiting book.

933
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,570
As the right claw of retrieval points to each day,

934
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:47,010
the thunderous voice of Moses

935
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,130
shall call forth the transgressor.

936
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:53,330
As that sinner cranes his or her head skyward,

937
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,530
the stark fist will focus the giant glass

938
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,270
so that every sin of that sinner

939
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,850
can be read as they burst into flame.

940
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,770
The longer the entry, dear friends,

941
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,910
the longer that sinner burns.

942
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,510
Those within a five-lock radius

943
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,070
will also read the charges

944
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,370
and witness the judgment.

945
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,470
The intense light shall blind them,

946
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,070
the excess heat will burn them,

947
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:18,190
but they shall live to bear witness

948
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,670
to both crime and punishment.

949
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,950
Their empty eye sockets and blistering bodies

950
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,010
shall serve as living testament

951
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,610
to the power of the God of light.

952
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:32,890
As our planet rotates beneath the giant lens,

953
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,290
Jehovah will direct its column of flame

954
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,830
across the burning surface.

955
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,510
Judgment day shall be the day

956
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,730
that the sun will last for months on end,

957
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:43,110
for the sun never sets on his empire.

958
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:46,470
Judgment day indeed.

959
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,830
Meanwhile, among the ruins of civilization,

960
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,810
the exes and subgenies will scurry about,

961
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,450
flushing out the surviving pinks and normals

962
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,490
from their hiding places beneath the rock.

963
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,090
Those holed up in bunkers

964
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,250
will receive special incentives.

965
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,350
Spaceship loads of Zyklon B

966
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,490
will gas the remaining vermin

967
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,450
from their rat holes.

968
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,310
Pink's and normals' hearing

969
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,590
now is truth or die.

970
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,350
There is no escape from the justice of Jehovah.

971
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,510
Thou shall embrace dogs,

972
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,050
pay homage to him,

973
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,890
or perish in his light.

974
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:24,190
Now, there are some normals out there

975
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,550
who think they can hedge their bets.

976
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,550
They think they can live the life of the subgenius

977
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,910
without joining the fight against the conspiracy.

978
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,710
They might even send in the thirty-dollar love offering

979
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,670
in Etebab's sacred P.O. box.

980
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:41,270
But alas, these people are ash.

981
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:41,670
Ash!

982
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,410
For they think they can buy off dogs

983
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:46,030
with a lousy thirty bucks!

984
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,710
Dogs resisted every temptation, dear friends,

985
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:53,630
every temptation the conspiracy could throw at him.

986
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,370
A model of every new car,

987
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:57,130
a model of every new bride,

988
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:01,130
and a mountain of every known currency.

989
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:05,150
Only a normal would be stupid enough

990
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,010
to think that they could outbid the conspiracy

991
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,510
with an insulting thirty-dollar bribe.

992
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:13,290
Dogs isn't interested in money, dear friends.

993
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,370
He only accepts the love offering

994
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:16,890
as a deposit on your soul.

995
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:19,870
It's supposed to be earnest money

996
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,810
to show you're committed in joining the fight

997
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:23,910
to liberate slack.

998
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,670
Laying neutral isn't good enough anymore.

999
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:31,190
You've got to go to war against the conspiracy.

1000
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,370
Others may ask,

1001
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:37,650
well, what about that poor soul

1002
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:39,410
in some remote African village

1003
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,770
born enraged without ever hearing about dogs

1004
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:42,910
and his message of slack?

1005
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,190
Will they be punished for not sending in thirty dollars

1006
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:49,070
and not joining the religion they never even heard of?

1007
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,670
Yes, dear friends, they will.

1008
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,970
Only they won't be punished as severely as the others

1009
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,970
who had the money and knew the address

1010
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:03,990
but didn't send it.

1011
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,870
Because on next day, dear friends, 1998,

1012
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,670
all disbelievers will burn.

1013
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:14,310
Only some will burn a little harder than others.

1014
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,510
Then, of course, there's the bobbies.

1015
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:22,970
I could reveal the faith that's in store for them,

1016
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:25,670
but I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.

1017
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,950
That leaves only one category of people

1018
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,710
who think they can avoid judgment but cannot.

1019
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:38,230
That group is the subgenies with doubts.

1020
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,710
The otherwise sage subgenius,

1021
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:46,070
except for that lingering shadow of a doubt

1022
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:47,350
in the back of their mind.

1023
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,270
Oh, they believe in the conspiracy.

1024
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:50,750
They believe in slack.

1025
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,010
They've experienced both,

1026
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,830
and they know they are real and of this world.

1027
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:54,410
But dogs?

1028
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:57,770
Well, they're still not sure whether or not

1029
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,770
he's just some legend made up to explain

1030
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,450
what being a subgenius is all about.

1031
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:04,450
After all, there's no photos of him,

1032
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:06,310
only a piece of clip art.

1033
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:11,750
I mean, after all, if he really died,

1034
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:12,790
there should be a grave.

1035
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:15,890
If he really existed,

1036
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:18,090
there should be government records.

1037
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,510
Dear, dear friends,

1038
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,310
these subgenies are in the gravest danger of all,

1039
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:29,890
for they have no defense for refusing dogs into their hearts.

1040
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:31,430
The other subgenie,

1041
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:33,570
they had ignorance or stupidity to blame,

1042
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:34,950
but a subgenius has neither.

1043
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:38,050
They were given Dobbs' greatest gift,

1044
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,850
the privilege of knowing him,

1045
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:42,470
but turned and walked away instead.

1046
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:47,610
Oh, they were provided every piece of evidence

1047
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,050
one could possibly want,

1048
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,470
but chose to interpret it in a way to disprove Dobbs

1049
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:54,330
instead of substantiating him.

1050
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,210
Of course there's no pictures of Bob.

1051
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:01,130
Bob's a god.

1052
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:02,830
You can't take pictures of God.

1053
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:03,950
Everybody knows that.

1054
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:11,730
Likewise, there's no grave,

1055
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,010
because gods are immortal.

1056
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,690
You can shoot them and you can bury them,

1057
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:20,610
but you can't keep them dead.

1058
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,570
They're immortal. They live forever.

1059
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:25,470
Put them on a grave and they leave it every time.

1060
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:26,930
Everybody knows that.

1061
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:31,010
The government records of his existence

1062
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:33,010
is a conspiracy.

1063
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:34,430
Wake up!

1064
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,710
It's a conspiracy!

1065
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:39,750
I mean, they're never going to reveal the truth

1066
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,390
because their business is lies.

1067
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:45,010
That's why we call it a conspiracy.

1068
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:48,730
Oh, dear friends,

1069
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:52,630
we must return these Dobbsian doubters to the fold

1070
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:54,350
before they self-destruct,

1071
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,710
because doubts end Dobbs means death.

1072
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,790
You have to serve somebody,

1073
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:00,990
and if you're not a god,

1074
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:02,030
you're not serving Dobbs,

1075
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:03,650
you're serving the conspiracy.

1076
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:08,130
Now, we're not the type of religion to use threats,

1077
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:10,050
but imagine, if you will,

1078
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:13,090
the sight of your own blistering flesh,

1079
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:15,570
the smell of your own burning hair,

1080
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:18,190
the sound of your very blood boiling,

1081
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:21,090
and the feeling of your inner bones melting.

1082
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:22,930
Oh, God!

1083
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,810
The pain, the pain,

1084
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,470
the pain you'll experience in those final hours

1085
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:31,610
will make you beg for your body to burst,

1086
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,030
just to end the agony.

1087
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:35,390
But thanks to time control,

1088
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,750
every second will be a year,

1089
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:40,010
and every minute a millennium.

1090
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:45,830
To believe in Dobbs means you will forever have slack.

1091
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:49,170
A real subgenius can never be convinced otherwise.

1092
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,650
If you worry about your fate,

1093
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,510
even just a minute micron,

1094
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:56,930
then you should worry a lot,

1095
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:00,050
because if you are truly a true subgenius,

1096
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,010
you know it, you feel it, you exude slack.

1097
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,610
But if you have doubts in Dobbs,

1098
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:07,790
you're toast.

1099
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:11,070
You might as well just buy marshmallows

1100
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:12,790
and stick them on the ends of your fingers,

1101
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,290
because you're gonna burn, baby, you're gonna burn!

1102
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:20,450
You're gonna fry, you're gonna stew in your own juices,

1103
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:22,010
unless you change!

1104
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:24,990
Now is the time

1105
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:26,910
to get off the ground.

1106
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:30,050
Join Bob Dobbs and bathe in his bliss,

1107
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,330
or reject him and perish in pain.

1108
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:35,350
It's your choice, and you alone must make it.

1109
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,650
But time is running out.

1110
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:40,370
Herein is the word of all three Bob!

1111
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:41,330
Amen!

1112
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:46,630
Oh, lordy, lordy, lordy.

1113
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,790
It's, uh, Father Joe Mama.

1114
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:49,850
Oh.

1115
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:51,570
What?

1116
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:53,810
Cheap, tanked, racked collections

1117
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:55,250
are available at the dealer's table.

1118
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,370
Oh, yes, that's right.

1119
00:47:56,370 --> 00:48:00,450
Dear friends, the great, the great Father Joe Mama,

1120
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:01,470
and, uh,

1121
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,390
oh, I don't even know what next.

1122
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:07,210
There's so much tape I could pack into this.

1123
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:10,170
We've got amazing Dr. Legume Rance,

1124
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:14,770
but let's see what lovely sister Susie the Floozy

1125
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:16,370
has going on over there at WREK

1126
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,850
on the Bob Slacktime Funhouse.

1127
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:19,470
1974.

1128
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:21,430
Uh-oh.

1129
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:23,630
The future.

1130
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:25,370
Is the year that they are now planning

1131
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:28,930
for sex on the streets

1132
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:32,190
in every major city from coast to coast.

1133
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:33,850
1974, did he say?

1134
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,170
And get ready for a shock.

1135
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:35,330
I can't wait.

1136
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:39,070
The music that they're planning to use

1137
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:41,090
to crumble the morals of America

1138
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,590
is this rotten, filthy, dirty,

1139
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:47,210
lewd, lascivious junk called rock and roll.

1140
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:50,890
God help you compromising creatures

1141
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:54,110
who allow this rock beat in your pulpit on Sunday morning

1142
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:55,570
because they got Jesus saved.

1143
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:55,650
And it's the same thing.

1144
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:55,750
It's the same thing,

1145
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:55,850
but the truth is

1146
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:56,390
that it's got a lot of things tied to it.

1147
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:58,810
It isn't just the lyrics.

1148
00:48:58,910 --> 00:48:59,710
It's the beat.

1149
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:03,590
I preach into my conversion story,

1150
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:04,350
which you can get,

1151
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:07,310
how this beat gets them.

1152
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:09,590
400 teenage girls in Detroit interviewed

1153
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,490
as to why they had illegitimate babies.

1154
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,330
It's not just the words,

1155
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:14,090
the beat.

1156
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:16,810
The fertility rates of the jungles

1157
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:17,990
are the same beats

1158
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:21,070
incorporated in this modern rock.

1159
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:21,970
Just screw them up.

1160
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:27,470
You're not hearing from a preacher now.

1161
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:30,030
You're hearing from the leader of the White Panthers

1162
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:33,290
planning a revolution, a sexual revolution by 74.

1163
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,530
And all through rock music.

1164
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:38,350
Don't you dare defend it.

1165
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:41,010
I'll tell you, I'm brokenhearted.

1166
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:45,090
In my citywide crusade, I can preach against immorality, sex.

1167
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:47,150
I can preach against liquor.

1168
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:48,710
I can preach against tobacco.

1169
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:49,570
Name it!

1170
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:51,490
They take it.

1171
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:54,190
I've had two churches pull out of my crusades already

1172
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,350
because I hit on rock and roll music.

1173
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:59,570
Well, if it makes the devil that mad,

1174
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:00,610
there has to be something wrong.

1175
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:07,350
Our message is one, and that is freedom.

1176
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,610
For the first time in America,

1177
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,390
we have a generation of visionary maniacs,

1178
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:15,550
white mother, country, dope, rock and roll freaks

1179
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,890
who are ready to kick out the jams, all the jams.

1180
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:21,810
Our program of rock and roll.

1181
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:25,110
Not the waltz, not the polka, rock and roll.

1182
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,730
And sex in the streets

1183
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:30,210
is a program of total freedom for everyone.

1184
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:32,650
We are totally committed to carrying out our program.

1185
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:33,770
We breathe revolution.

1186
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:36,970
We are LSD-driven maniacs in the universe.

1187
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:39,290
We'll do anything we can to drive people crazy

1188
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:40,630
out of their heads, into their bodies.

1189
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:41,610
It's for grammar.

1190
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:45,890
Rock and roll music.

1191
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:47,870
It is a spearhead.

1192
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:48,530
It's a spearhead of our path

1193
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:52,610
because it's so effective and so much fun.

1194
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:56,150
Nobody would stop and talk to me today.

1195
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:56,710
How you doing?

1196
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:57,650
I'm doing fine.

1197
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:58,790
What's the meaning of life?

1198
00:50:58,970 --> 00:50:59,890
Inhale and exhale.

1199
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:01,510
Life is living.

1200
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,350
Life is all about love.

1201
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:04,750
What are you hitting him for?

1202
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:09,250
We just came back from the Cicada Theater.

1203
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,710
You know, someone has suggested, you know,

1204
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:14,010
that people do spend a lot of time making love

1205
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:15,410
and they expend a lot of energy

1206
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:16,770
and that if they could do something,

1207
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:17,870
if couples could do something,

1208
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:19,550
while they were having sex,

1209
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:22,070
can you think of anything to do during sex

1210
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:23,350
that would be productive?

1211
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:24,850
Eat. That isn't productive.

1212
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,030
How about making hamburger patties?

1213
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:29,230
I couldn't do that.

1214
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:30,210
Not while I'm there. Huh?

1215
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:31,910
Really, if it was a pound of hamburger,

1216
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:32,650
just to your left?

1217
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:33,410
I couldn't concentrate.

1218
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:34,530
Whenever I'm making love,

1219
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:35,890
I have to concentrate on what I'm doing,

1220
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:37,110
not the hamburger patties.

1221
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:39,090
If I gave you two pounds of hamburger,

1222
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:41,870
would you go home tonight and, if you do make love,

1223
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:43,150
make some hamburger patties

1224
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,210
and then I'll try and sell them, let's say, to McDonald's?

1225
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,650
How much money would I get out of this?

1226
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:47,870
What?

1227
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:49,130
What would I get to profit?

1228
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:51,670
Well, let's say if you could make 100 bucks a night

1229
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:52,590
making hamburger...

1230
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,290
I'd make the shit out of hamburger patties.

1231
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:59,150
Well, I mean, I wouldn't be concentrating on my woman.

1232
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:00,470
I'd be concentrating on making money.

1233
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:02,030
What would be the best position?

1234
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:02,970
The dog position.

1235
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,670
Well, then where would the hamburger be?

1236
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:05,710
I guess on her back.

1237
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:07,810
So, obviously, the longer I last,

1238
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:09,410
the more hamburger patties we get, right?

1239
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:11,310
Have you made hamburger patties like this before?

1240
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,190
No. No, hell no.

1241
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:13,790
How about you?

1242
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:14,650
No.

1243
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:16,670
You know, you could put it like...

1244
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:17,390
Can I ask you a question? Yeah.

1245
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:18,450
What's the purpose of this?

1246
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,170
I'm trying to find out the meaning of life.

1247
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:21,870
Have anybody ever flicked your bitch?

1248
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:24,170
Wouldn't this turn you on as you were making love

1249
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:26,030
to know that he was making hamburgers on your back?

1250
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:26,350
Yeah.

1251
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,310
What's wrong? You're looking at her in a straightaway...

1252
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:31,450
I was thinking, you know, I was trying to figure all this out, you know?

1253
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:34,110
We're gonna make this a real situation, right?

1254
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:36,350
And what I'd like to do, because if this works out,

1255
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,390
we're gonna try and make some commercials.

1256
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:39,750
We'd like to just film you.

1257
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:40,890
Yeah. Why not?

1258
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,590
I mean, it's slick to me, guys.

1259
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:46,530
Now, would you be at all nervous if there also was a dog involved?

1260
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:47,010
Yeah.

1261
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:49,490
Oh.

1262
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:54,150
Oh, howdy-do, Seekers.

1263
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:58,930
Oh, welcome to Bob's Slacktime Funhouse.

1264
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:04,410
I'm the rapidly rotating, righteously irreverent Reverend Susie the Floozy.

1265
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:08,050
And, hey, you look like you need to unwind.

1266
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,950
Here, let me loosen your collar.

1267
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:14,210
There. Doesn't that feel better?

1268
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:17,310
Now, get out of that bulky race.

1269
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:18,130
I'm gonna get you a new suit.

1270
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,390
Oh, what a week, Seekers.

1271
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:23,670
In this climate of hysteria,

1272
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:27,670
don't think the full story about the Branch Bob Dobson involvement

1273
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:30,170
in that Oklahoma thing will ever come out.

1274
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:34,610
It was just a couple of goofuses who were going into the Federal Building

1275
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:38,470
to slip a Bob virus into the IRS computer mainframes.

1276
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:42,990
And the one in the GM truck rear-ended the guy in the Ford Pinto.

1277
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,390
What a sap foo.

1278
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:47,370
Oh, this colloquial thing.

1279
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:50,010
The colossal monkey ranch has made things really unpredictable.

1280
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:53,530
But one thing will definitely come out of this.

1281
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:57,630
The Republicrat repression machine is going to gather more steam

1282
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,450
than ever from this little incident.

1283
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,690
Oh, what a stroke of luck for them.

1284
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:04,350
I bet they can't believe it.

1285
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:08,890
It's goosed their plans for domination ahead beyond their wildest dreams.

1286
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:14,290
Now, nothing stands in the way to stop their police state juggernaut.

1287
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:17,510
And the most draconian measures will seem reasonable

1288
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:21,750
to the paranoid media fear-imprinted American electorate.

1289
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:23,930
They'll love them for it.

1290
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,410
Oh, I was thinking that until X-Day I could weather this storm,

1291
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:29,950
but now I'm not so sure.

1292
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:33,690
A couple times a conspiracy's veil has slipped,

1293
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,490
and I've seen the writing on the wall.

1294
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:38,530
And the words belong to them.

1295
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:44,270
Oh, we went to see Faster Pussycat Kill Kill again the other day.

1296
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:44,270


1297
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:47,210
We stopped at a bookstore across the street first.

1298
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:50,130
And while Reverend Rex hit the magazines,

1299
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:54,130
I went trolling for a copy of Revelation X with Brother Marcus.

1300
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:57,430
And we couldn't find one.

1301
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:04,890
It wasn't filed under psychology, the arts, self-help.

1302
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:09,330
If that wasn't it, what isn't what it is, I don't know what it is.

1303
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:12,950
It wasn't under sexuality, literature, poetry.

1304
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:15,870
We gave it a chance. We looked everywhere.

1305
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:20,570
It wasn't even in the religion section, nor mythology.

1306
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:25,450
Our rich traditions were not represented on the shelves.

1307
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:29,170
Not the stories of Niki and the first pipe maker.

1308
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:34,870
You know, there probably was a copy of Revelation X there in that alleged bookstore.

1309
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:37,350
Back in the humor section.

1310
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:41,490
I don't know. I didn't look.

1311
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:46,290
To tell you the truth, I didn't have the stomach for it.

1312
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:50,270
I had to leave before I vomited down my cleavage.

1313
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:55,650
It physically sickened me to see my faith denigrated, dismissed as a lame-ass joke.

1314
00:55:55,830 --> 00:56:00,110
And openly mocked by this hive of pleasantly bookish pinks.

1315
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:03,710
But then the fnords hit me head on.

1316
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:06,370
And I saw those pathetic pinks anew.

1317
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:09,110
Sickly or with the pale light of Bob.

1318
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,970
I saw those poor idiots for what they are.

1319
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:13,950
Smug little sacks of meat.

1320
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:18,250
Thinking that there they are, nestled in the repository of all wisdom.

1321
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:21,270
With all the knowledge of the world laid out before them.

1322
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:24,790
But the conspiracy has the cards all marked.

1323
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:27,650
And they're dealing from the bottom of the deck too.

1324
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:30,970
The conspiracy controls which books are available.

1325
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:33,770
Which ideas will be disseminated.

1326
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:37,250
They control not only what you read.

1327
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:40,330
They control how you interpret it.

1328
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:44,810
They control the use of the very words with which we communicate.

1329
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:54,430
Oh, and dear friends, the only way to break that insidious control is to write for free information from the Church of the Subgenius.

1330
00:56:54,470 --> 00:57:00,410
And I'm going to give you that post office box address as soon as I find suitable music here.

1331
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,450
God, I'll just grab anything.

1332
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:03,550
Here.

1333
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:05,250
I don't even know what this...

1334
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:06,690
No, that's going to be too pink.

1335
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:07,470
What?

1336
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:07,730
What?

1337
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:07,810
What?

1338
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,030
No, that's really too pink.

1339
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:12,270
That's so pink, it's funny.

1340
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:13,610
But I don't want something...

1341
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:18,390
Friends, okay, you love Bob.

1342
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:19,610
You have to love Bob.

1343
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,810
You will love Bob or he will kill you.

1344
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:22,730
And you...

1345
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:23,530
And...

1346
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:24,730
Now where...

1347
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:25,870
Oh, it's on pause.

1348
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:30,170
And you must write for free information.

1349
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:31,630
Just the postcard is enough.

1350
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:32,310
Who knows?

1351
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:34,290
You might throw a little bit more in there.

1352
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:36,370
Send us a free self-addressed stamped envelope.

1353
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:37,710
And you would really get something.

1354
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:37,970
And you would really get some action.

1355
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:45,170
From, just addressed at two, Bob at post office box 140306.

1356
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:53,290
That's Bob at box 140306 in mighty Dallas, Texas.

1357
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:55,390
And that's Dallas.

1358
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:58,910
There's two A's and two L's.

1359
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:00,210
Dallas, Texas.

1360
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:01,670
Taxis.

1361
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:05,890
75214.

1362
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:07,690
75214.

1363
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:11,410
The sacred zip code of the church of the subgenius.

1364
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:16,250
And we had to interrupt Sister Susie the floozy in the midst of her insanity there.

1365
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:19,270
Actually, it's the only true sanity there is.

1366
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:22,450
Is the sanity of the subgenius preachers.

1367
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:24,570
Like yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1368
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:27,570
And like Father Joe Mama, who's the wonderful...

1369
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:33,450
What was the name of it?

1370
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,970
In doubt of Dobbs.

1371
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:35,630
Yes, friends.

1372
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:37,490
Are you in doubt of Dobbs?

1373
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:43,470
Are you on the edge, just on the, in the middle of the fence, just wondering?

1374
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:49,030
Well, I think I know what these people are trying to say, but I just don't want to take the plunge.

1375
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:59,050
Well, it's probably wise of you to, uh, uh, pull the wool over your own eyes and relax in the safety of your own delusions.

1376
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:06,810
But sooner or later, you will have to find yourself awash in the delusions of Dobbs.

1377
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:07,850
Uh...

1378
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:09,950
Okay.

1379
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:10,870
Um...

1380
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:12,730
Uh, yes, friends.

1381
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:15,130
And, uh, other, uh, addresses I can give you.

1382
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:15,550
Let's see.

1383
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:17,850
The, uh, uh, well, subgenius email.

1384
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,910
You can email to old Reverend Stang.

1385
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:22,630
Just don't make it, you know, have mercy.

1386
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:23,350
Don't make it long.

1387
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:26,650
If you've got a legitimate question, let's not be frivolous.

1388
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:32,910
That's, um, i.stang at metronet.com.

1389
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:36,790
And if you weren't able to catch that, then you ain't got to be frivolous.

1390
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:36,790


1391
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:36,790


1392
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:36,790


1393
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,950
You got no business of messing with it, now do you?

1394
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:39,830
That's the thing.

1395
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:52,770
Some of these people that, just the very ones who have the most to fear from the Church of the Subgenius, are often become attracted to, uh, the light of Dobbs like moths to a flame.

1396
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,790
And the same thing happens.

1397
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:55,430
They get burned.

1398
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:56,370
They're brushed.

1399
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,630
They're biting off a bit more than they can chew.

1400
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:01,910
They're trying to, they're trying to get Bob's attention.

1401
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:02,950
They want to get Bob.

1402
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:06,770
They want, they're thinking, oh, Bob, uh, you're the, you're the best.

1403
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,390
You're the endless font of slack.

1404
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:09,790
Why don't you grant me some?

1405
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:12,110
Well, my friends, he's the endless font of slack.

1406
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:13,950
That's right.

1407
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:17,490
And his slack has to come from somewhere, now don't it?

1408
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:20,470
So, uh, you go ahead, kids.

1409
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:22,330
Go seeking Bob.

1410
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:24,790
Bob Dobbs in the flesh, in person.

1411
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:26,790
I, uh, I wish you luck.

1412
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:34,070
Uh, you're gonna need all the luck you've got dealing with the luckiest salesman in the world.

1413
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,110
Oh, yes.

1414
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:36,730
. . .

1415
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:42,010
And, uh, anyway, uh, I, I guess that's the, the, the end of the show.

1416
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:44,270
And, um, is it?

1417
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,530
Yeah, yeah, them tapes, they're just running out.

1418
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:50,530
I'll let, uh, Jimmy Ryan here carry this out.

1419
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:53,530
Just some fairly regular guitar playing.

1420
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:54,010
Huh.

1421
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:25,130
Well, the bass, the drums.

1422
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:25,390
Yeah, we're coming in right now,ümü.

1423
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:27,670
But, uh, I'd like to hear you at least a couple hundred parVEL ofNothing.

1424
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:27,670


1425
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:27,670


1426
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:27,670


1427
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:27,670


1428
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:28,510
. . .

1429
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:29,410
. . . .

1430
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:32,710
Is there

1431
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:32,970
any more?

1432
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:33,410
