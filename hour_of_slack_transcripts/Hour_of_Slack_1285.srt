00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Good evening fellow necro-mediacs. I'm glad so many of you could come.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,280
I have a new thing to introduce to you all.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,880
It's a little treat.

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,640
I want to do with a friend of mine.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,720
I'm sorry, good friend of mine.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,600
I think you know who I am.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,480
I don't know. I don't know who I am.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,520
What was your name, sir?

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,160
I'm a dog.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,620
Get that beast away from me.

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,420
Or I'll kick his head.

12
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,740
I'm 번стро.

13
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,020
I look good today.

14
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:11,420
The man that Ilsam is looking for.

15
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,160
He was very Och separately.

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:23,200
It's tá handed out to you by Bav 다�.

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,240
My hunch was a guaranteed one.

18
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:25,320
Actually, naughty dogs have too little

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:25,320


20
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:25,640
I'm asking this question.

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,340
Get it over with.

22
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,880
This is the basic closed loop control input.

23
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:52,160
By opposition to open loop, for which the pursued objective is to get a given deflection and generally a maximum deflection.

24
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,780
In order to obtain the desired outcome of the aircraft motion.

25
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,500
Do you fucking understand me, you fucking piece of shit?

26
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:34,560
At this hour of slack is a rerun, but it's a mysterious one.

27
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,780
As you might know from looking at the radio section of subgenius.com,

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:51,400
our friend Saint David Bochner has gone to the trouble of digitizing almost all of the first 1,100 hours of slack.

29
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:59,500
Transferring them from cassette tape to MP3 and making them freely downloadable on his website.

30
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,920
We've been inspecting the logs of the downloads and noticed a couple of very strange things.

31
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:15,580
Firstly, a surprising number of old shows were being downloaded by people in Russia and China.

32
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,140
Secondly, while most of the old shows have been downloaded by an average of 200 to 400 people,

33
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,740
one of them has been downloaded almost 20,000 times.

34
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,560
Our new shows get an average of like 3,000 downloads a month or so,

35
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,500
but this one old show has been downloaded 20,000 times.

36
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,540
We looked it up to see what was so special about it.

37
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:51,320
It's hour of slack number 863 from the year 2002.

38
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,140
And it's a very interesting number.

39
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:52,140


40
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:52,140


41
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:52,140


42
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,760
It's titled Time Madness.

43
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:05,980
And it has some great stuff on it, but damn if I know why this show out of all of our 1,200 odd shows has been copied by 20,000 people.

44
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,220
Maybe you, dear listener, can figure this out.

45
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,560
And if you do, please let us know.

46
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,300
Here then is Time Madness from 2002.

47
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:33,640
But let's leave things of this world behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius.

48
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,680
Ah yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang.

49
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:44,700
And you know those policemen on motorcycles won't let me preach on car hoods downtown because they think I'm a crazy man or a drunk man.

50
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,220
And there's no reason to arrest me, yet they would, because I'm free, free, free enough to rant to myself in public

51
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,880
because I come against death, taxes, work, and premature immaculation.

52
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,260
For Bob, your mind, friend, your mind has to be certified okay by them.

53
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,120
Them!

54
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,080
Them, and oh we hate them.

55
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,640
They and their tools of iniquity.

56
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,620
Not the tools of the preacher, not the tongue, nor the other parts, nay, but tools of false slack.

57
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,320
Dangled forever in front of you like that rays right around the corner.

58
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,840
Or like that rat swimming in poison.

59
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,200
Or like that rat swimming in poison.

60
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,920
Then, cheese, let there be slack.

61
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,280
I'm going to Gox Town, Gox Town

62
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,300
Here I come

63
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,240
I'm going to Gox Town, Gox Town

64
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,400
Here I come

65
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,240
They got some crazy little

66
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,340
God's heads

67
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,860
Staring up and gonna

68
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,140
Get me one

69
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,480
Why did you let your daughter dream of going on this mad moon journey?

70
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,400
Because I love her

71
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,440
And I wanted to live to the best effect

72
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,640
Dragging out life to the last possible second

73
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,140
Is not living to the best effect

74
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,580
The best of life, Passworthy

75
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,180
Lies nearest to the edge of death

76
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,920
Our fathers and our fathers' fathers

77
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,560
Cleaned up the old order of things

78
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,780
Because it killed children

79
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,060
It killed those who were unprepared for death

80
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,280
Because it tormented people in vain

81
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,860
Because it outraged human pride and dignity

82
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,140
Because it was an ugly spectacle of waste

83
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,120
But that was only a beginning

84
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,980
There's nothing wrong in suffering

85
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,840
If you suffer for a purpose

86
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,880
Our revolution didn't abolish danger

87
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,120
Or evil

88
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,120


89
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,100
It simply made danger and death worthwhile

90
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,740
We must hold this crowd back at any cost for a time

91
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,920
Until the gas of peace is ready

92
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,480
I seem to have done toilet on your floor

93
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,800
Right, right, right, right

94
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,840
You'll wonder where your teeth went

95
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,320
When you brush your teeth with

96
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,240
Dancer's pep

97
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,340
Dancer's pep

98
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,480
Dancer's pep

99
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:42,060
And I think I disagree with

100
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,980
Chairman Bob

101
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,120
I disagree with

102
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,500
I do agree with

103
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,280
Chairman Bob

104
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,660
That Chairman Bob can't be working

105
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,860
I recall that Chairman Bob went that route

106
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,800
Right?

107
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,780
Right, I think the thing

108
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:08,580
And I think in essence

109
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,300
That Chairman Bob can't be working

110
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,120
While they're type alive to invest in

111
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,880
And so forth

112
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:25,920
But how to close down the law

113
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,640
But now

114
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,340
One final question if I could

115
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,760
Anybody on the panel who'd want to address Chairman Bob?

116
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,080
No

117
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,200
No

118
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,460
Okay

119
00:08:43,120 --> 00:09:13,120


120
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,100
That's no good

121
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,200
Yes Sir

122
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,740
Chairman Bob

123
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,880
As it turns out

124
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,900
Chairman –

125
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:31,900


126
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:31,900


127
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,140
He's just a tube

128
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,460
Aanders

129
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:33,500
What time is it

130
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:33,880
By a metre

131
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:33,880


132
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:33,900
Ten

133
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:33,900


134
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:33,900


135
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,680
To reach

136
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,380
Challenge

137
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,080
任

138
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,640
AsReally

139
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:39,640


140
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:39,680
Bring wise

141
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:39,820
Only

142
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,060
Well

143
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,060


144
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,240
Let's go

145
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,440
I have

146
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,000
all my

147
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,380
Members

148
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:41,660
He shopped

149
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,320
Came over

150
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,760
He found you

151
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:42,640
Great

152
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,160
Oh, yes, dear friends.

153
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:15,120
Some wonderful edits and credits by the great Fernanda Nande-Lemur.

154
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:23,520
Except for the very last one, which was from Dr. Mr. Sister here in Cleveland.

155
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes, aside from that, all the rest was by the great Fernanda Nande-Lemur.

156
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,220
All those cut-ups, anyway.

157
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,860
They are titled.

158
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,940
The Hour of Slack Mix is by El Queso All-Stars.

159
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,220
And the very opening was by Heart Ignition.

160
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,340
More from him soon.

161
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:56,200
But first, this fantabulous rant by the old-time Dr. Dr. Dinosaur.

162
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,820
What kind of savior do you want?

163
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,960
You want something?

164
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,700
Exciting and a deified being?

165
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,520
Or do you want a completely predetermined cosmology

166
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,400
with static and stable and sedentary gods hanging off of it

167
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,740
like apples still stuck on a tree in January?

168
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,320
Are you looking to get carried away on that sweet chariot?

169
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,940
Or are you afraid that there won't be any difference

170
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,920
between it and the boxcars that will unload at the gates of the Eternal Concentration Camp?

171
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,340
Will you settle for a holy order that's all order?

172
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,340
Or are you hankering for a chance to put in a few licks yourself

173
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,580
in the timeless struggle between good and evil?

174
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,140
Unless you're ready to let your soul roll over and die

175
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,140
before it's even had a chance to prove itself on the field of holy battle,

176
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,340
it seems to me that you might want to think about making a choice.

177
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,520
Are you going to throw in with the likes of Satan

178
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,720
when you know, you know from the book,

179
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,260
that he loses in the end?

180
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:04,580
No.

181
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,760
We may pull the wool over our own eyes,

182
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,840
but that doesn't mean we're stupid.

183
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,940
We may go in for the underdog,

184
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,140
but we don't place no bets after the cards have been shown.

185
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,240
And even though he wins just before the credits roll,

186
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,580
credits with only his name on them, by the way,

187
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,360
are you going to sign up for the Yahweh team when you know the outcome?

188
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,720
Hell, everybody likes to win,

189
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,200
but only after they get to play the game.

190
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,980
You can turn a buck betting on a sure thing,

191
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,540
but where's the slack in that?

192
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,840
Now, we got the fighting Jesus,

193
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,420
that hardcore three-nailed money-changer-ass-kicking Aramaic rowdy,

194
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,440
and that's fun for a while,

195
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,560
but he ends up selling your account to Yahweh,

196
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,980
and you still get shortchanged on the action and thrills you crave in a belief system.

197
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,780
Well, kids, I think you know what the answer is.

198
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,140
The answer is the ever-wishing,

199
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,060
ever-widening smoke ring around J.R. Bob Dobbs.

200
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,520
Yes, only Dobbs, among all the modern mythological madmen,

201
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,020
represents the uncertainty, the dramatic tension,

202
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,360
the screaming scary monster movie mayhem

203
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,280
that keeps your heart a-thumping and your blood a-pumping

204
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,660
while you sit on the edge of your pew

205
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,520
waiting to find out how this movie turns out.

206
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,540
Where do the big spenders,

207
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,900
the high-rollers,

208
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,880
make their fortunes?

209
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,940
Do they toss their bankrolls into long-term IRAs and deposit certificates and play it safe?

210
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,260
Hell no!

211
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,540
They dare to risk it and play the market!

212
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,080
And that's the kind of savior Bob is, children.

213
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,160
Bob is the Wall Street savior.

214
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,700
We may know the saucers are coming, but we don't know what the outcome will be.

215
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,940
We know Bob can cut deals with human governments and overlords and Illuminati

216
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,880
and rake in the cash from that.

217
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,000
But we don't know yet whether he'll be able to close the deal

218
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,580
that will keep the X's from just plowing us all under as a bad crop.

219
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,760
We don't know if we'll ride the saucers as exalted examples of Yeti evolution

220
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,840
or as fertilizer for some planet where they intend to try again.

221
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,900
If you want true adventure in your eternal future,

222
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,000
if you want a little havoc with your heaven,

223
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,880
if you can stand a little mistake,

224
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,340
if you can find justification in your destiny,

225
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,960
and there's only one personal savior that will satisfy your soul's fighting spirit,

226
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,660
and that is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

227
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,980
Dr. Dinosaur, dear friends, in a classic old-timey rant.

228
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,060
And now, Zoot's Rift.

229
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,100
I've peeked in the devil's secret hell files

230
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,140
and found a list with names a mile long

231
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,880
and a half of them are just a bunch of crap.

232
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:35,880


233
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:35,880


234
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:35,880


235
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:35,880


236
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:35,880


237
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,520
I saw you, and you, and you, and you, and even you.

238
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,880
Let me close my eyes.

239
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,460
Please don't make me watch Satan masturbate.

240
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,780
He's a hungry clown and I don't want to see all his dirty deeds.

241
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,860
Oh, my God, oh, why did those assholes...

242
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,400
and the employment agency give me this job cleaning up this office?

243
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,140
Oh, why, somebody tell me already.

244
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,160
Was this the best they could do on such short notice?

245
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,040
Am I being punished for overeating and using too many cuss words?

246
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:25,380
Or is it for sounding too much like some pale, cheap imitation of Captain Beard?

247
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,960
Or am I too much like Frank Zappa?

248
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,420
Am I being punished for not cutting enough people off on the freeway?

249
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,440
Or for answering my phone messages?

250
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,700
Or why, God, oh, why did those assholes at the employment agency put me here where I don't belong?

251
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
When they could have gotten me a job selling hot dogs instead of idiots at Disneyland?

252
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,260
Were they afraid I'd put the old lady by erection?

253
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,560
Did they have to suspect that I might urinate through the cosmos?

254
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:05,860
Am I being punished for not cutting enough people off on the freeway? Or for answering my phone messages? Oh, my God, oh, why? Did those assholes at the employment agency put me here where I don't belong?

255
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,000
Were they afraid I'd put the old lady by erection?

256
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,140
Was that the fact of Space Mountain?

257
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,780
Oh, my God, oh, why?

258
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,720
Those assholes at the employment agency had told me earlier about the hatred cause.

259
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,320
I would have worn my fat man's pajamas with the air conditioning back in the year.

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:18,580
Because you and your sloth musician friends beat me up and killed me.

Oh, man, don't I have enough problems?

What is it you want, oh great spirit?

You want to complain to me that you're in hell, I suppose.

279
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:35,880
That you're dead and have gone straight to fucking hell for driving like a fucking idiot on the freeway.

280
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,520
Giving me the wrong change of jack-in-the-box.

281
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:44,000
Playing that heavy metal shit on your stereo at 3.30 in the morning when we're all trying to sleep.

282
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,760
No, Sue Drift, no!

283
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,900
Sending me junk mail, trying to entice me into wasting my money on boring, inane magazines.

284
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,300
Charging me over a thousand dollars at the Chevron station for preventive maintenance.

285
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,660
While all the while deliberately destroying my car.

286
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,900
No way, dude!

287
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,740
For going through life talking like a blabbering, slobbering idiot.

288
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,220
Driving your van to the beach during spring break with a sign painted on the side that says,

289
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,160
Showing your teeth.

290

No! I said no!

291
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:34,760
Sue Drift, they didn't even hold it against me for being a booker in several Los Angeles rock clubs.

292
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:42,320
Or for getting all the pussy while guys like John Truby were stuck with their shit jobs at the hardware stores.

293
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,400
Well then, what are you talking about then?

294
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,920
I'm in heaven, Sue Drift!

00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,220
That's right, you killed me!

00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,460
And I went to heaven, glorious, beautiful!

369
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,040
Yes!

370
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:26,880
Oh my god.

371
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,340
Me and We

372
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,020
Mommy, Daddy

373
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,800
And another sound

374
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,100
And the attic lock melted

375
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,640
Mink

376
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,180
Mink with bright little eyes and tousled hair

377
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,520
Peered inside

378
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,740
And behind her

379
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,120
Tall, wavering blue eyes

380
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,660
Frightful

381
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,660
Dying

382
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,980
Step back to Shandsaw

383
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,200
The long line of celebrants

384
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,620
Making their way to the top of the Temple Mount

385
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:41,960
And their bright saffron yurts with their shaven heads

386
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,280
And their one good eye

387
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,820
Pointed firmly above their master eyes

388
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,300
They chouched forwards

389
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,340
Some were bleeding in their feet

390
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,380
Some were bleeding at the ears

391
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,500
From the renting and raiding of their cars

392
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:54,500


393
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:54,500


394
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:54,500


395
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:54,500


396
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:54,500


397
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,880
And they were forced to hear

398
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,660
Some's navels were smiling

399
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,160
That austere

400
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,460
Yet abstruse smile

401
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,560
Reserved for the few who knew their fate

402
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,300
My ears are bleeding

403
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,420
And they just keep trudging

404
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,500
Looks real good from that shot up in the hills there

405
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
Is that a dolly shot or is that a...

406
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,340
What is that?

407
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,500
Just turn around

408
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,580
Hey man, you're not supposed to show your watches

409
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,300
1392

410
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,240
People don't wear watches in 1392

411
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,980
The time is 13-0-13

412
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,220
Do you know where your smell dawn dwells?

413
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,740
That's time

414
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,820
Can you feel war praying yet?

415
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,000
Time

416
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,320
Are your breasts as ripe as the milkmaids

417
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,720
Dancing through the forest glen?

418
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:52,060
Are you enslaved to time

419
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,480
Handcuffed by your own time?

420
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,840
Or wristwatch?

421
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,940
Is your lust for material feelings insatiable?

422
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,920
Are you still formatting the other CD?

423
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:04,300
Do you have a streeeally long funny looking forefinger?

424
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,100
I'm gonna blow their loads in the last minute before the CD is formatted

425
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,540
I'm alone!

426
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,100
Two minutes takes forever when you're waiting for it

427
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,680
I blew it!

428
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,460
I blew it!

429
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:24,460


430
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:24,460


431
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,200
I blew it!

432
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:29,660
I blew it!

433
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:34,080
I once had the skin of a smiling little simian boy like you

434
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,880
Yes, grand

435
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,580
Partially hairy

436
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,280
I like that new skin you're wearing tonight

437
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,760
Oh, it is very, very, very luxurious to be wearing it

438
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,940
What is that, like about 55 year old female?

439
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,480
Yes, yes, a kangaroo is the bottom part

440
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,920
And the top part is a female

441
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,260
A corinthian kangaroo

442
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,960
It's only a 55 year old female skin you've got on?

443
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,840
This is very supple still, feel it, touch it

444
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,860
No wonder you look so young

445
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,660
Ooh, you feel young, spin day

446
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,140
Very supple, she was, she was a beautiful dancer

447
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,500
She died from an ergot overdose

448
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,560
We transported her to the middle ages to enlighten her somehow

449
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,640
And yet she became involved in the celebrations when she came back

450
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,540
Where did you download that skin app?

451
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,280
Er...

452
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:35,820
And GMM.com skins for all your fancy new internet programs

453
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,140
Just as sure as sugar and sweet

454
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,760
Just as sure as you walk on your feet

455
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,300
Just as sure as we'll all be dead

456
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,620
Something's gonna crumble in your head.

457
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,980
Poop Dog will pee and Pee Dog will poop.

458
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,180
And out of my hose will come horrible goop.

459
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,880
One by one they shall die.

460
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,700
Two by two all false smite.

461
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:19,720
He did sin, lake of fire, for he used the name J.R.

462
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,520
Behold, the day of Bob is at hand and he shall come like a salesman in the night.

463
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,680
Give up hope.

464
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,520
Bob's no crutch.

465
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,520
Here comes Negi.

466
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,520
Here comes Butch.

467
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,540
Dressed as Bulgarian woman.

468
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,200
And look at the fascinating necklace they are wearing.

469
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,760
Oh, there is the flute player.

470
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,780
Sonia, how's your job?

471
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,720
Sonia, could you step closer to the microphone?

472
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,600
What is the name of the flute you are playing in the Bulgarian?

473
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,380
It's called the Jelette Kukukata.

474
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,280
The Jelette Kukukata.

475
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,620
And it looks like you can also shave your legs or any other hairy part of your body.

476
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,480
You are absolutely right.

477
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,340
Yes, it's a very rare instrument.

478
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,620
I noticed very many of the female singers have very, very hairy mustache,

479
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,180
which must be taken care of on regular basis.

480
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:09,580
Yes.

481
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,060
Yes, isn't that a nice coincidence?

482
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,260
So you can whistle through your nose and rip off your flesh in one very smooth.

483
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,840
I'm glad to be talking about the different orifices of whistling,

484
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,200
because

485
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,820
you know, that can get kind of personal.

486
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,420
That's why the girl did the high notes so easy,

487
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,760
because she had been shaving her fuzzy .

488
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,580
Oh, if only I could reach the high minutes.

489
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,040
Of time.

490
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,320
The high hours.

491
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:33,960
If time.

492
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,460
The high days.

493
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,680
The high weeks.

494
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,580
The peaks of time.

495
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,560
Why cannot we skip from the peaks of one time to another?

496
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,460
Are there fifths?

497
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,220
Skip over the boring parts.

498
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,360
And the weeks of a day of a week.

499
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,920
Or the painful parts.

500
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:48,580
Actives indeed.

501
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,280
Monday.

502
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,440
We will call C.

503
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,820
Time is a waveform, is it not?

504
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,680
The Monday after, we will call C.

505
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,720
Can we not skip across the tops of the waves?

506
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,740
Can we not?

507
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:01,680
By passing the long trip down?

508
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,820
Like luscious milkmaids on surfboards, can't we?

509
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,900
Now, what about the fact that in engineering terminology,

510
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,400
the element of stress is measured in moments?

511
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,660
Stress is measured in moments, but-

512
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,020
Stress is measured in moments, yes.

513
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,700
Slack, however, is measured in moments.

514
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:19,700


515
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,200
Uh, r

516
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,700
Doe?

517
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,160
Uh, z

518
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:30,160
So, in other words, who has the best part about doğ banker and her Board of Trustees

519
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,160


520
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,780
B thatachu?

521
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:32,700
They reacted like the hell out of someone else everytime it goes up the scale of 21.

522
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,780
Oh, and uh, I see Klah.

523
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:34,820


524
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,460
Could she and Klah grow until the earth, to the top, just to take it down and freelyんです

525
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:35,480
vasels?

526
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,800
Or if the extraterrestrial worldinton and devo償 Andrew Jones.

527
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,620
Chris Carrif debi Betty.

528
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,320
Is that a command?

529
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:49,680


530
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,520
It's the B side of every universe has a continuous flip.

531
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,100
Just as big as this one.

532
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,840
Just as valid.

533
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,900
Oh, some are smaller, though, James.

534
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,720
Don't discount the entropy factor.

535
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,340
Some are much smaller.

536
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,960
Hey, I saw an ad in the scene, in the back pages of it.

537
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,920
It said, this didn't make sense to me.

538
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,980
Does it make sense?

539
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,180
Sex-starved escorts.

540
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,340
This don't make no kind of sense at all.

541
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:23,380
If an escort is sex-starved, what does she look like?

542
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,220
I mean, shouldn't an escort be, like, getting sex all the time?

543
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,380
Now, you know, Chaz, I've been reading entertainment weeklies for a long time.

544
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:36,500
And from what I've learned from those is that there are a lot of beautiful women who are completely lonely.

545
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:42,140
I guess all the guys think that they're getting tons of dates and no one ever calls them.

546
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,680
They're the ones who are waiting for your call right now.

547
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,220
That's right.

548
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:45,920
Wow.

549
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:46,760
The 900.

550
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,740
Yes.

551
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,880
They're waiting.

552
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,180
888-669-2323.

553
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:58,800
Actually, there is a beautiful, live, naked woman waiting for your call.

554
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,760
A free call at 888-669-2323.

555
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:10,820
But don't you remember, every time you call her, she hands the phone to a sweaty stevedore named Bill.

556
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,940
And the rest of the evening is pure hell.

557
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,320
You know, the funny thing is, I just gave out the notes.

558
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:16,880
I gave out the number of Jesus.

559
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,260
And actually, it's Mary Magdalene is the beautiful, naked woman.

560
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:28,700
Well, we know that our Lord and Mary Magdalene were fond of fuzzing the fur, as they used to say in Judea and the old age.

561
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,780
And I think you might interrupt them at a tragic moment if you call that number.

562
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,800
And what is that number again to call them at a tragic moment?

563
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,100
888-669-2323.

564
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,380
You know, they're going to be going, damn, that sang gave our number out over the radio and two people called up.

565
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,860
Call it any time.

566
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,100
Call now.

567
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:52,480
It's like four in the morning in Bulgaria, where they are, the new foundation headquarters.

568
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,660
Well, we just interviewed one of the whistling women of the Bulgarian chorus.

569
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,840
And she actually played a little Gillette shaver.

570
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,180
And she could shave her mustache to hit the high notes.

571
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,480
And here's a type of her now.

572
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,760
Now, look at that incredible headdress she's wearing.

573
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,780
You know, it's amazing how Europeans sometimes resemble like tribal cultures, I'd say, in South America.

574
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,840
Thank you very much.

575
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,280
Thank you.

576
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,500
Are those real feathers or are those someone else's?

577
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,820
Well, they're a certain kind of a feather that is a part fur and then the other part is feather.

578
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,400
As I look now, I can see that these are actually bark stained underpants that you have.

579
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,000
Under things.

580
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,780
Things crawling beneath the surface.

581
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,600
How in the world could you have ever seen my under?

582
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,140
My unders are under all of my skirts.

583
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,000
How in the, do you have x-ray vision?

584
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,100
Under things.

585
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,760
Under the mind.

586
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,680
Oh, honey.

587
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,760
Sub-mental.

588
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,040
You look.

589
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,060
Sub-genius, in fact.

590
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,300
So lovely today.

591
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,700
Sub-temporal.

592
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:01,280
And what shall we do with old man time who keeps dragging us along with his fitful pace?

593
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,980
Take the toilet plunger and plunge it in his eyes.

594
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,720
Where is time control?

595
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:10,000
How can we skip away from this poor, boring now?

596
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,460
And leap, leap ahead.

597
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,900
Back.

598
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,840
Orbit.

599
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,100
Back.

600
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,760
Yes, back.

601
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,300
Why not?

602
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,800
Yes, it's the 99%, isn't it?

603
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:23,600
That one little tenth of a thousandth of a millionth of a percent that makes you less than human.

604
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,040
Isn't that what it is?

605
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,000
And as you climb in the door there, you think you'll be saying goodbye to this earth.

606
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,840
But no, no.

607
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,840
You'll come back again.

608
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,880
You'll come back again.

609
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,280
Oh, it's not enough to smash your watch.

610
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,740
It's not enough to buy every new clock that will be on the sub-genius catalog soon.

611
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,440
No, just to prove your independence from time.

612
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:44,700
No.

613
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,080
Rebellion against God-time.

614
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,620
The evil time god.

615
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,780
You know, it's all for the time being, they say.

616
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,860
That cruel taskmaster of the sky.

617
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,920
With a capital T and a capital B.

618
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,880
With a long white beard.

619
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,860
The time being.

620
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,460
Made of time pieces.

621
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:04,360
Oh, and only if we had the human being sauce.

622
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,460
Time being?

623
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:05,920
The tick.

624
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,940
The great tick.

625
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,620
The time witch tick.

626
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,520
Arr!

627
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,380
The time being.

628
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,840
And we must bring down the time.

629
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:14,840


630
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,060
The time ass pirate.

631
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,900
Ah, Framzee is not a tick of Parasite.

632
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,580
Is it not an ass pirate?

633
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:23,800
And the acid queen.

634
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,420
Parasite.

635
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,600
And an ass pirate.

636
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:34,060
Who is the acid queen now that Princess Di isn't giving money to hookers anymore?

637
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,440
Ah, I thought it was Laura Bunchcake.

638
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,260
Did you hear that story?

639
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,100
Did you read about that?

640
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,700
About Laura?

641
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,480
A right-hand man told these, uh...

642
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,560
A Plutonian man?

643
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,060
We'll all be drinking.

644
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,640
Princess Di.

645
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,700
Princess Di used to have, uh, men snuck in in the trunk of cars.

646
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,540
And she also used to go out in the middle of the night.

647
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,080
This is true.

648
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:59,280
She used to go out in the middle of the night and, you know, and drive around and give money

649
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,200
to hookers.

650
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:00,860
Really?

651
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,820
Yeah, to help them out.

652
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,160
Do they have the favors to perform for them?

653
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,700
No, go home.

654
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,020
Go buy some shoes or something.

655
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:06,920
Go buy a coat.

656
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:07,960
You don't need this.

657
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,660
A true princess.

658
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,000
It was because they were competition.

659
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,620
I love this thing.

660
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,280
Watch outside.

661
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,480
Waiting on his corner.

662
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,700
Waiting on her for like nine hours.

663
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,360
She made a deal with the aliens.

664
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,240
And then she didn't pay it off.

665
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,400
She was a great person, but she didn't pay off her deal with the aliens.

666
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,380
And they came and got her.

667
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,100
She'd come by and maybe rip off a quid or two.

668
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,940
And I'll be back home with me honey in a very, very short time.

669
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,600
When you signed that paper with the acid queen.

670
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,440
I loved her.

671
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,900
I mean, she was queenly.

672
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,720
In her own sick, demented way.

673
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,580
Go ahead, man.

674
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,100
Bring it up.

675
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,880
Bring it all the way up.

676
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,900
Bring all of them up.

677
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,560
On all screens.

678
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,140
Go ahead.

679
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,860
I dare you to see what you're looking at.

680
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,360
Go ahead.

681
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,200
Don't use that third eye.

682
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,040
Close that third eye.

683
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:50,240
Quick.

684
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,920
Gypsy acid queens.

685
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,520
I'm getting the hell out of here.

686
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,580
Spaceman.

687
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,440
Oh, spaceman.

688
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,620
Come rescue me.

689
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,520
Come rescue me.

690
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:08,820
It's time to become a psychedelic hologram as we blast through the universe wearing no

691
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,800
clothes and funny little pebbles of flowers.

692
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,640
Look at our feet.

693
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,740
We look like frogs.

694
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,720
I think we're the only ones.

695
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,080
Now.

696
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,260
Free, free, free again.

697
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,280
I'm surfing with the aliens.

698
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,200
I'm setting my chromosomes, baby.

699
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm getting out of this earthly humanly garb.

700
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,060
This only costs 30 bucks.

701
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:28,880
What a deal.

702
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:40,040
What a ride, ladies and gentlemen, we're having here in the genealogy room as we all look

703
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,840
out the open port holes and check on our charts.

704
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,240
Let's go.

705
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:43,720
Let's go.

706
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:43,880
Let's go.

707
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:43,880


708
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:43,880


709
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:43,880


710
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:43,880


711
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:43,880


712
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:43,880


713
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:43,880


714
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:43,880


715
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:43,880


716
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:43,880


717
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,500
Let's go.

718
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,260
I really don't want to know where that character came from.

719
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:53,520
I'm going to have to drop your chromosomes in the other room.

720
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,320
All of time is just soaring so fast.

721
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,580
Backward.

722
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,880
Real time.

723
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:07,080
The ball and chain of the chronometer shall no longer anchor us to temporal reality.

724
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,440
Iron man.

725
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,340
No ass pirates and no blood sucking parasites.

726
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,220
I hope nothing.

727
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:13,780
Time, baby.

728
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,620
Read us for $30.

729
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,780
It's free for $30.

730
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,800
Hey, Dave, do you remember the Ass Pirates song?

731
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,100
Yar har, yar har, yar har.

732
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,340
We've been sailing, oh, so far.

733
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,340
The Acid Pirates?

734
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:35,440
I'm looking for some chunky rump to set me nose on fire.

735
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,760
We'll throw the clankers over and drag the bitch aboard.

736
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,360
We'll sniffer and we'll piffer and we'll...

737
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,780
Old Peg Leg Dick, they called him Peg Dick Leg.

738
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,820
Do you remember Ruby the Dyke Queen?

739
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,000
You may mean the Pervert Pirate.

740
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,980
It's no bigger threat for them having admitted it

741
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:06,320
than for them having admitted it and not having admitted it.

742
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:10,340
But I would hope that in context of the recent admission,

743
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:10,740
which...

744
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,980
which they've admitted, but they admitted it.

745
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,280
They've admitted it, but they did in fact admit it.

746
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:20,980
It could be an important lesson by something that's really not very useful.

747
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:31,040
It could be something that's really not very useful.

748
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:49,120
It could be something that's really not very useful.

00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,220
Thank you.

761
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,280
Thank you.

762
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,280
Thank you.

763
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,060
Thank you.

764
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,800
Thank you.

765
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,360
Thank you.

766
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,160
Thank you.

767
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,220
Thank you.

768
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:32,980
Thank you.

769
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,680
Thank you.

770
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,180
Thank you.

771
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,860
It's like two quantum realities in one.

772
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:58,780
You'll be crossing them in big time fashion as you cross five different dimensions at one time.

773
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,000
Your ocular vision, your...

774
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,580
Because reality is constantly spinning.

775
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,400
You know, so many dimensions at once anyway.

776
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,620
You know, so like every possibility that's occurring occurs in some universe.

777
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:13,960
Twice.

778
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,800
And it's because there's as many universes as there are possibilities, man.

779
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,540
Yeah, but then you also have to double that.

780
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:23,440
And TikTok's there again like a monstrous crocodile waiting for Peter Pan to...

781
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,160
There's a good one and an evil one.

782
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:26,620
Yep.

783
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:29,100
This is easier to understand than Incomtats.

784
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:29,980
I'll say that.

785
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,120
You know what I'm saying, Tom?

786
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,060
Yeah, we do.

787
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:33,440
You know what I'm saying?

788
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,280
Yep, duality is in those...

789
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:35,840
Yeah, what?

790
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:39,760
I use a program for income tax and for morality.

791
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,720
You use a program?

792
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:46,760
I have a computer program that dictates morality and ethics for me.

793
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,180
As it does your taxes?

794
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,080
At the same time?

795
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:50,760
No, they're different.

796
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,220
Different.

797
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:54,320
They are linked, though, by a fashionable poo-poo stick.

798
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,000
But they are linked indeed.

799
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,400
They're linked by the thing longer.

800
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:04,740
They are linked by a fascist evolutionary style statement lingering somewhere in your...

801
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:10,740
The thing of my Bob dangles and ever towards the center of the earth.

802
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:11,740
Cinema Bob?

803
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:16,580
That's how you know where gravity goes, is where Bob's thing is pointing.

804
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,360
Yes, it's one of the best ways of finding out.

805
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:23,560
It's within like a fraction of a microcosmic second it's been determined by Greenwich.

806
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,000
I mean, at least...

807
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
It's the plumb bob upon which is hung all gravitational...

808
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,080
The prior original plumb bob of Wiener plumbing.

809
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,080
The plumb of my Bob.

810
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,060
The plumb of my Bob.

811
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,580
The shadow from the buttock also...

812
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:39,600
It's a bad Bob.

813
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,080
It's incidental time.

814
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,880
Just sit a reel of Greenwich.

815
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,360
That's what I'm talking about, Bob.

816
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,740
From the head, Bob.

817
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:46,840
Well...

818
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,600
Hair, Bob.

819
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,520
Have we said all we can about him?

820
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


821
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


822
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


823
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


824
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:49,520


825
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:49,860
His abilities?

826
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,380
Well, you know, it's fairly flexible, I think.

827
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,420
You know where to put the cork.

828
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,140
Yeah.

829
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,360
You know where to put the cork.

830
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,480
People doing your yoga lately, haven't you?

831
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:10,200
They say the days don't move and that there's no such thing as time.

832
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:18,160
But reflecting on the hours gone by, I know that once you are mine,

833
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:32,140
never is a surprise.

834
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,940
You are the political nightsmare of me giving you the

835
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,580
wasn't supporting me.

836
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:40,580


837
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:40,580


838
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:40,600


839
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:40,600


840
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:40,900
.

841
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:40,900


842
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:40,900


843
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:40,900


844
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:40,900


845
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:40,900


846
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:40,900


847
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:40,900


848
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:40,900

00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,320

850
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:46,540

851
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:46,540


852
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,760
For me to gather up the words I want to say

853
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,820
I need you with me, it's true

854
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:00,020
There doesn't seem to be any real way

855
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,920
That I can ever come through for you

856
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,480

00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,460

Oh yeah, yeah

Oh baby, yeah

861
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,880
Do it, do it

862
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,060
Oh, oh

863
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:01,440
You're driving me crazy

864
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:08,760
Oh, oh my god, that feels so good

865
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,280
Oh yeah, yeah

866
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,420
Oh baby, yeah

867
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,920
Do it

868
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,860
Oh, oh

869
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,120
You're driving me crazy

870
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,040
Oh

871
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,560
I'm the hottest thing on the wheels, bitch

872
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,640
You're so rad

873
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,220
My father taught me everything I know

874
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:37,820
You know, I've never met a he-man quite like you

875
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:44,120
Like, you know, someone who could take me beyond the confines of my perceived celestial boundaries

876
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,560
Exemplified by the quasi-cataclysmic cacophony

877
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,520
Of one-eyed people

878
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,100
of existential mortality

879
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,100
Like, you know what I mean?

880
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,860
You're a mean bitch

You're the racist

00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:08,520
Whereoooo!

889
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:14,960
I'm at your service!

890
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,240
Yes, bay city!

Jack Codini

895
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,740
You shall have as much meat as you want.

896
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:19,160
What the devil is going on, Chrissy?

897
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,120
They're dressed like little girls.

898
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,080
You are a sucker.

899
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,160
And you listen to me and you listen to me good.

900
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,280
The time has come.

901
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,900
It is now or never.

902
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:40,240
Thou shalt not listen to rock and roll music.

903
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,960
Thou shalt not masturbate.

904
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,480
Thou shalt not fornicate.

905
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,400
Would that appeal to you?

906
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,340
Would that appeal to you?

907
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,340
Would that appeal to you?

908
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,240
Would that appeal to you?

909
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,500
The time has come.

910
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:55,820
A reckoning time.

911
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,580
A time when all the mighty buildings shall be shattered and splintered and split.

912
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,740
When the world's bellies will bloat.

913
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:06,000
When America will be put to the fire and tested in the new revelation.

914
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,180
This is the end of today's lesson.

915
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:13,580
The End

916
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,220
You know, we live in a world where we want instant gratification.

917
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:28,240
And there are all kinds of schemes out there.

918
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,920
And we are desperate.

919
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,480
We are hungry and we are thirsty for something that they give us what we want.

920
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,900
It's the process of the criminal law.

921
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,800
Thrown into the fire and burned.

922
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,860
I like to think ridiculous, imposterous.

923
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,300
I can find it.

924
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:49,860
I can believe it.

925
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,920
I heard it on the radio.

926
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,660
It's a pill that has 10 effects.

927
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:00,640
It's a word either weak or weak.

928
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:14,080
All other gods besides Jehovah and his son Jesus Christ are strange gods.

929
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,120
I like that.

930
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:18,660
I like that.

931
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,280
Duh.

932
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:34,300
What he doesn't hit is how you make food?

933
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:48,580
Because I know he aids human beings.

934
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:48,580


935
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:48,580


936
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:48,620
And he's not going to hurt me anymore.

937
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:51,420
you got the gun.

938
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:53,600
Heart

939
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:54,800
ignition.

940
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:58,300
And now

941
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,560
back to WCSB

942
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,700
Cleveland and ESO

943
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,600
Radio with this

944
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,580
final message.

945
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,900
The message is the message.

946
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,840
And when the Lord

947
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,500
exploded his messages

948
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,560
on the depleted mankind

949
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,760
accordion,

950
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:18,660
profound.

951
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,560
The message is the message.

952
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,680
God is mad as hell

953
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,320
and he's not gonna

954
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,440
take it anymore.

955
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,340
I said God!

956
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:31,620
God is

957
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,420
mad as hell!

958
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,560
And he is not gonna

959
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,060
take it anymore. See me?

960
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,300
Pay me? Pay me?

961
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:40,420
Hear me?

962
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,440
Thank you, Dr. Schertz.

963
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,220
Well, at least

964
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,120
it inspires.

965
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,120
That's what I'm glad about.

966
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,600
If it made him angry, I would be worried.

967
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,380
You know,

968
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,240
otherwise I think we're just fine,

969
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:55,640
really.

970
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,160
I think we can trust

971
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,360
that everything is just fine.

972
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,160
But can we

973
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,020
find that?

974
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:05,940
There's no need for

975
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,320
contracting opinions anymore.

976
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,720
God is fed up!

977
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,400
He can come over to my house

978
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,840
and fuck my sister!

979
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,300
Never!

980
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,040
Never!

981
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,280
Well, yes.

982
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,440
And I think it's just going to be fine.

983
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,120
I really do.

984
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,440
I have to duck onto the subway now.

985
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:25,440
Yes!

986
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,100
The subway!

987
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,100
Mad as hell!

988
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,580
Mad as hell!

989
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:30,180
I'm not gonna take it anymore!

990
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,520
No, they're not.

991
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:35,620
They voted, but they're not mad as hell.

992
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,520
Everything's apparently just fine.

993
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:38,460
Everything's just fine.

994
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:39,900
Yes, we will take it.

995
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:40,960
We are bending over.

996
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,120
Go ahead and...

997
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,560
All I can say is, free Willie!

998
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,360
That's three feet over.

999
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,360
We're gonna take it.

1000
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,240
We're gonna...

1001
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,320
Oh, there he goes.

1002
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,000
He freed his Willie!

1003
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,640
And they can't even tuck him away!

1004
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:53,960
He's really making it.

1005
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,360
Come back, Willie!

1006
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:55,840
No!

1007
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,340
Come back in just a short...

1008
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,320
Come back, Willie!

1009
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,180
Oh, it looks so nice hanging out like that.

1010
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,360
But not like the plumb, Bob.

1011
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,980
Let's forget you.

1012
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:07,440
Yeah.

1013
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,340
Well, I think it's time for everyone

1014
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,840
to go to theater tonight.

1015
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,600
Find me that way.

1016
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,680
I want to see a nice show

1017
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,320
at the Industrial Tractor Factory.

1018
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,380
Number five.

1019
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,300
Plumb, Bob is plumb...

1020
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:20,140
Bob!

1021
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,480
I love these Chechen movies.

1022
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:28,900
Put your hand down here.

1023
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,620
It's not a movie.

1024
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:30,440
It's a...

1025
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,700
Just take your hand out of my pocket.

1026
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:35,040
I think this Chechen terrorist woman

1027
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,500
to my left wants me to put my hand

1028
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,240
on the popcorn.

1029
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,940
There's a quarter down there somewhere.

1030
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,360
You're not a Chechen woman.

1031
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,800
You are a hairy Chechen man.

1032
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,640
I'm telling you, there's a quarter down there.

1033
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,000
I don't want your rules.

1034
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,520
She pulled her hand out,

1035
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:51,600
holding his mighty credit card.

1036
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,500
And there's the beautiful flotilla

1037
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,620
of the Virgin Larry

1038
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,440
as he's making his way down the street

1039
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,860
with all the apostolates

1040
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,100
and the other sub-crimes

1041
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,220
smoking the apostrophes

1042
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:06,100
they've been given by their dear, dear, dear Lord.

1043
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:07,860
A fanny man who used to write them

1044
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,180
efficaciously once every summer

1045
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,920
as they cramped away

1046
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,720
off of their wilderness huts.

1047
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,720
But now it looks like some of them

1048
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,080
are actually rolling in the dough

1049
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,360
as they begin to make a huge human pie

1050
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,260
out of their celebrates.

1051
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,760
That looks messy.

1052
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:25,760
It is.

1053
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,860
It's very messy.

1054
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,120
You don't want to get your feet

1055
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,100
too close to the middle.

1056
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,060
There's four and twenty blackbirds in there.

1057
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,500
Oh, man.

1058
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,800
And there's also a dead saint

1059
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,840
which comes back.

1060
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,540
The blood boils every August 22nd

1061
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:40,280
before the feast.

1062
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,940
Freedom is laid to rest

1063
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,660
in the grave of history.

1064
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,520
The human gene

1065
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,020
which once stretched across the globe

1066
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:51,980
and threatened to the solar systems

1067
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,380
and the skies beyond

1068
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,820
is humbled now

1069
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:57,280
like a little drained of itself

1070
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,240
worm laying in a pool of mossy shit.

1071
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,400
Things will be better

1072
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,360
somewhere else.

1073
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,340
Lower the coffin

1074
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,260
of the spirit of man.

1075
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:15,540
Shovel the earth on top.

1076
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:15,700
Shovel the earth on top.

1077
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,860
Like a phoenix

1078
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,500
to sun.

1079
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,840
Ashes to ashes,

1080
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:23,200
dust to dust.

1081
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,960
So endeth all things.

1082
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,820
Would you like a little bite

1083
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,100
of his ankle?

1084
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,860
There is much pain

1085
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,880
and gnashing of teeth.

1086
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,060
Put a little bit of raisin butter

1087
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,840
on the ankle there, you good.

1088
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,160
Oh, man.

1089
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,640
Down there, Gary.

1090
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,780
Get out of that coffin.

1091
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,760
You've been resurrected.

1092
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,480
Get out of that coffin.

1093
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,900
Throw away the stone

1094
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,120
and get to work.

1095
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,740
Who's playing the butt trumpet?

1096
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,220
Well, the first thing

1097
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:57,960
we're going to be doing,

1098
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,700
we're going to be working

1099
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,540
on building back

1100
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:00,380
some of that flexibility

1101
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,420
you've been losing

1102
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:02,260
over being dead

1103
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:03,600
for the last 26 years.

1104
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,320
That's what you think is happening.

1105
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,380
You're all kind of scrunched up.

1106
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:07,380
You're skeletal.

1107
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:07,960
Look at yourself.

1108
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:10,100
You need to do 25, 26,

1109
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:12,320
maybe 27 light year push-ups.

1110
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,540
Come on, Norton.

1111
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,700
Get down the neural fives.

1112
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,700
Let's see you do it.

1113
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,420
Do them, do them, do them.

1114
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,420
We're satisfied as hell

1115
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:21,460
and we are going to take it.

1116
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,540
Please do.

1117
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,140
Evermore.

1118
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:24,840
Please give it to us.

1119
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:25,400
Just punch.

1120
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,200
Just give it to us.

1121
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,260
We were hoping

1122
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,140
we could have a big war, you know.

1123
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,820
And we were also hoping

1124
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,380
they'd take my social security

1125
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,440
and get a bunch of them

1126
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,060
crack-butt right-wing guys

1127
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,200
on the Supreme Court,

1128
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:38,760
you know, eh?

1129
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:40,140
And they'll see

1130
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,360
a homeland security.

1131
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,460
Oh, yeah, I was hoping

1132
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,300
I could get stopped

1133
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:44,260
every three blocks.

1134
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,560
And that's why

1135
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,100
I was one of the 37%

1136
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,240
of American registered voters

1137
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,200
who showed up

1138
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,520
to wave my fist

1139
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,040
in the occult sky

1140
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,000
and smack myself firmly

1141
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,560
between the genital areas.

1142
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,460
I am so glad.

1143
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:00,860
I was the first.

1144
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:01,480
And now I'm...

1145
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,960
Well, you hear the dogs, don't you?

1146
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:03,660
We better get out of here.

1147
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,680
Oh, here they come.

1148
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:05,260
Here they come.

1149
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,620
There were only 37 percenters

1150
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:07,880
total.

1151
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,480
I voted the wrong way, man.

1152
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,220
Here they come.

1153
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,680
It's those giant crickets.

1154
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,120
The tag glows.

1155
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:14,660
They're going to kill us.

1156
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,680
They can see the tag, man.

1157
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:16,600
Just keep moving.

1158
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:17,700
Cover up your arm.

1159
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:21,380
Till next week,

1160
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,640
keep your head on tight.

1161
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:25,880
You're back to the wind

1162
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,140
and you're sack in the saddle.

1163
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,840
Mr. Butch says his mandate

1164
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,720
means lots of fun

1165
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:35,740
for the people

1166
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,440
on top of the pie.

1167
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,660
For those squanderlings

1168
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,520
laying down near the bottom,

1169
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,660
there won't be much pie left.

1170
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,720
The crickets are only coming

1171
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,480
to the party.

1172
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:46,300
For the gravy.

1173
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:47,560
I want to know

1174
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,480
what I want to know.

1175
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,740
Like a diamond

1176
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:53,580
in the sky.

1177
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:57,300
Twinkle, twinkle,

1178
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,740
little star.

1179
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,360
How I wonder

1180
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,040
what you are.

1181
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,660
You have been listening to

1182
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:11,160
the subgenius radio ministry

1183
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,080
Hour of Slack.

1184
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:14,080

1191
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:28,300

01:00:59,440 --> 01:00:59,440

FOR GEARS AND

1211
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:06,140
Rhhhh plans.

1212
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,460
Do not stop us today.

1213
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,320
Don't move! Just stay still! Help!

1214
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:23,600
They're hanging in there upside down like in a slaughterhouse. I wish you'd seen it.

1215
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:24,660
I want to get a picture.

1216
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,260
Well, you better get to bed now, son. Have a good sleep.

1217
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,840
In the middle of the night?

1218
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,020
Yes.

1219
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,980
So now you listen and you listen good. Have a good sleep.
