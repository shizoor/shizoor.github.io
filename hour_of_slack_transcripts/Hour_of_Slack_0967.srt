1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,400
Mr. Speaker, a message from the Senate.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,480
The subgenius powerhouse mob.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,120
Oh, but we are. We're all here.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,740
We're all sitting here together right now. Remember?

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,740
Yes, and we were all sitting around at the Beachland Ballroom listening to the microphone when it came on.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,300
Yes, and my nose was expanding and parts of my brain were disappearing.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,280
Little pieces of my head were flying off into the atmosphere.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:30,880
Oh, my goodness.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,760
It was. It was. It was.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,220
Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above.

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,240
Don't fence me in.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,320
Let me linger for a while in the land that I love.

13
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,520
Don't fence me in.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,540
I want to ride to the west, to the sun.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,600
And gaze at the moon till I lose my senses.

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,800
And I can't stand huggers and I can't stand fences.

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,540
Don't fence me in.

18
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,340
Fuck you!

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,600
What's going on?

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,640
The answer is the U.S. military attacked a U.S. patrol killing four soldiers who refused to go on a convoy mission.

21
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,200
Convoys in Iraq frequently get ambushed on Friday.

22
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,360
A lot of people haven't arrived because Ralph Nader would be included.

23
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:37,340
Last month, Eagle County prosecutors dismissed Bryant after the woman accusing him of rape said that she did not want to participate in a string of break-ins targeting cars and RTD lots.

24
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,780
She is in a women's prison in West Virginia.

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,360
There you go.

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,920
I'm George W. Bush and I approve this message.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,960
Oh, golly.

28
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,300
He's a tomato plant fellow.

29
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:54,960
Oh!

30
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,480
I'm John Kerry and I approve this message.

31
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,420
Vote for Barry Goldwater.

32
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:13,360
Mr. Speaker, our president again wants dead and decaying human flesh from the governed.

33
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,600
Today, medical science patches up mutilated bodies transplanting humans in.

34
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,120
Eyes.

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,740
Lips.

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,040
Even vital organs.

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,260
Is the next step the transplantation of the human brain?

38
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,220
Many scientists answer yes, but they pause and add a grim warning.

39
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:42,120
For in the ancient folk legends, tales are told of blood-sucking vampires crawling out of graves to live on the bodies of helpless victims.

40
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,480
Is man now doomed to produce a race of ever-living monstrosities worse than the vampires of legend?

41
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,940
Will ruthless men and women of great wealth and power be able to survive?

42
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:58,960
Will the power greedily buy or steal the living bodies of the young and beautiful so their brains may live on forever?

43
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:07,220
Such questions may seem fanciful, but at this very moment scientists are working on the answer to brain transplantation.

44
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,300
And human bodies are used.

45
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,200
I'm George W. Bush and I approve this message.

46
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,000
Vote for Barry Goldwater.

47
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,640
Uh, uh, Mr. Bush says...

48
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,940
My opponent wants dick.

49
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,340
It's wrong to cross against the cars.

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:32,760
And when I'm president, we will tell scientists that they can't lead the world against the computers.

51
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,020
You're on your own shot there, thanks.

52
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,400
I want dick.

53
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Certainly the president's very large and very important.

54
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:47,000
Well, you know, Wally, there's a quotation from Shakespeare that kind of fits in here.

55
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,020
Take that gun out of your pants.

56
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,660
Well, I'm the president, I'm not going to give any shit.

57
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:56,920
Okay, so this is what I'm going to do.

58
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,900
I'm George W. Bush.

59
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,280
The president is going to be no more than a few years old.

60
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,280


61
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,900
And he's going to be the president.

62
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:03,900


63
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:03,900


64
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:03,900


65
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:03,900


66
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,000
And I approve this...

67
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,340
message.

68
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,000
Well, sort of.

69
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,060
Good evening.

70
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:17,240
And before I take your questions, let me speak with the American people about the situation in Iraq.

71
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,480
This has been tough weeks in that country.

72
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:21,920
And I'm going to talk to my friends.

73
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:21,920


74
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:21,920


75
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,320
If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.

76
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,080
Just so long as I'm the dictator.

77
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,060
You said we're headed to war in Iraq. I don't know why you say that.

78
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,120
I hope we're not headed to war in Iraq.

79
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,760
I'm the person who gets to decide, not you.

80
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,500
Our enemies are innovative and resourceful.

81
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,480
And so are we.

82
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,360
They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people.

83
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,160
And neither do we.

84
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,260
I was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go in,

85
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,480
and I saw an airplane hit the tower.

86
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,320
The TV was obviously on, and I used to fly myself,

87
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,140
and I said, well, there's one terrible pilot.

88
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,000
The Iraqi regime is a threat to any American

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,640
and to threats who are friends of America.

90
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,580
The goals for this country are peace in the world.

91
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,140
And the goals for this country are peace in the world.

92
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,840
We are a country, or a compassionate American,

93
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,260
for every single citizen.

94
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,400
I mentioned early on that I recognize there are hurdles,

95
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,600
and we're going to achieve those hurdles.

96
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,060
We're going to achieve what we need to achieve.

97
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,780
Porque este país es un gran país,

98
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,020
with great values.

99
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,140
For a century and a half now,

100
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,100
America and Japan

101
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,300
have formed one of the great

102
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,140
and enduring alliances,

103
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,260
dua ger de baguias sig Feuerwerk.

104
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:49,260


105
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,460
From that alliance has come an era of peace

106
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,380
y entre tanta fuera de paz.

107
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,120
So that's what tells the ideas.

108
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,640
And my job is to think beyond the immediate.

109
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,580
Nobody can threaten this country.

110
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,400
Oh, they may be able to

111
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,820
bomb a building.

112
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,500
There are some who feel like it,

113
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,080
the conditions are such that they can attack us there.

114
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,840
The answer is bring them on.

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,140
Hay que l Stalin Colombia a само arranged?

116
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,280
trying to shake the will of the Iraqi citizens, and they want us to leave.

117
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,520
That's what they want us to do.

118
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,760
And I think the world would be better off if we did leave.

119
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,020
If we left, the world would be worse.

120
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,940
The world is better off with us not leaving.

121
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,560
I want to remind you all that in order to fight and win the war,

122
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:45,120
it requires an expenditure of money that is commiserate with keeping a promise to our troops

123
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,220
to make sure that they're well-paid, well-trained, well-equipped.

124
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,720
And the other lesson is that there are people who can't stand what America stands for

125
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,120
and desire to conflict great harm on the American people.

126
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,260
See, without the tax relief package, there would have been a deficit,

127
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:12,920
but there wouldn't have been the kick to our economy that occurred as a result of the tax relief.

128
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,100
You're working hard to put food on your face.

129
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,320
The law signed today directs new funds and new focus to the task of collecting vital intelligence

130
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,840
on terrorist threats and on weapons of mass production.

131
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:31,920
We cannot let terrorists and rogue nations hold this nation hostile or hold our allies hostile.

132
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:39,080
To encourage them to start a ministry which will find the children of those who are incarcerated and love them.

133
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,080
Coalition forces have encountered serious violence in some areas of Iraq.

134
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,620
Our military commanders report that this violence is being instigated by three groups.

135
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,640
There's a lot of countries that have got a direct stake in whether or not North Korea has nuclear weapons.

136
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,160
We've got a stake as to whether North Korea has a nuclear weapon.

137
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,620
China clearly has a stake as to whether or not North Korea has a nuclear weapon.

138
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,960
South Korea, of course, has a stake.

139
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,720
Listen, people join terrorist organizations because there's no hope and there's no chance.

140
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,340
To raise their families in a peaceful world where there is not freedom.

141
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:29,340
It's in the interest of long-term peace in the world that we work for a free and secure and peaceful Iraq.

142
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,940
A free and secure Iraq in the midst of the Middle East will have enormous historical impact.

143
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,040
You're free and freedom is beautiful.

144
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,720
And, you know, it'll take time to restore chaos and order.

145
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,660
But we will.

146
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,640
Conspiracy theories abound in American politics.

147
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,900
I don't think we need to be subliminal about the differences between our views on prescription drugs.

148
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,780
We say to seniors, we understand how important prescription drug coverage.

149
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,460
So prescription drugs will be an ingrained part of the Medicare plan.

150
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:14,820
The, the, frankly, mood of the world.

151
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:27,260
I would have been astounded had the United States acted unilaterally in trying to deal with Al-Qaeda in that part of the world.

152
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,700
You know, I think the intelligence I get is darn good intelligence.

153
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,660
And the speeches I have given were backed by good intelligence.

154
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,120
Some of the other members of the crew are here as well.

155
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,700
Where are they, Robby?

156
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,800
Where are the members of your crew?

157
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,100
Here.

158
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,100


159
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,220
Well, they must have couldn't pass the security check.

160
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,540
What do you think tribal sovereignty means in the 21st century?

161
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,440
And how do we resolve conflicts between tribes and the federal and state governments?

162
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,140
Tribal sovereignty means that, sovereignty.

163
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:09,560
You're a, you're a, you've been given sovereignty and you're viewed as a sovereign entity.

164
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,880
Okay.

165
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,080
And therefore, the relationship between the two is not good.

166
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,340
The relationship between the federal government and tribes is one between sovereign entities.

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,660
America stands for liberty, for the pursuit of happiness, and for the unalienable right of life.

168
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:38,240
You know, I, I was campaigning in Chicago and somebody asked me what, is there ever any time where the budget might have to go into deficit?

169
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,100
I said only if we were at war or had a national emergency or in recession.

170
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,200
Oh, so there's no budget.

171
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,200
Just higher, higher so the government is doing for about $700 million.

172
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,840
And what does that have to do with...'It' don't exist as common sense though, do you think?

173
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,000
I've always wanted to make poison in milk.

174
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,000


175
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,520
So they can start picking one from the end to the other.

176
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:03,520


177
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,960
It's up to the state and the government.

178
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:06,960


179
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,040
would happen then?

180
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,040


181
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,640
ARE THE GREAT LEGAL LOF WE LEGAL LEGAL, NO, THEY'RE GOING TO L你的 BROTHERその

182
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,540
WHO LIE WHAT REALLY MAR

183
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,360
want to call it speech

184
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:29,340
I asked Americans to give 4,000 years 4,000 hours over the next or the rest of

185
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:35,900
your life of service to America that's what I asked I said to 4,000 hours

186
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,780
there's an old saying in Tennessee I know it's in Texas probably in Tennessee

187
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:47,400
that says fool me once shame on shame on you

188
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:57,620
fool me we can't get fooled again for once at this Thursday ticket counters and

189
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,980
airplanes will fly out of Ronald Reagan Air Force

190
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,960
uh yes

191
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,820
dude

192
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:05,880
stop it!

193
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,480
dear friends

194
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,380
uh cut-ups there by yours truly and uh Fernanda Nende-Lemur and tonight

195
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:18,940
is uh Halloween two days before the horrible election

196
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:35,420
it's there's people disguised as monsters on the street and monsters

197
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:41,300
disguised as people in Washington and uh Rudy Schwartz project in the background

198
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:49,300
and lonesome cowboy Dave in the studio and princess we are dough and we're out

199
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:57,340
of candy yes it really is as we broadcast tonight it's it was Halloween

200
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:03,180
don't know when it was for you we have no more sugary tweets we only have little

201
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,400
nuggets of truth to dispense with our hearts and our minds and our minds and our

202
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,300
to the children and hope that they do not

203
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,180
vomit in their sleep and fall

204
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,560
into a deep coma.

205
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,320
I promise you they don't want that.

206
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,340
They don't want the

207
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,380
nuggets of truth. They probably would love the deep

208
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,320
coma. Oh, yes, of course. As the

209
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
romantic movement grew, we noticed

210
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,580
there were many, many more suicides

211
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,080
throughout the land. People

212
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,700
dressing up in drag and

213
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,360
blue shoes and

214
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,960
drinking tryptophan

215
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,840
and then...

216
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,840
Well, you know, when you've had everything, you start

217
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,660
thinking, well, I want to try death

218
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,880
next. We may

219
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,900
not have much choice after a

220
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,880
while. Yes, it'll be chosen for

221
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,560
us, I think. We all will get the

222
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,940
ticket at the end and we'll get

223
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,900
our stubs punched. Well, we

224
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
all end up on our heads, you know, Bob

225
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,740
said. One and all, the

226
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,380
greatest and the lowliest.

227
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,880
That's not very...

228
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,800
That doesn't really make me feel all that

229
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,460
much better when I see the

230
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,880
lowly suddenly become great

231
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,500
because of the other

232
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,400
lowly. The lowly

233
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,360
outnumber the highly, I guess.

234
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,480
Well, they certainly do, but we cannot

235
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,780
bring the highly down.

236
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,640
We struggle, we struggle, and yet

237
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,880
the highly remain on high.

238
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,340
I don't know, man. I'm feeling

239
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,260
kind of brought down.

240
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,460
But that's maybe because my neck

241
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,600
hurts. Well, it may be because of that

242
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,420
huge, gaping neck wound

243
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,880
inflicted on you by

244
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,140
one of your little teenage

245
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,320
twicker tweeters with a George

246
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,040
Bush pin on its thing.

247
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,980
That wasn't one of them. It was the anxiety

248
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,220
about them. It was the anxiety,

249
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,340
it was the worry about them that caused me

250
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,560
to cut myself.

251
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,460
I was anxious because they

252
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,620
burned it down

253
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,780
and then they tried

254
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,480
to resurrect it

255
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,660
and then I

256
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,800
had to vote for

257
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,720
the fatherland

258
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,880
and I had no choice.

259
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,620
I had no choice. I could vote

260
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,440
for Adol

261
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,400
for sickle.

262
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,600
I could vote for

263
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,700
von Hindenburg.

264
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,500
I used to vote for Hindenburg,

265
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,800
but the taxes went down,

266
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,940
but Hitler says

267
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,800
no new taxes.

268
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,920
The taxes...

269
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,240
I am dogs.

270
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,100
Get that thing.

271
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,120
I am dogs.

272
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,660
As I march into Poland,

273
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,220
I can already feel my

274
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,480
feet begin to stink.

275
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,620
It was the same way we rolled into Baghdad

276
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,120
on the 4th of May

277
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,360
2002.

278
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,880
What? When was it again?

279
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,060
I don't know.

280
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,720
Somebody close the window and get these flies out of here.

281
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,740
Drag the corpses out.

282
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,480
Culturally and genetically

283
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,100
engineered buzzard.

284
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,160
Buzzing thing.

285
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,740
What is it?

286
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,660
I've got one of those

287
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,540
protest songs

288
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,460
coming up by a protestical

289
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,240
please fellow. Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

290
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,580
I've heard about him.

291
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,440
It's a live recording.

292
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,420
Have you tried the ergot eye wash?

293
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,600
Oh, it is

294
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,440
very, very

295
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,040
sick.

296
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,240
Yes, I have.

297
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,180
The president's on the phone

298
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,700
talking to his mom and dad.

299
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,220
The president's

300
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,200
on the phone

301
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,060
talking to his mom

302
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,840
and dad.

303
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,060
The president's on TV.

304
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,800
Talking to you and me.

305
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,700
He's talking about liberty.

306
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,060
But you and I.

307
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,840
Meanwhile

308
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,020
outside the world is coming

309
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,700
down in a pile of shit.

310
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,260
There's war and revolution.

311
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,140
Suffering destitution.

312
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,720
The government seems proud of it.

313
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,060
Of the president's

314
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
on the phone.

315
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,940
Talking to his mom

316
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,480
and dad.

317
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,160
Saying should I

318
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,500
turn over evidence

319
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,340
or be a good old

320
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,900
stonewall lad.

321
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,280
The president's

322
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,720
with Karl Rove.

323
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,580
Talking to his White House

324
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,340
aides.

325
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,560
The president's

326
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,760
program control.

327
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,540
Making sure they don't

328
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,260
see the hope.

329
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,300
Meanwhile

330
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,320
outside the world is

331
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,640
tumbling down in a pile

332
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,520
of shit.

333
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,920
There's war and revolution.

334
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,080
Pain and destitution.

335
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,340
And the government seems proud of it.

386
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,300
Meanwhile, outside the world is tumbling down in a pile of shit.

387
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,820
There's war and revolution, pain and destitution.

388
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,160
The government seems proud of it.

389
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:59,320
The president's on the White House lawn, talking about opportunity.

390
00:18:59,320 --> 00:18:59,900
Opportunity.

391
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,100
He's talking about opportunity.

392
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,240
As if there's enough for folks like you and me.

393
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:14,540
The president's on TV, telling us we're all free.

394
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:21,860
The president's in your mind, when nobody can see.

395
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:29,300
Meanwhile, outside the world is tumbling down in a pile of shit.

396
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,900
There's war and revolution, pain and destitution.

397
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,400
The government seems proud of it.

398
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,460
The president's in your mind.

399
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,060
The president's in your head.

400
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,720
The president's in your head.

401
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,500
The president's in your head.

402
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,160
Right.

403
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,280
The president's in your head.

404
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,300
Lonesome cowboy Dave in thine ear bones.

405
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,100
The who?

406
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:20,380
Of course we're doing everything we can to protect America.

407
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,360
It's hard work.

408
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,060
But by speaking clearly, it'll mean it's less likely.

409
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,040
And less likely we have to use force.

410
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,720
I wake up every day thinking about how best to protect America.

411
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,680
That's my job.

412
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,140
To, uh...

413
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,000
And, uh...

414
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,420
To, uh...

415
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,300
There's a lot of good people working hard.

416
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,520
And we're making progress there.

417
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,300
We've done a lot of good work.

418
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,600
We've done a lot of hard work together over the last three and a half years.

419
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,340
And I have, uh...

420
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,140
I understand what it means to be the commander-in-chief.

421
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,060
We're making progress.

422
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,380
I, uh...

423
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,080
Let me finish.

424
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,440
Of course I know Osama bin Laden attacked us.

425
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,840
I know that.

426
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,840
Of course we're after, uh...

427
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,200
Saddam Hussein.

428
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,300
I mean, uh, bin Laden.

429
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,360
He's, he's, he's...

430
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,540
Let me say, I certainly hope so.

431
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,280
Uh, I think that by speaking clearly...

432
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,720
Uh...

433
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,900
Let me, um...

434
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,300
You know, my hardest...

435
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,300
The hardest part of the job is to, um...

436
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,740
No doubt about it, it's tough.

437
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,220
And, uh, it is, uh...

438
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,660
One of the things I've learned in the White House is that...

439
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,860
There's enormous pressure on the president.

440
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,500
And you cannot wilt under that pressure.

441
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,680
Otherwise...

442
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,320
Um...

443
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,080
Understand that, uh...

444
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,240
We must...

445
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,780
Um...

446
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,240
Before I, uh...

447
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,040
I, I just think...

448
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
I believe that, uh...

449
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,740
Uh...

450
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,400
What you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right for...

451
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:11,860
Interact.

452
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,340
Uh, you cannot lead...

453
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,440
If you send mixed, mixed messages.

454
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,740
And so the answer to your question is...

455
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,980
You know, it's hard work.

456
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,500
Uh, Phineas Narco from nationalcynicalradio.com.

457
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,780
Oh, God.

458
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,880
That's wonderful.

459
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,700
One chromosome too many.

460
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,920
He's my president.

461
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:46,940
Now, did you hear the story that Prescott Bush actually was the one who introduced the alien chromosome into the rest of the family's corpus habium?

462
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,840
And that's why he has the extra spinal attachment.

463
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,840
Like, he's got a little vestigial tail down there.

464
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,860
But it's not cute.

465
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,300
It looks like, you know, it's like, um...

466
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,500
Uh, uh...

467
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:56,760
Um...

468
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,580
It's got a...

469
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,260
It's a...

470
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,600
Monde-loid...

471
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,220
Monde-loid!

472
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,780
And he determined what he could see!

473
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,040
Monde-loid!

474
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,600
He was a monde-loid!

475
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,540
Determined that he would be...

476
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,560
The president of these here, you...

477
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,500
The restless snakes.

478
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:17,740
The restless snakes!

479
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,960
These uneasy sounds.

480
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,280
These uneasy sounds.

481
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,380
These uneasy sounds.

482
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,580
Well...

483
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,480
This is a cover of Monde-loid, played by Monde-loid.

484
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,680
Mongoloids at X-Day.

485
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,980
Actual mongoloids, too.

486
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,740
Yeah, it's the acid corpses, I believe.

487
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,080
So do they have three X's and two Y's?

488
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,820
Or besides the vestigial tail and the X-Line?

489
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,040
Oh, wait.

490
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,600
Here's the horny one.

491
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,120
That's the sexy, sexy one.

492
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,160
Anyway.

493
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,900
Let me make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make, make.

494
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,420
It's incredibly hard.

495
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,700
Need some wood?

496
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,000
It is hard.

497
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,460
It is hard.

498
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,460
It's incredibly hard.

499
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:57,820
It is.

500
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,640
It's incredibly hard.

501
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,060
It is hard.

502
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,620
It's incredibly hard.

503
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,500
It is.

504
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,680
It's incredibly hard.

505
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,480
It is.

506
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,880
It is.

507
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,340
It is.

508
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:07,560


509
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,980
It is.

510
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,980
It is.

511
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:09,980


512
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:09,980


513
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:09,980


514
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:09,980


515
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:09,980


516
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:09,980


517
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:09,980


518
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,840
Need some wood?

519
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,540
Understand how hard it is.

520
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,920
Missy understood that.

521
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,860
I think about Missy Johnson's fantastic body.

522
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:26,720
I told her after we came together, change positions.

523
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,620
Speed up.

524
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,400
Speed up.

525
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,360
Change positions.

526
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,080
Quicker.

527
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:30,900
Quicker.

528
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,840
Here, we're getting the job done.

529
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,640
It's incredibly hard.

530
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,820
I try to love her as best as I can.

531
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,500
We were very much involved.

532
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,540
It's incredibly hard.

533
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,920
It's a matter of using every asset at our disposal.

534
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,800
It's incredibly hard.

535
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:54,720
Just be.

536
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,840
It's incredibly hard.

537
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,980
You need some wood?

538
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,140
It's hard.

539
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,780
It's incredibly hard.

540
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,120
You need some wood?

541
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,060
Once there was a boy down south

542
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,800
Always had snot running across his mouth

543
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,260
What's that mess boy the neighbors would say?

544
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,820
Why is that snot on your face that way?

545
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,320
Snot, not riddle, snot, not riddle

546
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,140
Snot, not riddle, snot, not riddle all day

547
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,120
Mama sent him to the grocery store

548
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,780
Asked him to buy three eggs times four

549
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,320
Run back home for the grocery man say

550
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,000
Why is that snot on your face that way?

551
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,520
Snot, not riddle, snot, not riddle

552
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,120
Snot, not riddle, snot, not riddle all day

553
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,860
Soon this boy became a man

554
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,200
What did you know?

555
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,080
The master plan

556
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,500
So to the Lord he did say

557
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,540
Hey God, why is this snot on my face this way?

558
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:09,580
Huh?

559
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:14,840
Hey God, God why, why do I have this snot all over my face like this God?

560
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:15,640
Huh?

561
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,360
Hey, hey God, why is this snot on my face like this God?

562
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,680
Snot, not riddle, snot, not riddle all day

563
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,400
Snot, not riddle, snot, not riddle all day

564
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,100
Snot, not riddle, snot, not riddle all day

565
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
Snot, not riddle, snot, not riddle all day

566
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,380
Snot, not riddle, snot, not riddle all day

567
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,000
Snot, not riddle all day

568
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,340
I love her and the Ink, she takes the kids down here before they put them in the snot mart

569
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:38,280
I hear those trains running day and night, day and night

570
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,920
I hear their anguished cries as they went by

571
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,840
Never did much don't but waves

572
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,680
Those were the days

573
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,260
Sometimes we see their little fingers

574
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,540
Stick, stick, stick, stick

575
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,200
I see their little fingers sticking out of the box

576
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,980
Car bar blue

577
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,680
It's so painful just to think about, isn't it?

578
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,560
Oh, not for me.

579
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,580
I enjoyed sometimes if little toes and fingers would fall off,

580
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,800
I'd come back and collect them, make soup for the family,

581
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,000
and everybody enjoyed it.

582
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,780
That's just disgusting.

583
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,720
And it's, you know, life is for the moment.

584
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,240
And it was a beautiful moment.

585
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,180
I guess you could think of it as sort of recycling.

586
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,460
The red sky, the Zyklon B in the air,

587
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,020
and the trains going by,

588
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,420
and the exciting sounds of the clicky-clack.

589
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,480
Sometimes they all have, all the cars would be from Korea,

590
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,920
and China, and Japan.

591
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,640
And sometimes there'd be a man with it,

592
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,100
like he looked like a little cartoon figure

593
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,360
and a big old W on his head.

594
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,340
I guess he was selling the hamburgers.

595
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,860
They didn't eat too much after the first love fest, though.

596
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,260
Most of the hairs, well, they were pretty well depilated.

597
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:51,400
And, of course, the mind just can't watch the watering down.

598
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:51,780
Yes.

599
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,460
It can't.

600
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,020
It can't hold it.

601
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,220
Yes.

602
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,620
It's like a sieve.

603
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:55,860
Yes.

604
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,460
Steel sieve.

605
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,780
As we see from these four appropriate messages being beamed in,

606
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,620
it appears that we are actually literally making some sort of contact.

607
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,640
And I would expect the president of these here United Snakes

608
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,620
is going to be standing firmly out on that White House lawn.

609
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,980
And he's not going to be sputin' dog pootie.

610
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:20,900
No, he's going to be talking to whoever this group is,

611
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,140
these aliens.

612
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,460
These aliens.

613
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:22,460


614
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,360
These people with a third nostril.

615
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,920
These strange beings who...

616
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,280
Wait a minute.

617
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,300
I think I need to...

618
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:27,880
I think I need to...

619
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,720
I think I need to...

620
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,280
I think I need to...

621
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,520
I think I need to...

622
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:31,700
I...

623
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:32,980
Listen.

624
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:33,760
Time.

625
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,780
We need guns.

626
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,460
Manumission.

627
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,360
We need hair.

628
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,560
We need...

629
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,360
Hello.

630
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,620
Abu Ghraib Detention Facility.

631
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,420
How may I help you?

632
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,240
Hello, this is Amir Samir.

633
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:51,980
Amir.

634
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:51,980


635
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,460
Amir.

636
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:52,460


637
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:52,460


638
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:52,460


639
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:52,460


640
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:52,460


641
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:52,460


642
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:52,460


643
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:52,460


644
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:52,460


645
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:52,460


646
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:52,460


647
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,940
I seem to have lost my children

648
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,800
during the last curfew roundup.

649
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,340
Could you tell me where they might be?

650
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,400
Hold on for a minute.

651
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,140
Your call is important to us.

652
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,840
Please stay on the line

653
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,720
until a directory assistance operator can help you.

654
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,040
All service operators are currently busy.

655
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,100
Your call is important to us.

656
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,100
Thank you.

657
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,720
Thank you.

658
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,400
Thank you.

659
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,140
Our book of red is bound to be your bread.

660
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,120
Better get inside before curfew.

661
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,820
Our book of red is bound to be your bread.

662
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,860
Better get inside before curfew.

663
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,860
Better not demonstrate.

664
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,280
Better not try to procreate.

665
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,200
Better get inside before curfew.

666
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,880
Our book of red is bound to be your resting place.

667
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,800
Better get inside before curfew.

668
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,420
Our book of red is bound to be your final grave.

669
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,520
Better get inside before curfew.

670
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,160
Our book of red is bound to make you change your ways.

671
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,240
Better get inside before curfew.

672
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:52,460
Our book of red is bound to be your final grave.

673
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,220
Its got tape gonna be your final grave.

674
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,440
Better get inside before curfew.

675
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,180
Better not chain your neck.

676
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,100
Better not do the best old hair.

677
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,040
Our book of red is going to be your final resting place.

678
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,900
Your final resting place.

679
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,840
Your final resting place.

680
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,800
Your final resting place.

681
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,920
The Band bulbars are on…

682
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:14,920


683
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,260
Two…

684
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,600
Four…

685
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,660
Five….

686
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,160
six…

687
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,240
Seven…

688
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,620
And Bush laughs and laughs and laughs because somebody voted for Nader.

689
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:39,780
You know, I guess some people thought, I know, I'll vote my conscience this time instead of the lesser of two evils.

690
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,880
Better stick with that lesser of two evils next time, friends.

691
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:58,700
Well, that was Lonesome Cowboy Dave at the Beachland Ballroom at some subgenius revival at some point in the past.

692
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,740
I don't know which one. I can't remember.

693
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:11,740
And before that, Rudy Schwartz Project, the great Rudy Schwartz Project, doing snot mouth tweedle, a thinly veiled allegory of current events.

694
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,860
Now, staying on.

695
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,060
I hate to interrupt you right there.

696
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,420
I was going to ask you the interviewer type question, but go ahead.

697
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,400
Oh, no, no, no.

698
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:19,700
I was going to ask.

699
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,140
No, you go ahead.

700
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,280
No, you go ahead.

701
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,960
No, that's all right.

702
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,200
I'll go ahead.

703
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,240
All right, then.

704
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,860
Stan, what do you think of the thing in the back of the president's neck?

705
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,100
The thing hanging between his scapula and his vertebrae?

706
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,840
Well, you know as well as I do, that's what they used to control him.

707
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,940
I mean, that's the receiver.

708
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,360
That's what I thought.

709
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:43,080
Yeah, the receiver, the actual, one of the tentacles itself, perhaps, even, right?

710
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:43,860
Or does he get...

711
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,220
Is he the puppet one, or is he still one of the Bohemian Club hillbillies?

712
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,720
Well, you know, I've always...

713
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,460
You know, at this point, I have, to tell the truth, haven't been paying that close of attention.

714
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,560
At this point, what does it matter?

715
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,960
He could be one of the puppets.

716
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,980
He could be one of the clones.

717
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,420
He could be the real George Bush, somehow transformed, like in that stupid Stepford Wives movie.

718
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,220
The Stepford Presidents.

719
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:11,660
Well, he could really be one of the puppet presidents, not only as a puppet of the, you know, whoever controllers,

720
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,000
but that thing in the back.

721
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,660
It might be like, you know, Team America.

722
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,580
They might have...

723
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:20,760
Trey Parker and those guys might have, you know, I mean, they might have actually sussed on to something,

724
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,500
as they used to say in Popeye Island.

725
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,840
You know, they might have smoked something out, and it didn't feel good.

726
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,720
Well, now, how many puppets down the line are you talking about here?

727
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:34,820
Well, I'm talking about that apparatus on the back of his whacker that makes him talk quicker and makes him lick faster.

728
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,320
Right, and you better hope the right guy has the remote control.

729
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:39,980
That's right.

730
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,120
That's, you know, just like they blew up the world.

731
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,020
They built Tate Centers with a remote control, one of those little games.

732
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,620
Yeah, they used a Sega, I think.

733
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,000
Yeah, a Sega.

734
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,180
Just, that's how he went through the debates, as remote as you can be.

735
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,480
They said he had a remote look in his eyes.

736
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:05,740
Well, you know, speaking of remote, Princess Wee and I are going to be leaving the country shortly after the erection,

737
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,040
and do you think we'll be back?

738
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,040
I don't know.

739
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,980
Depending if the encumbrance is still encumbrating us.

740
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,000
Uh-oh, that's all I can think.

741
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,440
Yeah.

742
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:22,780
Whatever happens this election, the nutty squirrels have it right.

743
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,460
You might be voting for Feisthelmer von Wuchenschmapp, the schnick-schlapper for dog capture.

744
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,140
That's right.

745
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,480
Capturer.

746
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:35,840
When I was a little kid, they said in Russia, they don't give you any choice of who to vote for.

747
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,600
It's just, you know, you just get one vote, and it's just for this one guy.

748
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,780
And then we have one TV station.

749
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,240
Comrade X.

750
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:41,540
Yeah.

751
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:49,300
And it's all government stuff, talking about how evil us Americans are, and how great the party is.

752
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:55,400
And somewhere in between, there's that book and movie and comic book called 1984,

753
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,640
which is a little bit out of date by about 20 years, kind of dated.

754
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:03,240
But, you know, you put it all together, and you go...

755
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,100
You know, dude...

756
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,300
Well, who do you think, Dave?

757
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:13,660
It's true.

758
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,240
Dave, who do you think is going to win, Predator or Alien?

759
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,820
Or will we all lose?

760
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:25,900
I think we'll all lose to the Predators and Aliens running this cavuncular hospice we call UXA.

761
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,780
It's a gone deal, man.

762
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,700
You know what I mean?

763
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,740
What I'm saying, they've already pre-registered...

764
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,920
I forgot what I was talking about.

765
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,740
Oh, yeah.

766
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,240
All those implants.

767
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,140
Yeah, right.

768
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,360
That's what happens.

769
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,080
When you start talking...

770
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,560
About the subject...

771
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,360
What were we talking about?

772
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,460
See, friends, it's not...

773
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,500
It's not conspiracy.

774
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,920
It's actually difficult to brainwash somebody into talking about something,

775
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:58,480
but it's very easy to brainwash them into not talking about something.

776
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,040
Allow the flow to go.

777
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,620
It may come out in strange rivulets of otherworldly spokeages.

778
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,020
Some people even have taken the stuff down, all the way down,

779
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,300
and...

780
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:16,160
And it still comes out pretty much legitimate business for the rest of them.

781
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,960
That's BAU, of course, which stands for BAU.

782
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:26,860
Well, luckily, we in Ohio don't have to worry because some Ohioan guy makes the voting machines,

783
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,060
and he's a good friend of George Bush's.

784
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,660
Yes, and Taft.

785
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,540
And has said that he wants to help put the emperor back...

786
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,560
You know, keep the imp in place.

787
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,600
The imp.

788
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,620
The imp perverse, I would say.

789
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,140
He reminds me of the imp perverse, and I've noticed...

790
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:45,880
You know, the colloquial little drawings that have been done by each little neighborhood in the world

791
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,640
that show his ears sprouting into a kind of demonic thing,

792
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,760
and his forehead going backward into kind of like a bowling pin shape,

793
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,400
and he looks like Alien.

794
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,680
The Alien, you know?

795
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,600
Have you known...

796
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,080
Oh, I'm sorry.

797
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,920
She's dangerously...

798
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,400
I thought those were supposed to be you.

799
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,320
The big...

800
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:01,860
No, the big...

801
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,920
I thought those pictures in Mad Magazine were supposed to be you.

802
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,100
Those funny-looking guys acting stupid.

803
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:07,960
No, they're being...

804
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,020
I thought they were supposed to be you.

805
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,800
The big signals tonight.

806
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,320
Oh.

807
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,640
When the waves are dense, there's no...

808
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,160
I bet the waves are going to be so dense on historical erection day

809
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,780
that nobody will be able to maintain the encumbrance

810
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,320
unless they're wearing the wrong, you know...

811
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,320
Well...

812
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,080
Nobody will be able to maintain, period, okay?

813
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:28,580
Yeah.

814
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,660
Well, that's...

815
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,840
Yeah, that's exactly it.

816
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,560
I mean, you just won't be able to maintain.

817
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,180
No.

818
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:33,500
All right?

819
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,460
I think a lot of people are going to be flipping nervous

820
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,000
and going, yeah, yeah, right out there in front of the booths.

821
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,020
Do you?

822
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:41,700
I don't know.

823
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,100
I've seen this happen so many times before.

824
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,340
And everybody...

825
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,760
The monkeys get all upset.

826
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,320
I know.

827
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,180
They get riled up.

828
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,260
They rattle their cage.

829
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,540
Throw the food back at the keepers.

830
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,600
They fling their poo around.

831
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:55,380
Yeah.

832
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:59,000
And then, in the end, they're still behind bars

833
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,900
and everybody's still laughing at them,

834
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,040
going, look at those silly monkeys.

835
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,880
Yeah, and then they burn the Reichstag again

836
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,060
and then the monkeys are laughing again.

837
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,580
Yeah.

838
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,900
Hey, what happened to the October surprise?

839
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,020
Well, I was pretty surprised.

840
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,760
I was surprised that a month actually happened

841
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,760
and we didn't all die.

842
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,240
I mean, so far.

843
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,480
Well, no, they promised us we're going to die

844
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,660
every couple of days.

845
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,780
You're going to die tomorrow.

846
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,640
Yeah, you're going to die because the evildoers...

847
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,580
Be careful of Tuesday.

848
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,400
Tuesday is your walking dead day.

849
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,220
But one of these days, it's going to be...

850
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,520
It's going to happen, you know.

851
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,040
Well, yeah, well...

852
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,660
It's going to happen.

853
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,200
You know, Bob said it's going to be a bummer.

854
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,960
But will we be zombies then going to the booths?

855
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,520
In the same old way that we have...

856
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,540
His prediction came true.

857
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,500
It is a bummer.

858
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,400
I'll be a good zombie going to the booth.

859
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,380
My daughter called me up to make sure I was.

860
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,980
She said, Dad, you're not so radical

861
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,920
that you don't even vote, are you?

862
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,760
And I was like, well, yeah, I am,

863
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,880
but I'm going to vote anyway.

864
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:56,980
Yeah.

865
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,080
Just in case, you know, just because.

866
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,680
I don't know, just so I can get off work.

867
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,940
So do you have to go to a voting booth to get it off?

868
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,480
I do, yeah.

869
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,780
Can you go to a phone booth and just start screaming

870
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,740
and pounding on the windows?

871
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,120
No, this year they've made sure that you have to

872
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,520
dot all your I's and T's and punch your chads and everything

873
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,360
or they won't...

874
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,920
Especially if you have that one vote.

875
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,840
And they'll throw that one out.

876
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,180
Especially in a swing state full of swingers like Ohio.

877
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:28,880
Oh, yeah.

878
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:32,780
And Ohio is full of some of the ugliest swingers.

879
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,480
I drive by those trailer courts off the highway

880
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,440
and look and go, that's where that picture I saw

881
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,660
on the internet was taken.

882
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,060
Why?

883
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,400
Because the people in that trailer,

884
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,360
they're the ones I saw in the orgy shot on the internet.

885
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,420
Those are the ones that you...

886
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,640
They're the ones that are going to go and vote on Tuesday

887
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,020
or stay in their trailer.

888
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,220
Sometimes you think, man, maybe they shouldn't vote.

889
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,360
Maybe democracy was the worst idea that ever happened.

890
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,340
Maybe the king was right.

891
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,360
That last king was right.

892
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,200
You cannot trust the people because look what they do.

893
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,460
But that was supposed to be built into the Constitution,

894
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,600
you know, that magical...

895
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,080
That was supposed to be a document

896
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:15,580
that had some modicum of the people's will.

897
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,860
Because let's face it,

898
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,340
you can't really let the people call the shots.

899
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:24,560
I mean, if you voted by, you know, your television,

900
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,660
say every idiot,

901
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,620
okay, today we're all going to vote.

902
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,280
Should we go to war with Russia?

903
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,240
Everyone who wants to vote yes.

904
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,420
If they're playing the right theme music,

905
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,820
everybody's going to vote yes.

906
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,660
Do you really want to leave it up

907
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,720
to the people?

908
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,500
the Americans, the people

909
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,840
who elected this guy in the first place?

910
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,700
Do you want to leave anything up

911
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,320
to them for now? Or do you think

912
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:50,180
perhaps a dictatorship under

913
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,760
a kind and benevolent

914
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,960
benign dictator

915
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,520
like J.R. Bob Dobbs

916
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,920
an illuminated one.

917
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,420
But this is not the year

918
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,900
to write in J.R. Bob Dobbs

919
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,680
as world over.

920
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,560
Those of you who are dumb enough to listen, please do not be

921
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,160
dumb enough to write in Bob J.R. Bob Dobbs

922
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,500
for president.

923
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,600
I did that last time and look what

924
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,200
happened. Hey, don't blame me.

925
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,540
I voted for Bob.

926
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,320
Go ahead and blame me.

927
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,220
It's my fault.

928
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,440
No matter who wins or loses

929
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,580
it's always going to ultimately be

930
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:28,960
the conspiracy's fault.

931
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,620
And Dobbs is

932
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,100
always going to be the

933
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:32,600
what?

934
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,620
It's always the conspiracy's fault and it wasn't

935
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,720
really Bob's fault.

936
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,940
Or if it was Bob's fault

937
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:40,440
it was really

938
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:40,720
Conor's fault.

939
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,280
It was Connie's fault.

940
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,060
Because you know you don't really directly blame

941
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,140
the world overlord.

942
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,960
You always blame his wife or his underlings.

943
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,820
Yeah, you blame the first lady

944
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,060
and she's not involved in nearly enough projects

945
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,480
to be a suitable first lady of our land.

946
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,460
You know, let alone of any large

947
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,640
or small church.

948
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,280
Princess, we and I were discussing the difference

949
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,560
between the Democrats and the Republicans

950
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,300
and the way they deal with their

951
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,060
used up women

952
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,020
after these politicians.

953
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,420
Like in a Democratic White House

954
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,240
your biggest problem is going to be

955
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,260
blue dresses

956
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,340
and sweaters clogging up

957
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,120
the toilets, you know, as people

958
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,400
have tried to flush them away.

959
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,380
Whereas under a Republican administration

960
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,060
they just kill the hookers.

961
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,000
And so you've got, in their case, the entirety

962
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,180
of Chesapeake Bay backing up

963
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,180
with dead presidential

964
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,320
hookers that they've used

965
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,260
and wisely cast away

966
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,040
and made sure they weren't going to go telling

967
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,760
their little buddy somewhere

968
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,100
about, oh look, I got collected some sperm.

969
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:40,720
off the president.

970
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,640
Let's make a little waterhead president

971
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,320
clone baby.

972
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,340
Let's make a little lonesome

973
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,480
cowboy George.

974
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,980
President, lonesome cowboy George.

975
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,480
The monkey animal president.

976
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,100
Oh, been there, done that.

977
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,960
You know, if you're out of the beltway,

978
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:56,820
a lot of these...

979
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,840
Let's get another rich person.

980
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,220
Yeah, we need another rich person.

981
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,260
My dad, I caught my own dad going,

982
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,300
well at least Bush is a Texan.

983
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,740
He's a rich Connecticut Yankee

984
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,520
acting,

985
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,540
like a stupid Texan,

986
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,860
so stupid Texans won't vote for him.

987
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,420
At least he's a German.

988
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,080
You know, he could be, you know,

989
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,620
Swiss or Slovenian,

990
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,920
but thank God the Fuhrer is a German.

991
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:23,240
I will vote for him.

992
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:24,940
My family comes from

993
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:26,920
Bavaria.

994
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,500
And I...

995
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,920
You know, ironically enough, my family

996
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,700
actually does come from Texas

997
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,680
and Connecticut.

998
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:35,620
And Mexico.

999
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:36,540
Mexico.

1000
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:39,360
Well, it was Mexico and then they called it Texas.

1001
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:40,380
And then they called it Mexico.

1002
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:40,440
And then they called it Mexico.

1003
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:40,460
And then they called it Mexico.

1004
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:40,460


1005
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:40,460


1006
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:40,460


1007
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:40,460


1008
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:40,460


1009
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:40,460


1010
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,000
Didn't you say your old Uncle Pappy

1011
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,320
Rubric Cube or whatever?

1012
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,720
He was a wetback.

1013
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,740
He swam across a river,

1014
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,880
but it was the English channel.

1015
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,180
What have we got coming up next?

1016
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,660
Oh, let's have some music.

1017
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,360
How about that band,

1018
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,600
Lonesome Cowboy Dave?

1019
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,140
I suppose this isn't music.

1020
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,740
You know, what are you...

1021
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,600
I'm digging this music that's going on right now.

1022
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,980
We better soak up the slack volume.

1023
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:10,700
You can't, kids.

1024
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,480
It's full of things you can't control.

1025
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,060
It's going to all be taken away.

1026
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,360
Of course it is my childhood.

1027
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,220
Favorite music.

1028
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,660
It's the Nutty Squirrels.

1029
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,380
I'd like to see Laura Bush

1030
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,740
scat along with the Nutty Squirrels.

1031
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,440
Live. I'd like to see these guys live.

1032
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,880
Maybe at Democracy Plaza, you know,

1033
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,800
ice skating at Christmas time after they've won the election

1034
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,020
and Iraq ceases to be even a place.

1035
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,140
You know, geographical area.

1036
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:40,920
That isn't...

1037
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,000
It'll all be like a big shopping mall someday.

1038
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,220
I hope so.

1039
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,500
Where can you find finer things

1040
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,180
than an Iraqi shopping mall

1041
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:52,120
that goes all the way from the Arabian Sea

1042
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,860
all the way up to the coast of Turkey

1043
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,720
and then narrow borderline

1044
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,620
that guards it from the rest of the world?

1045
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,500
I think you could find it in any of the shopping malls,

1046
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,280
like the one that goes from North Dallas to South Austin

1047
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,580
or the shopping mall that goes from South Washington

1048
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,020
to Northern Boston.

1049
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,400
Any of those big malls.

1050
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,240
Well, do you think anybody will ever notice

1051
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,960
the spasm, you know, these weird spasms

1052
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,220
in the face that Bush makes at different times?

1053
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,120
Do you think anybody's ever going to say anything about it?

1054
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,740
Well, you know, now, to be fair,

1055
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,020
like where you take your pig,

1056
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,340
I was cutting that Bush stuff up

1057
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,020
and I thought...

1058
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,620
I've had people cut up my speech patterns.

1059
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,880
To be careful where you take your pig?

1060
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:34,800
And...

1061
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,020
I'm trying to...

1062
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,220
I learned it from you, Dave!

1063
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,400
Anyway, um...

1064
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,600
We, uh...

1065
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,160
What the hell was I talking about?

1066
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,160
Let's just play that song.

1067
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,180
You were taking your pig out for a dance.

1068
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,980
Yeah, now, see, I can't even...

1069
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:49,440
I tried to...

1070
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,200
Pizza flag!

1071
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,320
I was trying to be...

1072
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,680
I learned it from you, Dave.

1073
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,200
A pizza and a soda.

1074
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,720
I'd like to salute the flag

1075
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,280
to which we all swear a republic

1076
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,480
to the United States of America.

1077
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,020
The flag known as...

1078
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,180
O'Gory.

1079
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,860
Well, I'm proud to salute

1080
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,140
O'Gory.

1081
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,360
O'Gory.

1082
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,660
And the colors for which she stands.

1083
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,780
She stands.

1084
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,900
Red for the blood.

1085
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,040
Pow! Pow! Pow!

1086
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,240
White for the guts.

1087
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,720
Pow! Pow! Pow!

1088
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,980
Blue for the blue-bodied bag.

1089
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,080
Zip!

1090
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:40,300
Zip!

1091
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:45,960
And I'm proud to tell the story

1092
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:46,880
The story

1093
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,060
of the United States of oil.

1094
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,020
Chug, chug.

1095
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,280
They come and take

1096
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:53,780
Chug, chug.

1097
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,320
The brains gone about

1098
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,000
Chug, chug.

1099
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,600
Learning and living the story.

1100
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,500
The story of oil.

1101
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,440
Well, I'm proud to salute

1102
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:13,700
O'Gory.

1103
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,740
O'Gory.

1104
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:17,920
And the colors for which she stands.

1105
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,960
The red for the blood.

1106
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:21,680
The red for the blood.

1107
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,880
White for the guts.

1108
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,080
Blue for the blue-bodied bag.

1109
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,340
And I'm proud to tell the story

1110
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:33,340
The story.

1111
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,400
Of freedom and financial gain.

1112
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,420
Chug, chug.

1113
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,180
Free to carol.

1114
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:39,920
Chug, chug.

1115
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,080
Chug, chug.

1116
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:40,080


1117
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,440
Free to back tail.

1118
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:41,840
To the chain.

1119
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,120
Free to haliburte.

1120
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,160
Haliburte.

1121
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,320
Hey, hey, hey.

1122
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:59,520
Well, Mama, I'm coming back to Air Force, Andrews Air Force Base, dressed in a brand-new white suit.

1123
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:05,140
They've done some work on me, but I think I'm going to be all right.

1124
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,920
The planes keep coming in, coming in every day.

1125
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,180
Well, Mama, I ain't got no arms or legs.

1126
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,840
I just got stumps.

1127
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,500
But that's good, because I got a new job at the polling alley.

1128
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,340
I'm going to work there every day.

1129
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:39,660
I'm going to sell off my car and sell off the house and the bar.

1130
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,680
So I'm proud to salute old Dory.

1131
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:46,720
Old Dory.

1132
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,500
And the colors for which she sang.

1133
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,380
She sang.

1134
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,460
Red for the blood.

1135
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,380
White for the guts.

1136
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,800
Blue for the blue body.

1137
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,420
Bye.

1138
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,300
Yep.

1139
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:03,320
And I'm proud to tell the story.

1140
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,260
The story.

1141
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:07,260
Of freedom and financial gain.

1142
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,360
To the chain.

1143
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,780
Free to head.

1144
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:10,760
To the chain.

1145
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,080
Free to car line.

1146
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:12,740
To the chain.

1147
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,880
Free to Halliburton.

1148
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:16,940
Halliburton.

1149
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,720
Hey, hey, hey.

1150
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,600
Well, Mama, there's a few things I forgot to tell you.

1151
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,700
I got part of my head blown off.

1152
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:38,060
But that don't matter with the kind of job skills I got anyway.

1153
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,200
I'm missing a few digits.

1154
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:42,780
Oh.

1155
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,260
Oh.

1156
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,220
Oh.

1157
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,320
I'm missing big chunks of my skull.

1158
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,080
Oh.

1159
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:49,440
Oh.

1160
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,160
Oh, what the hell.

1161
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:50,860
Oh.

1162
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,480
Oh.

1163
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:54,340


1164
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,040
Oh.

1165
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:56,160
Oh.

1166
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,060
Oh.

1167
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:57,860
Oh.

1168
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:58,240


1169
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:58,560


1170
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:58,580


1171
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:58,940
Oh.

1172
00:51:58,940 --> 00:51:59,160
Oh.

1173
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:00,520


1174
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:00,520


1175
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:01,580
Oh.

1176
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:01,620


1177
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:01,800
Oh.

1178
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:01,800


1179
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,280
Oh.

1180
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:02,420
Oh.

1181
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:11,100
Oh.

1182
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:15,940
Oh.

1183
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:16,400
Oh.

1184
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,160
Oh.

1185
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:25,400


1186
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:26,220
Oh.

1187
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:39,020
No, no that's over.

1188
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:39,460
Oh, we caught personalities in baby, you know.

1189
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:39,460


1190
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:39,680
Yeah, we obviouslyording.

1191
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:39,680


1192
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:39,680


1193
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:40,080


1194
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,140
I'm just going to let you guys do that the whole time.

1195
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,000
Boy, that guy's like Bob Dylan.

1196
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,920
He's a regular Bob Dylan of...

1197
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,900
I should have just let you guys sing this over all that stuff.

1198
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,260
It would have sounded a lot better.

1199
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:05,240
I would have liked to sing it like this, but I just don't have the time.

1200
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,580
I have the earwax, I have the eye color.

1201
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:14,160
I have the nostril, but I don't have the time.

1202
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,160
And the time...

1203
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,780
He's doing the harmonica.

1204
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,920
The answer, my friend, is blowing out your arse.

1205
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,500
The answer is blowing out your arse.

1206
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:34,260
We cannot have a president, commander-in-chief, who blows in the winds.

1207
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,580
He must be steadfast in his steadfastness.

1208
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,560
And never change his...

1209
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:39,960
His minds.

1210
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,020
Even though he may be of more than one mind.

1211
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,940
His minds must all be focused.

1212
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,840
He must... I'm sorry.

1213
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:49,780
Let us all pray...

1214
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,720
You were right about those consonants.

1215
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,580
He will have to just work on his carry...

1216
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:56,200
Character.

1217
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,040
Impression.

1218
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:57,860
Yes.

1219
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,500
Well, I...

1220
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,860
I have it once in a while, but I don't have it now.

1221
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,960
It comes in flickers.

1222
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:06,700
I do have AdWords.

1223
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:08,520
And believe me, this...

1224
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,100
Oh, no, that's gore.

1225
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:09,400
Okay.

1226
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:09,860
For good fun.

1227
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,020
I don't...

1228
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:11,160
I...

1229
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,780
How do you tell them apart?

1230
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,560
How do you tell them apart?

1231
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,440
I'm a selfish rich guy.

1232
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,440
I'm a selfish rich guy.

1233
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:22,180
You know, any young fellow or girl can grow up to be president in this country.

1234
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:31,020
Any abused, young, misogynistic young child can have their foreskin and their pecker driven any way they want.

1235
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:38,540
And they can grow up or grow down to be the president of this great American country that...

1236
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:39,100
Oh.

1237
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:43,080
Well, Bill Clinton actually was some kind of a po-bucker that became president.

1238
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,380
Yeah.

1239
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,300
He was...

1240
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,420
That doesn't usually happen, though.

1241
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,280
Usually, they're the sons of mafia leaders and big businessmen.

1242
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,200
Yes, the great white clans of Norway, yes.

1243
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,780
Husbands of incredibly rich, powerful monsters.

1244
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:57,860
Sometimes...

1245
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,880
Disguised as people, like on Halloween.

1246
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:00,880
Right.

1247
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:06,420
Sometimes, they're those guys with the big long nose tubes from Papua New Guinea, and they sneak them in there.

1248
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,680
You know, they bleach their skin a little bit.

1249
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,760
Make them a mason, you know, or something like that.

1250
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,080
And then the next thing you know, they're taking the strips out of their hair.

1251
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:20,140
Yeah, and then before you know it, they're pulling off almost all of their skin because they can't...

1252
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:24,100
Their skin just doesn't work anymore because of GSR, the galvanic skin response.

1253
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,320
You know, start buzzing, man.

1254
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,080
And then the next thing you know, they're standing in front of the Republican National Committee.

1255
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:33,080
And they're standing there, thousands of people are cheering.

1256
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:34,460
And they...

1257
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,080
And they...

1258
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:47,780
Well, Dr. Trump, is it true that Dr. Howell, your comrade there at the show, is going to join being a Republican?

1259
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,340
Well, we're approaching the tail end.

1260
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,180
My eyes are bleeding.

1261
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,300
The very butt of the show, as I said.

1262
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,760
It's a devilish tail, isn't it?

1263
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,040
Yes.

1264
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,480
Forked like Popeye's nose.

1265
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,640
My eyes are bleeding.

1266
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,640
My eyes!

1267
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,440
Strange happens too.

1268
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:24,180
Let's just allow ourselves to be as free as we can be.

1269
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:30,220
And don't forget this November 2nd.

1270
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,220
To get out there and vote with your feet.

1271
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,580
The way God intended you to.

1272
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:37,620
Run!

1273
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:38,160
Run!

1274
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,060
Run!

1275
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,560
Run for the nearest border!

1276
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:49,880
And next week there will be a radiothon.

1277
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,780
Yes, as if we could use one.

1278
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,060
Yes, the station will be...

1279
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,020
So, I'm just warning you ahead of time.

1280
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,360
If you have any money, spend it now before then.

1281
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,500
You know, things might be very different a month or two from now.

1282
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,020
There might not be any money one month from now.

1283
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,080
We don't know.

1284
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,040
There might not be any money.

1285
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,320
There might not be any people.

1286
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,420
Or there might not be any...

1287
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:12,580
The winner could abolish money.

1288
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:16,640
Maybe the change will be that change will finally stop happening.

1289
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:17,040
Right.

1290
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,420
The changelings then will be the happening.

1291
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:21,600
That, my dear, is impossible.

1292
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,320
Well, that's the...

1293
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,100
Change can never stop.

1294
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,300
It could be that...

1295
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,440
It's the only constant.

1296
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,860
It could be a dream come true, though.

1297
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,420
Small change.

1298
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:33,020
A complete perfect piece of stasis.

1299
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:34,140
Ah.

1300
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,200
I...

1301
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,600
Where sleep is awareness.

1302
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,020
And love is...

1303
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:39,200
Hey.

1304
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:40,700
A death.

1305
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,320
Number one is really number two.

1306
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,520
And number two is really number one.

1307
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:51,600
Well, friends, all we can do is ask you to do the responsible thing.

1308
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,940
But, unfortunately, you're subgeniuses.

1309
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:57,860
So, it doesn't do much good to even suggest such a thing.

1310
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:58,520
And, uh...

1311
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:02,740
But, uh, whatever you do, don't name it after Bob.

1312
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,080
Friends, uh...

1313
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,100
Whatever you do...

1314
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,260
Love yourself.

1315
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,420
Whatever you do...

1316
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:11,840
Yeah.

1317
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,760
You sure have killers out there.

1318
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:14,580
You hear it now?

1319
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,220
You listen to Princess Wee.

1320
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,920
Don't feel bad about yourself, man.

1321
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,380
Don't beat yourself up.

1322
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,720
Feel bad about others.

1323
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,260
You've got other people to beat up.

1324
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,780
Goodbye, the powers.

1325
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,300
Goodbye, the powers that trusted me.

1326
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:35,800
I say, if I solemnly swear you are president...

1327
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:39,000
Of the United States of America.

1328
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:39,660
Um...

1329
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:56,840
I have promised...

1330
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,480
Many things.

1331
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:05,120
I have delivered few...

1332
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:06,880
Empty promises.

1333
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:07,820
Empty promises.

1334
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:11,840
Some of them were big empty promises.

1335
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:17,840
As big as that football field there.

1336
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,460
There are no empty promises, only empty heads.

1337
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:24,760
And some were empty premises that had actual heads.

1338
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,840
Where are we?

1339
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,900
Um, I think we've just, uh, passed Langley.

1340
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,680
And we're heading for the Maryland border.

1341
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:37,800
And we're heading for the Maryland border.

1342
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:40,580
And now we're gonna have to take a little quick loop over here to get back.

1343
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,040
If you want to get close to the White House lawn.

1344
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,940
Gonna make the digit repair, the, uh, funnel entry.

1345
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,220
I guess they're calling it now.

1346
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,480
Uh, there's no, uh...

1347
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,800
Are you, are you picking up anything on your, uh...

1348
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,920
Are you picking up anything?

1349
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:56,960
Bogey, six o'clock.

1350
00:59:58,260 --> 00:59:59,420
It's six o'clock already?

1351
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,120
Christ, I was supposed to have eaten by now.

1352
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,800
Are we gonna get some food before we get back?

1353
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:04,240
Or are we just gonna...

1354
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,960
Mmm, I understand that...

1355
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:11,660
There is food aplenty on the ground a few thousand feet below us.

1356
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,440
There are people.

1357
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,080
There are houses.

1358
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,720
There are little cows.

1359
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,580
There are roses.

1360
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:19,620
Flowers.

1361
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:21,340
Tomatoes.

1362
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,580
Fresh proteins and greens from the sea.

1363
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,520
Produce from the islands of Langahans.

1364
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,820
Uh, now there's more than one, anyway.

1365
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,520
And large, large vessels of oats.

1366
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,540
Oh, yes.

1367
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:37,560
Yeah, why, I don't...

1368
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:42,100
Ladies and gentlemen, this has been the Hour of Slack.

1369
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,460
Thank you for listening.

1370
