1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
Praise God.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,740
Oh yes, dear friends.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,940
This is Li Li Jing, a Chinese subgenius.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,480
And you are listening to the Hour of Flag on KNON in Dallas, Texas.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,740
Praise God!

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,560
Somebody help!

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,700
Somebody help me!

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,560
Please!

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,700
Please help me!

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,340
Help!

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,240
Help!

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,600
Help!

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,520
Where are we, Wang?

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,640
You are nowhere.

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,240
You just stop rubbing your body up against mine because I can't concentrate when you do that.

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,440
I don't want to be hated.

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,980
I don't want to be hated.

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:04,800
I don't want to be hated.

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:04,800


20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:04,800


21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,480
Just a minute!

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,240
Well, the wolf was a man.

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,960
There once was a man.

24
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, it's great to say he was mad.

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,560
I say it, he was mad.

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,320
And he had ten thousand fans.

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,080
And he had ten thousand fans. I'm not looking mad.

28
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:29,980
I'm not looking mad.

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,300
He Colombia перед ciudad, he teche yникинfishunk Pomimiin drink us up.

30
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,200
It's anesser a se points.

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,560
This is Li Li Jing, someone from Le Indigo Pacificaf Sheila raporter.

32
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:47,560


33
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,380
Who knew he was theığın, you saw it just cats and dogs.

34
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:51,460
factorial.

35
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,120
No, born, but knew that the cat likes dogs in Toolbox 시청a H FREE arms.

36
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,600
Youoner scarves the actual enriching coat maine.

37
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,140
You have a nice coat, so let me check it on.

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,940
I'm going to wear several sandals.

39
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,960
And I was one of the best in the country, Lear Doc.

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,620
There goes another shot.

41
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes, he's hurt.

42
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,380
He's full of sweat.

43
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,860
All this love.

44
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,900
And it's coming again.

45
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,780
Oh, yeah, we're back on the air now, I guess.

46
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,300
But it's pledge drive.

47
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,920
I don't know what difference it makes, though, for most of y'all.

48
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,740
You don't care.

49
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,240
Shoot.

50
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,940
Well, I'll tell you, I have a story to tell.

51
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,720
This is Reverend Ivan Stang.

52
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,680
I'm talking to you tonight.

53
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,460
But this is, I mean, it's pledge drive.

54
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,080
It's supposed to be big whoop-dee-doo.

55
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,120
But, friends, I'm afraid to have to.

56
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,280
Oh, shut that music off.

57
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,480
I don't want to hear that stuff.

58
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,960
Oh, shoot.

59
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,140
Bob came to me.

60
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,780
The other day in a vision.

61
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,720
Yes.

62
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,040
Oh, you go ahead and laugh.

63
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,160
You out there.

64
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,500
You can laugh all you want.

65
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,880
But Bob, I'm Reverend Stang.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,380
I'm the one of the first apostles, friends.

67
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,220
And I'll tell you what.

68
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,720
Bob Dobbs came to me and he said, Reverend Stang, I'm going to take you home.

69
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,840
I'm going to take you home.

70
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,180
If you don't raise $8,000.

71
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,340
By midnight.

72
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,240
The night of your show.

73
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:30,840
That's it.

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,800
That's it.

75
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,480
I've had enough of this stuff.

76
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,940
I'm going to take you away.

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,240
You ain't going to.

78
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,280
Friends, you know what?

79
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,020
I mean, that.

80
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:40,820
Shoot.

81
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,680
I don't care.

82
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,340
I don't care what you say.

83
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,620
I'm ready to go with Bob.

84
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,240
Go off to heaven or hell or wherever.

85
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,180
Hell or fire.

86
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,680
I don't care what he wants.

87
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:53,680
You know?

88
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,840
You don't care.

89
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,520
I can tell.

90
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,220
Y'all don't care.

91
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,420
Because you ain't calling 828-9500.

92
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,940
You don't.

93
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,360
828-9500 or 823-7490.

94
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,120
But you ain't.

95
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,580
You don't got your pencils up.

96
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,920
You ain't writing those numbers down.

97
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,700
You think the hour of slack is going to be free forever.

98
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,220
Oh, yeah.

99
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:19,040
I'll be taken by Bob by midnight tonight if we don't raise that $8,000.

100
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,400
We didn't do so good last time.

101
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,480
Oh, you think.

102
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:22,820
Yeah.

103
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,500
You think.

104
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,320
You know everything, don't you?

105
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,520
Well, that's 828-9500, 823-7490.

106
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,520
You can talk to the Will of Dobbs.

107
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,460
You can talk to Reverend Zaphon.

108
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,520
You can talk to Reverend Shimon.

109
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,900
You can talk to the mighty Pope of Sicilia.

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,780
You can even talk to the nameless Harvey, the invisible one.

111
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,920
Now, you think I'm crazy, don't you?

112
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,860
Well, who's shoot?

113
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,340
Right in stewing and stabbing and jiving and jabbing.

114
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,480
Having a good time.

115
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,820
Petting and poking Bob.

116
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,360
Here, help me.

117
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:58,700
Somebody.

118
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,560
Okay, here we go.

119
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:09,040
The demons you may see during the initial hallucination sequence are not real.

120
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,420
If you do not panic, this phase will end after a few minutes.

121
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,280
Always resurface from the hypnosis slowly.

122
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,960
Coming out of the tape has been likened to a total rebirth process.

123
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,780
Yes.

124
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,380
Managed successfully.

125
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,960
He knows that a creative sale is one in which the idea that leads to a purchase

126
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,620
generates in the mind of the salesman before it does in the prospect's mind.

127
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,600
Right.

128
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,400
Sales, that's all it's about here, friends.

129
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,520
Sales.

130
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,460
The code is broken.

131
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,380
Trouble?

132
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,040
Big.

133
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,140
Oh, over here.

134
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:01,240
We've got the slackless children who've been cast out of the home for slackless children

135
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,200
because you didn't send in your donations to the station, friend.

136
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,560
Look at these poor little children.

137
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,480
What do you have to say to the people, children?

138
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,680
My truth is loose.

139
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,780
Like my sister's truth is.

140
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,940
I got an ant box.

141
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,500
Right.

142
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,920
A big old bug.

143
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,740
Right.

144
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,420
See, friends, these are truly slackless children.

145
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:34,120
And these kids, these ant bites and these little bumps and bruises.

146
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,300
Now, friend, you're not going to let these poor kids, these are American kids.

147
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,800
You're not going to sit by and let these kids be in pain and slacklessness, are you?

148
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,880
See, they all call me daddy.

149
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,180
Isn't that sweet?

150
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,660
These are only two of over 5,000.

151
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:54,320
5,000.

152
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:54,500
No.

153
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,420
Because we have this amazing electronic babysitter here, this handsome robot.

154
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,400
You can hear it talking.

155
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,420
He's going to make a million dollars.

156
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,500
That's right, friend.

157
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,680
He's going to make a million bucks.

158
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,500
Inside the brain cavity of Doug Smith.

159
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,360
My legs are on fire.

160
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,220
They smell pray sauce.

161
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:30,300
2-8-9-5-100 is the number to call if you want to save your soul, friends.

162
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,420
Not just this station, but your soul.

163
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,860
Your eternal soul.

164
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,720
So, open your heart.

165
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,220
Close your mind.

166
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,740
Unzip your lips and bend over to pull out that wallet, friends.

167
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,960
Because you're going to receive the word of Bob.

168
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:52,980
Because this is the last hour of the last pledge drive of the last hour of slack.

169
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,060
If you don't.

170
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,960
Call 828-9500 and make that pledge.

171
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,220
And dear friends, that some already have, even before we got on the air.

172
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,680
Oh, yeah.

173
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,080
Yeah, that's easy.

174
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,280
That's just a tape.

175
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,840
See, I'm not feeling so hot about this stuff tonight.

176
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,800
No.

177
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:23,240
Because I know that I'm ready to meet my maker or whatever.

178
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,660
Whatever he is.

179
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,020
I don't even care.

180
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,560
Shoot.

181
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,300
Bob, he said he's going to take me away.

182
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,640
And I know I've said that before.

183
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,700
I've said that in that last pledge.

184
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,060
I said that in 1986.

185
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,180
Well, Bob, we raised that money that time.

186
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,040
I was sick.

187
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,860
But I'm a lot sicker this time, friends.

188
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,220
Yeah, I was sick last week.

189
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,200
And this time, I still ain't over it.

190
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,600
And it's getting worse and worse.

191
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,580
Worse.

192
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,180
Oh, yeah.

193
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,240
But I, you know.

194
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:52,860
Yeesh.

195
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,680
If you ain't going to call 823-7490, I'm going to die by midnight.

196
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,100
That's all there is to it.

197
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,580
Severe pharyngitis.

198
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,060
That's the thing.

199
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,020
It's sick.

200
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,000
I know.

201
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,220
I'm sick.

202
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,480
God, no.

203
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,580
I'm going to lay the truth down on you.

204
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,140
I'm going to strap it on.

205
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,020
I'm going to put it on with big red straps, dear friends.

206
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,980
I ain't going to spare you the truth.

207
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,200
That's right.

208
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,300
I'm going to preach on.

209
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,160
I'm going to tell.

210
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,140
I'm going to tell it like it is, as they say.

211
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,240
But you got to call and pledge that money.

212
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,060
And you know what?

213
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,960
You can't just.

214
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,940
I know you ain't going to do it.

215
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,500
You don't care.

216
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,180
Don't make any difference to you.

217
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,720
Oh, slack.

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,680
Big joke.

219
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,340
You ain't going to write that check to Box 710909.

220
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,200
You got that pencil out again.

221
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,080
You slow, full, unthinking, unfeeling.

222
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,380
You might as well be animals.

223
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,540
Most of it's box.

224
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,220
710909.

225
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,260
Dallas, Texas 75371.

226
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,600
Or call 8237-4900 or 828-9500.

227
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,100
But you don't care at all.

228
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,600
.

229
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,940
Daddy, what's going to happen if I don't get any money?

230
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,080
.

231
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,080


232
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,760
.

233
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,680
I can't tell you what's going to happen.

234
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,580
Mommy, what's wrong with Daddy?

235
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,780
What are we going to do without Daddy around?

236
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,980
Yeah, he seemed awful sick when he left for the station.

237
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,220
I think he's really worried about the money.

238
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,720
I don't believe that people listen to gain and win

239
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,760
and they don't give any money to it.

240
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,240
People really don't listen

241
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,780
without pain, do they?

242
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,320
They must be bad people.

243
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,320
Poor Daddy.

244
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,880
Give me some money, man.

245
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,020
Hey, mister, listen.

246
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,680
If you don't pay any money, I'm going to take it out of your pocket.

247
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,280
I'm going to walk up and take it like this.

248
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,740
So you better give it to me.

249
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,800
Me too.

250
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,180
I'm going to call the cops on you, man.

251
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,900
Me too.

252
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,040
I'm going to call the police.

253
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,700
Maybe I'll call the rock and roll dogs.

254
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,220
I might call the pincher dogs.

255
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,180
I might call my friend Raymond.

256
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,820
He lives across the street.

257
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,500
He has a mohawk and a duck tail

258
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,400
and walks around with a knife in his pocket

259
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,140
because they're not paying any money.

260
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,000
I can see what's going on here now.

261
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,580
You're all waiting for the other guy to call in.

262
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,180
Yeah, that's what it is.

263
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,780
You're just waiting to see what will happen.

264
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,480
You want to see Reverend Stang die, don't you?

265
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,720
That's fine with me.

266
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,160
That's fine with me.

267
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,540
That's just all right.

268
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,500
Yeah, yeah.

269
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,220
That's just perfectly all right.

270
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,680
Well, we've had a few.

271
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,860
There's a few that care.

272
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,680
Alan Walker, yeah.

273
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,280
I've seen Alan.

274
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,460
I know what Alan Walker was doing.

275
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,320
I've seen him.

276
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,520
His car pulled up in front of Eileen Hobbs' place.

277
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,780
Yeah, yeah.

278
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,460
And look, what did he put in the offering plate?

279
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,020
25 cents, a quarter in the offering plate.

280
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,280
But...

281
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,560
But go ahead, blow it off.

282
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,120
Don't call 8237-490.

283
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,620
Don't call 828-9500.

284
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,640
Mandy Macademia.

285
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,180
Yeah, I've seen what Mandy Macademia's been up to.

286
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,840
Oh, a woman.

287
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,260
A woman, she says.

288
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,580
Yeah, I want to see some of these phone lines lighten up.

289
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,860
We got a bunch of mighty sexy preachers here ready to talk to you.

290
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,080
And they're bored.

291
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,500
They're bored.

292
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,360
They're about to go home.

293
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,260
We're all going to quit.

294
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,820
Oh, now quiet down now, y'all.

295
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,220
You're getting too noisy.

296
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,080
Hold it down.

297
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,100
I can hear you.

298
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,820
I know what's going on out there.

299
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,640
I'm going to preach on.

300
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,620
I'm going to...

301
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,620
I'm tired of this stuff.

302
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,240
I'm going to have to unload on you.

303
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,960
You think I don't know what's going on with y'all?

304
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,220
You think I don't know if Will Frazier's been up there to see Wanda?

305
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,640
I see everything.

306
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,640
I see every bit of it.

307
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,400
Oh, sure I know.

308
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:50,620
I know it.

309
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,120
Don't you?

310
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,040
She told me.

311
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:59,560
She came into the dang altar, back behind the altar.

312
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,520
She told me.

313
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,380
Where have you been that you don't know this stuff?

314
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,840
You don't know no phone numbers.

315
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,460
You don't know about 828-95-183-7490.

316
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,360
Oh, sure.

317
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,720
Yeah, once or twice a year you'll come in and make your pledge.

318
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,620
Well, I'm sorry.

319
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,580
That don't cut no ice here.

320
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,600
Hell, fire.

321
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm going to get down on some of these butts today.

322
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,840
Hell, fire.

323
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,100
It's part of our job, fortunately, being the Subgenius Foundation,

324
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,040
it is part of our job to scare people.

325
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,860
It's also part of our job to exercise slack and to serve as role models

326
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:47,040
of abnormal behavior for people who have not yet been freed from the restrictions.

327
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,460
I'm going to get this.

328
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,060
Don't get mixed up anymore, you act like a douche.

329
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,060


330
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,060


331
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,060


332
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,060


333
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,760
pallete s.

334
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,300
I like that educación.

335
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:07,900
Most of my people are based in Mexico City.

336
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,160
Yes, and you've moved to Los Angeles and you've lived there about a year before.

337
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,500
I'm a friend of yours so long.

338
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:08,500


339
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:08,500


340
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,880
We met a little while ago, we longer ninth and an eighth hours on earth.

341
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,560
No moral.

342
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,800
And if you joke around, you too.

343
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,860
I don't have any excuse. You're fake.

344
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,180
Friends, you better call in this time.

345
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,680
I mean, we aren't kidding.

346
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,220
We didn't do so well that last pledge drive.

347
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,280
It's going to be the last hour of slack if you don't get it together.

348
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:30,200
We're only talking about $10, $15.

349
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,780
Not everybody can give that much.

350
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,540
You know, Dr. Drummond and I once talked about, you know, who means the most to Bob?

351
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:44,200
Is it the little old lady who can, who, you know, doesn't have anything at all to her name,

352
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,380
but she donates a quarter, her last quarter?

353
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:54,400
Or is Bob more impressed with the rich man who could give a million dollars but only gives $10,000?

354
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,380
We prayed on that, friends, and we realized that in Bob's eyes,

355
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,800
that rich man is the only one that's going to get to heaven because he paid more money.

356
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,860
So I want you to call 828-9500.

357
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,520
I mean, 828-9500.

358
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:08,520


359
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:08,520


360
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,360
You have to, not just that number, but 823-2490.

361
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,460
That's 7490.

362
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,260
You know, when you pledge, when you pledge,

363
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,520
you're showing that there is a listenership out there for the hour of slack.

364
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,040
And believe you me, we need proof every minute.

365
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:29,980
This show causes this nice station more headaches than probably just about any other show.

366
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,500
And, you know, we've probably got more enemies than most shows.

367
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,420
So we need to prove that we have the friends.

368
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,300
The dear, dear.

369
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,660
To fill their minds with questions.

370
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,460
Questions that only Bob can answer through his chosen apostles, his fishes of wallets.

371
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,340
And what is money?

372
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,680
Nearly another tool of the conspiracy.

373
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,400
Except when it gains power by passing from your pocket to Bob's.

374
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,860
I would like to testify to the power of Bob and what it has done for me.

375
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,780
And before I'd like to do that,

376
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,520
I'd like to bring you a message.

377
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,920
A public service message from the subgenius foundation.

378
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,420
And friends, I'm talking about, about your cash flow.

379
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,900
Have you thought about your cash flow recently?

380
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,240
Yeah.

381
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,200
Yeah.

382
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,860
And where's it flowing?

383
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,840
It's flowing out, isn't it?

384
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,020
Is there one person who says they got cash flow flowing in?

385
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,820
Not one.

386
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,140
Let me tell you something, brothers and sisters.

387
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,600
Let me tell you, cash is flowing into me.

388
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,520
Oh, I'm not telling you.

389
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,520
But I'm going to tell you.

390
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,180
I'm going to tell you right now because you asked.

391
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,200
I believe in Bob.

392
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,120
And if you have a problem with your cash flow,

393
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,640
it's because your cash is not flowing towards Bob.

394
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,440
This is the first industrial church.

395
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,440
We're not a tax write-off scam.

396
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,500
We are an incorporated profit-making foundation.

397
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,940
If there is such a thing.

398
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,420
We're profits and we want profits.

399
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,660
So you've got to come back.

400
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,060
To the old American way.

401
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:10,760
Yes.

402
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,900
You've got to come back to quality goods.

403
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,940
For your dollar.

404
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,180
A right to purchase.

405
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,380
Let me ask you a simple joke.

406
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,580
How many of you have been tithing up to Bob?

407
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,140
That, which is truly Bob's.

408
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,060
Tell me that joke.

409
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,800
How many of you have been giving 10% of your worth of goods to Bob?

410
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,020
I don't care who you are or where you come from.

411
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,820
If you haven't sent your $20 into Bob, you're going to burn.

412
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,340
And can I win?

413
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,020
Mother Teresa.

414
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,440
I don't care how many people she's helped.

415
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,300
If she hadn't sent her $20 into jail, Bob Dodge is going to burn in hell.

416
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:53,020
Friends, I want you to reach deep into that holiest aura piece in your body.

417
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,520
And have your back pocket pull out that wallet.

418
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,560
And we don't just want the money out of the wallet.

419
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,000
We don't just want the credit cards.

420
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,000
We want your library card.

421
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,180
Your social security card.

422
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,460
We want the wallet itself.

423
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,340
Because it ain't the money, friends.

424
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,040
It ain't the money.

425
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,120
It's the black.

426
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,660
Bob's got lots of money, friends.

427
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,300
Bob has lots of money, dear friends.

428
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,960
The money, you know, it don't buy you happiness.

429
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,580
But it allows you the choice of what kind of misery you want to endure.

430
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,980
And if you can't have real slack, then I guess false slack is better than no slack.

431
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:41,820
But remember, the conspiracy set it up to where you can never make enough money.

432
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:48,060
So, and this is something my young son just spouted the other day.

433
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,140
He spouted the word of Bob.

434
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,960
He said, don't take money, take Bob.

435
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:59,100
And you can't get Bob without sending money to K-N-O-N via calling 828-9500.

436
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,440
This logic is self-evidently inescapable.

437
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,960
It's, you know, obvious.

438
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,520
It's obviously true.

439
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,040
But, you know, there's so many of you.

440
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,580
You've been out here taping this show.

441
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,100
And guilt is that feeling that you've been feeling.

442
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:19,420
It's like, it's as if the most hideous henchman of the tiny demon, Iheg-Ihin,

443
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,940
was gnawing and tickling incessantly at your very guts.

444
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,480
Like, the same feeling you get when you call a pledge into 828-9500

445
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,800
and then don't make good on it.

446
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,340
And it isn't from being afraid of the punishment.

447
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,940
It's from knowing that, you know,

448
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,700
from that time on, you won't be allowed to forget what you didn't do.

449
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,840
And guilt is the way you're gonna feel when I finish this sentence,

450
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,740
which is actually that you did pledge to K-N-O-N last pledge drive,

451
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,440
but you never sent your money.

452
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,760
You're getting free on this radio station what other sub-genii outside of Dallas

453
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,880
have to pay eight, up to eight bucks for, for one hour's worth.

454
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,580
And on top of that, you've been taping them, sending them around.

455
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,420
Maybe you haven't.

456
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,040
Maybe you've been sinless by omission.

457
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:12,040
But, friends, Jesus, though Jesus Christ relieves you from, from guilt,

458
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,940
Bob, he, he, he, he don't forgive your trespasses.

459
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,420
He, he may show you some new ways to sin,

460
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,540
and he may give you a divine excuse by which to rationalize your sins.

461
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,280
Oh, yeah, but when it comes to sins against Bob,

462
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,820
against Slack, and against K-N-O-N,

463
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,420
which is a pillar of Bob's temple,

464
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:33,860
oh, no.

465
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:38,080
He ain't gonna, he, he's gonna be whooping on your butt for your trespasses,

466
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,780
and he's gonna do it in an hour that ye know not.

467
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,060
I lay upon ye jokers the curse that,

468
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,020
now, here it is,

469
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,480
may the curse of the head that has, hath never bled be upon you,

470
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,260
that you may live, listening to the other stations, in quiet desperation,

471
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,560
and, and not, not one new mind-breaking experience would you have

472
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,400
to give you that eternal,

473
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,220
eternal satisfaction, because,

474
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,760
because it would have taught you how to appreciate the Slack you already have.

475
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,520
But no, you're just gonna keep getting that slow poison.

476
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:17,460
You're gonna keep getting that slow, from not calling 828-9500 or 823-7490,

477
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,920
you're gonna get the drug of normality seeping further into your brain tissues.

478
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,320
Listen to it, listen to it seeping in there.

479
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,740
Ugly sound, ain't it?

480
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,480
That's the, that's the, it's real brain damage that comes from the stations

481
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,460
that play just what you want to hear.

482
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,360
Because if you had any brains at all,

483
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,420
you'd know that you don't really want to hear what you think you want to hear.

484
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,560
You pay to know what you really think,

485
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,840
and you want to hear surprises,

486
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,440
things that are new to your brain,

487
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,560
and they may be scary,

488
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,480
but it's like giving your brain a good rinse,

489
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,180
like through the car wash.

490
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,460
You know, you can't think about your own brain, friends,

491
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,380
but you can dial this number,

492
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,740
and, and pledge that money to, to KNON,

493
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,580
to help keep us all on the air.

494
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:03,820
And may, you too, for instance, at some point.

495
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,880
So, it's your choice.

496
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,840
It's your choice.

497
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,800
Go ahead and launch whatever spirits you hold.

498
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,240
Oh shoot, I've had enough of that.

499
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,080
I'm gonna shut off these tapes.

500
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,380
I'm just not in that kind of a mood.

501
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,000
We've got, we've got five preachers sitting here.

502
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,440
Some of the, some of the mightiest preachers in town.

503
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:30,440
They're, they're just, they ain't, they ain't doing nothing.

504
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:30,560
They're just, they ain't, they ain't doing nothing.

505
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,200
They're sucking on their thumbs.

506
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,020
They're just, they're, huh?

507
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,000
Playing Switch.

508
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,260
Playing Switch.

509
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,460
They're, they're, that's all they're doing.

510
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,600
They're playing pocket pool in here.

511
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,560
I've had, I've, I've never seen such a thing.

512
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,540
Oh, you quit laughing down there.

513
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,840
You, oh, you laughing.

514
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,220
Do you think it's funny?

515
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,100
We ain't getting no calls.

516
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,780
That's all there is to it.

517
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,700
That's, and you, ingrates is what they are.

518
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,440
I've had enough.

519
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,800
I'm just gonna get off.

520
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,960
Bob's gonna take me home.

521
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,280
He's just gonna, we're gonna get out of here.

522
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,780
This is gonna be the last hour of slack.

523
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,840
I'm, I'm, I just can't take any, I'm, I mean business.

524
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,040
I ain't hearing no praise, Bob's, and I ain't wanting any.

525
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,600
Hell no.

526
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,040
Hellfire.

527
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,720
All right.

528
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:24,740
Now, I noticed last Sunday one of you all out there put a, a nickel in the offering plate.

529
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,240
Yeah, phyllo drumming, a nickel.

530
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,620
There you tight son of a.

531
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,080
I see all, I see everything that goes on out there.

532
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,540
You think I don't know nothing?

533
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,580
You're the one that don't know nothing.

534
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,740
Dog like creatures.

535
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,480
Thanks.

536
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,540
I can't stand it.

537
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,760
I just can't stand it.

538
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:48,780
Y'all are going to fry like free toes in the skillet of Hades unless you cough up.

539
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,120
This is poor.

540
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,160
All right.

541
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,580
That's right, Al.

542
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,120
I'm maybe, let's just go to another church, Pope S. Cecilia.

543
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,620
Whimps, whimps.

544
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,120
Let's just go on to another radio station.

545
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,760
Maybe we'll go to one that pays.

546
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,960
Maybe we'll go to one of those stations people like to.

547
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,400
No.

548
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,780
They don't mind that commercial.

549
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,620
They'll give us gold Cadillacs.

550
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,260
Of course, we'll have to quit talking about Bob, but they don't care about Bob.

551
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,460
They don't want to hear about Bob.

552
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,980
We'll have to quit playing.

553
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:14,980


554
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,600
We can't play.

555
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,320
We wouldn't be able to play this unreleased Devo tape.

556
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:18,760
Oh, God.

557
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,120
No.

558
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,760
We're not going to be able to get around to that unreleased song that you ain't heard yet,

559
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,940
because you ain't calling in.

560
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,480
Old Will of Dog's, Will Frazier, he's just sitting there.

561
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,620
I see you out there.

562
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:30,620


563
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,280
Zaphod is totally idle.

564
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,200
This is pathetic.

565
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,620
You know what these boys are going to start doing if you don't get their hands busy on

566
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,200
that telephone?

567
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,320
I'm going to be seeing ugly stuff here right in front of me.

568
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,320
I don't like it.

569
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,760
I don't like it.

570
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,520
I haven't had enough.

571
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:46,720
I'm bored.

572
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,540
It's the end of the road for me.

573
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,040
I've lost patience with you people.

574
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,280
What does it matter with you people?

575
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,460
You're sitting on your butts.

576
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,140
You get calling 823-7490.

577
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,460
I'm bored.

578
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:58,460


579
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:58,460


580
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:58,820
823-7490.

581
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:58,820


582
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,500
4-8-2-8-9-5-100.

583
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,600
Now pick it up.

584
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,580
Oh, there's one call.

585
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,460
One call.

586
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,680
One call coming in.

587
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,260
Well, great.

588
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,540
That's going to make the Hour of Slack look real good.

589
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,140
How about the rest of you, huh?

590
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,720
How about the rest of you Slack thieves?

591
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,420
You're stealing this.

592
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,640
You're not paying for it.

593
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,300
Everybody else is paying for what they want to hear.

594
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,300
You know how we turned out on that last pledge drive?

595
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:27,160
They told me this was going to be the last Hour of Slack season if we didn't start raking

596
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,460
something in for the next hour.

597
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:28,460


598
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:28,460


599
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:28,460


600
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:28,460


601
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,940
The station is going, why do we need to have the Hour of Slack on there?

602
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,340
It's a big headache, big trouble.

603
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,060
All the Christians call up and complain.

604
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,960
All the demon worshipers call up and complain because they hate Bob, too.

605
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,980
What are they going to do when they lose Bob?

606
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,020
What are they going to do?

607
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,680
Oh, they don't care.

608
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,460
They don't want Bob.

609
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,640
Shoot.

610
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,480
Hell.

611
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,300
Fire.

612
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,260
They don't care about the church.

613
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,780
They don't care about their mental lives.

614
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,280
They'll say praise Bob as long as I'm saying something they like.

615
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:03,280
But when we start talking about money, then, oh, then they want to go up on the mountaintop

616
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,420
and get drunk with the other cavemen or sit there watching that tube.

617
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:07,860
Bob doesn't care about anything else.

618
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:13,060
Bob wants what's most important to you, and that's your cash, is it not?

619
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:13,980
That's right.

620
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,440
That's all they care about.

621
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,100
That ain't going to get it.

622
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,500
That ain't going to get it, hoss and hosses.

623
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:25,200
I mean, this is going to determine whether there's going to be an Hour of Slack.

624
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,820
I'm sick.

625
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,120
I'm just as soon.

626
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,260
Not just a hour.

627
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,500
I'm going to die.

628
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,660
A K-N-O-N period.

629
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,480
Where the heck else are you going to hear anything like you hear here?

630
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,580
You don't.

631
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,440
Nobody plays the things that K-N-O-N plays.

632
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,040
Nobody.

633
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:47,540
I just don't want to be a pastor to a bunch of lazy damn, I don't know.

634
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,600
My sermon is done.

635
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,200
Y'all don't pick.

636
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:50,980
I've had enough.

637
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,860
If y'all don't pick up those phones, I'm going to excommunicate y'all, every one of you.

638
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,260
You'll never get another drop of slack from me.

639
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,080
You're going to be false or otherwise in your entire lives.

640
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,700
I've had it.

641
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,260
Brother Woodrow, why don't you just lead us in the closing prayer?

642
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,120
I've had it.

643
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,820
Well, are you going to do it or not?

644
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,800
Oh, God.

645
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,120
Dismissed.

646
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,320
I've had enough.

647
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,460
Praise God.

648
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,260
Yeah, I, I, I.

649
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,540
And you can call in and you can talk to the, there's some sexy ministers on the, on the

650
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,160
line tonight.

651
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,000
Your prayer partners are here, ready to receive.

652
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,260
Your promise.

653
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,160
Your covenant with Bob, friends.

654
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,000
Friend, this is, I, I cast ye out.

655
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,400
It was Bob, that banished you to the pit.

656
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,720
It was he who flung you, from the depths of heaven to the pits of hell.

657
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,560
It was he who cast you out.

658
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,720
One clean spirit.

659
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,740
He has dominion over you.

660
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,400
I order you in the name of Bob to come out.

661
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,040
I order you in the name of Bob to come out.

662
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,040


663
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,800
I'm telling you, this is, you have to do, these are not just some, you know, there's

664
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,600
been a few, a few different things that have happened in your life.

665
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:57,600


666
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,760
We don't guarantee

667
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,600
Anywhere caused by

668
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,460
Or anything out of the

669
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,920
Space here or beyond

670
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,580
It's a comply with the

671
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,600
Instruction

672
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,400
Or recommendation

673

We don't guarantee

674
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,360
Anywhere caused by

675
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,540
The space here or the water supply

676
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,400
Any damage resulting

677
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,220
From a fire at the sky

678
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,540
We gotta sell you friends

679
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,860
We're not just gonna sit here

680
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,820
And talk

681
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,060
Bob said we had to party

682
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:40,600
Didn't he?

683
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,380
He said we had to party

684
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,200
He didn't say we could

685
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,840
He said we had to

686
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,940
And so we must also sell

687
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,080
Christ, Bob and Tink

688
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,240
I think this is in the mail

689
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,580
Tink

690
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,540
Tink

Tink

Tink

695

Tink

696

Tink

697

Tink

698
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:03,820
Tink

699
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,380
Tink

700
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,020
Tink

701
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,020


702
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,020


703
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,700
Tink

704
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,660
Tink

705
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,060
Tink

706

Tink

Tink

708

Tink

709

Tink

710

Tink

711

Tink

712
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,920
Tink

713
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,460
Tink

714
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:14,980
Tink

715
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,500
Tink

716
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,420
Tink

717
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,800
Hey, okay, okay, okay.

718
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,120
You're very impetuous.

719
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,340
Now get on your knees on the floor and start.

720
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,460
Just like we said.

721
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,500
Just like we said.

722
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,920
Now you can have Reverend Ann.

723
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,040
Now you can have something to sell.

724
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,500
We all know we're in the art of selling.

725
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,180
We create a mental and an emotional climate of unconscious selling.

726
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,740
Right in your own home.

727
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,900
When everybody sells.

728
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,680
We're all selling.

729
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,440
We all have something to sell.

730
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,920
Yes, everyone selling together.

731
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,740
Mighty symphony of prosperity.

732
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,780
For we all have something to sell.

733
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:12,940
Well, dear friend, J.R. Bob Dobbs and some outmoded, overused deity from ancient fairy tales.

734
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,860
The living bleat.

735
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,640
The child Bob experienced a traumatic, close encounter with a UFO.

736
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,100
What?

737
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:20,340
Yeah.

738
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,000
Age of three.

739
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:26,200
Soon thereafter, he began to exhibit strange powers of persuasion.

740
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,540
By age six, he had made his first million almost by accident.

741
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,500
You have to love Bob.

742
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,200
He loves you, Bob.

743
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,700
You love Bob.

744
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,140
You have to.

745
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,180
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

746
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,300
He'll kill you.

747
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,400
So Bob, you have to.

748
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,540
Bob.

749
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,820
Bob, you have to.

750
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,120
You heard it here first.

751
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:55,820
You heard it.

752
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,660
You don't love Bob.

753
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,480
You don't love Bob.

754
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,940
Bob, you have to.

755
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,140
Maybe it's your friends.

756
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,380
Oh, yes.

757
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,240
Well, you know, if you don't pledge, there's going to be more than one.

758
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,180
You're going to have to listen to it forever.

759
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,300
Or at least until the money.

760
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,460
Dear friends, we need that money.

761
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,200
Oh, my gosh.

762
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Let's get us.

763
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:17,920
Come on.

764
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,060
Let's get something happening here.

765
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:20,360
All right.

766
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,800
We're finally getting a couple of phone lines.

767
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,320
We've raised $200 so far.

768
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:26,720
Great.

769
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,180
Can you imagine a world without slack?

770
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,560
A world without the hour of slack?

771
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,580
And even almost as bad, a world without can-win at all?

772
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:44,080
Because if you don't send some money by midnight tonight, you're going to be wishing to God you had or Bob.

773
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,600
Oh, the world's going crazy.

774
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,000
Enough with the movie.

775
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:10,440


776
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:10,740
He doesn't deserve the credit.

777
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,820
Enjoying your...

778
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,680
He deserves it.

779
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,980
He deserves it?

780
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,560
Hospital

781
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,040
He deserves it.

782
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,040


783
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,800
was the infant Jesus, either man or God?

784
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,340
Or merely one of the countless aliens

785
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,540
that visit the Earth each and every day?

786
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,640
The answer, yes, definitely.

787
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,360
Take that and shove it up the two-part certainty

788
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,620
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

789
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,400
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

790
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,600
Yeah, and if y'all don't call in

791
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,080
some of that pledge money to keep this station going,

792
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,180
then you might as well forget it.

793
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,700
We ain't gonna be live for long.

794
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,060
We're gonna be off.

795
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,440
You're gonna get the hour of slack

796
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,980
at four o'clock in the morning,

797
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,940
and I ain't gonna be doing it.

798
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,040
No, it'll just be a bunch of tapes,

799
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,080
but that's okay.

800
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,060
That's all you care about, ain't it?

801
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,460
All you care about is these unreleased albums

802
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,200
I'm never gonna be able to play again.

803
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,940
We're having a pathetic turnout.

804
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,460
We need your money, folks.

805
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:48,060
We need your money, folks.

806
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,060
My baby doll

807
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,500
My baby doll

808
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:59,820
Baby, baby, baby doll

809
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,420
My baby doll

810
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,600


811
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,220
Light of my life, she turns it on.

812
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,920
Toot, toot, toot, toot.

813
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,900
Over my head, not closing up.

814
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,540
Toot, toot.

815
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,080
My baby doll.

816
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,540
My baby doll.

817
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,580
Doll baby.

818
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,960
My baby doll.

819
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,800
Baby, baby, baby doll.

820
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,420
My baby doll.

821
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,120
My baby doll.

822
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,480
Baby doll.

823
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,580
You look so good.

824
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,820
Baby doll.

825
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,020
You feel so big.

826
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,300
Baby doll.

827
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,940
You let me have it.

828
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,780
Baby doll.

829
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,680
Why don't you do it, baby doll?

830
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,320
Baby doll.

831
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,860
Baby doll.

832
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,380
Baby doll.

833
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,520
Baby doll.

834
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:12,520


835
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,960
Baby doll.

836
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,260
Baby doll.

837
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,940
Baby doll.

838
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,420
Baby doll.

839
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,000
We've2 done it.

840
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,100


841
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,100


842
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,100


843
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,100


844
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,100


845
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,100


846
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,100


847
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,100


848
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,100


849
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,100


850
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,100


851
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,100


852
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,100


853
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:57,560
Yeah, died. That's right. That song's going to stay dead and you're not going to hear the rest of any of this cool, groovy, unreleased stuff until we start getting some calls in.

854
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,340
I mean, it's 1139 at KNO in here and we ain't getting nothing.

855
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,140
Come on, you slugs.

856
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,480
Listen, I'm serious. This is, this is, it's really, really looking bad at this point, friends.

857
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,340
Uh, we've got, this is my one hour to raise some money for this show.

858
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,200
The only time we're not going to be able to do it next week.

859
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:22,340
Uh, you know, I'm not going to be able to do it again for another, uh, three months.

860
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,220
Yeah, well, that's, that's it. That's a good, that's a, we may not be here.

861
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:38,680
We died. My baby died. My baby died. Who cares?

862
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,040
Um.

863
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:48,060
I mean, friends, there's a big thermometer on the wall here and it, and unfortunately it's only up to about 10% of what it's supposed to be.

864
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,360
Now, last time, most of you called in in the last 10, 15 minutes and I'm assuming that may be what it is.

865
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,960
I sure hope that's what it is.

866
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,180
So we ain't got half what we did last time and last time didn't do us a whole lot of good.

867
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:09,720
And I'm, I'm sorry. This, uh, this is getting a little bit frightening to me because, uh, you think, I mean, I get on, I try to be entertaining and funny.

868
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,320
But.

869
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,520
Uh, frankly, it's true.

870
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:20,020
I went into the spirit and Bob Dobbs came and said he was going to take me off to that place where, where subgeniuses go.

871
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,740
Asgard, the home of those slain by overwork for Bob.

872
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:37,420
And that, I mean, listen, you know, they live, they let us have this show on this station only, uh, as long as we can prove there's a listening audience.

873
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,520
And so far we just aren't doing it.

874
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,280
So I want you to.

875
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,280
To seriously call.

876
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,960
You don't have to pledge a hundred dollars.

877
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:50,760
You don't even have to pledge $50 pledge, $10 pledged, you know, five, 20, something like that.

878
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:56,900
And the numbers to call are 8, 2, 3, 7, 4, 9 0, or 8, 2, 8, 9, 500.

879
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:03,020
And the place to send those checks is a PO box 7 1 0 9 0 9.

880
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,220
But, uh, you can, you don't even have to send a check.

881
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,980
You can call us in with a bank draft.

882
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,040
Uh, give us the information.

883
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,960
On your, uh, your bank account.

884
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,740
It'll be taken out automatically every month or so, painlessly.

885
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,100
You all, they don't care.

886
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:18,520
Well.

887
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:18,940
They don't care.

888
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,640
Yeah.

889
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,080
And.

890
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:22,480


891
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:22,680
When he's there.

892
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,020
When he's there, when he's there, when he's there.

893
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,160
When he's there.

894
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,200
When he's there, when he's there.

895
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,900
When he is there.

896
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,240
When he's there, when he is there.

897
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,980
And that's your symphony.

898
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,620
That's right, friends.

899
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,320
Now you can have

900
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:06,180
this amazing new symphony

901
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,760
generates in the mind of the salesman

902
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,360
before it does in the prospect.

903
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,140
Oh, something to sell.

904
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,100
He used to be my savior.

905
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,520
He used to be a friend.

906
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,980
But he didn't have just enough money

907
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,340
to lend some.

908
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,720
We don't think about

909
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,160
money.

910
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:36,560
We don't think about

911
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,600
dollars anymore.

912
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,160
We don't think about

913
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,000
dollars anymore.

914
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,520
Give me that again, will you?

915
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,340
Who's gonna get them?

916
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,780
The helots.

917
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,320
Who are they?

918
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,620
Listen, Sucky, you ever been broke?

919
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,000
Sure, mostly often.

920
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,100
All right, you're walking along.

921
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,560
Not a nickel in your jeans, you're free as the wind.

922
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,920
Nobody bothers you. Hundreds of people pass you by

923
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,860
in every line of business.

924
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,540
Shoes, hats, automobiles, radios, furniture,

925
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:05,960
everything.

926
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,040
They're all nice, lovable people.

927
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,180
They let you along.

928
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,140
Was that right?

929
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,380
Then you get a hold of some dough and what happens?

930
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,300
All those nice, sweet, lovable people become helots.

931
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,220
A lot of heels.

932
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:23,460
They begin creeping up on you.

933
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,260
Trying to sell you something.

934
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,220
They get long claws.

935
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,680
And they get a stranglehold on you.

936
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,080
And you squirm and you duck and you holler

937
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,100
and you try to push them away,

938
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,040
but you haven't got a chance.

939
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,640
They gut you.

940
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,160
First thing you do, you get a hold of them.

941
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,240
You know your own things.

942
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,740
A car, for instance.

943
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,060
Now your whole life is messed up with a lot more stuff.

944
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,960
You get license fees

945
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,220
and number plates

946
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,180
and gas and oil

947
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,820
and taxes and insurance

948
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:51,500
and identification cards and letters

949
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,640
and bills and flat tires and dents

950
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,840
and traffic tickets and motorcycle pops

951
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,760
and courtrooms and lawyers and fines

952
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,880
and a million and one other things.

953
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,580
And what happens?

954
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,760
You're not the free and happy guy you used to be.

955
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,720
You got to have money to pay for all those things.

956
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,500
So you go after what the other fellas got.

957
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,300
And there you are.

958
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,920
You're a helot yourself.

959
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,160
You win, Colonel.

960
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,180
Here, take the 50.

961
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,900
Go ahead and get rid of it.

962
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,460
You bet I will, just as fast as I can.

963
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,920
I'm going to get some canned goods,

964
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,920
a fish and rot, and the rest I'm going to give away.

965
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,260
Give away?

966
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,160
Hey, get me a pitcher's glove.

967
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,220
I've got to get some practice.

968
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,980
Say, he's giving it away.

969
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,020
I'm going to get me some of that.

970
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,020
Hey, come back here, you helot.

971
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,800
Well, you said

972
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,060
if anybody should ask you what the average John Doe is like,

973
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,800
you couldn't tell him

974
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,820
because he's a million and one thing.

975
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,960
He's Mr. Big.

976
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,360
With Connie's encouragement,

977
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,900
the young Dobbs became a salesman

978
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,900
of legendary and almost frantic

979
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,540
and frightening abilities,

980
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,140
known to his peers as the man who could sell anything.

981
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,960
He worked his way up to the very top

982
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,520
of the conspiracy ladder and might have saved him.

983
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:16,940
But...

984
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,180
But, dear friends, but...

985
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,060
What?

986
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,940
Oh, folks, I want you to get back on those phones

987
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,200
and call in another pledge.

988
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,260
And don't just pledge money, pledge everything.

989
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:34,900
You can pledge...

990
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:34,900


991
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,640
You can pledge credit cards.

992
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,080
That's right.

993
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,360
We'll take Visa or Master Charge here.

994
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,940
Most of you feel the spirit of giving, friends.

995
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,980
This is that wonderful time of year.

996
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,200
And if you can just call 828-9500,

997
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,360
folks, and keep us on the air.

998
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,500
Not just the Hour of Slack,

999
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,720
but KNON and all the other shows that you like

1000
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,520
and that I like.

1001
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,160
But don't...

1002
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,560
You know, we got a lot of subgeniuses out there

1003
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,880
that call in with their phones.

1004
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,880
With their church names.

1005
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,240
Their...

1006
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:07,580
Their...

1007
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,000
Their church names.

1008
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,660
And see, the problem with that is

1009
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,880
if you don't give your real name also,

1010
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,440
or rather your human name,

1011
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,080
if you don't give your human name,

1012
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,580
the mail won't get to you.

1013
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,760
Your subgenius church application form

1014
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,760
won't get to you.

1015
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,220
Your KNON t-shirt,

1016
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,000
if you had that large of a pledge,

1017
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,160
your KNON newsletter,

1018
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,160
that won't get to you.

1019
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:33,920
The post office,

1020
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,580
we have found out the hard way,

1021
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,000
is have many subgeni out there

1022
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,320
that if you don't tell the conspiracy your real name,

1023
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,280
they use that as an excuse

1024
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,660
not to give you your due slack.

1025
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,180
Just one of many, many excuses.

1026
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,260
So watch out with fake names,

1027
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,840
but do call in with that Visa and MasterCard number.

1028
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,920
Call in with that promise of a check or cash.

1029
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,180
And look at these names.

1030
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,120
Look at these souls lining up for the harvest, friends.

1031
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,600
Oh, look at these...

1032
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,660
I just wanted to be positive.

1033
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,700
Look at these souls.

1034
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,000
Look at these souls lining up for the harvest.

1035
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,180
Yes, we got a couple of them.

1036
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,060
And we finally got a couple of pledges.

1037
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,800
We got $100 from the High Council.

1038
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:15,940
Yeah.

1039
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,820
I want to see that $100 cash before I'm leaving.

1040
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,760
I've got 13 minutes to live, dear friends.

1041
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,560
13 minutes to live, according to the word of Bob.

1042
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:31,320
And I don't know about you, but I trust the word of Bob.

1043
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,680
In fact, it's about the only dang thing

1044
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:33,900
in the world.

1045
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,520
And this university can trust.

1046
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,300
And he's a hell of a liar.

1047
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,980
So I don't know.

1048
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,180
I just don't know.

1049
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,620
Call in those numbers.

1050
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,460
823-95...

1051
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,260
No, it's 823-7490

1052
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,960
or 828-9500.

1053
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,020
Are we getting any in there?

1054
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,680
Oh, they're just sitting there.

1055
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,660
They're trickling in.

1056
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,360
We got two or three, I guess.

1057
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,740
That's going to be a great ending for my life.

1058
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,300
Great.

1059
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,720
12 minutes to live.

1060
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,660
I guess I'll go out in a real bang, huh?

1061
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,360
It's going to be great.

1062
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,560
I'll be going out in a poof.

1063
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,620
More like it.

1064
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,260
More like what it is.

1065
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,680
They don't care about their souls.

1066
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,480
Mom, I don't know where my soul's going in 11 minutes.

1067
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,780
Well, I hope I know where it's going anyway.

1068
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:27,880
I don't know.

1069
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,960
My friends post that they can keep...

1070
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:33,320
Can I tell you?

1071
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:34,760
No.

1072
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,880
Uh, look where Positive Thinking has gotten most of the world so far.

1073
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,760
People say that Reverend Stange is a pessimistic booger,

1074
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:46,700
but frankly, I'm worried that my most pessimistic predictions

1075
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:51,520
might turn out to have been, in the long run, idiotically optimistic.

1076
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,400
And our fear tonight is that you out there taping this show

1077
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,500
will think...

1078
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:02,520
will think, oh, well, well, they'll stay on the air or not.

1079
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,560
Whether I give or not.

1080
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:13,960
But folks, if you don't pledge, the world will literally come to an end at the end of this hour.

1081
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,320
If you, and I don't mean just some of you, I mean you, the one listening right now.

1082
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,760
Oh, you're laughing. You're laughing.

1083
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,320
It's going to collapse around your pathetic ears, but you nihilistic teenagers out there,

1084
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,280
oh, no future, man, no future.

1085
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:33,260
You know, that's why if the rival cult that wants these airwaves had this hour,

1086
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,320
they'd have raised $10,000 by now.

1087
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,440
And you know what they'd do with it?

1088
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,080
They'd build concentration camps for the likes of you.

1089
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,500
You abnormal.

1090
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,980
You punk.

1091
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,520
You old hippie.

1092
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,280
You humanist.

1093
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,800
So genius.

1094
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,120
So friends, you know, the money isn't just for the hour of slack.

1095
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,840
It's for the totality that is K-N-O-N.

1096
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,980
It isn't just for us mutants.

1097
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,540
It's for your very mind, your very soul.

1098
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:09,420
And you wouldn't believe how close your soul is to being sold out.

1099
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,940
Dear brother or sister, between your job and the drugs and the lies,

1100
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,880
listen, you need every bit of slack you can hang on to.

1101
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,740
And we have a special form of slack in store for you tonight.

1102
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:23,260
Not stored in souls anywhere.

1103
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,180
And the type of slack you're going to be getting,

1104
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,220
is guilt.

1105
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,420
Guilt.

1106
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,380
Tonight we're going to whip us up some guilt.

1107
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,320
Some of you are saying,

1108
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,520
oh, what's pledge time,

1109
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,360
Reverend Stang's going to rant all night about money.

1110
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,600
And you better be afraid that that's true,

1111
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,980
little Bobby, little gimme Bob out there,

1112
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,760
because if you don't send that pledge by midnight,

1113
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:44,980
by midnight tonight,

1114
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,180
you're going to be wishing to Bob that you had,

1115
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,020
or whatever god you worship,

1116
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,520
the stark fist of a beautiful nose,

1117
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,780
whether you did or didn't.

1118
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,980
Do you think I'm crazy?

1119
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,260
Do you think I'm crazy?

1120
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,480
That's what they say about me.

1121
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,580
We'll call 828-9500.

1122
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,880
Call that number, 828-9500,

1123
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:07,200
or 823-7490,

1124
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,560
and receive the word of Bob.

1125
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,460
And first, you will want to turn away from him.

1126
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:23,380
Then, you may find him a silent, unresisting target for your ridicule.

1127
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,440
Stand up.

1128
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,120
Stand up!

1129
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:26,240
Stand up!

1130
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,440
Turn around!

1131
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:28,240
Turn around!

1132
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,360
Mister, why's your head so big, mister?

1133
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,400
But if you come to know him,

1134
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:36,140
Have you always been the way you are now?

1135
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,960
you will begin to see beyond the perversion of his form.

1136
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,140
Are you in any pain?

1137
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,000
Are your parents still alive?

1138
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,740
and discover the beauty in the beast.

1139
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,860
At no time have I met with such a perverted or degraded version of a human being as this man.

1140
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,980
I am not an animal.

1141
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,040
I am a human being.

1142
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:02,180
At this level, our salesman can see the top of the ladder and is well on his way to it.

1143
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,660
Well, I wish, I wish.

1144
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,380
Funny, you think it's real funny, don't you?

1145
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,840
I've about given up.

1146
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,680
I've got eight minutes to live, friends.

1147
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,160
Now, the hell is growing. The money ain't.

1148
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:26,100
The calls, Pope S. Cecilia's sitting there twiddling her thumbs.

1149
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:26,100


1150
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,180
All six of them.

1151
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,700
But what can you, a humble servant of Bob, do?

1152
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,180
Bob, my friend, is begun.

1153
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,040
But you are the boy to go.

1154
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,860
The showdown is fast approaching.

1155
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,240
Though the church is still unknown to most pigs,

1156
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:00,320
its infectious, ever-changing doctrines are spreading across the continent.

1157
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,560
Church headquarters, the first megafist of the lodge,

1158
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,620
is housed in this Dallas skyscraper,

1159
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:13,960
from which Dob's secret mandates are issued to his agents in the dreaded Brotherhood of Bob.

1160
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:20,040
But this mighty edifice represents but the tip of a wandering rogue iceberg.

1161
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:25,220
The words, hymns, and sound effects of Dob's are disseminated on a weekly basis.

1162
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,060
The

1163
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:45,500
First Bob, my name is Billy Jing.

1164
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:48,720
I will tell you some funny story.

1165
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:54,300
We know that humor is through exaggeration.

1166
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:00,960
Now a high school student came in and said that Bob is going to get arrestedプ där

1167
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,080
credits

1168
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,660
Well, that's the joke it's just the writing.

1169
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:03,660


1170
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:10,520
people got a piece of a right

1171
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,840
that people were normal

1172
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:11,840


1173
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,780
well and I was not

1174
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,280
aram

1175
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,140
cannonball

1176
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:20,140


1177
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,360
separated Belt

1178
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,160
I don't even care.

1179
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,540
Ivan, no.

1180
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,120
Wait a minute, is that clock right?

1181
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,240
Oh, my heart!

1182
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:31,840
Ivan!

1183
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,580
Ivan!

1184
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,160
No!

1185
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:40,020
Oh, no!

1186
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,420
Ivan!

1187
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:43,600
Ivan!

1188
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,220
Ivan, no!

1189
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,480
Please, help!

1190
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:49,740
Oh!

1191
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,200
Ivan, he's...

1192
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,020
No!

1193
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:58,920
He's dead!

1194
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:01,340
You dogs!

1195
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,160
You animals!

1196
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,100
You killed him!

1197
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,000
You scum!

1198
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:05,800
You did it!

1199
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,300
No, you couldn't believe it, K.O.

1200
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,500
We had to send you your money, and now he's dead!

1201
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:11,620
He's dead!

1202
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,100
Oh, no!

1203
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,760
And you think you'll hear the hours like on any other station?

1204
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:15,380
Ha!

1205
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,800
Dream on, it's over!

1206
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:17,420
There's no staying!

1207
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,720
Let me slap you around a little, see if you can't take it!

1208
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,060
Yeah!

1209
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,400
Stay funny!

1210
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:21,820
Come on, Stank!

1211
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,440
Get up!

1212
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,220
I tried again!

1213
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:23,700
Hope you're happy!

1214
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,280
Come on, Stank!

1215
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,180
Yeah, killed him!

1216
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:26,580
No!

1217
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:27,340
No!

1218
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,100
Deader than hell!

1219
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:28,640
He's not moving!

1220
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:29,360
Oh, my God!

1221
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,380
It's all over, and it's your fault!

1222
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:33,260
Faithless!

1223
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:33,940
Faithless!

1224
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:34,620
Hell!

1225
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,660
I've never seen anything like this!

1226
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:41,280
Anybody got a 220 wire, I'll stick it up next to his heart, if we can find where it is.

1227
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,460
That won't do any good.

1228
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,060
I've got a cab!

1229
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,240
His net life is gone!

1230
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:44,640
All right!

1231
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,520
He's been deserted!

1232
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:46,360
Get it going!

1233
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,020
Where are those phone calls?

1234
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,720
That's the only thing that can bring him...

1235
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,880
up is phone calls!

1236
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,620
Why aren't those lines being lit?

1237
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,420
No, they don't care.

1238
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,020
Couldn't believe that there even was a Bob.

1239
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,040
I believe that varies.

1240
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:09,040
Oh, 823-7490-828-9500.

1241
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,260
Please call.

1242
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,280
Call now!

1243
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,660
Hurry up!

1244
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,180
Any sec...

1245
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:16,940
Here's Ron Lindsey.

1246
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:17,740
Oh, my God!

1247
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,660
Here's Ron...

1248
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:18,880
Come!

1249
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:19,600
Come!

1250
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,400
Come on, now!

1251
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,300
Hurry up!

1252
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:21,800
Ouch!

1253
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,620
I'm so confused!

1254
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,520
Okay, poor Ron Lindsey's walked in on his horrible tragedy!

1255
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,600
What's wrong with you people?

1256
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:29,880
Okay!

1257
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,460
Okay, we've got the high power line.

1258
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,740
We're gonna apply it to Ivan's heart now.

1259
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,740
Only you can help save the Reverend Stanning.

1260
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,140
Only you can save him.

1261
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:37,580
Come on.

1262
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:38,520
I know you're...

1263
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,640
I know you want to.

1264
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:40,380
It's in your heart.

1265
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:41,560
You've got to save Ivan.

1266
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,320
How can you live without Ivan?

1267
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:43,480


1268
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,120
We've got the power line.

1269
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:44,900
Ready switch.

1270
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:45,620
Hit it!

1271
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:46,520
Ah!

1272
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:47,920
Look!

1273
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,820
I've been to the mountain top.

1274
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,700
I've seen the possibilities.

1275
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,600
I've seen what awaits us.

1276
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,580
All right.

1277
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,920
Wait a minute.

1278
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,060
I'm getting a transmission.

1279
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,180
Friends!

1280
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,860
Bob said I can tell the truth now.

1281
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,980
I can go ahead and tell you what's been going on here.

1282
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:25,760
What?

1283
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,580
Friends, I lied.

1284
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:35,220
I lied.

1285
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:36,980
Lied, lied, dear friends.

1286
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,680
Actually, the last pledge drive.

1287
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,340
This is the first time we've announced this.

1288
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:42,560
We've known for about a month.

1289
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,580
During the last pledge drive, the hour of slack raised.

1290
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:46,460
Actually.

1291
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:47,300
The hour of slack raised.

1292
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:52,040
The hour of slack raised more money per hour than any other show on KNON.

1293
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,340
Can you believe it?

1294
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:58,580
This, the weirdest show in the Southwest, if not the universe,

1295
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:05,860
managed to raise more per hour and just about more, period, than any other show.

1296
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,280
More than the, I mean, it's unbelievable.

1297
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,000
And this was paid money, dear friends.

1298
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,320
Paid, paid up pledges.

1299
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,560
Now, what we got this time?

1300
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:17,260
I've got a giant chance.

1301
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,440
We've been faking you out, you fools, suckers.

1302
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,380
We got your...

1303
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,800
No, we actually, actually, don't speak too soon.

1304
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,280
We just got the, we just got the pledges.

1305
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,680
We don't have the money yet.

1306
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,480
It don't count.

1307
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,640
That's right.

1308
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:36,940
It doesn't count until we, until we actually get that green in the station's pockets.

1309
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,500
And if you don't get it, Zaphod comes looking for you.

1310
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:39,920
That's right.

1311
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,180
The station's got big, big pockets.

1312
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,180
And Zaphod's got a mighty...

1313
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,120
He's got big...

1314
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:45,600
Big feet.

1315
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,540
Being a son of the Yeti, he's ready to stomp you, friends.

1316
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,340
So, stay tuned.

1317
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,700
You've got two minutes for...

1318
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,940
Keep, you keep on calling in.

1319
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:03,740
You've got two more minutes to go ahead and top us off if we possibly can.

1320
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,600
I don't think we did as well as the last pledge drive.

1321
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,520
But, but it's, you know, we could.

1322
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:10,600
We could, we could make it.

1323
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:13,260
823-7490, 828-9500.

1324
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,100
You know, I mean...

1325
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,560
Let's, let's, let's not...

1326
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,900
Hell, hell fire.

1327
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:18,940
Hell.

1328
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,120
I've had it.

1329
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,880
I've had enough of this stuff.

1330
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,620
I'm ready to get out of here.

1331
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,520
I'm sure something's going on here.

1332
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:52,200
I'll see you in over a week.

1333
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,680
Hey!

1334
00:57:59,260 --> 00:57:59,320
Hey!

1335
00:57:59,320 --> 00:57:59,320


1336
00:57:59,320 --> 00:57:59,320


1337
00:57:59,320 --> 00:57:59,320


1338
00:57:59,320 --> 00:57:59,320


1339
00:57:59,320 --> 00:57:59,320


1340
00:57:59,320 --> 00:57:59,320


1341
00:57:59,320 --> 00:57:59,320


1342
00:57:59,320 --> 00:57:59,680
Bye-bye.

1343
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,020
Bye-bye.

1344
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,760
See you next time.

1345
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,220
Bye-bye.

1346
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:03,220


1347
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:03,640
Bye-bye.

1348
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,340
Bye-bye.

1349
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:05,640
Bye-bye.

1350
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:06,680
Bye-bye.

1351
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,140
We'll see you next time.

1352
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,520
Bye-bye.

1353
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:11,660
Bye-bye.

1354
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,960
But, get in the Jaybirds.

1355
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:32,120
What? What? What?

1356
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,080
No, we don't. We're getting out of here.

1357
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,300
No, you can't. Not anymore. It's over with. That's it.

1358
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:48,660
I'm sorry, friends, that we had to pull these gimmicks on you to try, but I swear y'all were sluggish tonight.

1359
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,440
Sluggish. I think I will just go home and die every night.

1360
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,200
But Ron Lindsey is here.

1361
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:00,300
And, friends, you better get ready to pay up again.

1362
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,320
Do it again. Call in another pledge.

1363
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,940
This is the stateside. That's all it is, friend.

1364
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,440
Money. What is money but merely a medium of exchange? Who cares?

1365
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,560
We're going to go back to the home for slackless children.

1366
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:16,520
Tell the poor kids we just got enough for...

1367
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:20,100
Hey, we don't have enough money for modeling clay this time around.

1368
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,960
I've had enough.

1369
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,640
No free lunches this time.

1370
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,160
Thanks a lot, suckers.

1371
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:34,160
You're listening to KNON 90.9 FM. Praise Bob.

1372
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,900
We'll be right back.

1373
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,500
Money, money, money, money, money.

1374
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,500
Money, money, money, money, money.

1375
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,440
Money.

1376
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,120
Money.

1377
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:37,760
Some people got to have it.

1378
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,620
Some people.

1379
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,500
Really need it.

1380
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:44,280
Listen to me, y'all.

1381
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:48,780
Do things, do things, do things, bad things with it.

1382
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:58,320
Well, you're going to do things, do things, do things, good things with it.

1383
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,020
Yeah, yeah.

1384
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,660
Uh-huh.

1385
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,180
Talk about cash, money, money.

1386
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:07,740
Yeah.

1387
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,220
Talk about cash, money.

1388
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,260
Dollar bills, y'all.

1389
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,280
Come on now.

1390
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:19,720
Yeah, yeah.

1391
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:22,660
Yeah, yeah.

1392
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:24,580
Yeah.

All the love and money

01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:31,240
People will steal from their mother

1395
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,440
All the love and money

People will ride their own brother

1397
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,260
All the love and money

1398
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,320
People can't even walk the street

1399
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,280
All the love and money

1400
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:41,280


1401
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,280
Because they'll never know

1402
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,240
In the world they're going to meet

1403
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,820
For that deed, oh, deed

That's money

People will laugh, laugh, they will cheat
