1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Remember, remember, remember, we're sitting together listening to this.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:04,880
And this was prison.

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,980
Remember, remember, remember, remember, remember, remember, remember, remember.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,400
You need me, and I have come.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,640
Hi, Bob.

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,200
Hi, Bob.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:15,700
Hi, Bob.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,140
Yeah.

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,520
Bob, Bob.

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,200
Bob.

11
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:18,780
Bob.

12
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,660
Bob, Bob.

13
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,140
Bob, Bob.

14
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,560
Yes, sir.

15
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,960
I like subgenius.

16
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,640
No, sir.

17
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,020
I don't like pink boys.

18
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:25,920
Yes, sir.

19
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,880
I love Bob.

20
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,800
No, sir.

21
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,460
No, sir.

22
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,240
Sir, I do not want to stop Bob.

23
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,020
I want Bob in every tree.

24
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,100
I just want to give my feast to the thousands.

25
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,480
In every flower, in every bee, in every leaf, in every twig, in every cow, in every pig.

26
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,180
They brought out the best in Bob's fish and laid it upon the other water and fowl and little stinky things.

27
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,040
I want to see him in the sky.

28
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,620
I hope his pipe will catch my eye.

29
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:58,220
Dear Bob who floats above the ground, I long to hear the mournful sound that's made when you emerge from space

30
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,440
and come to the sky.

31
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,780
This is my dwelling place.

32
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,880
Dear Bob, each night while I'm asleep, I hope to my house you will creep and poke your

33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,100
pipe in through the wall so I'll be burned remembering all.

34
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,580
Dear Bob, it's time to close my eyes.

35
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,640
Remember now.

36
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,040
It's no surprise if I should be found dead someday.

37
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,740
I'll think that you were in the way.

38
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,620
Oh, gimme Bob.

39
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,480
Confusing that face.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,440
Oh, gimme Bob.

41
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,700
With my own.

42
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,180
Can't remember my place.

43
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,420
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to

44
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,460
the subgenius.

45
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,700
Our old swag.

46
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:59,280
Bob's role on this planet is to see that the earth is not soul.

47
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,680
On that glorious or terrible day we call X-Day in 1998.

48
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,280
When the men from Planet X arrive.

49
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:06,740
Yeah.

50
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,380
Now it may sound ludicrous.

51
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,200
It may sound ridiculous to many believers out there.

52
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:11,420
It may sound impossible.

53
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:11,660
That's right.

54
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,020
You're saying they're all nuts, all those people?

55
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,700
Maybe.

56
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,800
Yeah, maybe.

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,220
You once were telling me about Planet X, Dr. Morbund.

58
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,320
Evil on Planet X is more than you could think of.

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,420
Evil stalks some people.

60
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,420


61
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,420


62
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,420


63
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,420


64
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,420


65
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,420


66
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,420


67
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,200
Every night and day they wait to see the evil they go through.

68
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,640
So they come down in flying saucers?

69
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,200
Flying saucers are bearing on us.

70
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,140
We don't know what to do.

71
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,240
We're here all alone.

72
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,380
The planets are fading.

73
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,860
The blood is running.

74
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,720
The lights were fading.

75
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,480
And they stalked us one by one.

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,200
This is the Man in Black here for the Roma Wine Company.

77
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,400
I'm Bob.

78
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,400


79
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,400


80
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,400


81
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,400


82
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,400


83
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,400


84
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,400


85
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,400


86
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,400


87
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,400


88
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,400


89
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,400


90
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,400


91
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,400


92
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,760
I'm Bob

93
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,180
my ìž˜ feast.

94
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,800
Goodbye.

95
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:29,380
Have a wonderful day.

96
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:29,380


97
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,300
What happens when that collapses?

98
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,760
What happens when your diary was a damn well?

99
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,440
What happens when your diary was a damn well?

100
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,220
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius church.

101
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,740
But until that day, the power and wisdom of Bob can help us break their mind control

102
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,860
by activating that mutant gland that we all have within us.

103
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,680
You don't like your life?

104
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,180
Straighten it out in a big hurry.

105
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,400
Give your money to the church, not the state.

106
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,460
The church!

107
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,680
Yes!

108
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,200
Give us your children!

109
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,860
Give us your children!

110
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,400
Let us raise them!

111
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,360
You'll have weirder kids than me!

112
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,640
That's hot. Very hot.

113
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,520
Meltdown.

114
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,180
Summer can come and live to be yours.

115
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,740
Uh, yes, dear friends, it can happen to you.

116
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,460
It can be yours, and it will be yours on X-Day 1998.

117
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,280
Only two years from now.

118
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,620
And, of course, dear friends, this is our, uh, X-Day show.

119
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,840
It's, uh, July.

120
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,440
By the time you hear this tape, I will probably be at the X-Day drill.

121
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,940
And, uh, drilling my way in deep environment.

122
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,160
I'll be your rival.

123
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,400
Famous last words.

124
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,540
From 1996.

125
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,560
Boy, there were some old voices on there.

126
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,760
Or young voices.

127
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,280
Young, uh, Pope Keckhaver was there.

128
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,720
Yeah, I could hear, uh, Glass Madness in there.

129
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,620
And, uh...

130
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,820
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

131
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,360
Uh, once you hear this...

132
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,240
Yeah, that, that show...

133
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,540
Number 534 that I grabbed to cover the first five minutes here.

134
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,440
Since we just got back from Wisteria.

135
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,800
It was, uh...

136
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,600
20, uh, X-Days ago.

137
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,620
That was, uh, the first drill.

138
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,320
We just finished 18 X-Day.

139
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:52,200
But, really, it's the 20th time that it's turned out to be a drill.

140
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,320
Not the right X-Day.

141
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:54,800
Yeah.

142
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,860
So, uh...

143
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,000
But, uh, but, once again, Bob has left us with the lesson.

144
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,680
X-Day could happen any second, dear friend.

145
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,400
It could be this second.

146
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,600
Or this second, or this one, or this one.

147
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,500
Are you ready?

148
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,600
Will you, will you be ready?

149
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,200
We were certainly ready at 7 o'clock this morning.

150
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,360
Because I'm broadcasting on July 5th.

151
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,660
Out on the landing field.

152
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,960
Well, uh...

153
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,780
They played a trick on us.

154
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,840
Dr. Havilland...

155
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,980
Al, Princess Wee, and Dr. Dark.

156
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,140
Oh, and Philo Drummond.

157
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,100
Were all of us packed into the clown car.

158
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,500
We made our way a little bit early.

159
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,820
Down to the stone circle.

160
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,540
Which really is, looks like a perfect place for a flying saucer to land.

161
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,980
This circle outlined in stone.

162
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:48,880
And there were empty clothing of the subgeniuses all over the place.

163
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,800
Reverend Symphaltimus's yeti suit was, uh, laying there on the ground.

164
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,540
Susie's bimbo outfits.

165
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,180
As if...

166
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,620
And ruptured already.

167
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,600
And we were left behind.

168
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,780
But then we heard the snickering from the tree line and...

169
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,040
Yes, we saw elfin faces watching us, uh, broadly smiling.

170
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,440
Hands over mouth.

171
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,440
Tee hee hee.

172
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,400
Ha ha, another trick on Reverend Stang.

173
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,620
And then we noticed it was time for the world to end.

174
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,460
And we did the countdown.

175
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,800
And, well, the usual.

176
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,900
They all stand around staring at me.

177
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,700
What name?

178
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,520
Oh, Stang.

179
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,080
Oh, Stang's fault.

180
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,400
Let's meet up Stang.

181
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,660
Let's throw Stang in the pond.

182
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,800
Oh, the pond's too far.

183
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,540
Shh, shh, Stang's about to talk.

184
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:34,960
Shh, shh.

185
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,680
Uh, mm, yeah.

186
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,760
I'm upset.

187
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,680
I did have a consolation prize.

188
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:48,180
I bought 50 earth erasers from, uh, Oriental Trading Company.

189
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,380
And handed out, uh, all but ten.

190
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,800
So we know at least 40 people got up at 7 o'clock this morning.

191
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,440
Mm-hmm.

192
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,520
Poor disappointed subgeniuses.

193
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,900
So sad.

194
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,440
And the ones who were the most disappointed were the true subs who actually showed up.

195
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,620
Well, some people stay up all night.

196
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,780
And others like us try to get a little shut-eye.

197
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,440
Even so, some of, uh, the sublets, the, um, actual subgeniuses, as opposed to Bobbies or Gimme Bobs,

198
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,320
or opposed to the elder subgeniuses, uh,

199
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:31,780
who are now known as, uh, Bobsters.

200
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,440
Yeah, oldster Bobsters.

201
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,160
Yes.

202
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:41,180
There were some who had been up all night and yet came right on out to the field,

203
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,060
looking up at the vacuous emptiness of the overarching sky.

204
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,840
Yeah, laughing at us.

205
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,260
The empty, empty sky.

206
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:50,920
Aw, evil.

207
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,160
Not a saucer to be had.

208
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,780
Yeah, so the Discordians will be laughing at us again.

209
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,840
This is a flying saucer.

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,240
Ah.

211
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,780
Um.

212
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,120
Tossed across the lawn.

213
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:11,320
But the good news is the audio recordings of all the shows we did at Tarzan's radio station,

214
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:17,720
all the bands, all the music, so far, everything that I've spot-checked, they sound spot-on.

215
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,880
I am a robot.

216
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,140
So, um, our Slack listeners can look forward to the, uh,

217
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,860
annual, uh, five months of, uh, X-Day recordings.

218
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,360
Yep. Yep.

219
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:38,580
So much recording is done there that five months flow from that one nexus point on the calendar.

220
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:45,140
Well, it's not five months of continuous Slack, but it's about 20 hours of Slack altogether.

221
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,460
Of course, I have to cut cuss words out for the broadcast stations. Uh-huh.

222
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,120
But you can always hear the uncut, uncensored hour of Slack.

223
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,840
Slack at subgenius.com.

224
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,200
Collect your free downloads.

225
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,340
And by the way, they won't be free forever.

226
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,160
Yes, but if you want to get your hardcore subgenius thrills, that's the place to head right now.

227
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,940
subgenius.com.

228
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,040
Oh, it's my job now to watch for a blinky light.

229
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,220
Beep. Beep.

230
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,100
We might, uh...

231
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,460
Boop-boop.

232
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,780
We're gonna stay on the air after this hour

233
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,160
with Dr. Sinister's show.

234
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,800
I hope we don't fall asleep, but I guess it won't matter,

235
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,240
because people call that show.

236
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,740
We don't allow them to call here.

237
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:38,020
Do you remember my telling you that Dr. Sinister called Baby Bear without any trouble at Wisteria

238
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,460
and wished you and Princess Wee a Slackful X-Day?

239
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:47,180
Aww. Well, I actually had a fairly Slackful X-Day,

240
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,100
because I've retired from running around trying to videotape everything.

241
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:51,740
Oh.

242
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,400
I still do a certain amount of running around audio recording everything,

243
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,980
but, uh...

244
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,360
Or, you know, we can't use the videos because everybody's naked all the time.

245
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,560
Here are the clog stompers doing their synthetic native ethnic dance,

246
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,620
which someone always sees and reports on every X-Day.

247
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,000
Well, the, uh...

248
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,500
There's always a question of who's gonna be brave enough to get in that natural pond for the Bob-tism,

249
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,420
and we had a pretty good turnout, much better than I expected.

250
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,680
For that matter, the whole festival had a bigger turnout than it has, likely.

251
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,780
I was in it more this X-Day than I usually manage to get in it, so...

252
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:32,820
In the pond?

253
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,240
Yes, so I became more familiar with it than usual.

254
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,880
True. Uh, Dr. Hal and I do a lot of dunking of subgeniuses as we Bob-tized them.

255
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,780
It's for their own good.

256
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,240
Yeah. Yeah. They... That's, uh...

257
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,620
These punks deserve dunking.

258
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,340
And we make sure that each and every one of them has to go beneath the, uh,

259
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,940
foully, brown-stained surface...

260
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,940
Beneath the waves.

261
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,160
...of the bubbling mass of muck and murk.

262
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,340
It does actually have some muck and murk in it.

263
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,180
It's not really diseased muck and murk, but it's mysterious.

264
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,860
Someone said, is that all that stuff, uh, did that come after the Bob-tism?

265
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,360
And, of course, uh, that is a calumny on the...

266
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,020
Physical cleanliness of subgeniuses.

267
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,400
Right. The scum on the surface of the pond wasn't there until we got in.

268
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,180
You scum. You scum.

269
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,320
Uh...

270
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:40,500
You know, if we had these, uh, X-Day drills, which they've all turned out to be at, uh,

271
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:49,880
Holiday Inn, off the interstate, I'm sure we could get more people, and they would be much more boring people,

272
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,600
because the interesting people are really...

273
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,100
They're willing to put up with camping and this out-of-the-way place and risk terrible, brutal weather,

274
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,900
which we did not have.

275
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,380
It was actually very comfortable out there most of the time.

276
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,140
Yes, it was cool and pleasant. Maybe a little squishy underfoot, but we could...

277
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,140
Almost cold at night.

278
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:14,000
...go down in the dingley dell to the grindhouse and watch My Dinner with Andre the Giant,

279
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,440
Senior Citizen Kane, Rosemary Baby Carrots, and all sorts of other films that are not as well-known as the first run,

280
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,900
things everybody talks about on the internet.

281
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,100
I've always thought it was kind of funny that people go to a campground and then watch movies,

282
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,140
but they watch movies together.

283
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:33,900
Well, ideally.

284
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,300
And they're on MST 3000 routine and everything.

285
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:42,520
That's the way it's supposed to work, but sometimes, uh, no one will go with you, and so you and it are abandoned.

286
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,180
But it runs all the time, whether you're there or not. I've gone, no one's there at all,

287
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,440
and the movies are still projecting.

288
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,140
Down there in the leafy glade.

289
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,020
It's a good place to hide from the clamoring fans.

290
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:04,600
Reverend Stang, I'm gonna ask you what to do with my life, but first I have to tell you my whole life story so you can correctly tell me what to do.

291
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,360
Okay, my parents are blah blah blah blah blah blah blah...

292
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,320
Certainly, my boy.

293
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,080
You know, the subgeniuses are the nicest folks on Earth.

294
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:20,380
Come and unload all your personal problems on them and they'll stop their own busy lives just to listen to you and counsel you.

295
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:27,100
Wherever you are, from whatever direction you come from, go to a subgenius's door now.

296
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,540
Knock on it and announce, I come seeking slack.

297
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,240
And just see what happens.

298
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,220
Here in the wonder world of tomorrow.

299
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,660
Well, what happens eventually is the subgenius looks at his watch and says,

300
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,800
Oh my god, I have to go now!

301
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,620
Oh no, I'll walk you to your stop.

302
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,280
But let me tell you another intriguing adventure that I had.

303
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,980
This one in Maracaibo.

304
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,440
It was when I was in my salad days.

305
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:03,800
Green onions, chives, bell peppers, and of course spinach leaves overall.

306
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,180
Overallish.

307
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,740
Mm-hmm. Not like Popeyes, though, however.

308
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,180
Spinach that's, well, frankly, not in a can.

309
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,780
And for adults as well.

310
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,300
Serves for...

311
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:26,660
When I came down the hill to pack up the set, all the decorations and everything this morning,

312
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,820
Priestess Pisces, who is like Stang 2 and does all the bossy, mean stuff that I used to have to do...

313
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,400
Was still on stage?

314
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,460
No, well, she was, uh...

315
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,520
She greeted me and said,

316
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,480
It was a great X-Day. No one died.

317
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,700
And that is how we judge our X-Days.

318
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,840
Did anyone die? No.

319
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,420
That's the way we do it at Burning Man.

320
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,360
No, Subgenius died, I should say.

321
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,000
At Burning Man, when nobody dies, they're happy.

322
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,400
Well, they have had that problem a couple of times.

323
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,620
Yeah, they broke their record again last year.

324
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,500
But the year before that, nobody died.

325
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,760
Oh, that's good.

326
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,300
Well, no one died that we talk about at any Subgenius X-Day.

327
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,520
No, and I don't even think anybody died unto Bob.

328
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,680
And here is someone alive, I hope.

329
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,540
The real apostates stay away.

330
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,980
And who are we speaking to today?

331
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,420
You are speaking to a phony apostate,

332
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,020
who is growing a dowager hump and moving next to a toxic stump hurrah hurrah hurrah.

333
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,920
Well, you ought to have a doctor look at that swollen apostate problem.

334
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,440
If you're making a joke, Dr. Howell, that's not funny.

335
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,040
Considering the operations that I've got scheduled.

336
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,580
Well, that's true, but the institute in...

337
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:48,820
Do you have a...

338
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:55,460
Basil, uh, Dr. Waldman is considered the greatest specialist in his field.

339
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,620
When he's not drunk.

340
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,320
Well, he's... some people are...

341
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,960
I think he has problems with opiates as well as alcohol,

342
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,560
or he's been known to be involved in the white slave trade, whatever that means.

343
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,020
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

344
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,440
Where's your proof for all these terrible calumnies about poor old white haired Dr....

345
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:12,440


346
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,240
Oh, really?

347
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,680
Yeah. Thousands and thousands point in that direction.

348
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,980
They don't come out and say it.

349
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,280
But you can fill in the blanks if, you know, you're of a...

350
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,260
Well...

351
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:22,860
...some kind of character.

352
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,700
That doesn't sound too scholarly to me.

353
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,960
Where are the footnotes?

354
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,120
Well, it sounds like Dave was not...

355
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,540
Where are the citations?

356
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:39,780
Dave, I get the impression that you were not lifted up onto the escape saucers any quicker than we were this weekend.

357
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,560
Well, as a matter of fact, I expected some kind of transportation.

358
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,840
And instead of...

359
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,520
Well, they're shooting golf guns next door. Can you hear that on the radio?

360
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:49,860
I can.

361
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,340
Well, they're shooting at you? Well, shoot back, man. This is America.

362
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,180
Yeah, this is the fourth, fifth, whatever the encumbrance we've had over the last few thousand years.

363
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,560
And why not defend the empire with snappy little things like those kids were?

364
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,060
At least they're patriotic. Can you say the same for yourself?

365
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,220
They love their country. They just love it.

366
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,940
Weren't you just saying, though, that scoundrels wrap themselves in...

367
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,620
No. Patriotism is the last refuge of scoundrels.

368
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,420
Correct. Samuel Johnson.

369
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,160
Yes, it's true. Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.

370
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:35,700
But that's only because the foulest hide in the leaves of the fairest branches.

371
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,840
The leaves of the fairest? I thought... Oh, I'm sorry.

372
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,200
Oh, I'm just asking...

373
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,480
I'm just asking if you don't agree with the sensibility of that mildewed aphorism.

374
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,620
What is that?

375
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,380
Mildewed aphorism.

376
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:53,160
Are they really shooting at you, Dave, over and over again? I can sure hear that.

377
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
You can hear the gunfire.

378
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:01,600
No, I mean, just, uh, I may have to go to an adjacent room where there are less people outside shooting all firecrackers.

379
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:07,620
That's what you call the, uh, what is it, the safe room, the cold room, or what's that term, the, uh, quiet room.

380
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,600
No, the panic room. Panic room. Panic room.

381
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,360
It's one of our...

382
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,300
Or the mad room.

383
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,500
It's one of our, uh, the mad rooms.

384
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:12,960
Yeah.

385
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:18,480
Just to be able to go into an adjacent room, calm down, uh, you can...

386
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:33,040
Okay, well now you can run your electric trains and calm down while you tell us what happened in our absence while we went out to the deepest wilderness to meet aliens, which, uh, didn't happen.

387
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,000
I will reserve my comment on that for later.

388
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,320
But, uh, what phenomena did you observe in our absence?

389
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,080
I observed...

390
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,560
Uh-huh.

391
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,480
of people are behaving, there is peculiar behavior abundant. That's definitely true.

392
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,760
There are a lot of kids waving sticks around, brandishing lights.

393
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,120
Sticks?

394
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:57,060
Yeah, brandishing spears, you know, homemade spears and galoshes and, you know.

395
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:57,820
Galoshes?

396
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,780
Because it's a criminal act.

397
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:05,020
Well, I guess it must have rained a bit then. They're out in their galoshes waving sticks.

398
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,860
Are you sure these aren't the people who are, you know, just helping the kids cross the

399
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,020
street? Traffic monitors, I believe they call them.

400
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:18,120
No, they used to have those huge, those big, huge helmets, those jade helms or whatever

401
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:25,700
they call them on the propaganda radios. The big, big onyx-shaped glasses. Sometimes

402
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,100
they were wearing these goggles. I remember talking about them too much. But they were

403
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,240
fierce, as far as I was concerned.

404
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,380
Well, maybe you're lucky you got through the entire blockade.

405
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:44,860
It's quite possible you could still be back there at the barrier, unable to reach us or

406
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,440
call in.

407
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,240
Is that what happened down there?

408
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,400
I don't know.

409
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:49,560
In this area?

410
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,380
Do you know what happened up here in Ohio? When we came back, streets were blocked off.

411
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,840
There were cops on every corner.

412
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,940
Oh, yeah, I forgot to look that up. We were desperately trying to make it to the station

413
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:07,900
here on time, and my normal route was blocked off. And we could tell by the detour that

414
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:14,700
this huge area over in Cleveland Heights, actually, was blocked off.

415
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,580
The police were everywhere.

416
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,280
Mayfield Heights.

417
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,380
Yeah, well, it's Fourth of July. The police are having a...

418
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,400
...free zone, you know. That helps. At least we don't have to worry about any bombs going

419
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,080
off or anything.

420
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,860
Well, perhaps you do know, but you can't tell us because it would compromise a story that

421
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,580
you're working on.

422
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,640
Oh, no. I'm not creating history, if you know what I'm saying.

423
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,420
Well, no.

424
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,720
I'm not creating history.

425
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,360
What do you suppose this was all about? We had to take an extra lengthy detour simply

426
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:45,920
to...

427
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,280
Toxic waste spill. That was my theory.

428
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,320
...reach the Slacker Mansion.

429
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,980
Or alien attack, and they don't want the public to know. That would be my favorite.

430
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,260
Wouldn't that be funny?

431
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:01,260
I think maybe. One thing that could have happened is it could have been a fissure in the old

432
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:07,160
hook. Like saying, for instance, in your timelines and stuff like that, it really did happen.

433
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,840
X-Day really did happen.

434
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:14,800
But it didn't happen all the way, and there was all kinds of dismay and strange events

435
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,500
going on that precluded some sort of... Maybe they thought the person was trying to be a

436
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,440
terrorist or something.

437
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,460
There were enough cops and roadblocks around that there was sure something going on over

438
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,440
in the Mayfield Heights, Cleveland Heights area tonight, July 5th.

439
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:38,660
We'll stay with that story as the show continues, and perhaps as more news gets to us. In the

440
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:44,140
meantime, we're interested in your comments, so make sure you stay in contact as we continue

441
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:51,680
to deliver you the latest from X-Day at the Wisteria Campground in Deepest, Ohio.

442
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:58,780
And I did notice, Betty, that Hysteria, those have a long and troublesome history in the

443
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:03,280
annals of most of the parts of Southern Ohio we've dealt with over the last few weeks.

444
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,580
Well, don't believe everything you read on the Internet.

445
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,400
The staff was wisterical.

446
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,560
That's right. And wistful, also.

447
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:18,200
And I remember the one logo, the guy's wearing a monocle, and he looks like an SS colonel.

448
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,480
I thought that was really cute.

449
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,280
Who was that? Papa Joe Mama or something?

450
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,940
Dave may be making it up, but he's describing something that really has happened plenty of times.

451
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:35,240
Absolument. We have had the guys in the snazzy uniforms marching around, goose-stepping,

452
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,400
hiling. It's not...

453
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:38,640
It's not.

454
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:38,640


455
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,980
It's not unusual. I mean, it's not standard subgenius behavior, but we have all political

456
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:50,680
spectra represented at the campground, from hard right to limp-wristed, egg-sucking liberal.

457
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,440
That's me.

458
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,800
Saucy women of all varieties.

459
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:00,260
Everyone should be equal and special at the same time, but take all their money from the

460
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:06,200
people who are bad, which is the lucky people. See, I'm a limp-wristed liberal.

461
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,160
Mm-hmm.

462
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,720
Yep.

463
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,120
Mm-hmm.

464
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:14,060
That's what I heard that liberals say from conservatives. That's what the conservatives

465
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,900
told me that the liberals all say.

466
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,180
Yes.

467
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,260
That's what liberals say, and moo is what cows say.

468
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,320
And just think, they also accuse all liberals who talk to them in such a manner of cognitive

469
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,400
dissonance. And had it not been a tax on their cognitive dissonance, it prompted the idea

470
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,800
of cognitive dissonance. They would have never known what it was, but they accuse

471
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,880
everyone else of that now, which I think is fitting and moist.

472
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,640
What's worse, a cognitive dissidence.

473
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,560
Not dissidence.

474
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,640
The rebels in the system.

475
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,220
Or dissidence.

476
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:55,360
Mm-hmm. Even so. But, you know, there's room for a huge mixture at the campground, because

477
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:03,620
subgenius praxis and philosophy kind of winnow them all down to a bland subgenius statistical

478
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,360
normalcy.

479
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,620
There was a new person.

480
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,420
There was a new person there whose name was not generic subgenius, but what was it?

481
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,380
Something like subgenius minister?

482
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,500
Yeah, simply, yeah, Reverend Subgenius Minister.

483
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,180
It's like the most generic name I'd ever heard.

484
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,900
Yeah, that was, you know, he really was cute.

485
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,100
He brought his daughter?

486
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:26,840
Yeah.

487
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,740
He missed her.

488
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,840
So, as you can see, that was...

489
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,820
I'm sure you'll all be wearing those funny hats, you know, like with the cardinals and

490
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,620
then the Protestant guys wearing their funny hats and stuff like that.

491
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:37,780
There's a lot of people.

492
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:37,780


493
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,840
There were funny hats aplenty at State Trail 18.

494
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,540
You should have seen the one Susie the Flusie had on, why it caught the four winds of heaven

495
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,340
and whirled them over her head.

496
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,320
It looked like a wind farm on her head.

497
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:57,280
Well, if we could just use those, we could solve the so-called energy crisis.

498
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:07,480
So, we also had many popes and other peeps and perps wearing their specialized headgear.

499
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,180
And the occasional person wearing not much of anything.

500
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,620
But you don't get a whole lot of that.

501
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,440
Yes.

502
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,020
Not like Burning Man or something.

503
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,820
I'm afraid we did have sky-clad individuals.

504
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,260
Yes, they were hopping about the camp fitfully.

505
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,520
These sky-clad hoppers.

506
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,580
What did you like about the Pan Nation University?

507
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,460
Well, bless me.

508
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,560
I liked the way they were standing or whatever his name was.

509
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,720
The frog prints you had is dark for me.

510
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,120
At least that was the same timeline.

511
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,120
Generally, even the larger frogs from the pond don't leave prints,

512
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,560
but they do leave aggressive evidence of their passing.

513
00:26:50,760 --> 00:27:00,880
Sometimes, unfully fledged froglets with tadpole tails nonetheless climb out of or jump out of the pond,

514
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,240
causing surprise and consternation.

515
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,100
They're sending tuxedos.

516
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,440
There's some kind of a butt nipple.

517
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,700
There's a nipping fish in that pond.

518
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:08,980
Wow.

519
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:14,080
It only nips cute young ladies' butts, apparently.

520
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,760
Well, something attached itself to my thigh, but I just detached it.

521
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,360
That was phylo.

522
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,720
I thought it was a leech.

523
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,040
If you're describing phylo, I certainly wouldn't call anyone a leech.

524
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,740
Phylo was not in the pond at the time.

525
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,680
That we know of.

526
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,680
I definitely know.

527
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,400
He can hold his breath for a long time.

528
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,060
He won't.

529
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,320
And he'll nip your butt.

530
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,560
Ladies, you better watch it.

531
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:45,220
But next time, let's bring a swim mask so we can actually see what's at the bottom of that bloody, I mean...

532
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,600
Scummy.

533
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,520
I mean, natural, filtered...

534
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,000
It needs to be filtered.

535
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,960
They say filtered.

536
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,120
Well, there's a reason they filter that, boy.

537
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,080
I'll have to tell you.

538
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,200
Human body parts, right?

539
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,300
Is that what you're saying?

540
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,640
No.

541
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,840
Gigantic tortoises still around.

542
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,660
This year, I thought it was...

543
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,220
The errand.

544
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,440
I thought it was walnuts.

545
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:07,800
Walnut oil.

546
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,840
But now, doubt has been thrown on this theory.

547
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,700
And some say there are no walnut trees anywhere near there, and it's not walnut oil.

548
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,460
Well, what is that brownish scum that covers the surface?

549
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:27,220
That scum is known as the hour of slack from the church of the subgenius.

550
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,480
And you're listening to it now.

551
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,900
We recorded nine hours of slack out there, I believe.

552
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,880
Which I wish you were on, Dave.

553
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,340
Because you can't be on them when I rebroadcast them.

554
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,960
We had a slack out.

555
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,780
But we did have better looking show co-hosts than we normally do.

556
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,180
Yes, the ladies.

557
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,400
Until Philo got there.

558
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:55,640
Yeah, and then Philo also tramples down your voice.

559
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,440
And so, there you go.

560
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,920
But, at any rate...

561
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,940
The transgender thing, once again, you're accusing Philo of being not a transgender, but at least a transgressor.

562
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,560
No, not at all.

563
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,400
You get that.

564
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,440
No, not a trans...

565
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,720
He was taught by J.R. Bob Dobbs himself, so he always gets his way.

566
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,280
That's how it works.

567
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,780
Isn't that a conniistic characteristic to always manipulate the behind the scourings

568
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,660
and relegate the authority to smaller people and bigger people?

569
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,380
Not the way Philo does it.

570
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,500
You won't know that he's done it to you until long after.

571
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,320
But, anyway, we had...

572
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,660
Let's see who we had.

573
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,680
Priestess Pisces as a co-guest host.

574
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,260
Managing the stage.

575
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:44,560
And Reverend Baby Bear, whose voice is always easy and clear to hear on the radio.

576
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,080
Distinctive and beautiful.

577
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,780
Reverend Susie the Floozy.

578
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,400
What we didn't have was Princess Wee.

579
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:57,960
But we did have Princess Wee and her mother, Wee Maumau, sing three separate times,

580
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:03,780
sing filthy, filthy ditties from, I guess, World War II.

581
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,200
In beautiful harmony.

582
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,240
Yeah, beautiful.

583
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,420
Beautiful.

584
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:06,420


585
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,200
And they were beautifully sung with no cuss words because they were from the 40s,

586
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,600
but they were more perverted.

587
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,460
Well, let me put it this way.

588
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:20,040
I can't play the examples now because I don't think I can play them on WCSB or any broadcast show.

589
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,900
Not suitable for air parade.

590
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,780
And that was an 85...

591
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,580
That was the 85-year-old subgenius.

592
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,580
That's why I think they'd be so beautiful with the bleeps left in the mix.

593
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,020
You would hear your grandma singing away and stuff heartily,

594
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,240
and you'd get all...

595
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,220
You'd get all warm-hearted yourself,

596
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,460
and maybe even a little toasty where you're not supposed to be,

597
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,300
and the next thing you know, you'll be attacking her with a club or a stick.

598
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,460
There's nothing to bleep.

599
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:48,440
The filthiest songs don't have bad words in them.

600
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,280
It's the concept.

601
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,640
It's the subject matter that's unbearably foul and vile.

602
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,080
It's swollen.

603
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,440
It's diaphragmic.

604
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,020
You know, it's like a diaphragm or something.

605
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,960
Well, that'll be on the X-rated special hour of Slack,

606
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,640
which you can only hear on the Internet.

607
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,260
And we always get at least two of those out of the X-Day mix.

608
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,040
The X-Day.

609
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,180
The X-Day X-rated special.

610
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,060
X, X, X, X.

611
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,320
With Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy.

612
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,680
Oh, no, that's a different special.

613
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:20,320
And we also even have a little bit of video that we're going to show you right now.

614
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,080
There.

615
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,680
That was it.

616
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,340
Look it.

617
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,040
Look it.

618
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,920
She's got big bobs, Daddy.

619
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:26,940
Hey, stop that.

620
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,780
That is a family show.

621
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,100
Yes.

622
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,680
We better not play.

623
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,080
Hey, hey.

624
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,520
Cut the video.

625
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,600
We can't show that stuff.

626
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,180
That was a mistake in judgment.

627
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,020
Her bobs were wagging.

628
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:36,840
Wagging all over the place.

629
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,300
Yeah, right.

630
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,900
Well, you see.

631
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:40,620
Okay.

632
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,520
I hear it.

633
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,680
Boy, yo, yo, yo, yo.

634
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,540
I hear the boing, boing.

635
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:47,880
All right.

636
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,260
We had subgeniuses of all ages out there.

637
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,760
The pieces of the show up off the floor.

638
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,360
We really.

639
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:53,780
And dust them off.

640
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:54,620
What?

641
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,200
Please, please.

642
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,140
No, it's a show for all ages.

643
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,400
We had subgeniuses from 8 to 85.

644
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,480
Truly.

645
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,060
From the lethargic and stillborn to.

646
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:03,600
And babies.

647
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,840
All struggling for supremacy.

648
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,360
Yeah.

649
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,300
There was.

650
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,420
Well, the baby.

651
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,800
The youngest get the most attention.

652
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,900
There was a couple of practically newborns there.

653
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,600
And, of course, they're the big bosses.

654
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,600
They get the big attention.

655
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,280
Yes.

656
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,720
There was Milton newborn and Rachel newborn.

657
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,860
All right.

658
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,740
Irazu newborn.

659
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,420
And there was a bunch.

660
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,780
And the new birds.

661
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,320
So they're all there.

662
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,560
One big happy family.

663
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,860
Oh, we had a wedding, too.

664
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,880
So there's going to be 10 months from now.

665
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,000
There'll be yet another newborn.

666
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:35,960
Yes.

667
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,880
It takes an extra month to gestate a subgenius.

668
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,600
So, yeah, we may be.

669
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:42,940
Yeah.

670
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,160
You're kind of planning those holidays.

671
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,840
The wedding followed by the person or the Christian or the Dobbs.

672
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:56,160
You like some sort of mechanistic deterministic, you know, you know, Nazi monster.

673
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,260
You ask me, but I wasn't even saying that I made that up.

674
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,960
I did a legal subgenius wedding there.

675
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,260
Hey.

676
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:05,340
Hey.

677
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,380
Do you know who did my legal subgenius wedding, Dr. Howell?

678
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,640
Why don't you tell me now?

679
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,780
Lonesome cowboy.

680
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,720
Oh, for heaven's.

681
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,560
Honest to gosh.

682
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:19,560
I ordained him and he married Princess Leigh and me before anybody knew about it.

683
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,480
Except for the insurance company.

684
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,580
Her insurance company knew we were married.

685
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:29,000
And then we got married again later on at by a Unitarian.

686
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:29,800
Why?

687
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,220
With one whore?

688
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:31,760
In a theater.

689
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,060
Why does that remind me of?

690
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:34,760
The.

691
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,180
The.

692
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,540
Philodrum and nuptials.

693
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,740
I didn't know he had two of them.

694
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,600
In Golden Gate Park, the famous Philovian wedding took place.

695
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,020
And it sounds almost like what Ivan Stang just described.

696
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:55,780
Now, the other founder of the Church of the Subgenius, a strange duplication of function

697
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,640
and feature that you're only hearing about now on this program.

698
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,240
Phyla and Chaosmic Mama Cat had a.

699
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,040
A poo themed wedding.

700
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,240
Or was that just the.

701
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,100
The.

702
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,460
The.

703
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,960
The party after.

704
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:16,700
That must have been the after party because the wedding itself was more sedate and decorous.

705
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,920
Oh, OK.

706
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,580
Well, I know that the reception was poo.

707
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,060
Had the theme of poo.

708
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,460
Unusual for weddings.

709
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,660
Religious accolades.

710
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:30,180
It was affidavits of every type of variety during the dinner and cocktail hour.

711
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:35,000
But shortly after when they had the Hoopy Ding Dang and the band was playing and stuff.

712
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:35,380
Like that.

713
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,900
I guess they brought out the muses.

714
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,780
Muses?

715
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:40,700
Nothing.

716
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,760
Not the kind the.

717
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,640
The inclements were.

718
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:49,200
This is more designed for perpendicular climbing and stuff like that.

719
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,060
It's a sportsman's thing.

720
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:51,860
You wouldn't understand.

721
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,560
You're.

722
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,180
You're.

723
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:53,540
All right.

724
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,160
Well, he's a good sport.

725
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,460
I don't know what you mean.

726
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,260
Come on.

727
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,760
Let's hear it for Ivan Stang.

728
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,420
He's the bigger they are, the nicer they are.

729
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,580
What a good sport.

730
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,160
And he can.

731
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:11,160
He's tired of putting some stirrups in his mouth and driving around like a hog.

732
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:20,480
Just last night in his special room, I downed an enormous tumbler of glowing greenish absinthe.

733
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,960
That was a little bit too much absinthe in that time.

734
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,380
It was one hell of a lot.

735
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,900
And yet there wasn't as much in mine as there was in yours, I happened to notice.

736
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,120
Well, I had a wider glass.

737
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,780
Uh-huh.

738
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,560
That is drinking up our Christmas.

739
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:51,500
The guy that did his dissertation on Church of the Subgenius, Reverend Lee Seifer, gave us this iced, really for real absinthe, not American absinthe.

740
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,140
But French.

741
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,700
Sacre bleu.

742
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,080
French.

743
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,740
Oh, that's lovely.

744
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:54,940
Mon Dieu.

745
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,660
It made my pants damp.

746
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,280
C'est triste.

747
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,620
Oh.

748
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:58,980


749
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,560
Which in French is written A-T-I-N-A-T-I-N-A-T-I-N.

750
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,400
A-T-I-N-A-T-I-N.

751
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,520
Yes, it was the real...

752
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,320
I was just talking about A-T-I-N-A-T-I-N-A-T-I-N.

753
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,980
Make a leka high, make a high knee ho.

754
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,240
Oh, that was so sweet.

755
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,740
But it was delicious, mon frÃ¨re.

756
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,580
Congratulations.

757
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,500
I salute you on both cheeks.

758
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,660
Peu, peu, peu.

759
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,100
Allons, enfants de la patrie.

760
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,140
Le jour de gloire est arrivÃ©.

761
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:33,560
Yes, the jour de gloire not only arrived, but it went away without much consequence.

762
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,920
Le jour de gloire, because no saucer are descended.

763
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,400
But, you know, you can't...

764
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,980
It is Bastille Day, though, isn't it?

765
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,120
No, that's on the 9th, is Bastille Day.

766
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,260
I thought, you know, it's a wonderful time to put all your...

767
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:50,620
X Day, the 4th of July, Canada Day, or Commonwealth Day, whatever they call it.

768
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,360
The 21st and 22nd of...

769
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:03,080
Was it September, the original night of slack at the Victoria Theatre in San Francisco?

770
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,460
January.

771
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,380
January?

772
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,680
Yeah, January 21st.

773
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,720
January, 21st and 22nd.

774
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:17,580
So, you see, on those dates, the Queen Empress of France, Marie Antoinette, was beheaded.

775
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,160
The same dates that Bob was shot the first time?

776
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:22,900
Exactly.

777
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,340
A nightmarish night that was, friends.

778
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,260
Dr. Howell and I were both there.

779
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,040
I was.

780
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,100
We saw Bob with his own eyes walk out on stage.

781
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,300
A thousand people.

782
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,400
And the audience saw it.

783
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,400
Well, a few hundred.

784
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:43,160
And why did puzzling evidence of all people turn against Bob suddenly that night?

785
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:43,680
The betrayer.

786
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,580
Just because we'd been telling him to for weeks.

787
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,060
The one who betrays.

788
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,620
Well, it's all part of history now.

789
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,540
Bob lying on the stage, his broken pipe laced with his golden blood.

790
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,200
That didn't stop him, though.

791
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,480
He doesn't look good after being...

792
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,160
assassinated so many times.

793
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,920
Looks like a horrid walking corpse.

794
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,340
But you've got to give him credit for being around at all.

795
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,980
Luckily, that strong pipe smoke covers the smell.

796
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:16,500
Hmm.

797
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,540
Nothing like the smell of your clump and clogging.

798
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:26,340
It's the clump and clogging of the corp, or flop, as Stan was calling it previously.

799
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:31,820
The smell around your head, pre-smoked and pre-inhaled, for your smoking pleasure.

800
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,220
There was a lot of smoking.

801
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:33,540
What?

802
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,400
Smoking at X Day.

803
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,580
Heathen smoked some chickens.

804
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,120
Pigs were out there.

805
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:40,560
Heathen smoked chickens?

806
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,660
Now, let's not get personal and...

807
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,920
Pigs with human feet.

808
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,060
Yeah, okay.

809
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:44,900
All right.

810
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,440
Let me get all jaded outside.

811
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,000
I mean, everybody's perfect.

812
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,640
But no, Siri, David Apocalypse told me that he has been breeding pigs with human feet

813
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,940
so that he can make... sell bacon to Jewish people.

814
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,480
I didn't get that at first, but he was going to club and have...

815
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:03,540
Yeah.

816
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:03,940
He was going to club and have.

817
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,100
Oh, right.

818
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:05,560
Okay.

819
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:12,560
Well, the club and hoof is also a sign of El Diablo in the lands of the archetypical

820
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:12,880
strains.

821
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:19,840
The Straits of Guava, the Pulse of Truge of Guano, all those different parts of South

822
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,780
and Central America.

823
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,720
In San Iguana?

824
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:29,300
Yeah, the Ploja of Guana, or I think it's the Fields of Nazcar.

825
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,900
Now, that's not in South America.

826
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,520
And there's also a dissociative realm somewhere near Africa.

827
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:33,520


828
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:33,520


829
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:33,520


830
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,280
Antarctica, I guess, where a bunch of pre-natal surrogates are trying to outlive everybody,

831
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:44,600
but they haven't discovered the secret of the Church of the Subgenius because, well,

832
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,980
who the hell would want to do that anyway unless you really got wrapped for one year?

833
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:54,180
Well, we wouldn't want that to be floated out into the world so wide to be sniped and

834
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:54,780
japed at.

835
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:57,760
But why?

836
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,600
Oh, of course.

837
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,540
Like all publicity isn't good news or something like that.

838
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,500
Therefore, using reverse psychology, we have found that the Church of the Subgenius, which

839
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:03,500


840
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:03,500


841
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:03,500


842
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,940
And that's why we've put out numerous books and pamphlets, knowing that that would generate

843
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:12,280
a lack of interest and preserve our private moments for ourselves.

844
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,460
It keeps the ref out.

845
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,240
Mm-hmm.

846
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,620
Well, you know, you've got the...

847
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,780
Remember, these aren't occult kooks.

848
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,080
I know these people.

849
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:24,900
Yeah.

850
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,220
And on your assurance, we'll go with that.

851
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,740
Yeah, right.

852
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,480
Like you were indicted two times on what was the Court of the Absurd for 20 years.

853
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:33,480


854
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:33,480


855
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:33,480


856
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:48,020
And so, I had to go to the stocks and the pillory or one of those places and stuff like

857
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,540
that and hang your head and sing with a big P on your nose.

858
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,540
Hey, hey, watch your language.

859
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,700
Hey, hey, now, calm down, man.

860
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,200
A big P on your nose.

861
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,080
Yeah.

862
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,800
The letter P.

863
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,160
You know what that means.

864
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,520
I P on the people of North Korea.

865
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,240
Remember the Magayas?

866
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:03,600
The Magayas incident?

867
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,800
Oh, yeah, of course.

868
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,420
Lieutenant Commander Booker had to get on North Korean radio and apologize, so he said,

869
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,240
I P on the people of North Korea.

870
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:18,280
P-A-E-A-N, he pointed out to the translators.

871
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:22,280
So that's how his apology went out.

872
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,200
Wow.

873
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,480
Alert, alert.

874
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,140
I guess, you know, it's like Thomas Wolfe said, real life history is more important

875
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,740
than reality.

876
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:31,880
Or, it's more...

877
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,220
Reality is just...

878
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:33,920
It's just more strange than fiction.

879
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,160
It was the incident that marked the beginning of World War Four.

880
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,080
And we haven't even lubricated that transmigration yet.

881
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,280
That could be like a thousand strings away.

882
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,540
It could be right next to us.

883
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,180
All like hairy and undulating and going...

884
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,440
Get on in, get on in.

885
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,680
You're gonna like it in here.

886
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:58,400
Like a thousand tiny fingers telling you to let go and drop into a vertiginous, radiant

887
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,020
abyss.

888
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,360
Mm-hmm.

889
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,200
It's like mom and dad's dopey-dopey.

890
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,200


891
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,860
It's like the apple pie.

892
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,480
The kind they used to make to keep you quiet, like when you'd be beaten with those spoons

893
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:07,980
and everything.

894
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,100
The apple pie, you can have it.

895
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:17,440
We began an index day with a ceremonial cherry pie made from the ripest, plumpest, and reddest

896
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,900
cherries from the secret sacred orchard, seething with mosquitoes and blood-sucking insects.

897
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,620
He's not exaggerating.

898
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,300
Yeah, you should see my scalp.

899
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,340
It's a horrendous sight.

900
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:36,620
A horrid landscape of bumps and welts, which I had to keep covering all through instinct.

901
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,620
I am smooth.

902
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,240
I am a smooth man.

903
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:49,340
Devoid of bumps, because I was wise enough to buy a plane ticket for Dr. Howell, the

904
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:57,460
juicy, delicious Dr. Howell, beloved of all species of insects, especially mosquitoes,

905
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,320
who flock around him and avoid him.

906
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:01,800
They are not in the same boat as me.

907
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,680
They are not in the same boat as me.

908
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:02,680


909
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:09,380
And that's really the reason why Dr. Howell is the one person who actually gets kind of

910
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,260
almost paid to come to X Day.

911
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,840
Even the bands, even the famous bands have to pay.

912
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:21,300
But they don't keep the flies off of me like Dr. Howell does.

913
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,520
He's just the sweetest thing.

914
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,160
Well, there ain't no flies on Jesus.

915
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:28,880
Um...

916
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,300
He's almost dead.

917
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:31,300


918
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:31,500
He's almost dead.

919
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,760
I'm only telling it as it is.

920
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:37,100
This is simply a fact that must be acknowledged.

921
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,660
Some of us taste good and some of us don't.

922
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:46,280
You wouldn't think a horrible, roughy fellow like me would be so delicious.

923
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,700
Someone more toothsome in shape they would not be.

924
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,180
It's just the way it is.

925
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,760
They'll make the rules.

926
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,380
If you guys were on two different channels, that would have been comprehensible.

927
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,740
I'm sorry.

928
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,260
I'll withdraw my remark.

929
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,320
I just commented.

930
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:03,820
You don't need to.

931
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,340
It couldn't be heard anyway.

932
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,440
But it's all right.

933
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:07,780
I'm sorry.

934
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,140
It's all right.

935
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:08,940
I'm sorry, too.

936
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,820
We're all sorry here.

937
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,200
Sad and sorry.

938
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,420
But we'll do better, by golly.

939
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,100
It doesn't do you any good.

940
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,240
Even if you're sorry, you're not forgiven.

941
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,020
But Bob doesn't forgive you.

942
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,400
He slathers you.

943
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,000
He fills you with oatmeal and the kind of lust and nuts you need to get through another

944
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,440
day of transgressions.

945
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,300
He's got a lot of money.

946
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:31,300


947
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:31,300


948
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:31,300


949
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:31,300


950
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:31,300


951
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:31,300


952
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,320
ä½• ëª»quila

953
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,380
We need to let him go.

954
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,080
If he's giving it away, he doesn't get to buy it.

955
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,860
He doesn't have it.

956
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:41,860


957
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,640
Then you're still here.

958
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,360
If you let anything slip.

959
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:44,940
An example entered you about uncomfortable standings.

960
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:45,820
Listen, it was a establishMoney's businesscha.

961
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,000
There's an excuse.

962
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,700
Upwater is corporations.

963
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,800
It's something that represents a dear and precious product.

964
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,440
Lemon has been passed down through the generations with boringcharged deli's.

965
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,660
Are you an organisation member?

966
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:58,760
Oh, we're both endicons, not game- ë¨¹ì–´

967
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,000
Oh, there's so many?

968
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:01,280
It's all about constant.

969
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:01,280


970
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:01,280


971
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:01,280


972
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:01,280


973
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,600
partially out of rat muscles, at least in the transference part.

974
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,300
E-I-E-I-O, sir.

975
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:13,280
But the problem is the monoculture eliminates the possibility for many other creatures to live there,

976
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:16,800
other animal communities and plant communities which would be there

977
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,840
instead of a huge field of similar genetically engineered mulch.

978
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:28,880
But, Tom Red, wouldn't you agree that America's culture has become a monoculture,

979
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,620
especially its economic culture?

980
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:37,500
The worst of all would be the computer culture, which is a monoculture imposed over all.

981
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:43,400
So we're putting all our eggs into the same basket.

982
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,820
And that means if it falls, they shall all crack on the sidewalk

983
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:53,860
and their yulks shall run this way and that, and no one will be able to get Wi-Fi.

984
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:59,520
Moreover, anything that you got with a computer can be hacked, right?

985
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,600
Do you believe that?

986
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:01,480
Yes, absolutely.

987
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,260
Mr. Rosamond K.

988
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:02,740
Is that true?

989
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:06,440
Including America's nuclear missile arsenal.

990
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,620
How about that, Mr. Smarty Pants Communist?

991
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,260
That's really true?

992
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:15,820
Mr. College Professor, yes, it's true, Mr. Hippie.

993
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,240
Talk on this, hippie.

994
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,140
Oh, well.

995
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:20,720
That's done.

996
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:29,040
Anyway, so get rid of the computers and put a chain-smoking guy with a telephone in the silo

997
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,320
back the way it used to be.

998
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,120
And we'll all breathe a little easier.

999
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:33,740
He's not a Luddite.

1000
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:34,900
Except for the chain-smoker.

1001
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:35,380
He's a real pragmatist.

1002
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:38,220
Well, he's in there because he's nervous in the service.

1003
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,920
Ever read Level 7?

1004
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,080
No.

1005
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,380
Oh, yeah, that requires moon pants to begin with.

1006
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,680
You can't read that stuff without evacuating yourself.

1007
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,200
It scares the right out of you.

1008
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,760
It scares you very bad.

1009
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,020
Level 7 was written in the 50s.

1010
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,560
It's dedicated to Dwight and Nikita, and it's about the guy who pushes the button.

1011
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,180
You know that?

1012
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:06,520
He destroys the world and how he reports for duty and goes down into a bunker in a down escalator

1013
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,520
for which there is no up escalator.

1014
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,200
Oh, great.

1015
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,820
He goes down many levels.

1016
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:11,840
There's a Bolshoi ballet on this.

1017
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,280
They turned it into a Bolshoi ballet as well.

1018
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,540
The elevator scene and everything was transcribed by the...

1019
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,660
It's never been made into a movie.

1020
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,400
It hasn't?

1021
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:27,160
I thought there was one, like a science, like a dystopian thing, like it was kind of Solaris or something like...

1022
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,080
Well, there have been many movies about underground...

1023
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,460
Under dystopias.

1024
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:32,540
The...

1025
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,780
A boy and his dog.

1026
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:44,840
Yeah, a boy and his dog certainly comes to mind with Topeka, Kansas, underground, away from the ravages of the nuclear devastated surface.

1027
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:54,960
And then recently there was one with Bill Murray as the mayor of that underground town that was besieged by giant worms and moths and the power was failing.

1028
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,040
That was a weird movie.

1029
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:56,700
Yes.

1030
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,080
Not many people flocked to see that one.

1031
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,600
I thought it was quite interesting.

1032
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:01,580
Yeah, that's the problem.

1033
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,440
I can't remember the title either, but maybe Dave, can you remember the title?

1034
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,420
No, it wasn't dark anything.

1035
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,740
It was a church in Silicon Valley.

1036
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,560
I think there was some part of it that was heretical.

1037
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:16,860
It had that Irish actress in it, Sayaris, or however you say her name, Roman.

1038
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:23,680
Anyway, our listeners will be reassured to know that there was a subgenius in the missile silos.

1039
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,640
I don't know if he's still there, but Pope Cripps.

1040
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,240
Pope Dennis Cripps.

1041
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:38,080
Who drew the filthiest, filthiest giant peni onto TV guide pictures.

1042
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,360
As well as on America's nuclear missiles.

1043
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:41,900
Yeah, right.

1044
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:52,840
When he wasn't watching, keeping his finger hovering over the button, the button, he was drawing dirty pictures and sending them to the church of subgenius.

1045
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,920
That's really what all of subgenius was about.

1046
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,020
Just putting that guy in the proper place at the proper time.

1047
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,380
Everything else is, well, window dressing.

1048
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:00,860
And gravy.

1049
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:01,860
Yeah, but it worked.

1050
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:02,440
He's out of jail.

1051
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,440
Oh, I'm still here.

1052
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:04,680
Right.

1053
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,840
Everyone thinks we're trying to destroy the world.

1054
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,960
Actually, we're the only thing standing between this world and its complete destruction.

1055
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,660
We, the subgeniuses.

1056
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,460
You owe us, man.

1057
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,040
Everybody out there, you owe us big time.

1058
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,840
And it's time we collected.

1059
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,380
So line up and present.

1060
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,480
Or.

1061
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:35,580
Or we'll take Pope Crips out of the subgenius missile silo.

1062
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,720
Well, actually, it was a federal government missile silo.

1063
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,380
What are the Orwellian overtones of X-Day?

1064
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:50,380
What have you, when you glean an artificial mission or perhaps some sort of information, what were the Orwellian overtones of X-Day?

1065
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:54,580
It's probably found in Orwell's essay on shooting an elephant.

1066
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,100
I'm not really familiar with shooting an elephant.

1067
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,180
That's your elephant.

1068
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,580
You have to wear pajamas.

1069
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,440
If you shot your elephant.

1070
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,660
Yeah, what he was doing in my pajamas, I'll never know.

1071
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:14,280
But actually, it's not even safe to make jokes based on Groucho Marx because you can get banned from Facebook for doing it.

1072
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:14,800
What?

1073
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:18,420
Well, that is Goldsteinism at its finest right there.

1074
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:29,180
Grouchy Marx was indeed a Marxist by family lineage and therefore a Goldsteinite in the 1984 classic by George Classic.

1075
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:30,660
1984?

1076
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,860
Emmanuel Goldstein.

1077
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,760
The equivalent of Bernie Sanders, Noam Chomsky, all sorts of other characters.

1078
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,960
Other made-up characters.

1079
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,000
Yes, exactly.

1080
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,080
For a hate hour.

1081
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,040
For the six minutes hate.

1082
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,040
Where you just hate him.

1083
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:50,240
Hate him.

1084
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,040
Hate him.

1085
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:55,460
Right, like when they put Janer on the Puzzling Evidence show.

1086
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,540
Yeah, I understand that.

1087
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:58,980
Who?

1088
00:50:59,040 --> 00:50:59,960
As soon as you...

1089
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,740
You left...

1090
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:04,440
You and Philo both left the Puzzling Evidence show.

1091
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,060
It just went all to hell at the hands of Puzzling Evidence.

1092
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,820
Well, as it turns out, that's no surprise.

1093
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,700
Just kidding, folks.

1094
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,380
Just kidding.

1095
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,760
Not at all.

1096
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:20,200
I don't know if that show exists anymore, but we shall see.

1097
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,800
In the fullness of time.

1098
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:26,600
In the meantime, we must move along with our agenda here.

1099
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,940
Well, we're drawing Philo ever closer to Groucho.

1100
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,300
He's in Cleveland and the lovely stations here at WCSB.

1101
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:37,040
So he is fixing to move to Kentucky.

1102
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,660
In fact, the reason he was able to come to Ex Day in southern Ohio

1103
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:46,960
was because he's on a house hunting trip, or a barn hunting trip, more accurately.

1104
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,560
He needs property with a barn in Kentucky.

1105
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,560
In Keentuck.

1106
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,860
So that he can get up to Cleveland in about five hours.

1107
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,000
But no sooner.

1108
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,360
That's the important thing.

1109
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:05,840
I think it might take a little closer to seven, because Cincinnati is six in the west as well.

1110
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:09,320
Well, after they get the monorail built, it'll be faster yet.

1111
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,420
Yeah, you haven't seen the way Philo does it.

1112
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,700
You've just seen how old Grandpa Stang drives.

1113
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,040
Grandpa Stang is careful.

1114
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,420
And it's a good thing, too, because the man was on the highway.

1115
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:19,940
The police were everywhere.

1116
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:28,000
On July 4th weekend, we saw, we must have seen at least seven or eight people pulled over.

1117
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,540
Fire engines.

1118
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,680
Fire engines, ambulances, cops everywhere.

1119
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:35,300
Yeah, and that was before we got to the toxic spill in Cleveland Heights.

1120
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,260
Cops in the woodpile.

1121
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:36,720
They blocked our way.

1122
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:41,120
Well, they were all on terrorist alert, and so they had to make their presence known.

1123
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,180
Well, what was the deal?

1124
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,220
There was also another click it or ticket month, week, or something like that.

1125
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,400
Click it or ticket, eh?

1126
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,880
That was what occurred with a major holiday, which involves drinking.

1127
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:56,220
You've got to remember, our independence as a nation was based on a bunch of yahoos in an alehouse

1128
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,820
who were stinking drunk.

1129
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,520
That's where all this went.

1130
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,460
And goodly stretched on the hemp.

1131
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,280
Yes, what a fetid fervor of freedom.

1132
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,480
A fervor of freedom.

1133
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:15,540
A passion of a desire to be free, whatever the hell that means.

1134
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,520
Yeah, whatever that means.

1135
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:23,540
Freedom from the tyranny of taxation and quartering redcoats in your hall closet.

1136
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:29,140
Freedom from free association where things follow and don't follow.

1137
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,200
Come back again once more.

1138
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:36,600
Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy and wealthy and wise.

1139
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:40,000
Gentlemen cry peace, peace.

1140
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,480
But there is no peace.

1141
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:49,400
Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the chains of slavery?

1142
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,680
Forbid it, almighty God.

1143
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,600
I know not what course others may take.

1144
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,260
But as for me...

1145
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:04,480
Give me liberty or give me death.

1146
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:09,540
Wow, Dr. Howell's jowls swole up when he did that.

1147
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,240
That was cool.

1148
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,060
Yeah.

1149
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,720
He looked at those things waggling back and forth.

1150
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:17,760
That's the way you do it.

1151
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,320
Yeah, exactly.

1152
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,700
You can get a headache doing that.

1153
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:20,860
Too late.

1154
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:25,720
You could also get disemboweled by the corporate state secret government.

1155
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,340
You make too many jokes about tax not under the influence of fire.

1156
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:30,100
You're cracking a joke.

1157
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,580
Emboweled will I see thee anon.

1158
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,100
Emboweled will I see thee anon.

1159
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,640
And anon shall I see thee emboweled.

1160
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:45,500
At the subgenius wedding, instead of exchanging vows or even vowels, they exchanged vowels.

1161
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,280
And man, was that messy.

1162
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,820
It was. It was awful.

1163
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,940
But they...

1164
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,340
That's what the young couple wanted to do.

1165
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:59,180
There are some registered nurses with bedpans in the crowd and things were taken care of.

1166
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:02,460
But I wouldn't have wanted to sit in the front row in the splatter zone.

1167
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:11,720
This was not a short-duration wedding, but an eternal wedding to be totally locked in the bonds of matrimony.

1168
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:19,400
There were plenty of canes and walkers thrown away to the wind as people rushed off stage screaming,

1169
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,180
I can walk, I can walk again.

1170
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,620
Well, it was more like, I can crawl again.

1171
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:25,880
I can crawl again.

1172
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,620
So you did that again this year?

1173
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,140
You dragged...

1174
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:32,540
You dragged up all those people that were like in stretchers and stuff?

1175
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,060
No, we took people who...

1176
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,500
And that's to drag them up on stage?

1177
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,100
People who had learned...

1178
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:41,840
Who were walking fine, but had wanted to regain the ability to crawl.

1179
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:45,220
And we can do that with the laying on of sledgehammers.

1180
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,660
Acubating and other doctoral techniques.

1181
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,420
The lame to see, the blind to walk.

1182
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,000
The forbidden sciences.

1183
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,580
You know, the boots.

1184
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,820
Like the little lamby pies led to slaughter and stuff.

1185
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,940
Also makes good Mexican mariachi music too, I suppose.

1186
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,600
I prefer to call it slafter.

1187
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,060
The slafter house.

1188
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,240
Exactly.

1189
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,200
Lead him to the slafter house.

1190
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:15,940
Whether a bobby, a sublet, or even a bobster.

1191
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:21,780
I may be just an old bobster, but let me tell you, Bobby, something.

1192
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,740
You better believe that.

1193
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,440
That man Bob, when he says, it's going to be a bummer.

1194
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,320
I thought you knew J.R. Bob Dobb.

1195
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,460
I know J.R. Bob Dobb for what he was.

1196
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:36,720
And I know the sub-demuses for what they was.

1197
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:41,440
Here, it's time to take your pill, Reverend Stang.

1198
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,540
Uh, hold on a minute.

1199
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,040
For difficult reasons.

1200
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,880
Now this won't hurt a bit.

1201
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,860
Just one little pinch.

1202
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,760
He just stuck one up there three minutes ago.

1203
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,220
What's going on here?

1204
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,400
It's elder abuse.

1205
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:55,000
What are we...

1206
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:59,140
Say, did you know that this show is almost over?

1207
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,840
The box elder needle here.

1208
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:06,960
This hour of slack number 1,500 and something, something, something.

1209
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,840
Because I don't know what order they're going to be.

1210
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:10,260
Sackack never.

1211
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:16,340
I guess this could be number 1,525.

1212
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,100
Of course.

1213
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,580
As you say, so can it be.

1214
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,440
And you can hear all the...

1215
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,080
The previous ones for free.

1216
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,280
Temporarily.

1217
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,600
On subgenius.com.

1218
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:35,300
Where you can learn all about X-Day and Subgenius and Doctors for Bob.

1219
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,820
And Dr. Hal's show.

1220
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:38,980
The Ask Dr. Hal show.

1221
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:39,680
Yes.

1222
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,740
On Radio Valencia.

1223
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:44,300
And also the Puzzling Evidence show.

1224
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:49,660
And also the Suzy the Flusies Bob Slackdime Fun House.

1225
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,600
On WREK Atlanta.

1226
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:53,120
So you see.

1227
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:53,480
We...

1228
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:54,420
At one point we had...

1229
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:59,100
We had three separate radio show hosts all at one table.

1230
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:06,660
Suzy, Dr. Hal and myself representing the three cities of Bob.

1231
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,000
San Francisco, Cleveland and Atlanta.

1232
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,960
Atlanta, home of Waffle House.

1233
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:17,300
Bob's favorite restaurant.

1234
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,720
Yes, it was a moment destined to happen.

1235
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,960
But now that it's happened, it's kind of...

1236
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,280
Over and done with.

1237
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,900
Yes, yes, yes.

1238
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:27,980
Only for...

1239
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,100
Only for this hour.

1240
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,540
No, it wasn't sour.

1241
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:32,400
It was tasty and it was delicious.

1242
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:33,820
It was a wonderful afternoon.

1243
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,560
You guys should just come out and admit...

1244
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,540
You say so.

1245
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:42,100
You didn't spend five hours driving through rural Ohio.

1246
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:48,480
Well, I had a hard time driving through an hour and a half of rural Ohio.

1247
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,360
Rural Ohio.

1248
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,580
Five hours would probably tax me too much.

1249
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,060
And so, as a...

1250
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:57,420
As a consequence, my car and I stayed home and looked at each other.

1251
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,780
We wish you could have been there, Dave.

1252
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:05,540
And you'll be there with us when you hear those shows that you can't be on

1253
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:11,100
as they intermittently come out as I gradually edit my way through.

1254
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:15,100
I'm removing all the terrible language that I myself used

1255
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,400
in front of a live audience.

1256
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,000
That beautiful wisteria.

1257
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:19,420
Blah, blah, blah.

1258
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,100
Which will...

1259
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,980
Yeah, wisteria was beautiful.

1260
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,840
It wasn't too hot and everything was fine.

1261
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:37,100
So, don't listen to those who say wisteria is a hellish, tropical, insect-tormented purgatory.

1262
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:44,420
Although the local newspaper was commemorating the derecho that came through

1263
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:47,940
and ruined X-Day three years ago.

1264
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,220
No, actually, only X-Day was spared.

1265
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:52,940
Everywhere else was ruined.

1266
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:53,940
Oh, it was still hell.

1267
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,440
It was really, really hot.

1268
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,720
It was 104 degrees.

1269
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:57,640
I'll admit that.

1270
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:03,260
But evil enemies of the church spread the untrue rumor

1271
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:06,040
that it was always like that.

1272
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,300
Even in the dead of winter, wisteria was 104 degrees.

1273
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,480
Well, even...

1274
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,280
Forever and ever and ever.

1275
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,240
With flames that do not consume but only hurt.

1276
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:22,760
There is a nice cold pond there to get out of that fiery deluge of eternal flame.

1277
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,700
Hey, I have to do a thing.

1278
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:27,580
It's called the station ID.

1279
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:28,900
Hey, watch this.

1280
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:29,980
Look what he's going to do.

1281
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:32,740
This is WCSB Cleveland.

1282
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:34,580
That's it.

1283
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,780
That's all you have to do.

1284
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,660
You're listening to WCSB Cleveland.

1285
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:44,380
And I'm going to fade out soon here.

1286
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,280
Round he throws his baleful eyes.

1287
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:53,580
In fact, Dave, why don't you call back in a little while after Dr. Sinister gets sunk in.

1288
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:56,980
I will call in one half an hour.

1289
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,380
Okay, man, I'm fading you out.

1290
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:01,940
You're fading out.

1291
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:05,700
Witness huge affliction and dismay.

1292
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,320
Dave is gone and he's been dropped.

1293
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,740
At once, as far as angels can.

1294
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,300
And now I'm dropping out. Bye.

1295
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:16,840
Bye.

1296
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:18,460
Bye.

1297
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:20,700
Bye.

1298
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:22,680
Bye.

1299
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:23,500
Bye.

1300
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,020
Bye.

1301
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:24,040
Bye.

1302
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:24,040


1303
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:24,040


1304
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:24,040


1305
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:24,040


1306
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:24,040


1307
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:24,040


1308
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:24,040


1309
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,320
Bye.

1310
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:27,740
Bye.

1311
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,320
Bye.

1312
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:32,980
Bye.

1313
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:33,640
Bye.

1314
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:34,560
Bye.

1315
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:35,960
Bye.

1316
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:38,780
Bye.

1317
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,220
Bye.

1318
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,620
Bye.

1319
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,640
Bye.

1320
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,080
Bye.

1321
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:42,920
Bye.

1322
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:42,960


1323
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:43,820
Bye.

1324
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:46,260
Bye.

1325
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:46,280


1326
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:47,380
Bye.
