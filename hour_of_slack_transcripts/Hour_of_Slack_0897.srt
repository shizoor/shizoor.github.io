1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,620
At last I have control of your radio tubes!

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,100
Uh, and I do too!

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,560
Good! This is Ren Hoak!

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,560
And this is Stimson J. Cat of the Ren and Stimpy Show!

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,060
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack!

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,820
Keep listening, you idiots!

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,140
Else I shall kill you!

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,280
Shane, look out!

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,800
The Self-Genius Hour of Slack!

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,940
If anything is excellent or praiseworthy,

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,140
we should find something else to do instead.

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,120
Now you're starting to get odd.

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,560
That's right. Watch it.

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,260
Oh!

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,540
The problem is, it's special.

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,720
Hard of thinking of us.

18
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,320
I cannot.

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,860
You really tolerate it well.

20
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,440
And what happens is an old pan,

21
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,800
a pair of neon and old pizelle,

22
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,140
it thins skinless serrates,

23
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,100
and the back of it now comes critched.

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,920
In fact, in there, in a gay spunner,

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,000
to live in a sea of pus.

26
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,060
The openings of this show, down there,

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,720
were by, all of them,

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,500
Fernanda Nande, Lee Murr.

29
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,000
More, of course, from him.

30
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,200
My friend, the Pope of all Europe!

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,600
Pope Dave Lee Black!

32
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,600
An exile from his own country in America!

33
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,140
Well, I'll tell you more about the conspiracy.

34
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,140
It is Pope Dave Lee Black!

35
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,220
Praise Bob!

36
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,100
Hi-ya!

37
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,560
Hallelujah!

38
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,160
Now, before I get started,

39
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,560
I've noticed that most of you are standing in the back.

40
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,520
I think you need to come up here a little bit.

41
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,780
Come on, come on to the front.

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,120
Come on to the front!

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,980
Come on, don't stand in the back.

44
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,320
Step up, step up!

45
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,120
Step on up!

46
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,260
Don't be afraid.

47
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,580
Don't be afraid of this man,

48
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,460
this smiley man with a pipe in his mouth.

49
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,100
Come on, don't smile!

50
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,060
Okay.

51
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,720
Now, I want everybody...

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,080
He's not real! He's not real!

53
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,700
I want everybody to bow your hands.

54
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,980
Bow your hands in a moment of...

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,140
A moment of truly sacred...

56
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,500
Noise!

57
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:27,840
No!

58
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,260
Praise Bob!

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,920
Praise Bob!

60
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,860
Praise Bob!

61
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,620
Praise Bob!

62
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:32,980
Praise Bob!

63
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,680
No one wants to...

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,620
Woo!

65
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:34,680
Woo!

66
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,780
Now, I know most of you have been wondering,

67
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,800
what is this church of the subgenius?

68
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,380
What are you?

69
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,060
We're a...

70
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,540
Well, just to make it a little bit simple,

71
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,120
we are a sex, drugs, and rock and roll,

72
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,040
end of the world, UFO religion,

73
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,180
and the world's only true religion.

74
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,160
Praise Bob!

75
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,160
Praise Bob!

76
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,220
Praise Bob!

77
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,100
Praise Bob!

78
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,680
Praise Bob!

79
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,040
Praise Bob!

80
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,600
Praise Bob!

81
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:57,700


82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,560
Praise Bob!

83
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,040
Praise Bob!

84
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,020
Pray, on the cross.

85
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,640
Follow.

86
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,260
on the cross.

87
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


88
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


89
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


90
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


91
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


92
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


93
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


94
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


95
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:29,260


96
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,700
Point to Bob now! Point to Bob now!

97
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,260
Point to Bob and the holy photo opportunity!

98
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,440
I'm going to prove to you this is the only world's true only religion.

99
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,320
There were maniacs who flew planes into buildings in New York on the 11th of September.

100
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,840
And they flew these planes into these buildings with a promise they would go to heaven

101
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,280
and they would receive each 42 virgins.

102
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,880
Not in the Church of the Sub-Genghis, my friends!

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,840
No! You don't have to fly a plane into a building to get virgins!

104
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,840
Hell, who wants virgins?

105
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,260
The Church of the Sub-Genghis for $30?

106
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,000
You don't have to fly a plane and you get professionals!

107
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,080
Not virgins, but professionals!

108
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,860
Now, this is true.

109
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,820
There are other virgins.

110
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,800
There are other popes in Europe.

111
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:32,200
But I am the only pope in Europe that passes out condoms.

112
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,060
It's true.

113
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,100
That other pope won't even wear a condom!

114
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,380
As a matter of fact, I'll give you one.

115
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,080
I'm not the only pope in the world that passes out condoms.

116
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,060
I'm the only pope in the world that passes out used condoms.

117
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,880
I'm the only pope in the world that eats used condoms!

118
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,140
A-ha!

119
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,300
Illuminatus...

120
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,260
Electrus...

121
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:15,480
The plan was fixed. All we needed was guitar.

122
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,320
Then around the bend, an old friend fell down from the sky.

123
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,740
We helped him on our voyage to the happiest vie.

124
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,740
Then we racked our brains too far.

125
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,340
The thing that we would advertise

126
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,980
Illuminatus, Illectus, Immaculatus

127
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,720
Illuminata, Electra, Immaculata

128
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,840
Immaculata, Electrus, Illuminata

129
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,040
Illuminatus, Electrus, Immaculatus

130
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,840
Illumin, Illumina, Illuminatus

00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,020

Illuminata, Illumina, Illumina

134
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,680
That's our story, simple as can be

135
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,620
Though the planet's torched with dangers

136
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,200
And never guarantees

137
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,060
We might be eaten by dragons on the way

138
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,900
But we might be eaten by dragons on the way

139
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,360
But we might prove indigestible, perhaps you'll agree

140
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,040
Illuminatus, Illectus, Immaculatus

141
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,760
Illuminata, Electra, Immaculata

142
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,400

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,180


152
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,180

Illuminata, The Elephant

162
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,120


163
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,600
bang woo

164
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,440
bill smoking

165
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:24,940
yay

166
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,680
you live in

167
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Raleigh North Carolina

168
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,220
what's your

169
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,440
what suddenly

170
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,060
the economy

171
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,760
gets a boost

172
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,180
fuck

173
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,460
now I've been

174
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:34,940
getting that look

175
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,460
a lot lately

176
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,040
because I started

177
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,620
smoking again

178
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,620
and performing

179
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,320
abortions

180
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,020
so you know

181
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,420
I mean

182
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,720
everywhere I turn

183
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,200
these

184
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,640
sometimes I can

185
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,480
hardly get out of bed

186
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,080
but I just love

187
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,780
smoking folks

188
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,240
I'm sorry

189
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,040
I went nine months

190
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,640
without them

191
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,780
and man

192
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,440
what can I tell you

193
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,120
the hook is fucking

194
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,720
deep man

195
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,140
I'm telling you

196
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,660
they just dropped

197
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,040
the bait

198
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,600
back in the water

199
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:00,880
boom

200
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,400
plop

201
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,480
they weighed me

202
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:08,900
you know

203
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,580
hung me up

204
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
caught a big one

205
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,340
but I have this

206
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:17,880
theory

207
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,180
actually it's a hope

208
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,380
that if that scenario

209
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,140
is at all true

210
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,800
when you die

211
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,540
and you go to heaven

212
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,440
and St. Peter

213
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,180
meets you at the gate

214
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,160
if that's at all true

215
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
I believe the first thing

216
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,140
he's going to ask you is

217
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,400
you got a light

218
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,660
you mean y'all smoke here

219
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,700
yeah that's why it's heaven

220
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,320
these aren't clouds

221
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,900
this is cigarette smoke buddy

222
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,120
hell is non-smoking

223
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,260
you want to look down

224
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,080
at them for a minute

225
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:47,920
alright

226
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,160
I can't believe it's not smoke

227
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,160


228
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,160


229
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,160


230
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,300
I don't know what they do

231
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,820
to their bodies

232
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,940
it smells like an ashtray

233
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,220
I'm trying to eat my food

234
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,180
why would they want to do that

235
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:53,460
to themselves

236
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,180
do you know how stupid that is

237
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,140
god how hellish

238
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,080
no shit

239
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,720
light up

240
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,440
come on in

241
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,260
Hendrix is on harp tonight

242
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,360
let me stand next to your fire

243
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,020
yeah

244
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,420
and no one beats Hendrix man

245
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,760
fuck Eddie Van Halen

246
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
fuck Steve Vai

247
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,820
no one beats fuck

248
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,000
Hendrix was an alien

249
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,560
okay

250
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,800
the ship landed

251
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,100
they said Jimmy

252
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,220
show them how it's done

253
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,760
we'll pick you up in 28 years

254
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,920
and you know what Jimmy said

255
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,880
alright

256
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,100
he plays his cock

257
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,080
did y'all know that

258
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,960
they just strung his cock

259
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,200
he played it with his teeth

260
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,160
does that make him gay

261
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,360
I love people who are dead

262
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,140
for some reason

263
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,360
all my heroes are dead

264
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,940
Keith Richards

265
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,140
you know that's right

266
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,480
for instance

267
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,220
ah

268
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,740
what do you say we do some comedy

269
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,160
I always like to put some comedy

270
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,660
in my shows

271
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,900
here's an impression of

272
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,000
Keith Richards

273
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,740
some people are

274
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,860
start talking to him

275
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:10,400
it's so real

276
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,100
Keith

277
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,900
boy Keith went over the edge

278
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,880
years ago

279
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,820
went over the fucking edge

280
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,140
right now

281
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,680
right now everyone thought

282
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,200
that's it

283
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,820
Keith's gone

284
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,580
and then they looked over the edge

285
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,880
and there was a fucking ledge

286
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,840
and he had hit and landed on it

287
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,420
there's a ledge beyond the edge

288
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,580
Keith was like

289
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,880
I hit a fucking ledge

290
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,220
I'm alright

291
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,560
throw down me guitar

292
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,480
got a song

293
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,440
there's a ledge beyond the edge

294
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,460
Keith landed on it

295
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:48,660
Keith landed on it

296
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,140
Keith landed on it

297
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,220
so shake it

298
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,220


299
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:59,140
I literally

300
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,240
worried about this

301
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,240


302
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,240


303
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,240


304
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,420
People commit to just

305
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,640
wonderful's

306
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,540
or even better

307
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,400
ill call it

308
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:08,400


309
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:08,400


310
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:08,400


311
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,620
it's so true

312
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,380
this guy continues to become

313
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,980
a mind who wasn't

314
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,140
always motions

315
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,980
honorary subgenius minister one month before learning that he had just died.

316
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,280
Go!

317
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,280
Go!

318
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,520
Go!

319
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:52,660
Go!

320
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,700
Go!

321
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:54,460


322
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,120
Go!

323
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,240


324
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:55,440


325
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:55,520
Go!

326
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:55,720
Go!

327
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:55,800
Go!

328
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,240
Go!

329
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,260
Go!

330
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,780
Go!

331
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:56,880
Go!

332
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,320
Go!

333
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,860
Lemur!

334
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,640
Good!

335
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:10,060
Am I the only one here who feels that tremor in the force?

336
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,760
Or did somebody just cut a fart?

337
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,480
Did someone just bite a tooth?

338
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,640
Did I just hear the moan of the trouser ghost?

339
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,120
Or did the pipe just take a puff of Bob?

340
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,760
You see, friends, our guru Bob Dogs does not smoke the pipe.

341
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,280
The pipe smokes Bob!

342
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,440
And if that pipe ever stops smoking, that's when we're in real trouble.

343
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,580
Because, you know, here's what it really is all about.

344
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,960
This is the truth.

345
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,600
If you're new to this subgenius thing,

346
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,060
and don't know and really came here for an explanation,

347
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,900
sorry.

348
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,780
But I can tell you it's like this.

349
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,620
This is the true subgenius in slap.

350
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,000
Look at that Bob.

351
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,680
He's so stupid looking.

352
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,360
I could sit here looking at how stupid looking he is

353
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,480
for the rest of my life.

354
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,720
Look how stupid looking he is, sitting there looking at me.

355
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,120
That's what the church of the subgenius is all about.

356
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,420
Well, some days.

357
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,360
Some days, friends, it's...

358
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,800
But see, it's not about the intelligence.

359
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,880
It's about sense, common sense, sense of humor.

360
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,560
The subgenius, as Dr. Onan Kanabite said,

361
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,900
is pre-targeted.

362
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,560
Pre-targeted.

363
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:54,240
You know, we'd rather be stupid than their idea of smart.

364
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,040
We'd rather be stupid than their smart.

365
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,200
That's what J.R. Bob Dobbs said to Onan.

366
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,040
Friends, we get to see the world through rose-colored glasses

367
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,120
and Bob holds them up for us.

368
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,960
We pay for a subscription to what we really think.

369
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,480
And, you know, you might say,

370
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,780
well, that's why they call it subgenius.

371
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,420
But really, friends,

372
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,120
are the normals.

373
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,440
Are the normals that much smarter than us?

374
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,440
Have you watched TV lately?

375
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,280
Do we have to?

376
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:29,820
You know, the less you watch it,

377
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,580
the more retarded it seems when you do watch it.

378
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,680
I don't have cable, deliberately.

379
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,460
But when I go to a hotel,

380
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,540
I turn the cable TV on,

381
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
and then I'm locked in,

382
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,180
and I sit there switching channels for five hours,

383
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,740
going, thank God I don't have this cable stuff.

384
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,660
Because I can't stop.

385
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,400
But, you know, it's gotten to the point

386
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,380
where they're so sophisticated,

387
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,660
the television producers and makers,

388
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,740
that, you know, they've taken it, like, conceptually.

389
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,740
They go ahead, they gloat brazenly

390
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,940
at what cows we are to watch their dumb crap.

391
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,460
This reality TV stuff.

392
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,820
Actually, I'm surprised it took him so long to start doing this,

393
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,720
because it's actually not a TV show.

394
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,540
It's not a bad idea.

395
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,620
The average dumb-ass normal human being

396
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,000
is more entertaining

397
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,120
than a lot of what they were scripting and putting on.

398
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,920
And if, you know, they are following people around

399
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,740
with cameras as they act stupid

400
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,480
or they endanger themselves,

401
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,200
that's fine, you know, that's no problem.

402
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,640
But it's almost as if,

403
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,540
it's like you watch Jerry Springer

404
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,820
or so many of these shows,

405
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,880
and you're going, God, this is so stupid.

406
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,320
People must be really dumb to watch this.

407
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,500
You don't change the channel, though.

408
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,580
And it's as if,

409
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,320
and they're just so upfront about it.

410
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,340
The television itself tells you how bad it is.

411
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,040
They make fun of how bad they are

412
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,680
and how dumb you are to watch them.

413
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,640
It's as if they're saying,

414
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,520
break free of the Matrix after this message.

415
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,080
I wasn't going to bring this up.

416
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,500
I saw it.

417
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,260
Sometimes they're inadvertently dumb.

418
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,300
I saw an ad for Yoplait yogurt

419
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,000
that they were saying,

420
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,320
I guess it's like every time you buy the yogurt,

421
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,280
they give a little bit of money to breast cancer.

422
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,680
And the announcer actually said,

423
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,360
together we can lick breast cancer.

424
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,180
And, you know, the Anna Nicole Smith show

425
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,600
and my cousin, by the way.

426
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,500
You know, you watch that stuff,

427
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,840
and you go, maybe everybody's doing that.

428
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,100
Maybe everybody's looking at the TV saying,

429
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,420
man, I can't believe how stupid this is.

430
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,220
People watch this stuff?

431
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:48,800
Cool.

432
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,040
Yoplait must be stupid.

433
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,580
I could sit here forever looking at how stupid

434
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,740
people must be to be watching this stuff.

435
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,660
And I'm guilty of it, too.

436
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,440
But the ultimate reality TV show, friends,

437
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,920
started this Wednesday.

438
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,040
It's a great follow-up to that miniseries from 91.

439
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,420
You know, they've got some new special effects.

440
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,080
They've improved all the graphics and things.

441
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,080
Reality TV.

442
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,940
They've certainly taken it all the way, I guess.

443
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,800
Viewed paleoanthropologically,

444
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:26,000
television paints quite a visible picture of its very self.

445
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:32,840
Incredible levels of talent dedicated to the giant alibi for pinkness

446
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,580
and the dope rating of the language itself, friends.

447
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,180
Changing words to mean less and less instead of more.

448
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,020
And oddly enough, using more words to do it.

449
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,360
And the news, my God, man.

450
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,700
I swore off the news totally for three years.

451
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,080
But of course, on September 11th,

452
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,020
I had to start tuning in again.

453
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,200
The news is either evil or it is a sin.

454
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,640
We don't know which yet.

455
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:08,360
But we know that, well, maybe even if the revolution was televised,

456
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,020
television will not be revolutionized.

457
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,000
And it is.

458
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,880
And it is addictive.

459
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,220
And even I, you know, I try to fight back.

460
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,680
But, you know, we're all slackers.

461
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,880
As the great slacker princess, we said once,

462
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,200
I have feist in me.

463
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,960
I have feist.

464
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,820
But it just can't be sourced properly.

465
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:37,480
In order to fight, friends, the subgenius must have slack.

466
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,200
True slack, though.

467
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,320
And everybody knows that.

468
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,980
You know, I don't have to explain that.

469
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,720
And I'm with everybody who's anybody.

470
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,700
But not if it's for everybody, because I'm cool.

471
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,080
You know, I'm not, I'm only into it if it's only for everybody who's anybody.

472
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,180
I'm too independent to follow the big crowd.

473
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,180
I follow the small crowd.

474
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,460
Good.

475
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,180
Real independent thinker.

476
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,840
And everybody knows that everybody who's anybody already knew that,

477
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,980
except for the nobodies.

478
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Nobody who's anybody doesn't know that.

479
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,420
I'm nobody's fool.

480
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,400
Not nobody who's anybody, anyway.

481
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:33,060
I'm not the brightest crayon in the box.

482
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,160
Everyone says I'm dumber than a bag of rocks.

483
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,980
I'm not the brightest crayon in the box.

484
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:42,980


485
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:42,980


486
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:49,260
I barely even know how to put on my own pants.

487
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,800
But I'm a genius in France.

488
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,740
Genius in France.

489
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,020
Genius in France.

490
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,060
I may not be the sharpest hunk of cheese.

491
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,060
I got a negative number on my SATs.

492
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm not good looking.

493
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,680
And I don't know how to dance.

494
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,380
But nevertheless, in spite of the evidence, I am so widely considered to be a

495
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,380
genius in France.

496
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,800
Genius in France.

497
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,340
Genius in France.

498
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:41,980
People say I'm a geek, a moronic little freak, an annoying pipsqueak with an unfortunate physique.

499
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,200
Genius in France.

500
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,720
If I was any dumber, they'd have to water me twice a week.

501
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,420
But when the mademoiselles see me, they all swoon and shriek.

502
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,020
They dig my mystique.

503
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,540
They think I'm c'est magnifique.

504
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,800
When I'm in Paris, I'm the chicest of the chic.

505
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,160
They love my body odor and my bad toupee.

506
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,660
They love my stripy shirt and my stupid beret.

507
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:19,360
And when I'm sipping on a Perrier in some café down in Saint-Tropez,

508
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,920
it's hard to keep the fans at bay.

509
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,280
They say, sign my Poodle, Sibu play.

510
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,820
Sign my Poodle, Sibu play.

511
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,100
Poodle, Poodle.

512
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,160
Folks in my hometown think I'm a fool.

513
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,520
Got too much chlorine in my gene pool.

514
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,700
A few peas short of a casserole.

515
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,620
A few buttons missing on my remote control.

516
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,980
A few fries short of a heavy meal.

517
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,700
I couldn't pour water out of a booth.

518
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,080
With instructions on the heel.

519
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,520
Instructions on the heel.

520
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,780
Instructions on the heel.

521
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,600
But when I'm in Reuvence, I get free croissants.

522
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,720
Yeah, I'm the guy every French lady wants.

523
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,940
And if you ask them why, you're bound to get this response.

524
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,040
He's a genius in France, genius in France.

525
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,500
He's a genius in France, genius in France.

526
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,980
He's a genius in France, genius in France.

527
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,680
Genius in France.

528
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,860
I'm not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree.

529
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,920
But the folks in France, they don't seem to agree.

530
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,160
They say, bonjour mon chien.

531
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,620
Would you take ze picture with me?

532
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,440
I say oui, oui.

533
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,020
That's right.

534
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,960
I say oui, oui.

535
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,480
Oui, oui.

536
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,000
He says oui, oui.

537
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,520
I'm done.

538
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:12,940
Now I'm gonna make a big splash.

539
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:12,940


540
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,000
I may look a little dumber than a box of hair.

541
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,300
But those Frenchies don't seem to care.

542
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,620
Don't know why I'm on France, but they love me there.

543
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,540
I'm a genius in France.

544
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,740
I'm a genius in France.

545
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,860
Gonna make a big splash when I show up in Cannes.

546
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,220
Gonna make those Frenchies scream.

547
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,080
Use a man, use a man, use a man!

548
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,780
Like a fine red wah!

549
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,120
I got that shit to say wah!

550
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,720
Like a fine red wah!

551
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,800
I got that shit to say wah-wah-wah-wah-wah!

552
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,600
Hoo-wee-oo!

553
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,580
Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah!

554
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,660
Hoo-wee-oo!

555
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:05,080
Bow-dee-dee-bow-dee-bow-dee-bow-bow-dee-dee-bow-dee-bow-dee-bow-bow-dee-bow!

556
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,160
I'm a taco short of a combo plate

557
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,620
But by some twist of fate all the frogs think I'm great

558
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,720
Oh, the men all faint and the women scream

559
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,140
They like me more than heavy cream

560
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,460
When I'm in Versailles, I'm a popular guy

561
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,860
My oh my, I'm as French as apple pie

562
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,440
Apple pie!

563
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,600
They think I'm awful

564
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,180
Fully witty

565
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,900
A riot and a half

566
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,560
When I tell a stupid joke they laugh

567
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,800
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

568
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,280
And laugh

569
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,760
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

570
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,320
People and friends have lots of attitude

571
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,940
They're snotty and rude, they like disgusting food

572
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,300
But when they see me they just come unglued

573
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,400
They think that I am one happening dude

574
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,280
Bow-bow-bow-bow-bow-bow-bow-bow-bow

575
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,200
I'm about as sharp as a bowling ball

576
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,340
But they like me better

577
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,940
Than Charles de Gaulle

578
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,200
Andre knew it's very true

579
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,540
The room temperature's higher than my IQ

580
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,160
But they love me more than Gerard Depardieu

581
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,060
How did this happen?

582
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,460
I don't have a clue

583
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,180
I'm not the greatest tractor on the farm

584
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,280
I don't have any skills or grace or charm

585
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,820
And most people look at me

586
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,260
Like I'm all covered with ants

587
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,720
But I'm a genius in France

588
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,700
Genius in France

589
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,220
Genius in France

590
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,880
And I'm never going back

591
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,740
I'm never going back

592
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,840
I'm never, never, never, never going back home again

593
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,820
I'm tearing up my return flight ticket

594
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,780
Gonna tell the folks back home

595
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,820
Where they can't stick it

596
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,420
Cause I'm never going back

597
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,340
I'm never going back

598
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,480
I'm never going back

599
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,700
The girls back home never gave me a chance

600
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,780
But I've shown off goddamn frogs and some kind of trance

601
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,300
And I'm aware that it's a most improbable circumstance

602
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,460
But great googly moogly

603
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,220
I'm a genius in France

604
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,080
Every Frenchie that I meet

605
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,920
Just can't wait to kiss my feet

606
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,860
Get in line, fuck her up, too sweet

607
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,780
Poundity, poundity, poundity

608
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,620
I'm getting even more famous by the hour

609
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,360
I'm stuffed with pastries and drunk with power

610
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,180
Now they're putting up my statue by the Eiffel Tower

611
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,680
A little more to the left, boys

612
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,100
A little more to the left

613
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,760
A little more to the left, boys

614
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,220
A little more to the left, boys

615
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,980
A little more to the left

616
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,660
I'm the biggest dork there is alive

617
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,860
My mom picked out my clothes for me

618
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,360
Till I was thirty-five

619
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,120
And I forgot to mention

620
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,360
I'm not even welcome at the Star Trek convention

621
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,920
But the Frenchies think that my poop don't stink

622
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,740
I'm a genius in France

623
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,760
Say, would you pass the Grey Poupon?

624
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Merci beaucoup

625
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,400
Weird Al Yankovic, of course, from the album Hoodle Hat

626
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,740
I think that I ought to begin by saying that our subject today concerns silly

627
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,140
Oh, let's take an example

628
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:28,460
Probably the silliest personal emergency that can come to a man

629
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,820
is his silly wedding.

630
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,420
Oh!

631
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,180
Rather than keep you in suspense any longer,

632
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,820
the ladies will have to leave the room.

633
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,760
Thank you.

634
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,580
Are you all right?

635
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,320
I'll say that we are guilty,

636
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,580
but also look silly.

637
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,160
No, no.

638
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:45,960
Oh.

639
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,200
Oh, yes.

640
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,780
24 and a half.

641
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,740
9 and 3 quarters.

642
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,760
13 and a quarter.

643
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,760
24 and a quarter.

644
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,440
42.

645
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,580
42 and a quarter.

646
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:53,980
39.

647
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:54,720
43.

648
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,020
Well, I guess I'm in the way here.

649
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,900
So I see.

650
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,800
Good night.

651
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,180
Did it.

652
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,260
And now,

653
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,480
a puzzling evidence

654
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,760
and glass madness

655
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,140
about 20 years ago.

656
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,180
What you gonna sing about

657
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,940
at five o'clock

658
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,020
in the morning?

659
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,760
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

660
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,460
Yeehaw.

661
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,820
Talking about Bob Dobbs

662
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,460
and the church,

663
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,760
everything in a whole big mess

664
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,300
on the floor.

665
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,680
Just back.

666
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,940
A disorganized first church,

667
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,920
a disorganized mess on the floor.

668
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,900
You're a little intimidated.

669
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,640
I'm joining any kind of church.

670
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,640
You can call a church

671
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,440
anything you want.

672
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,200
Foundation or a club

673
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,680
or just something to look at.

674
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,380
We call it Church of the

675
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,700
fill-in-the-blank.

676
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,440
And Bob Dobbs

677
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,460
is the biggest blank

678
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,740
to fill in you'll ever see.

679
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,120
And that's all it is.

680
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:57,860
Friends and neighbors,

681
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,980
out there listening tonight,

682
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
we hope that you're putting

683
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,380
your hands on the radio

684
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,620
and getting the full impact

685
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,420
of this message

686
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,520
that's coming down to you.

687
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,780
Face at the very fact

688
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,160
of your eyes

689
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,060
moving across the page

690
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,940
at this very moment

691
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,300
as you try to read your radio

692
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:10,780
is inevitably

693
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,540
and subatomically decreed.

694
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,340
Your brain is working

695
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,140
without your control.

696
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,580
You are locked into the machinations

697
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,940
of a cosmic puppeteer

698
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,780
who worked your strings

699
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,340
so skillfully

700
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,340
you never knew they were there

701
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,220
until now.

702
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,100
Feels good, doesn't it?

703
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,400
Oh, it feels so very good

704
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,060
when I've got the strings

705
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,800
pulled tight.

706
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,100
Oh!

707
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,900
But we can show you

708
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,380
where the strings

709
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:27,840
are attached.

710
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,960
And how to sync up

711
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,620
with a puppeteer.

712
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,380
Will this say

713
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,140
life after death,

714
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,880
reincarnality,

715
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,560
psychic powers,

716
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,180
immortality,

717
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:33,680
invisibility,

718
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,180
nirvana,

719
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:34,640
communications,

720
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,500
higher challenges,

721
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,460
slack, slack, slack,

722
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,340
so on.

723
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,320
They may be pink,

724
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,420
but their money is green.

725
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,840
So I walked into the

726
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,440
air conditioning.

727
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,400
I walked into the jaws

728
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,600
of corporate sellout city today.

729
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,540
You did?

730
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:47,780
Did you?

731
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,980
Yeah, I bent over and said,

732
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,700
let me in the club.

733
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,020
You didn't say

734
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,720
put it in here,

735
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,680
but don't be gentle?

736
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,460
I said, you put it

737
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,040
wherever you want.

738
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:55,960
Just let me in the club.

739
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,740
He doesn't even want it.

740
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,120
Dome.

741
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,200
When they release the gas,

742
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,500
let me in the dome.

743
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,880
Lube or no lube,

744
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,840
don't matter to me,

745
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,980
but you let me in,

746
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,360
you got your way.

747
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,500
That's why you got into it,

748
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:07,600
man.

749
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,480
You don't like the lube.

750
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,640
You don't like the lube.

751
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,240
You like it rough.

752
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,660
So we'll see if I get

753
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,660
called back in

754
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,680
to the sacred orb

755
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,840
for round two.

756
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,400
Are you going to have to kiss?

757
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,220
Round two will be

758
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,560
a showdown

759
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,620
between three people,

760
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:19,920
like good,

761
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,200
the bad,

762
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,600
and the ugly.

763
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,560
Remember the good,

764
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:22,800
the bad,

765
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,140
and the ugly?

766
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,560
At the end,

767
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,500
it was three people,

768
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,220
not a shootout

769
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,300
between two people.

770
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,540
But a shootout

771
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,620
between three people.

772
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,380
Job interviews

773
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,380
are more and more

774
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,640
like American Idol.

775
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,320
This was definitely

776
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,080
like American Idol.

777
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,460
They are definitely

778
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,640
all videotaped

779
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,500
from the time

780
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,520
you walk in the door.

781
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,640
They want to make sure

782
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,380
there are no stains

783
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,320
down there,

784
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:41,720
and you know

785
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,440
where I'm talking about,

786
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:42,700
too.

787
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,080
The finger pad.

788
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,680
Well, you did great

789
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,460
in the bathing suit contest.

790
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,520
I did really good in that.

791
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,540
You had to wear

792
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,400
five pairs of socks

793
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:49,960
on that thing,

794
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,120
though,

795
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,620
to get any kind

796
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,880
of substantial formate.

797
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,880
Oh, they all do that.

798
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,440
Oh, they all do that.

799
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,580
That's understood.

800
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,540
I did really good

801
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,620
with the Motown song.

802
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,720
They do sometimes

803
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,740
take off that

804
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,500
ten-point slide

805
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,420
for too many songs.

806
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,680
The Motown song was good.

807
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,880
The R&B song was all right.

808
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,880
What did you do?

809
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,380
Did you do

810
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,560
Stop the Name of Love?

811
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,260
The Elvis song, though,

812
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,200
was a little tough

813
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,380
because I picked a hard one.

814
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,240
Which air...

815
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,140
I picked the

816
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,020
American Trilogy.

817
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,480
Which air guitar

818
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,640
ten did you pick?

819
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,620
Or did they assign one?

820
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,920
No, no.

821
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,180
That's coming up

822
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,900
in round two.

823
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,300
Oh.

824
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,460
They're saving that

825
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,380
for the big round.

826
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,580
There's a lot

827
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:27,700
of people

828
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,380
who have eye injuries

829
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,100
and those things.

830
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,420
Man, make sure

831
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,640
that EMS is on call.

832
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,400
And make sure

833
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,080
you're getting plenty

834
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,100
of food and water.

835
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:34,900
And make sure

836
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,940
your vacation time

837
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,980
is clearly marked here

838
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,860
on the digital cock.

839
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,960
I mean clock.

840
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,100
I'm sorry.

841
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,180
Rocking.

842
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,940
It's only rocking rocks.

843
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,340
Boy, talk about Freudian.

844
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,340
I know.

845
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,080
Man.

846
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,960
That guy kind of

847
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,680
climbed in my head

848
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,240
and now I can't.

849
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,020
I just, I don't know.

850
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,540
That was pretty Freudian.

851
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,300
I'm still thinking

852
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:49,940
about little kids.

853
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:50,760
Everyone.

854
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,140
The one listening

855
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,040
is listening.

856
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,620
Look, Chaz,

857
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,380
the one listener

858
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:57,800
is there.

859
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,500
Oh, cool.

860
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,500
He's calling again.

861
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,620
And his twin brother

862
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,800
on the other line.

863
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,700
It's okay.

864
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,760
You can call now

865
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,140
and you can express

866
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,180
yourself freely

867
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,880
because, damn it,

868
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,540
we liberated this zone

869
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,820
for your protection

870
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,540
and flavor.

871
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,220
Just relax.

872
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:13,820
Release.

873
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,980
And just let it go.

874
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,500
Enjoy.

875
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,300
It's for your own good, man.

876
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,200
It's good

877
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,540
for your own good.

878
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,360
Push.

879
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,100
Like you're trying

880
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,660
to get one out.

881
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,780
It'll go in easier.

882
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,600
Come on.

883
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,500
Remember what Mommy

884
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,020
did so many years ago

885
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,220
when she pooped

886
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:27,680
a watermelon

887
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,780
and called it you.

888
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And, friends,

889
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,340
of course,

890
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,460
that was ESO Radio,

891
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,280
Swamp Radio

892
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,900
from WCSB Cleveland

893
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,060
with Professor Chaz Smith,

894
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,460
the host,

895
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,540
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

896
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,780
Princess Wee,

897
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,000
and Yee.

898
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,820
And now,

899
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,920
Lamer.

900
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,580
Lamer.

901
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,620
Lamer.

902
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,580
Lamer.

903
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:02,580


904
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,680
Lamer.

905
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,480
Lamer.

906
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,080
Lamer.

907
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,300
Lamer.

908
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:06,300


909
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:06,300


910
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:06,300


911
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:06,300


912
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:06,300


913
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:06,300


914
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,620
Hey, you guys want to keep it down?

915
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,760
There's more than enough

916
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,900
flame to go around.

917
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,700
It doesn't have to be

918
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,420
an entity.

919
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,780
Delicious frozen custard.

920
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,520
It doesn't have to be a custard.

921
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,940
It doesn't have to be an entity.

922
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,880
It doesn't have to have

923
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,020
fibulations because

924
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,000
its heart beats.

925
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,280
7th Cavalry caramel topping

926
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,800
You can hear the sound

927
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,240
of the pounding heart

928
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:24,980
of the show

929
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,680
from under the floorboards.

930
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,000
Has the pain ended?

931
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,500
Oh, God, look at that EEG.

932
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,460
It's incredible that it could be in a coma for this long,

933
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:41,000
yet still it goes on and on like the vegetable it is

934
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,940
and doesn't die.

935
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,700
Although when you purchase all three,

936
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,880
it's only $16.98 per stew.

937
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,100
They try to clean up the song and make it feel good about itself.

938
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,460
They thought maybe then it would be ready for death.

939
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,140
Maybe just a sense of bitterness was keeping it from dying.

940
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,060
The other members of the team kept ranting about other things

941
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,780
while the song pulsated along behind them,

942
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,720
unbeknownst to their very actions.

943
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,320
You know, go ahead, try to kill it, Hal.

944
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,740
Try to kill the song right now.

945
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,780
Take this gun and shoot the song.

946
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,080
Just try to kill it.

947
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,220
Don't cripple this song, Hal.

948
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,260
No, let it glide along.

949
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,120
You can't slow it down.

950
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,360
Hold on, we're trying to pull you up right next to our little spacecraft.

951
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,360
They cut off three of its legs, but look at it.

952
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,240
It's still chopping along.

953
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,000
There you are. You're climbed on.

954
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,600
You're on, you're on. You're in, you're in.

955
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,660
Dr. Philodrum, Dr. Hal and Puzzling Evidence

956
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,320
on the KPFA Puzzling Evidence Show.

957
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:49,740
By the way, this music or sound in the background is from Negative Land,

958
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:55,940
whose show precedes the Puzzling Evidence Show on KPFA Berkeley.

959
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,560
For the vivid subgenius imagination is in a churning turmoil of constant growth,

960
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,520
and it can make the wait blast.

961
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,800
When starving, or contemplating unpaid bills,

962
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,720
the subgenius eats his imagination for breakfast and lunches on his own soul.

963
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,320
It invents more possibility of future pain and joy,

964
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,780
letting us see their immense range and depth,

965
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,200
and that they are subjective.

966
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,020
We then realize that duration is dependent upon mood.

967
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,240
Could we control our own rates?

968
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,640
We could shorten apparent pain time to zero and apparent slack time infinitely.

969
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,220
Meanwhile, the subgenius must bravely face the bars of his cage.

970
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,900
Patience is the only form of time control,

971
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,940
at least until the time of now.

972
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,620
Now, go for a walk and keep walking,

973
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,100
until you stub your toe, get bugged,

974
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,740
or until your feet really hurt.

975
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,180
This will remind you that what you have been reading is valid,

976
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:53,660
only idea your head and just a bunch of philosophical crap to begin with.

977
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,900
There's no sense in getting permanently cosmic-headed,

978
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,640
even if you could and most yogis are only faking it to themselves.

979
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,920
You still have to eat, and your shit still stinks.

980
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,820
There is such a thing as getting too high, and death is a waste,

981
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,820
though that is the only reason you should be afraid of it.

982
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,260
Religious yahoos can keep blabbering glib crap forever,

983
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,740
us included, and it's a good flushing out of the brain-pen,

984
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,060
but that's all it is.

985
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,200
The rest is between you and Bob.

986
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,840
Good luck, suckers.

987
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,760
Time control outtakes from the subgenius book,

988
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,940
Revelation X, read by the author.

989
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,380
The book is available for purchase at www.theblogspot.com

990
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,120
One of the most spectacular kinds of automobile accidents

991
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,860
is the one in which a car not only gets banged up,

992
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,080
but bursts into flames.

993
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,320
One makes it really horrible...

994
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,820
...is the idea that a driver and his passenger, stunned by the accident,

995
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,860
may be trapped inside the burning car.

996
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:43,140
The National Safety Council says that, proportionately for most of us,

997
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,280
this type of spectacular smash-up...

998
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,160
...is very dangerous.

999
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,420
...is very rare.

1000
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,320
The thing that stuns people inside a car...

1001
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,040
...will make you help.

1002
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,000
Artemia Salina did it.

1003
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,800
And now...

1004
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,980
Les Murs.

1005
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,140
The American Heart Association

1006
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,180
has a lot to learn about dirt.

1007
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,200
That dirt, McCain.

1008
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,180
I want you to look around.

1009
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,760
And you tell me who'll pick dirt.

1010
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,860
That dirt.

1011
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,140
But...

1012
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,460
If the Marshal's dirt was the dirt,

1013
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,260
why Paul never throw that...

1014
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,540
...that dirt in the dirt?

1015
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,360
I don't know.

1016
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,120
He's got too much dirt.

1017
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,440
Because I don't believe in principles?

1018
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,300
But it's important dirt.

1019
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,840
Very, very important.

1020
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:44,940
Who is it?

1021
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,120
The American Heart Association.

1022
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,660
Still awake, son?

1023
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,620
Can't seem to get to sleep.

1024
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,800
Well, maybe you can sleep if you think of something pleasant.

1025
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,640
Not Michael or me!

1026
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,480
Maybe.

1027
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,260
Mark, I told you before.

1028
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,760
You had no right to get away.

1029
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,940
I'm sorry, Paul.

1030
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,420
One thing is sure.

1031
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,900
We're not your friend.

1032
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,100
Mark, wait!

1033
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,960
I'd be glad to.

1034
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,320
Well, I guess I take the prize for stupidity.

1035
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:14,800
I know.

1036
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,440
I know the one you mean.

1037
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,900
Don't you have at least 15 friends?

1038
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,860
No, it's easy.

1039
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,960
The problem is you get too many people.

1040
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,100
We would have to arrange a friend stock.

1041
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:23,560
Like 60.

1042
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,860
You would have to have a friend stock.

1043
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,540
We'd have to have like more than 15.

1044
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,160
We might have to have 16 friends.

1045
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,760
We can rent some friends.

1046
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,900
I know there's this place called Rent-A-Friend now where you can go in and you can rent somebody.

1047
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,020
Rent-A-Friend?

1048
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,660
Is that like where you can get a Russian bride or something?

1049
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,840
They'll act like they've known you for a long time.

1050
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,500
You'd give them like a bio sheet and they'll memorize your bio sheet.

1051
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,880
And then like when they walk around with you, you know, they'll...

1052
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:48,880


1053
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,980
They'll always be laughing at your jokes no matter how lame.

1054
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,100
I wouldn't show just anyone my bio sheet.

1055
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,400
You know, you don't have to pay them too much.

1056
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,020
It's really...

1057
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,100
You notice this scene looks a lot like the one in 2002 where the guy touches the monolith.

1058
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,620
You pay their expenses and give them money.

1059
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:02,380
I was enjoying the special effects but they just somehow didn't look very convincing.

1060
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:08,260
But did you notice that when you have your Rent-A-Friend that they never say anything bad?

1061
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,440
Yes.

1062
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,260
Well, that's their job, you see.

1063
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,460
They never ever say anything bad.

1064
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,700
I mean a good friend, a real friend...

1065
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:18,860
Motion picture in the scene.

1066
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,600
They'll tell you a bad news every now and then.

1067
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,460
So when you rent one, it sort of like breaks down after a while.

1068
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,260
And people can say, you know, people will notice,

1069
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,280
Hey, I think that's Hal's Rent-A-Friend because he never says anything bad about Hal.

1070
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:40,940
But there are natural culling factors which would remove me and him from any suspicion.

1071
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,120
That boy needs therapy.

1072
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,140
Psychosomatic.

1073
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,520
That boy needs therapy.

1074
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,660
You're psychosomatic.

1075
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,920
That boy needs therapy.

1076
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,040
Gonna lie down on the couch.

1077
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,260
What does that mean?

1078
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:51,940
You're a nut.

1079
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,900
You're crazy in the coconut.

1080
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:54,920
What does that mean?

1081
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,240
That boy needs therapy.

1082
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,540
I'm gonna kill you.

1083
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,620
That boy needs therapy.

1084
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,760
The Branniga Zoo blitz half of Chief.

1085
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,060
Now when I count three.

1086
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,920
That boy needs therapy.

1087
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,400
He was white as a sheet.

1088
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,600
And he also made false teeth.

1089
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,320
Frontier Surveillance

1090
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:35,580
Can you think of anything that talks other than a person?

1091
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,260
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

1092
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,460
A bird?

1093
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:39,940
Yeah.

1094
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,180
Sometimes a parrot talks to me.

1095
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,640
Sometimes a parrot talks to me.

1096
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,720
And sometimes...

1097
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,560
Sometimes...

1098
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,740
The laundry talks to me.

1099
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,820
And sometimes...

1100
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,760
A little teeny piece of house will talk to me.

1101
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,440
And sometimes...

1102
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,680
A little...

1103
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,360
Wax...

1104
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,340
A statue of a person this big...

1105
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,000
Talks to me.

1106
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,840
And we go dancing.

1107
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,120
In a club in my own mind.

1108
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,720
And I used to have friends.

1109
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,020
And they used to be on the air with me.

1110
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:38,660
But now they just sit around and drink little energy drinks.

1111
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,640
And draw little smiley faces.

1112
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,860
At times.

1113
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:43,660
At times.

1114
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:45,740
Yeah.

1115
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,360
Yeah.

1116
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:46,840
Yeah.

1117
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:46,900
Yeah.

1118
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,100
Yeah.

1119
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:47,340
Yeah.

1120
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:47,340


1121
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:47,340


1122
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:47,340


1123
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:47,340


1124
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,380
I still think the show's funny.

1125
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,560
They do talk about phantom planets that are actually planets in another dimension

1126
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:59,280
that we can't see or anything like that.

1127
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,820
Oh, come on.

1128
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,260
The only thing that...

1129
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,060
The only way we could tell they exist...

1130
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,380
That doesn't sound like Starbucks coffee.

1131
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:13,080
The only messenger particles that could carry between the two dimensions would be gravity.

1132
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:17,200
So would this explain dark matter and that stuff running out of Dave's...

1133
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,120
Yeah, they're trying to explain all kinds of stuff like that.

1134
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:20,140
Gravity waged.

1135
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:20,380
Now, see...

1136
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,460
Now, I'm confused again.

1137
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:22,820
Gravity's particles?

1138
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,700
I thought gravity was waged or maybe wave particles.

1139
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,060
The graviton.

1140
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,300
There's actually...

1141
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,520
Have you ever heard about the graviton?

1142
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,860
No, I have not heard of graviton.

1143
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,840
It's all a bunch of fairy tale stuff.

1144
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,300
What are these?

1145
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,640
I find these to be odd.

1146
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,580
I don't believe it unless I see it.

1147
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,400
Fairy tales and children's stories.

1148
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,620
I can prove the world's flat.

1149
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,420
The moon is made of green cheese and the world is no more.

1150
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:44,720
It's flat.

1151
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,180
If the world was curved in puddles...

1152
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,280
Would have a curve to it.

1153
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:48,680
Right?

1154
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,080
They're flat.

1155
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:56,300
If the world was round stank, we'd be able to dance all the way to the other side and back and never know the difference.

1156
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,700
What do you think, Wee?

1157
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,780
Well, the horizon is straight.

1158
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,920
It's not curved.

1159
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,660
It's straight.

1160
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,760
So it must be flat.

1161
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,000
Flat.

1162
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,480
Flat as it can be.

1163
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,860
Man, flat as your skull.

1164
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:15,660
Sometimes it seems to go up and down and kind of curves at the sides.

1165
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:16,780
Up?

1166
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:17,660
Or it's like...

1167
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,220
There's something really wrong.

1168
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,320
Stang, if the world was round, you couldn't go bowling.

1169
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:29,960
The balls would go on infinitely and return back into your hand from the opposite direction.

1170
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,280
That happens below the equator, right?

1171
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,920
I don't know about blowing the equator or any of these other strange things you allude to,

1172
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,180
but I know one thing.

1173
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:44,040
If the world was truly round, you'd not be standing where you are right now.

1174
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:44,840
All ready?

1175
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,160
This lecture is about Guadalupe.

1176
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:47,680
Guatemala.

1177
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:53,760
Uh, he, the, uh, Guatemala is far more, uh, powerful than the CIA.

1178
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:54,700
Uh.

1179
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:00,380
Before beginning the lecture, one point I should make is that when people think of this Guatemala,

1180
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,160
they think of lawyers, they are going to be front and center because

1181
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,880
the Lord, the Lord and the Son of God, will not stand there and do things.

1182
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,040
I, uh, do.

1183
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:08,300
Uh.

1184
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:12,500
It's difficult to give a lecture and not avoid Guatemala's

1185
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:12,960
Obamacare.

1186
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,440
Oh, my God.

1187
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,060
Oh, my God.

1188
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,060
Oh my God.

1189
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:17,060


1190
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:17,060


1191
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:17,060


1192
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:17,060


1193
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:17,100
Oh, my God.

1194
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,100


1195
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,100


1196
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,100


1197
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,100


1198
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,100


1199
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,100


1200
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,560
Oh, my God.

1201
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:17,760
Oh, my God.

1202
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,760


1203
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,760


1204
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,760


1205
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,760


1206
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,760


1207
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,760


1208
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,760


1209
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,760


1210
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,760


1211
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,760


1212
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,760


1213
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:17,760


1214
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,960
If you look down, you see a Guatemala, Leon.

1215
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:20,920
What's that?

1216
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,160
You know what a turtle is?

1217
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,020
Of course.

1218
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,400
Same thing.

1219
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,960
A little bit there by Reverend Jarto.

1220
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,460
Uh, friends, you know, this show, it's not just you.

1221
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,420
This show makes me feel weird, too.

1222
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,160
In fact, I'm feeling kind of sick.

1223
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,440
Do you need to go to the hospital?

1224
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,340
Do you need to go to the hospital?

1225
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,160
Do you need to go to the hospital?

1226
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,800
I need to go to the hospital now.

1227
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,020
Hey, can I take you to the hospital now?

1228
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,940
Yeah, take me to the hospital, please.

1229
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,180
I think you need to go to the hospital.

1230
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,560
Yes, you do.

1231
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,320
Yes, you do.

1232
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,020
Yes, you do.

1233
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:08,800
It's weird.

1234
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,880
Go to the hospital.

1235
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:13,720
Go!

1236
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,600
Get up and go now.

1237
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,640
Get up and go.

1238
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,500
Or you just stand up and walk over to the hospital.

1239
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,540
Yeah, just go.

1240
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,660
Just get the hell out and go to the hospital.

1241
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,300
But I feel better now.

1242
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:34,980
I don't think my heart is beating too fast, and that rash is imploring my mind as bad as it was.

1243
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,680
That's okay.

1244
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,340
The hospital is waiting.

1245
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,040
They've staffed up for you.

1246
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:47,080
They've added on new doctors and new nurses and a whole army of volunteers ready to meet you.

1247
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,320
I know that your needs are waiting at the hospital.

1248
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,940
But I don't want to go to the hospital anymore.

1249
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,780
I don't want to need my insurance.

1250
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:56,580
That's okay.

1251
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,120
The hospital is free now.

1252
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,160
You go to the hospital.

1253
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,460
It doesn't cost any money.

1254
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,320
You just walk in.

1255
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,560
They'll start doing the tests.

1256
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,360
They don't even...

1257
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,680
You don't have to sign any papers anymore.

1258
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,380
You don't have to wait in the waiting room.

1259
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:10,640
They did away with the waiting room because there's no waiting.

1260
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,360
You just walk in.

1261
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,000
You just can't have a camera guy with you.

1262
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,600
And there's a whole hospital dedicated just to you.

1263
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,820
A whole staff...

1264
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,380
Just for me?

1265
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,100
Yeah, just for you.

1266
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:33,680
It has a whole staff of doctors and nurses, lawyers, and all those other kind of people that are at hospitals to take care of you without any overlap.

1267
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:40,320
Without any focus on any other patients besides you.

1268
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,660
You are it.

1269
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,000
Yee-haw!

1270
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,240
I'm King String.

1271
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:46,580
I make a living.

1272
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,040
Take a home-made electric chair at home in your own house.

1273
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,560
Everybody is dropping out, man.

1274
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,440
Everybody's dropping out.

1275
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,020
Blau and red.

1276
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,360
You can't fight the machine no more.

1277
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:00,060
And their tuning out and turning out.

1278
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:00,920
That's right.

1279
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,960
And toning out.

1280
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,200
Did you ever try and make a home-made electric chair in your own home?

1281
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:10,400
Like you make the chair with the straps you get, like one of mom's aluminum pie panes you put on your head.

1282
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:14,660
And then you get the battery charges and attach them to your...

1283
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,360
and did you stick your feet in the water

1284
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,600
and you're good to go somewhere?

1285
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,840
We killed the neighbor's kid's bunny that way.

1286
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,560
You put him in a chair?

1287
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,240
You gave him the chair?

1288
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,200
A little fake chair and a car battery.

1289
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,020
Did you guys go through a series of appeals

1290
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,140
or anything like that?

1291
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,300
No, no.

1292
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:31,940
No, you just...

1293
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,660
It was just cruel Pobucker kids.

1294
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,080
Not even a trial for the bunny.

1295
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,220
You didn't even try him or anything

1296
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,260
or charge him or anything?

1297
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,020
No, it was just cruelty to animals.

1298
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,000
That's what kids did in Fort Worth in the day.

1299
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:45,960
See, when we would...

1300
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,940
In the 50s.

1301
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,540
The 1850s.

1302
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,160
Yeah, the 1850s.

1303
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,200
Who else was there to torture besides animals?

1304
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,040
You were a kid.

1305
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,860
We have a real police force here

1306
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,240
and they have enough M16 toting criminals

1307
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,880
to deal with and without scooping up sub-dini's

1308
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,800
without table manners.

1309
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,480
Sidewalk lawyer G.G. Gordon had his hands full

1310
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,460
just trying to get us out in one piece

1311
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,000
because of that little dinner.

1312
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,400
Those jokers have got to go.

1313
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,020
Can't you burn their houses down

1314
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,040
like you did your buddy D. Burns suggested?

1315
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:15,940
Maybe they'll...

1316
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,660
Then they'll see

1317
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,360
Stemo comes out here

1318
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,300
with the same fake accent they all use,

1319
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,160
all of you use,

1320
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,240
and slays no one.

1321
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,100
J.N.R. spouts that his lower extremities are aflame,

1322
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,080
that he wishes and asks that a member of the court

1323
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,560
at both the state and federal levels,

1324
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,240
not to mention God,

1325
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:41,440
to perform an evil, defiled sex act on him

1326
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,260
just that he may hear the same washed-out sound effect

1327
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:45,920
of an explosion.

1328
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,020
that we all heard.

1329
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:48,760
Ha ha ha!

1330
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,280
I was mortally embarrassed to play that Midwestern drivel,

1331
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:57,600
but in the interest of salvaging some sort of a show from the muck,

1332
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,740
I bore on.

1333
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,240
Kids, I'm afraid I've...

1334
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:08,920
I've lost the most precious thing there is to me,

1335
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,160
my personal slag.

1336
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,560
Our children gather around,

1337
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,280
you know, the older girls.

1338
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,140
Look up closer,

1339
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,960
the ones who are starting to sprout.

1340
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,380
Are you missing your slag, brother?

1341
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,620
Have you no slag?

1342
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,700
Well, praise Don.

1343
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,420
Don brings slag.

1344
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,160
To the slagless,

1345
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:31,280
if you down in your mine or your quarry

1346
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,660
have not enough slag,

1347
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:38,380
why, R.L. Don Glodds

1348
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,340
will bring you slag.

1349
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,020
Smooth.

1350
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,000
And he will teach you the story

1351
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:43,500
Sweet.

1352
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,960
of the MS,

1353
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,600
from outer space,

1354
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,520
who will come down to Earth

1355
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,080
and save all those who spent their $31.

1356
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,340
Oh, yes.

1357
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,040
Praise Don.

1358
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,320
Praise Don.

1359
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:00,740
Don will let you play with your thermometer in the rain,

1360
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:01,900
unlike Bob Dobbs,

1361
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,560
who'll let you stand in hackneyed and short.

1362
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,020
He's the kind of man who visits block...

1363
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:10,880
What was in that stuff?

1364
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,820
Is that stuff, or is it just something else?

1365
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:14,700
Oh, that's that stuff.

1366
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,100
J.R.

1367
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,140
Bob Dobbs told you, ain't it?

1368
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,300
He ate it?

1369
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,280
Yeah, he ate it.

1370
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,280
He ate it?

1371
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,820
He can't, he can't step, step thinking

1372
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:22,960
and then he downed it.

1373
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,300
All the time.

1374
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,540
It just goes like Bob.

1375
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,940
It gets into your brain

1376
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,600
and then it just scrambles everything up.

1377
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,280
Thank God we're into Don now

1378
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,660
and forgot that evil slackmeister Bob.

1379
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,460
Trying to heal, you know,

1380
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:41,040
those who've, those who've been brainwashed

1381
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,460
by the Bob cult.

1382
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,440
Those who eat their...

1383
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,200
Or recovered.

1384
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:45,680
Recovering.

1385
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,400
Those poor people.

1386
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,260
Recovering cult addicts.

1387
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,600
That was about his mother, I think.

1388
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,100
His sainted mother.

1389
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,880
His sainted gray-haired granny.

1390
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,460
Well, you know,

1391
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,300
there's no replacing

1392
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,980
his gray-haired granny

1393
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:05,460
and his blue-haired brother,

1394
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,800
brown-haired idiot,

1395
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,240
his pet idiot.

1396
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:10,540
And his pet idiot.

1397
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,380
He had a pet idiot.

1398
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,980
Can you believe that they allowed him

1399
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,120
to keep a pet idiot?

1400
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:14,840
How are you?

1401
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,020
How are you?

1402
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:15,260
How are you?

1403
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:15,260


1404
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:16,660
Actually, to tell the truth, Chaz,

1405
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,860
I've been doing X-Day shows

1406
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,540
for Hour of Slack

1407
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,940
ahead of time.

1408
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:23,860
They're all done.

1409
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,580
So it's like,

1410
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,200
anything we say about X-Day now

1411
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,200
would be used on next year's show.

1412
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,560
I can't stand the pleasure.

1413
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,740
Assuming that the world was still here

1414
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,460
and that our cult is, in fact,

1415
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,880
just a sad, pathetic joke.

1416
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,880
Well, that's true.

1417
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,640
Struggling tadpole out of the water.

1418
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,240
Well, we...

1419
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:45,920
Never to grow...

1420
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,760
Never, ever to lose its tail

1421
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,600
and grow legs.

1422
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,540
Well, now,

1423
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,160
Reverend Stang,

1424
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,000
is it not true

1425
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,780
that you gave

1426
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,140
in the year 1980 itself

1427
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,260
on itself here

1428
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,680
on my congressional rectus?

1429
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:58,020
That's right.

1430
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,800
It says here that you...

1431
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,240
We tried to destroy the world.

1432
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:01,940
You tried.

1433
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,560
Well, you actually succeeded

1434
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,100
in destroying some parts of the world.

1435
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:07,640
Isn't that true, Senator Klebock?

1436
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,860
That was absolutely true,

1437
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,900
Senator Hedwig.

1438
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,520
That was the federal building

1439
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,840
in Waco, Texas.

1440
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:14,800
Well, it says here,

1441
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,040
there's the Fezziwig building

1442
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,300
of the Imperial Literacy Towers,

1443
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,720
a place that doesn't really exist

1444
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,380
except for in your warped mind.

1445
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,100
Well, look, look.

1446
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,800
Almost every religion

1447
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,300
has an end-of-the-world prediction.

1448
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:26,920
Sir, are you...

1449
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:28,020
Fizzles are...

1450
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,820
You know, they try to end the world

1451
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,120
in their immediate vicinity.

1452
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,200
I cannot...

1453
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,880
We've got a virus this time, though,

1454
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,140
that we think is going to work.

1455
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,360
It's going to take a while,

1456
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:38,420
so, you know,

1457
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,120
the July 5th thing

1458
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,940
becomes sort of more of a symbolic...

1459
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:44,440
If my ears aren't burning now,

1460
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,240
I don't know so when my ears

1461
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,320
will ever burn again.

1462
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,100
You have said not only you've promised

1463
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,840
to hook the virus upon this land...

1464
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,260
It's done.

1465
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,420
...to visitate the pestilences and so forth.

1466
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,140
You've not only included yourself

1467
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:57,980
in this plan,

1468
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,200
but you call yourself a religion?

1469
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:01,180
What?

1470
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,260
I almost swore.

1471
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,600
In the name of the Lord,

1472
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,040
I can't...

1473
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,620
What kind of religion

1474
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,440
would you call that?

1475
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,060
Well, an above-average,

1476
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:13,940
well, below-genius religion, sir.

1477
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,240
Your Honor.

1478
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,400
It's not...

1479
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:16,980
It's not...

1480
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,060
Just another...

1481
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,400
Just another end-of-the-world

1482
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,320
UFO sex weirdness.

1483
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,680
Well, these moon pants you've marked there,

1484
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,720
they contain spent plutonium,

1485
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,740
much like the weapons

1486
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,480
we're using in Osaka, Japan.

1487
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,780
Sir, how can you be so cold-blooded?

1488
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,500
I know you have some lizard blood in you,

1489
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,100
but how can you be so cold-blooded?

1490
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,540
Who let the rooster in?

1491
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:40,900
Yeah.

1492
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,680
Well, the plutonium in the moon pants

1493
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,200
prevents...

1494
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,160
prevents normals

1495
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,560
from being born to sub-genius couples

1496
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,860
who wear the moon pants.

1497
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:49,360
That's weird.

1498
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:50,900
Well, I...

1499
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,200
I never saw a rooster in my studio.

1500
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,920
If my ankles are not covered with sweat

1501
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,700
and turning green right now, sir,

1502
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,480
I do not know if they ever shall.

1503
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,780
Now you've got the music to this.

1504
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,640
You've got the music to this.

1505
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,100
You seem to think you're some kind of big dude.

1506
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:13,880
You've got all...

1507
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,180
You've got all...

1508
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:14,340
You've got all...

1509
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,740
You know where you get those ideas.

1510
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,620
You know you're nothing but a shield for the needy.

1511
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,160
But you want you to live happy, Phil.

1512
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,300
But everybody wants to start something happy.

1513
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,420
And the thing that's watching through you

1514
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,700
is this Catholic selection.

1515
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,280
It's a sin.

1516
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,860
It's a downright disgrace.

1517
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,720
You never thought I'd find out the big secret.

1518
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,840
Now you've got the music to this.

1519
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,480
You've got the music to this.

1520
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,980
The geeks and the boys know all about it

1521
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:10,080
You gotta get out of town, you gotta take a platter with it

1522
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:12,760
Doesn't look like you draw a lot of water with

1523
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,600
You don't have any say in the matter with it

1524
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,360
Looking for someone to throw the book at with truth

1525
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:23,040
Think the world's nice and queer, but it's a shame, it's a sin

1526
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,660
It's a downright disgrace

1527
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:29,320
You never thought I'd find out the big secret

1528
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,660
Now you've got the music to face

1529
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,660
You've got the music to

1530
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:38,920
Music

1531
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:38,920


1532
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:42,560
Music

1533
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:42,740
Music

1534
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:42,740


1535
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:42,740


1536
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:42,740


1537
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,680
You've got to face the music

1538
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,040
Face the music

1539
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:51,080
You've got to face the music this time

1540
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,360
Music

1541
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,760
Music

1542
00:57:58,860 --> 00:57:59,740
Music

1543
00:57:59,740 --> 00:57:59,740


1544
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:12,740
Music

1545
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:12,740


1546
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:12,740


1547
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,600
Music

1548
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,620
Music

1549
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:16,760
Music

1550
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,200
Music

1551
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,340
Music

1552
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,200
The Pink Boys

1553
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,640
With Dr. X on vocals

1554
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,440
May he rest in peace

1555
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,480
The Pink Boys

1556
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:42,620
With Dr. X on vocals

1557
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:42,620


1558
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:42,740
The Pink Boys

1559
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:51,680
You are listening to the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius, www.subgenius.com.

1560
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,760
Praise Bob and praise the doctors.

1561
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:07,220
This is Reverend Ivan Stang and you can reach me at Post Office Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1562
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,380
Ah, yes.

1563
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:16,380
