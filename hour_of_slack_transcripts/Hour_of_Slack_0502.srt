1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Uh, uh, yes, yes, I'm on a tear, dear friends.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,120
We're on a real tear tonight.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,120
Uh, we're on Hour of Slack show number 503.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,960
The 500th and third show that I've put together just today.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,880
Would you just relax?

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,700
Don't tell me to relax!

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,420
I hate it when you do that!

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,260
I'd rather you tell me to shut up!

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,040
Shut up!

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,780
You shut up!

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:33,060
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,540
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,220
The subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:49,000
is specially designed only to be played on radio station...

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,120
This one.

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,520
And only in the city of...

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,320
This area.

18
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,760
If I am not...

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,240
If I am not pleased by tonight's entertainment,

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,900
I shall banish their souls to everlasting damnation.

21
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:01,940
Damnation.

22
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,560
And madness.

23
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,660
And madness.

24
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,700
And madness.

25
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,400
And madness.

26
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,140
And madness.

27
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,220
This is a program about knives.

28
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:17,060
How to sharpen them, set them, adjust them, replace them, align them, maintain them, analyze them.

29
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:24,240
Sharpen them, set them, adjust them, replace them, align them, maintain them, analyze them.

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,740
And...

31
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:24,740


32
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,460
And...

33
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,660
In short, everything you ever would want to know

34
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,980
about keeping the knives in John Deere Forage Harvesters in cutting trim.

35
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:40,340
I can recall his headless body was found dangling from a chandelier.

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,080
So, mistakes will happen.

37
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,020
Won't they?

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,860
Now, if you will forgive me.

39
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,060
Now, if you will forgive me.

40
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,180
Hahahahahahahaha!

41
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,240
Not mob.

42
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,820
Program complete.

43
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,080
Enter when ready.

44
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,340
I don't think wine will do it.

45
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,400
I don't think acid would do it.

46
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,900
Some other time, maybe.

47
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,600
My mind is expanded as far as it can go.

48
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,120
Any more and it'll pop, you know what I mean?

49
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,420
How are you feeling now?

50
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,460
Now put that gun in your mouth, soldier.

51
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,820
There is nothing like being at the heart of it all.

52
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,020
The dead center.

53
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,540
The pulsating vortex.

54
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,940
The gravity spot.

55
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,700
Where the very air seems with the electric current of split-second decision-making.

56
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:39,920
And it is there that you will find the unparalleled intensity of comrades-in-arms on the front lines before the masses.

57
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,680
Where are they?

58
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,180
Who are they?

59
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,060
Uh, yes, I can tell you who they are.

60
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,500
And they are the subgenius preachers.

61
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,600
Uh, though I can't tell you what.

62
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,500
I don't know what any of them are.

63
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,700
Uh, but I can tell you the name of the one coming up.

64
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:04,520
I'm gonna play a long stretch here of the great, late Dr. Katahdin Legume.

65
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,860
Uh, appearing, uh, his second to the final appearance at, uh, the, uh, Atlanta Dragon Con.

66
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,740
Uh, D. Vival, subgenius D. Vival.

67
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,640
And I think this should explain pretty much everything you need to know.

68
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,620
I'm told that cynicism's a lie.

69
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:23,700
I'm told that cynicism's a lie.

70
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:23,700


71
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:23,800
I'm told that cynicism's a lie.

72
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,040
I've been on the rampage in this country.

73
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,720
And I can't blame anybody for being cynical.

74
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,440
I mean, hell, when you're a little child, they tell you about Santa Claus.

75
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,020
If you're good, he's gonna bring you presents.

76
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,800
But they lied.

77
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,160
Oh, and they tell you about the Easter Bunny, the boogeyman.

78
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,440
They lied.

79
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,220
Oh, yes.

80
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,240
They told you masturbation would make you go blind.

81
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,880
And I got 20-20 vision.

82
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,160
They told you that the water was safe to drink.

83
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,780
They lied.

84
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,340
Hallelujah!

85
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,740
Can I get an amen, brothers and sisters?

86
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,800
Can I get an amen?

87
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,200
Can I get an amen?

88
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,540
Can I get up?

89
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,680
Hallelujah!

90
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,460
Hallelujah!

91
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,320
And can I get my wireless mic wired up?

92
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,000
Can you all still hear me out there?

93
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,320
Can you all still hear me out there?

94
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,220
Hallelujah!

95
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,900
Thank you, thank you, brothers and sisters.

96
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:41,980
I'm here to tell you about the promise of Bob, the promise of Slack, and the promise of Salvation!

97
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,520
Oh, yes, the promise of Salvation.

98
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,920
For any of you who are members of our mighty church, for any of you who are members of our

99
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,080
mighty church, there is salvation.

100
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,300
There is salvation.

101
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,300


102
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,300


103
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:59,760
Oh yes, oh yes, there will be salvation and it shall come from the sky in silvery discs

104
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,520
on 7th of July, 1998.

105
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:12,920
Oh yes, that is when the UFOs from Planet X are coming down to rapture away the subgeniuses.

106
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,240
Oh yes, to go on the pleasure craft of the sex goddesses.

107
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,660
Oh yes, these exist aliens are like anything you have seen.

108
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,140
They're not like anything you saw on Star Trek.

109
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,160
They're not like anything you saw on Star Wars.

110
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:37,680
Oh yes, these are the exists, the multi-tentacled, multi-tasticled, the multi-whatever-you-need

111
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,540
brothers and sisters.

112
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,160
They have it in abundance.

113
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:47,040
Oh yes, oh yes, brothers and sisters, and too much is always better than not enough.

119
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,900
subtle Forget-All is too active

Love, ELO, серьез l level of every song 4

124

You hear it as if it were from the back of the room.

125
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,780
But I'm going to try, friends.

126
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:00,280
I'm going to try to edit the best of Dr. Legume from its most audible sections.

127
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,000
Thank you.

128
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,000
And this ain't one of them.

129
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,100
You have more orgasms.

130
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,820
Oh, yes.

131
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,440
Oh, yes.

132
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:15,240
But a lot of you out there don't have a subgenius membership card.

133
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,600
A lot of you don't have a subgenius membership card.

134
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,540
A lot of you won't be saved.

135
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,740
Oh, yes.

136
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,680
But Bob gave me the lowdown on you, big boy.

137
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,280
Oh, yes.

138
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,760
Oh, yes.

139
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,120
Bob gave me the lowdown on you all.

140
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,020
Yes.

141
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,460
I'm going to walk you across hell.

142
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm going to walk you across hell on a spider web.

143
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,140
Your problem is you don't know about Bob.

144
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,500
But I'm going to teach you, brothers and sisters.

145
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:54,780
After 1998, I'll teach you with a loose rope and a long trough.

146
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,960
Good people are going to be coming from other planets just to see your poor sinning spirits meet the devil.

147
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,360
And I may need to please them.

148
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,160
Oh, yes.

149
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,500
I'm going to make sure you do a proper prayer.

150
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,480
The Lord's Prayer.

151
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,660
The Lord's Prayer.

152
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,200
The more you do that final dance.

153
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,220
That final dance.

154
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,980
That final horizontal dance on the ground.

155
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,100
As you're thrashing and kicking and screaming in agony.

156
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,180
And going, oh, God.

157
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,580
Oh, Jesus.

158
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,100
Oh, Jesus.

159
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,660
How come you didn't say anything about Bob in your Bible?

160
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,400
And that's because it's full of...

161
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,160
Yes, and you know, we also have to...

162
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:43,560
We have the problem with Dr. Legume's rants of having to censor them considerably in order to make them airworthy.

163
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,620
Bob gave me a vision.

164
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,640
Bob has given me a vision.

165
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,700
Yes, and part of it has to be a vision.

166
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,080
A vision of the post-apocalyptic earth.

167
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,980
Where the entire surface is coated with through the glass.

168
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,920
And everyone will weigh 300 pounds.

169
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,360
And it'll always be 120 degrees.

170
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,400
Oh, yes.

171
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,900
And every day at four o'clock.

172
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,200
It'll rain alcohol, and it'll suddenly deal wounds from the broken glass.

173
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,180
And you'll have no clothes to protect you, only a pair of boots.

174
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,680
And there'll be no food.

175
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,240
You'll be forced to eat each other.

176
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:31,560
Whoa.

177
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
And you'll never die.

178
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,600
You'll never die.

179
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,820
And Jesus won't ever save you.

180
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,380
You'll just have to cry out, cry out,

181
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,600
Jesus, Jesus, why didn't you save me?

182
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,540
That's because Jesus lies.

183
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,960
Jesus lies, just like your parents lied to you.

184
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,160
Just like how your parents lied.

185
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,880
But that won't do you a lick of good, once you're on the thing of the broken glass.

186
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,900
Oh yes, because even if someone eats you, you will still be alive.

187
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,780
That little chump of you.

188
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,520
You will be alive all the way through the digestion.

189
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,800
All the way through the digestive system.

190
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,200
And all you'll do is feel pain.

191
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,720
And all of your parts will be in communication with each other.

192
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:35,440
All of your parts, the sum of all of the little pieces that you feel in pain, will still come together into one glorious lifetime.

193
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,980
One glorious eternal lifetime of pain.

194
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:50,000
So if you wish to avoid this, then you'd better find out about Bob.

195
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,440
You had better find Bob tonight, brothers and sisters.

196
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,240
Oh yes.

197
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,800
The clock.

198
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,980
The clock is ticking, brothers and sisters.

199
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,080
Night.

200
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,940
Oh yes, dear friends.

201
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,800
And at that point, Dr. LeHume took the subject.

202
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,940
The sacred sledgehammer.

203
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,200
And smashed that clock.

204
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,240
That great big hefty alarm clock on stage.

205
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,700
To demonstrate how one may free oneself.

206
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,400
But, you know, the problem is.

207
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,980
Eh, we.

208
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,240
The problem is.

209
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:36,540
With actually, those recording scrims came from my little tiny personal tape deck that was sitting up on stage.

210
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,360
There was a four track recording machine at the back.

211
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:47,520
But you know, these kids, they think that if they've got a high tech machine, it's going to do everything for them.

212
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:59,640
And they forget that no matter how good the recording machine is, and how good the microphone is, if it's sitting at the back of the room, and they're standing in front of it, gossiping about their friends.

213
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,560
It.

214
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,140
What you're going to hear is a perfect recording of them gossiping about their friends.

215
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:11,380
And a terrible murky subgenius rant in the background.

216
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,920
The problem is, dear friends, that the world just ain't perfect.

217
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,360
Well, actually, that's not the problem.

218
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,000
Under Bob, the world would be completely imperfect.

219
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:30,060
But it would be so completely imperfect that it would be as if in a perfect way.

220
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,480
Don't you see?

221
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,200
So, uh.

222
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,120
Well, it's very important to understand.

223
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,120


224
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,440
And it's very important to us now to preserve every moment of Dr. Legume that we can.

225
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,160
And I believe that I do have a much better recording from the subsequent Cleveland revival.

226
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,640
However, for tonight, let's stay in Atlanta, shall we?

227
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,340
Thank you, Jimmy Ryan there in the background with that music.

228
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:03,400
Let's run a little bit of radio from our big guest appearance all together.

229
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:11,380
On Sister Susie the floozy's noble show there in Atlanta on WREK.

230
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,060
Bob's Slack Time Fun House.

231
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,080
Yeah.

232
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,400
Now shut up. Play the music.

233
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,880
But here's the problem, friends.

234
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Now he won't shut up.

235
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,100
Out of this bunch of subgenius preachers, there's only two real professionals.

236
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,340
That's me and Jayner.

237
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,820
We can still, well, and Father Joe Mama still has his voice.

238
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,560
I'm back to Papa Joe now.

239
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,300
But you'll notice it.

240
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,120
Sister Susie the floozy has not really been heard yet.

241
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,700
And that's because she can't speak because she blew her lungs out and out inside out.

242
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,220
Literally inside out.

243
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,960
Even the record players.

244
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,500
In the first five minutes of her rant.

245
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,760
And Dr. Legume blew his inside out just for fun before we even started.

246
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,400
Before the show even started.

247
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,980
Reverend microphone can still talk a little bit.

248
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,960
Reverend microphone is here and still croaking.

249
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,140
Isn't it wonderful to have it where the woman can't talk?

250
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,860
I mean, it's kind of a change of pace.

251
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,400
We just stuck a bat in her mouth.

252
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,000
It's just like, you know, reproducing with her tongue.

253
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,640
I stuck this bat.

254
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,100
This is one of the unusual instances in which it is actually reverse discrimination.

255
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,100
It's the bat that's being violated.

256
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,240
Oh, you're just jealous.

257
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,360
About an hour ago, Sister Susie the floozy and I were in one bed.

258
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,400
Father Joe Mama was in the other bed over the hotel room.

259
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,700
By myself.

260
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,640
A sci-fi convention.

261
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,300
Entertaining myself.

262
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,260
He was bitterly entertaining himself because he'd been disappointed.

263
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,660
However, Susie and I were making him watch and he really didn't want to.

264
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,280
Yes, the women had been replaced with nothing other than comic books.

265
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,400
Such was my despair.

266
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,840
You don't know pain until you've had to make love with those acid pages.

267
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:52,980
It's true.

268
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:59,620
Poor Father Joe Mama had been stood up and had to sit there like all the other young lonely men

269
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,380
in the comic book community.

270
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,260
Well and of course, all of a sudden, he got to this convention, giving himself succor and love.

271
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,740
Self-love.

272
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:15,100
While watching and listening to Susie and I perform acrobatic comedy acts in the next bed.

273
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,540
I always suspected they never loved me.

274
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,860
It was only when I made love to myself did I realize it was all true.

275
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,500
Such is my despair.

276
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,340
Father Joe Mama had to marry himself.

277
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,600
During the short duration marriage ceremony.

278
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,160
but really isn't it the most dependable sort of sexual partner?

279
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,160
It's the only way I can have sex with someone I truly love.

280
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,320
How can you ever get married when you're in love with yourself and you even want a divorce?

281
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,040
I mean, it is a bitter pill to swallow.

282
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,400
My wife said for our honeymoon she wanted to go someplace she'd never been before.

283
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,580
I said, why don't you try the kitchen? I don't know.

284
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,320
So why don't we just start off with maybe going someplace I've never been before?

285
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,380
She didn't like that idea.

286
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,020
Kill every person that you meet.

287
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,980
No, actually, I'm just joking.

288
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,360
How are you doing these days, Jayner?

289
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,700
I've been up for five days.

290
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,760
We had to drag Jayner to this show.

291
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:17,540
We had to get him to get a taxi cab to deliver him because the limo, the limo was not sufficient to his tastes.

292
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,060
The limo driver would obey his every whim.

293
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,740
He wanted a driver that would be cocky to him and tell him how the country should be run.

294
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,280
What was the matter with the government?

295
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,920
That's why he went with the Atlanta Taxi Company.

296
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,400
How are you doing, Jayner?

297
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,220
I'm about two unpaid bills from another Oklahoma City bombing.

298
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,100
Yes, John Doe number two, Jayner Hyperclise.

299
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,060
Jayner Doe number two finally has been unearthed.

300
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,860
Why did you do it, son? Can you give us the details?

301
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,140
Name? Jayner Hyperclise.

302
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,420
Rank? Saint.

303
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,700
Serial number? 666.

304
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,440
What was your motive, Bob?

305
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,980
What was your target, Bob?

306
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,000
Number five.

307
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,840
I was about two flat tires away from pulling some kind of Jonestown, man.

308
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,840
What's that new concept, pulling a Jonestown?

309
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,620
Well, that's what we were trying to do last night, but for some reason some people just wouldn't take it seriously, I suppose.

310
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,980
I told you that's what happens when you keep the house lights up. They can see what you put in the Kool-Aid.

311
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,260
If I have to work one extra shift this week, I might just have to pull some kind of Jonestown or something, you know?

312
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:27,660
The only way he's able to come to this devival is the fact that when he clocked in on Friday, he hasn't clocked out yet.

313
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,840
He doesn't even plan on...

314
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,080
...putting that stuff into the machine again until Sunday night when he gets back home.

315
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,360
I hope they don't tune the radio in. They'd still think I'm down there.

316
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,360
Time and a half on WREK.

317
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,920
Ah, here we are at the door.

318
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,540
That's the thing about being a subgenius superstar.

319
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,220
Happy haunting.

320
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,080
You know, because it's hard. It's hard being a writer.

321
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,360
Well, now that I've got my subgenius membership card, I'll just walk right into this haunted house.

322
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,260
Wait, no, no, no, no, it's...

323
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,820
It's a dragon.

324
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,720
Dragoncon convention!

325
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,480
I had no idea Americans could be this unhealthy.

326
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,840
They are either all extremely ugly or beautiful, but made themselves up to look ugly.

327
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,200
And I love them all. All the better both ways.

328
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,020
I don't know which is worse, naturally ugly or unnaturally ugly.

329
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,520
I kind of prefer them...

330
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,260
But they are all truly ugly.

331
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,200
Dragoncon is the ultimate freakout, man.

332
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
Geniuses, subgeniuses, geniuses.

333
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,820
I'll bring the girls if you make them look like they're not geniuses, subgeniuses, geniuses.

334
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,900
Now, come on, you gotta admit we had a pretty...

335
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,720
I mean, we're subgeniuses, but girls should act dumb if they really want to be sexy.

336
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,140
That really turns me on.

337
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,720
Nothing is as sexy as a stupid woman.

338
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:56,100
She's lost her voice. She's got a face bat stuck into her mouth.

339
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,780
I mean, a face bat.

340
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,760
When I'm thinking love, the last thing I want to think about is thinking.

341
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,140
I just...

342
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,300
You inspire me so, Susie.

343
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,040
Ever since you quit talking, I've been so attracted to you.

344
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,100
It turns me on so...

345
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:15,140
I'm on the edge of total arrival and she says to me some really deep thought that makes me break my concentration.

346
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,060
I don't want to think when I make love. I just want to make love.

347
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,420
It turns me on so much when you act dumb.

348
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,520
Would you mind if I just drilled your frontal lobe out with this power drill?

349
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,620
It's like the 60s bumper sticker.

350
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,880
Oh, baby, you're just turning me on. You're turning me on so much.

351
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,520
I said, do you like that?

352
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:34,940
Will it hurt?

353
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,980
Only for a second, just like what we did the other night, remember?

354
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,040
No.

355
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:48,300
For the benefit of the viewers at home, allow us to illustrate what some of the subgeni here are wearing in the station.

356
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,520
Sister Susie the floozy has a giant bat on her breast.

357
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,320
Ivan Seytang has the anti-barb with his green glowing eyes.

358
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,720
Staring into the meters.

359
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:06,320
Jaina Hypertheclesian has a...at least a hundred skulls spelling out the words, have a nice day on his chest.

360
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,200
Or kill me.

361
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,520
Or kill him, which we will commit.

362
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,780
Microphone has bob with serpents leaping out of his ears.

363
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:25,080
And the most revered legume, Doctor Creature...Preacher of the Black Legume is standing there with dreaded subgeni testicle t-shirts.

364
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,080
Jesse Jackson, the Preacher from the Black Legume.

365
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,660
And yours truly, of course, has a snake suffocating him.

366
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,120
But it is a very comfortable snake.

367
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:41,540
Uh, that no unclean servant shall harm them, for so great shall be their strength and their faith.

368
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,400
Shalacondalanebosoya.

369
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,460
Friends, you should have seen this snake.

370
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:55,060
Well, you should have seen them last night, friends. They really were handling the snake.

371
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,580
They were handling snakes. A multitude of snakes, poisonous serpents.

372
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:58,920
They were taking in tongues.

373
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,400
And rubber snakes. And dangling them out of their pants.

374
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,900
You know that we are sinners when even the rubber snakes kill us.

375
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,460
And we're all going straight to hell, because we're gonna launch the liver of Mickey Mantle.

376
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:20,640
It's true, dear friends. The liver, the liver of Mickey Mantle was launched in a blasphemous parody of the sacred, holy, and so beautiful, of bleeding head of...

377
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,160
My God!

378
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,100
...the dreaded anal and vaginal snakes.

379
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,040
It's the kind of thing that just nauseates you.

380
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,060
It's the kind of thing that just nauseates you.

381
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,300
You know, someone just gets up and launches a liver.

382
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,440
But it's a good liver, though.

383
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,260
It doesn't make any sense.

384
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,660
Cute liver. Susie has tucked it deep into her crevasses.

385
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,580
We recognize it as the Mantle liver.

386
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,180
The stoop-walking dry liver.

387
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,080
It really looks dumb.

388
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:42,900
The old liver. The swollen liver of Mickey Mantle, the great American baseball player.

389
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,360
The slugger.

390
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,820
Put the microphone up, too, so everybody can see this.

391
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,220
Don't let that baseball liver get next to that bat.

392
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:49,700
It's great.

393
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:50,780
May...

394
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,440
...lose its balls.

395
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,060
You can't just launch something like that.

396
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,820
You can't just launch a kind of Trevino head.

397
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,780
That doesn't make any sense.

398
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,180
It does.

399
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:58,660


400
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,500
...a sneed liver.

401
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,400
You can't...

402
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,180
This is...

403
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,240
Are you trying to insult me?

404
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:02,660
No.

405
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,740
Are you trying to insult my religion?

406
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,400
What if it's an Arnold Palmer liver?

407
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:05,900
I mean...

408
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,560
There could be Palmer worshippers present.

409
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,060
You want to really embarrass people?

410
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,700
I mean, that could be...

411
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,500
You know, I'm all for the school prayer thing, because that means that the subgenius children

412
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,020
will be able to go to school and launch little Mantle livers and Palmer heads.

413
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,940
All those Wiccan children can go to school topless and run around smoking pot as part

414
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,480
of their religion.

415
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,420
Well, I just...

416
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,200
You know, I mean, what kind of country is this that you can't even put a Trevino head

417
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,340
or a Palmer head up in a town square?

418
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,780
I mean, you know, what is this, some sort of repressive society?

419
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,280
Well, you can if you have a permit.

420
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,320
I mean, at Christmas time?

421
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,180
Well, that's if you...

422
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:43,280
I have a permit to carry a concealed Palmer head, but, you know, I feel that I should

423
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,960
be able to show and flaunt my religion instead of having to hide it underneath my vest.

424
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,280
Well, maybe there should be like a separation of church and stupidity in the Constitution.

425
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,460
Well, the Trevinos are trying to say, well, you know, you're a Christian.

426
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:53,460


427
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:53,500
You know the word, I don't believe that.

428
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:53,500


429
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:53,500


430
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,060
I mean, you know, they say there is no bleeding head of Arnold Palmer, and that's just what

431
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,160
makes me mad.

432
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,140
Well, sure.

433
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,720
I mean, I don't want a head that's been launched too many times...

434
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,340
Oh, they say...

435
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,580
I mean, it's all, you know, launched out.

436
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,700
You know, there's head sluts, you know, launch sluts, people that just launch heads just

437
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,040
on and on.

438
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:15,260
You know, maybe not a virgin head for, you know, for your wedding night, but a head that

439
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,080
hadn't been launched more than, you know, maybe at the senior prom or something like

440
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,100
that, you know.

441
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,360
You mean marital head launching.

442
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,900
And then they come and they say...

443
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,980
on 2020 you can take your your bleeding head and you can you can launch it at home but you can't

444
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:33,420
even launch it on your own private property in public now does that make sense to you yeah why

445
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,980
can't i just go outside and just just launch a palmer head they can they can show pictures

446
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:45,540
i think we know who's going to happen just don't call the a btf about it or the atf i think we

447
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:50,320
know who's going to have the last lesson don't we oh yeah i have a little bit of an indication

448
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,340
there's kind of a hint as to who might have the last lesson you know what i'm saying i mean it's

449
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:01,720
possible it could be jr bob dobbs oh i think there's the possibility that the person who you

450
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:07,240
know what i'm trying to say teaches the last lesson just you know i might have an inkling

451
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:14,500
who that might be today's factoid reverend ivan stang and reverend papa joe mama were both in

452
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:19,560
dallas at the time of the waco storming coincidence i think not

453
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,420
why don't we just have susie come up on the microphone and just say something in her

454
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:33,140
cracking please don't be grotesque oh her voice i thought you said her so sexy when she can't say a

455
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:39,800

456
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:49,100
crypt at this stage various uh haunted fears to be seen but not heard that long black hair

457
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,100
the missus

458
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:57,400
venice veronica bitch whatever her neighbors no this was another critter

459
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,420

462
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,620
we want to hear your hideous croak more it's kind of sexy

463
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:20,360
i don't know what you mean you're going to say that because you're talking about something

464
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,240
that's that's a little too much you're going to be like one of those old mattress back hookers

465
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:29,900
who's been smoking camels four packs of camels a day for 40 years you make it sound so good

466
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:35,460
what you need is honey or some other similar consistency fluid to go against the back of

467
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:42,200
your throat to come and smooth it yes uh similar you see it was the bat i was so happy it felt

468
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:48,600
so good in the fashion i pulled the bat out of my throat where the barbs were retracted

469
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,300
yes susie i was so happy to see you in the fashion i pulled the bat out of my throat

470
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,120
The Reefs.

471
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,800
The Reefs.

472
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,120
The living example of the folly.

473
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,320
Well, dear friends, you know, and at that point,

474
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,520
this show starts to crumble into little bitty pieces,

475
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,680
which I won't inflict on you now.

476
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,040
We might come back to it later.

477
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,240
In fact, I know we will.

478
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:12,280
But, you know, I was going to cut to Suzy the Floozy's rant from Atlanta,

479
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,360
which was her best ever.

480
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:21,000
And, once again, the sound, when I got right down to it,

481
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:27,620
I realized that the sound quality of those recordings just would not carry over the air.

482
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,700
They just didn't work.

483
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,560
It's these kids, man.

484
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,100
They think they know everything.

485
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:40,700
They get the big machine, and then they just forget to plug in the one crucial plug.

486
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,920
And, well, that's it.

487
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,000
That's it.

488
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:49,680
Perhaps now it's time to drive across the country like we did over to Cleveland

489
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:56,560
and attend to the Cleveland revival, where things were recorded much better.

490
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,380
Although, you know, the problem is you have to get one line off the mic,

491
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,220
directly out of the mixer,

492
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:08,500
and one just a live mic from anywhere in the back of the room

493
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,840
just to get some audience presence.

494
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,820
Why these kids just can't understand?

495
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,000
You try to tell them.

496
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,060
You go in there, and you try, and you try, and you say,

497
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,280
well, can't you just do this and do that?

498
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,360
And they go, oh, no, we don't need to because we have such good equipment.

499
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,540
Uh-huh.

500
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,040
Yeah.

501
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:31,120
Well, talk to me if I sound a little bit bitter sometimes about this sort of thing.

502
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:32,740
Oh!

503
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,800
Come on!

504
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,160
Sex!

505
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:35,980
Money!

506
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:36,780
Bob!

507
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,680
Come on!

508
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,480
Sex!

509
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,120
Money!

510
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,060
Bob!

511
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:40,700
Sex!

512
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,580
Money!

513
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,080
Bob!

514
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,080
Sex!

515
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,720
It's medication time.

516
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,860
Time for some pills.

517
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:46,920
Time.

518
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,900
Got your pills?

519
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,660
Oh, is it time for the pills?

520
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,480
Medication time.

521
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,080
We're going to give you some pills.

522
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,120
What would you all like?

523
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:54,640
Hey, listen.

524
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,800
What's in Bob's head?

525
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,720
We've got them this time.

526
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,980
If you're not too shy.

527
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,820
Oh, there we go.

528
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,940
Friends, these are pure Bob's head.

529
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,760
Take a good look.

530
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,320
Dare you indulge in the commute?

531
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,180
Have you had your medication?

532
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,260
Because now I want mine.

533
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:23,380
Because it's medication time.

534
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,720
The Church of the Subgenius is not responsible for their behavior.

535
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,500
It's medication time.

536
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,820
We are not responsible for any possible brain damage.

537
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,380
It's just part of the satire.

538
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,660
You know?

539
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,580
Are those 75 people in the...

540
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,580
Illinois home for the mentally ill?

541
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,220
That's just part of the joke.

542
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,520
Medication time!

543
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,900
It's medication time.

544
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,520
The schizophrenia?

545
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,240
That's just part of the takeoff on religion, folks.

546
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:00,020
It's a perfectly legitimate part of an artistic statement.

547
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,620
Medication time.

548
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:03,660


549
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,900
This is the best pill.

550
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,620
Have a pill.

551
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,760
That was your dosage number one, friends.

552
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,400
It's quarter of nine.

553
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,640
That was dosage number one.

554
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,720
It's medication.

555
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,820
We'll have dosage number two coming up fairly shortly.

556
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,360
You'll need dosage number two to counter effect dosage number one.

557
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,200
Come on, have another pill on me.

558
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,440
Oh, by the way, don't take the ones with the little fish hooks inside.

559
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:37,600
I'm not going to.

560
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:37,600


561
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:37,600


562
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:37,600


563
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,860
Those are just a joke.

564
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,120
Medication time.

565
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,200
The ones with the broken glass aren't from us.

566
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,980
How many here would say that they are cognizant or familiar with the main teachings of Bob Dobbs?

567
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,600
Raise your hand.

568
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,240
Let me see your gun.

569
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,120
About half at least.

570
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:58,560
Okay.

571
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,260
Well, the rest of you, you know, just...

572
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,880
Well, if you didn't get your pill, there's still a few left up here.

573
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,580
And like I say, dosage.

574
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,420
Dosage number two will be coming up.

575
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:16,220
If you got dosage number one, don't miss dosage number two.

576
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,560
Helpful hint there, kids.

577
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,320
Oh, well, just don't take dosage number two and you'll find out.

578
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,980
Now, we have doled out these pills in the sacred communion.

579
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,380
You know, you're taking a bit of the brain of Bob.

580
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,400
And I've had people come up to me after the show going,

581
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,220
Yeah, man.

582
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,560
I got off, dude.

583
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,780
What was that?

584
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,500
Come on, tell me, because I'm like flying.

585
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,280
And friends, all it is is the word.

586
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,700
It's just the word is all it is.

587
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,600
It's all you need.

588
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,300
Take it all off, baby.

589
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,940
Now, I'm tempted...

590
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,380
Oh, Jesus.

591
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,860
It's time for the second dosage.

592
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,220
All right, dear friends.

593
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,580
I'm going to dole out these myself.

594
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,400
And you really do want to stick these in your mouth,

595
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,160
but you'll have to peel them out of the...

596
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,600
the lead-lined foil first.

597
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,520
Let's see if this will come over here.

598
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,080
Now, friends.

599
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,940
All right, now, okay.

600
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,480
Anybody...

601
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,180
There may be some of you here who didn't get the first dosage earlier in the evening.

602
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,420
That's all right.

603
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,580
The second dosage will do you good.

604
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,800
Now, is the camera person ready?

605
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,400
Because we want to be able to see...

606
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,960
Oh, can you turn on the house lights up so we can see?

607
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,380
I want to be able to see.

608
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,620
I want to see the faces of these people when they put the pills in their mouths.

609
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:42,940
Okay.

610
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,020
There's going to be a lot of them.

611
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,080
No need to crush.

612
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,660
Oh, look.

613
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:53,760
A little child is crushed horribly in the stampede for the great pills.

614
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,140
Now, check all over the floor.

615
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,760
The little pieces of paper don't count.

616
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,640
And whoa!

617
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,600
Whoa!

618
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:02,900
God.

619
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,020
Anybody of you who got a lemon?

620
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,620
They're the best.

621
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,340
Whoa!

622
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,800
Because that's what we're doing, friends.

623
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,360
We're just trying to give you an excuse.

624
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,680
As of this moment, you can do anything you feel like doing.

625
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,880
Could I take another pill?

626
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,300
Take another pill.

627
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,040
Have you another damn pill, Dave?

628
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,760
You can have all the pills, but...

629
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,460
All the pills you want.

630
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,340
Take another pill.

631
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,000
It'll cure your ill.

632
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,380
Take another pill.

633
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,560
It'll cure your ill.

634
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:49,560


635
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,380
Take another pill.

636
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,440
Take another pill.

637
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,980
Your problems will be nil.

638
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,660
Take another pill.

639
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,980
It'll make you want to kill.

640
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,900
Take another pill.

641
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,100
Leave it on the window sill.

642
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,060
And take another pill.

643
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,620
Put your mind through rototill.

644
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,400
Take another pill.

645
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,960
Just throw it on the grill, my friend.

646
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,640
Take another pill.

647
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,800
Fall down like Jack and Jill.

648
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,840
Take another pill.

649
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,980
Vomit will start to spill.

650
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,160
Take another pill.

651
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,040
Hey, bungalow bill.

652
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,140
Take another pill.

653
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,160
We'll brew it up in a still.

654
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,280
Take another pill.

655
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,060
You won't be happy until...

656
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,480
Take another pill.

657
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,260
You'll be the essence of evil.

658
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,540
Take another pill.

659
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,340
You'll have to have a refill.

660
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,640
Take another pill.

661
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,420
Less pills are unacceptable.

662
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,720
Take another pill.

663
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,880
The concept of less pills would be impossible.

664
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,840
Take another pill.

665
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,860
This is not a drill.

666
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,880
Take another pill.

667
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,200
You'll be pickled like a dill.

668
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,940
Take another pill.

669
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,480
You'll feel just like roadkill.

670
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,100
Take another pill.

671
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,220
Yo, yo.

672
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:05,500
Yo, yo.

673
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:05,980
Chill.

674
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,240
Take another pill.

675
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,840
Walk through the daffodil.

676
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,300
Take another pill.

677
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,800
You'll be spouting gills.

678
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,340
Take another pill.

679
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,200
It's a thrill.

680
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,360
Take another pill.

681
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,600
When you've been feeling run through the mill.

682
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,420
Take another pill.

683
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,300
And you'll end up on Boot Hill.

684
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,460
Take another pill.

685
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,100
Whales take them with their krill.

686
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,540
Take another pill.

687
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,720
And that's...

688
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,680
Take another pill.

689
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,120
Do we do this still?

690
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,660
Take another pill.

691
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,380
Take another pill, friends. Just go ahead.

692
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,660
Take another pill.

693
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,020
You know, what harm's it gonna do ya?

694
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,640
Take another pill.

695
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:51,680
Like Bob said, too much is always better than not enough.

696
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,740
Take another pill.

697
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,540
Oh, you get words to live by. Go ahead. Do what Bob said.

698
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,780
Take another pill.

699
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,040
Yeah.

700
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,860
Take another pill.

701
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,180
Oh, that reminds me. I missed my pill.

702
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,860
Take another pill.

703
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,640
I need to... I need to... Do you have any more than pills?

704
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,920
Take another pill.

705
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,780
Hey, now Dave, I know that you had another pill.

706
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,880
Take another pill.

707
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,820
You had a half of one of those throw up on the radio errs.

708
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,120
Take another pill.

709
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,040
Didn't you?

710
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,820
Yeah, I got a few of them left.

711
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,720
Didn't you have one of those imagined I heard weird stuff over the radio errs?

712
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,480
Yeah.

713
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,620
Shaped like a radio demon.

714
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,040
Take another pill.

715
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,420
It was like a white cross, but it was a radio demon.

716
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,200
Did you ever do one of those screamers?

717
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,940
Yeah.

718
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,680
Did you ever do screamers and laughers, man?

719
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:37,880
Yeah.

720
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,980
Did you ever run up some screamers and laughers?

721
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,520
Yeah, it's like hollow bacon. No, it's not.

722
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,200
Well, they're like the bad gut splitters.

723
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,920
What do you... They just make you laugh?

724
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:50,780
Well, yeah.

725
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,860
Well, you know, normally they're for asthma,

726
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,020
but when you melt them down and mix them with Aunt Jemima's syrup,

727
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,440
it gets you off.

728
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:57,720
Oh, that's delightful.

729
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,080
Like the remagnetized Palmer head.

730
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,180
It sounds like a good idea.

731
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:05,840
I like it a little.

732
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,420
Janer used to do this

733
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,480
demagnetized Palmer head,

734
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,760
but it would like degauss his aura

735
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,100
so that he couldn't remember

736
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,700
the words to the song or anything.

737
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,680
He'd just have to make them up as he went along,

738
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,920
which was like the lowest form

739
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,680
of entertainment.

740
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,640
But that was all we had to provide

741
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,400
for Dave out there in that little space capsule.

742
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,640
Yeah, well, I'm feeling kind of degaussed now.

743
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,820
I'd like to take a few of them pills

744
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,600
instead of just talking about it all night.

745
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,160
Sorry, the tape's not working.

746
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,460
The tapes have all been erased, Dave.

747
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,940
Oh, no, no, no.

748
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,380
Remember, you put your CDs in the microwave

749
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,760
just to see the pretty colors.

750
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:44,360
No, no, no, no, that one's chemical.

751
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,060
Yeah, you know,

752
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,280
all I do is I'll just imagine

753
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,260
I'm taking pills.

754
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,440
Take another pill.

755
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,180
Ah, ah, ah.

756
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,280
Take another pill.

757
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,320
Take another pill.

758
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,300
Take another pill.

759
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,360
Take another pill.

760
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,400
Whales eat them with their krill.

761
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,900
Whales eat them with their krill.

762
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,320
Here's your bitch, one more!

763
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,380
Here's your bitch, one more!

764
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,060
Hey, I came up with all those words

765
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,760
that rhyme with pill all by myself

766
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,280
just now. Just now, why?

767
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,180
Yeah, you did that all by your schnaff.

768
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,640
Yeah, because I'm in that church of the sub-gene pool.

769
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,260
I missed part of it on my tape.

770
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,180
I had to turn my tape over. How are everyone else's tapes?

771
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,100
It pre-drills, Cranstrip.

772
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,820
But I've been recording my whole show,

773
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,200
so my tape is different.

774
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,720
Okay, just remember those things.

775
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,400
The logistics of doing this radio program

776
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,380
are phenomenal.

777
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,400
I'm gonna go check my tape.

778
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,980
You're listening to WCSB.

779
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,860
I squeaked it in there earlier, but I'll give you

780
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,360
a nice, clear, defined one right now.

781
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,160
WCSB Cleveland, and special guests in tonight

782
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,440
with Einstein Secret Orchestra.

783
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,800
The full complement.

784
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,340
Yeah.

785
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,380
So why don't I hook you up with the microphone

786
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,240
here and let you actually

787
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,460
listen to yourself.

788
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,880
Listening to yourself.

789
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,640
Spouting on the radio, listening to yourself.

790
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,180
Ah, yes, brothers and sisters.

791
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,860
My name is Dr. Legume.

792
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,240
I'm one of the real in-person preachers

793
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,320
of the church of the sub-genius.

794
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,020
I don't hide behind the radio waves too terribly much.

795
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,920
And I'm here to talk to you tonight about

796
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:33,880
heroes.

797
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,080
Yes, heroes.

798
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,420
I seen today on the news.

799
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,760
I was sitting at home watching television

800
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,400
and I saw this hero on TV.

801
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,120
This guy who got shot down over Bosnia.

802
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,300
And they came in and rescued him,

803
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,660
and he was a real hero.

804
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,140
Oh yeah, you can hear them choppers coming in

805
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:50,900
to pick him up now.

806
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,240
The gunfire.

807
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:56,300
Oh yes, the evil empire that's creeping up

808
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,060
behind him ready to take his patriotic American life

809
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:03,220
and snuff it out like such a pitiful little candle

810
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,860
in a hurricane.

811
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,880
Oh yes, he was a great hero.

812
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,020
He wasn't expecting to be shot down or anything.

813
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,080
No, he wasn't expecting to be shot down.

814
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,040
But he was.

815
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,760
And he managed to hide out.

816
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,120
You know, he ran off into the forest.

817
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,860
Tried to protect his sorry butt for about 10 days.

818
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,000
And he sat out there eating bugs and everything.

819
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,120
But does that really make him a hero?

820
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,200
Just because he got shot down and ran like hell?

821
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,160
I mean, he's a hero.

822
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,160


823
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,160


824
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,160


825
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,160


826
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,680
I mean, wouldn't anybody else do it in the same situation?

827
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,900
I mean, what makes him a hero?

828
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,380
I mean, he was only doing his job.

829
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,620
Hell, half the people in Philadelphia risk getting shot by somebody

830
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,120
just for doing their job.

831
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,160
But you don't see them on TV.

832
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:55,400
And oh, he got on there with his fake-ass written down speech

833
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,080
that they had prepared for him that sounded so patriotic.

834
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,160
And it was all just a big cover.

835
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,980
Oh yeah, they make it sound like one of those great World War II gigs

836
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,160
where the hero comes up and says,

837
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:05,860
I'm just marching home.

838
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,200
But the fact is, it's all just a big cover-up

839
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,680
to make you feel good about America

840
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,800
so that you won't feel so terribly bad about the government

841
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,180
when they send the rest of the soldiers in there

842
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,140
to start shooting at the other people and blowing them up.

843
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,580
And who really gives a damn what's going on in Bosnia anyway?

844
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,280
I mean, let them all die.

845
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,340
So they blew up Oklahoma. I don't care.

846
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,860
Hell, I could still get a pizza in 30 minutes or less if I want one.

847
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,780
And my cable TV wasn't cut out.

848
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,700
As a matter of fact, hell, it gave me something good to watch

849
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,440
for a couple hours.

850
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,740
You know, I kind of got tired of seeing that same old footage

851
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:42,360
of somebody handing somebody's stupid dead child around.

852
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,220
Oh yeah.

853
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,960
But it's all just a big conspiracy.

854
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,320
It's a conspiracy to make you think that everything's okay.

855
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,160
Oh yes, brothers and sisters.

856
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,220
It's all just a big conspiracy.

857
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,380
They lie to you. They cheat.

858
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,360
They fool you into thinking that you're something that you're not.

859
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,060
They take all your money out of your paychecks.

860
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,580
Oh yes.

861
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,300
And the con has ruined so many lives.

862
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,000
It's surprising.

863
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:10,720
It hasn't been snuffed out yet by an uprising of the American people.

864
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,780
Put on your jackboots.

865
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,520
Load up your shotguns, brothers and sisters.

866
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,560
Let's go out and take back what's ours.

867
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,500
Oh yes, the con tried to take me.

868
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,380
They tried to ruin my life.

869
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,380
Oh yes, they threw me into a damp prison.

870
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,760
With no trial.

871
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,280
With no lawyers.

872
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,660
And they fed me nothing but gruel and worms and bugs.

873
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,700
But I escaped.

874
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,300
Yes.

875
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,460
No, no, that's fake gruel, isn't it?

876
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,280
Oh yes.

877
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,080
But no matter how down and out I got,

878
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,380
even when I had to live in a dumpster and hide from the police,

879
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,420
there was always that little bit of hope that came from Bob.

880
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,920
Oh yes, Bob saved me.

881
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,660
One day I found one of them subgenius pamphlets in that dumpster.

882
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,220
And I read about it and I said, well, I gotta write to this address.

883
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,020
I gotta go out and stick up a liquor store with my knife and try to get up enough money to get a stamp.

884
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,840
Just to send for that religious pamphlet.

885
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,060
That Church of the Subgenius pamphlet.

886
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,020
Oh yes.

887
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:12,400
And when I got it, my life was turned around, brothers and sisters.

888
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,880
My life was turned around.

889
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,460
I became a warrior for Rotan.

890
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,580
Oh yes.

891
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,640
I cast off my shackles.

892
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,440
I have cast off my shackles.

893
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,300
And Bob took good care of me.

894
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,700
Oh yes, he took good care of me.

895
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,640
He set me up with the finest in liquor and women.

896
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,440
And he gave me a bright red Jaguar.

897
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,000
And even though I drove it into a church,

898
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,100
I was very weary.

899
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,340
There was a dozen more waiting for me when I got home.

900
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,580
Oh yes.

901
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,780
Oh yes, and all I had to do was fight the conspiracy.

902
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,280
And fight them I do.

903
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,180
And fight them I will.

904
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,060
And fight them I shall.

905
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,420
I'll fight them in the alleys.

906
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,500
I'll fight them in the streets.

907
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,840
Oh, I'll fight them in the churches.

908
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,820
Oh yes.

909
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,480
But I don't have to fight them for much longer.

910
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,800
Just another two or three more years until the exorcists come on July 5th, 1998 at 7 AM.

911
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,380
Oh yes.

912
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,300
Then.

913
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,620
The tide shall be turned.

914
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:05,620


915
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,280
We shall be as naked fists of fury.

916
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,900
We, the persecuted subgeniuses,

917
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,100
shall rise up

918
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,240
and it will be

919
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,280
as a great wave

920
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,920
shall wash over the earth.

921
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,940
A wave of evil blood

922
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,480
shall wash over the earth.

923
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,700
And it shall wash the conspiracy

924
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,940
and its Christian dukes

925
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,740
into the lake of fire.

926
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:31,800
into the lake of fire.

927
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,540
Oh yes, brothers and sisters.

928
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,120
Oh yes.

929
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,240
The lake of fire.

930
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,080
The fox go when he dies.

931
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,500
Oh yes.

932
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,360
And after 1998 you too will be able to fight the evil conspiracy.

933
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,740
Oh yes.

934
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,040
You will be up there in the saucers with the energy weapons

935
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,380
blasting down on this

936
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,360
worthless husk of a planet.

937
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,780
Oh yes. And then you will have your own planet.

938
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,180
And you will be able to design it as you will.

939
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,200
I have my planet

940
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,240
already designed.

941
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,940
Oh yes. It will be covered with a layer of broken glass.

942
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,820
And everyone will weigh 300 pounds.

943
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,380
And they will sweat profusely

944
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,880
because it will be 120 degrees

945
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,720
all the time.

946
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,520
And they will sweat.

947
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,180
And they won't have any clothes

948
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,520
to protect them from the sun.

949
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,920
And they will never be able to sit down.

950
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,160
You're talking about Philadelphia, right?

951
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,680
Actually, I'm talking about Trenton, New Jersey.

952
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,240
Oh yes.

953
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,280
But if you want to get in on any of this

954
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,780
all you have to do is write a letter

955
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:31,780


956
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,740
and write for information from the Church of the Subgenius

957
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,100
at P.O. Box

958
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:39,620
140306

959
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,340
in Dallas, Texas

960
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,120
75214

961
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,720
That's right, brothers and sisters.

962
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:46,660
Because

963
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,300
you have to

964
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,440
you have

965
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,700
you have

966
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,160
to join the Church of the Subgenius.

967
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,840
That is all you need to do to be saved.

968
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,940
Oh yes. Oh yes.

969
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,800
All you need is

970
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,960
your Subgenius membership card.

971
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,640
Because if you're not

972
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,080
on the train, brothers and sisters

973
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,680
you're going to be

974
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,940
tied to the tracks.

975
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,220
Oh yes.

976
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,120
Some have to be the chainsaw,

977
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,380
others the tree.

978
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,940
And the harvest cometh, brothers and sisters.

979
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:17,820
There are many signs.

980
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,140
There are many signs that Bob's will is beginning to take over this planet.

981
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,460
Oh yes.

982
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,560
Oh yes. Billy Graham is bleeding

983
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,420
from the rectum, brothers and sisters.

984
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,480
That proves that there is

985
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,160
Bob's justice here on this planet.

986
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,460
That proves it!

987
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,680
Bob sold it to me.

988
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,700
I smoked it.

989
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,200
That proves it. Praise Bob.

990
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,760
He comes by his hatin' fair and square.

991
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,620
See, this is my circle. I'm in my circle.

992
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,560
I mean, you can kill me, you can

993
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,460
crucify me, but that circle's still here.

994
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,560
I mean, as long as you're not in my circle,

995
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,460
you're not playing my game. But once you get in my circle,

996
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,260
you're playing my game, because it's my circle.

997
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,860
I thought we were safe when we were inside the circle.

998
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,960
But that's a different circle.

999
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,780
You can kill me, you can crucify me,

1000
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,560
but that circle's always gonna be there.

1001
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,900
That's my circle. That's the protection circle.

1002
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,760
I never killed anyone. Anyone who knows anything

1003
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,200
about it knows that I never killed anyone.

1004
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,360
They just happened to die in your presence.

1005
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,900
Wouldn't they be dead if it wasn't for you?

1006
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:12,860
If it wasn't for me, nothing would exist.

1007
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,820
I did not design the bullet.

1008
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,340
I did not design the gun.

1009
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,700
I did not even aim the gun. I was just

1010
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,620
holding the gun. And it was the

1011
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,900
fear of that person that made my finger tremble

1012
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,740
in such a manner that the gun

1013
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,840
accidentally exploded, and they happened to

1014
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,540
stand in front of the bullet. They psychically willed me to kill them.

1015
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,900
But Charlie, you went in and tied up

1016
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,860
the LaBiancas, then you went out to the car

1017
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,940
and told the girls to go in and kill them.

1018
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:37,060
Why is that?

1019
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,780
I walk the line.

1020
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,500
I keep a close watch on this

1021
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,660
heart of mine. I walk

1022
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:44,260
the line.

1023
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,320
Now Charlie,

1024
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,480
there are people out there who think you're a god.

1025
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,140
What is your answer to this?

1026
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,100
I am. They're right.

1027
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:55,700
But there must be something

1028
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,500
deeper than just that, because

1029
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,780
it's the way that you look at me with those eyes

1030
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,760
is there's something commanding.

1031
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,700
You can't say that you didn't tell them to kill, because I look

1032
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,020
in your eyes and I see death emanating from them.

1033
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,840
Jane, are you implying that actually

1034
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,800
Manson was inspired by

1035
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,500
a Johnny Cash record and not

1036
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,760
the Beatles' White Album? He went down in

1037
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,520
a ring of fire. Well, let's see.

1038
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,460
Was I responsible?

1039
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,720
Did I order the slayings of the LaBiancas?

1040
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,700
Let's see. Knight to King 3?

1041
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,000
I think I'll pass on that right now.

1042
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,040
That was the circle.

1043
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,780
That was the circle in which

1044
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,780
Manson was referring to. The ring of fire.

1045
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,760
Oh, you dealt the hand.

1046
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:32,720
The prosecution dealt the hand.

1047
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,660
Let's see what the hand is here.

1048
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,220
Okay, let's see. You've got your hippie cult leader card.

1049
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,700
What's a hippie cult leader?

1050
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,300
Okay, well, okay. Could that be Reverend Stang?

1051
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,480
He has long hair.

1052
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,020
Is anyone accusing him of killing the LaBiancas?

1053
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,380
No. Why is that?

1054
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,220
No. Now we're looking at things

1055
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,960
at a different angle, a new perspective here.

1056
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,380
Do I see another conspiracy?

1057
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:54,300
Could be.

1058
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,560
Who's passing the cards out?

1059
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,780
Is it Charles Manson? No, Charles Manson's

1060
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,020
in prison. Explain that, huh?

1061
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:03,820
With Tom Snyder. With Tom Snyder, yes.

1062
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:06,540
Tom Snyder. Did Tom Snyder ask for the interview

1063
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,440
with Charles Manson?

1064
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,160
Or did Charles Manson ask for the interview

1065
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:10,880
with Tom Snyder? Eddie knows what I'm talking about.

1066
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,820
We were in New York City. I used to be the anchor at KNBC.

1067
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,220
We got a little

1068
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,900
liverwurst sandwich over there.

1069
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,060
It was that little delicatessen

1070
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,180
over on 2nd Street.

1071
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,080
Eddie knows what I'm talking about.

1072
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,900
Come on, Charlie.

1073
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,200
Let's get serious about this.

1074
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,480
We need to answer some questions here because

1075
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,820
there's a lot of people out there that just...

1076
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,740
There's a guy off camera that no one ever knows who I'm talking about.

1077
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,580
They need to make sense of these murders, Charlie.

1078
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,660
I just keep laughing and smoking cigarettes and making

1079
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,860
off-camera references.

1080
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,580
Charlie, there's nothing funny about

1081
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,140
the murder and

1082
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,640
vivisection of so many people that

1083
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,800
at your orders... Oh, there's some things funny

1084
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,320
about it.

1085
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,140
I can think of maybe two or three.

1086
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,120
You're right, there's not a lot funny about it.

1087
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,840
I can think of some things that are funny.

1088
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,740
I think only a mass murder is so

1089
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,160
funny.

1090
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,940
You know, there's been...

1091
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,160
Humor's been done about it for the past

1092
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,840
15, 20 years.

1093
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,880
It's been milking the same Tate-LaBianca

1094
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,480
routine.

1095
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,020
When did you ever get new writers?

1096
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:15,400
Yeah, who cares anyway?

1097
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,660
Who cares about Charles Manson? Who cares about

1098
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,080
the Tate-LaBianca? Who cares if they blow up Oklahoma City?

1099
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,740
I can still get on the phone right now

1100
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,260
and have a pizza in 30 minutes or less.

1101
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,380
And I can still get my cable TV nice and clear.

1102
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,500
So who gives a damn if they blow up the entire

1103
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,960
middle section of the country?

1104
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,500
Who cares anyway?

1105
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,220
Get some new writers. We've heard the one about the Tate-LaBianca

1106
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:34,720
slings.

1107
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,620
Now I'm not personally offended by this swastika that you have carved

1108
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,160
in your forehead.

1109
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,440
But I think that there are some people out there in our listening

1110
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,580
audience that might take some exception to this.

1111
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,700
Uh, somehow

1112
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,420
I feel that's not just a runic symbol.

1113
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,720
I think there's a statement there.

1114
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,720
What is the statement you are trying to intone

1115
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,620
in a manner which can be explained

1116
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,340
on the radio without offending too many of us?

1117
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,000
And I don't want any of this pat answer.

1118
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,600
I mean, I want the motive behind the motive.

1119
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,600
I didn't write the music.

1120
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,020
It's not my conspiracy.

1121
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,520
I didn't invent slack.

1122
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,580
You hear slack, you hear about Bob every day.

1123
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,420
Only you hear the word Bob every day.

1124
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,700
Only you're too deaf, dumb, and blind to understand it.

1125
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,200
The Bobbies come at you with guns and knives and clip art.

1126
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,400
Because that's what you deserve.

1127
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,900
Freeform Radio.

1128
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:23,440
The most creative art form in human history.

1129
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,980
I'm one of the least satisfying sexual acts ever created.

1130
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:26,980


1131
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:26,980


1132
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,620
That's for damn sure.

1133
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,020
It doesn't do what they said it was gonna do.

1134
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,100
Oh yeah, you...

1135
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,640
Oh yeah, the famous Freeform Radio.

1136
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:37,620
It's like Negative Land and Over the Edge guys

1137
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,980
and Puzzling Evidencers

1138
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,060
and that, uh,

1139
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,260
Lonesome Space Dave show

1140
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,200
and all them, them, uh,

1141
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,820
that, that slack oil

1142
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,040
traveling radio show

1143
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,060
and so forth. Oh yeah.

1144
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,240
Oh yeah. The groupies.

1145
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,560
Mm-hmm. The money.

1146
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:55,240
Oh yeah.

1147
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,700
The, the, the press parties

1148
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,420
with the CD releases.

1149
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:02,820
Oh yeah. The baked beans.

1150
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,220
The ham hocks.

1151
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:07,260
The cans of pepper. The sleepless nights.

1152
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,840
The pills, of course.

1153
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,300
Well, there are the pills.

1154
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,980
The foolish sideways glances at the wrong waitress.

1155
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,000
Mm-hmm.

1156
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,440
The fungal diseases.

1157
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,060
Mm-hmm.

1158
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,480
Oh yeah, the fungal diseases.

1159
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,680
Mm-hmm.

1160
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:25,300
Mm-hmm.

1161
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:25,900
Mm-hmm.

1162
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:27,820
Mm-hmm.

1163
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,120
Mm-hmm.

1164
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,980
Mm-hmm.

1165
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,120
Mm-hmm.

1166
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,500
Mm-hmm.

1167
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:42,980
Mm-hmm.

1168
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,980
Mm-hmm.

1169
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:45,700
Mm-hmm.

1170
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:46,840
Mm-hmm.

1171
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:46,860
Mm-hmm.

1172
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:47,420
Mm-hmm.

1173
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:51,160
Yeah, it was a stormy night in Laredo.

1174
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,720
Yeah, it was a stormy night in Laredo.

1175
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,980
I was, I'd been in the saloon

1176
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,980
preaching.

1177
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,820
Preaching to the drunkards.

1178
00:51:59,060 --> 00:51:59,440
Preaching to the drunkards.

1179
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,520
Back around 1875

1180
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,780
it was, I think.

1181
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:07,000
Well, I'd had a few whiskies in the course

1182
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,340
of my sermonizing, and

1183
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,580
as I crawled out underneath

1184
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,760
the saloon doors

1185
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,620
and down into the three foot

1186
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,640
deep mud of the streets

1187
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,800
of Laredo,

1188
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,420
crawling amongst the

1189
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,700
horse offal in the muddy

1190
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,460
streets, what?

1191
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:26,080
I suddenly felt a chill

1192
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:26,940
and I looked up,

1193
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,120
and there in the middle of the night,

1194
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,560
Bob was riding into town.

1195
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,640
Bob was riding into town.

1196
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,060
Bob was riding into town.

1197
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:38,420
Yes, sir.

1198
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:38,640
Yes, sir.

1199
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,140
My Bob, my Bob had rode into town

1200
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,940
and here I was, a humble,

1201
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,560
subgenius preacher,

1202
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,840
crawling through the gutter,

1203
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,680
looking up at my Bob

1204
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,760
on his mighty white stallion

1205
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,440
with his huge white saloon.

1206
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,160
And I saw that Stetson hat

1207
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,040
and that pipe just a-smoking

1208
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,200
in the pouring rain.

1209
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,120
Oh, yes, and I, and of course

1210
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,260
I knew what I had to do.

1211
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,660
I had to lick Bob's boots,

1212
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:05,700
my friend.

1213
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:09,420
Ah, yes, sir.

1214
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,600
You know, because Bob's my savior,

1215
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,460
my short-duration personal savior,

1216
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:14,700
but he's my savior nonetheless.

1217
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,340
And I love Bob, and I,

1218
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:17,940
and you know when Bob rides by,

1219
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,860
you have to assuage his feet

1220
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,580
with salve and ointments,

1221
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,740
and lick the boots,

1222
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:26,520
the boots of Bob.

1223
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,760
You gotta be a Bob boot kisser.

1224
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,460
You gotta kiss that old leathery boot

1225
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,760
hanging off Bob's behind.

1226
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,060
You gotta work them boots,

1227
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:37,960
actually, friends.

1228
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,060
You know it doesn't matter

1229
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,460
if Bob's been walking through the prairie

1230
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,100
through all them buffalo chips,

1231
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,680
cow pies,

1232
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,560
pasture pastries,

1233
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,020
meadow muffins,

1234
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:50,980
or if Bob's been squishing

1235
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,800
through the streets in his boots,

1236
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:57,140
the streets of an 1875 western town

1237
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:00,060
with open sewage running through the mud.

1238
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,440
Friends,

1239
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,900
if you're a preacher and Bob rides into town,

1240
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,260
you gotta get to licking them boots,

1241
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,040
and that's what I did.

1242
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,800
I licked, and I licked, and I licked.

1243
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:10,920
I was working them boots.

1244
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,320
I was kissing Bob's boot cheeks.

1245
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,160
And I was thinking,

1246
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,080
I'm working so hard for slack.

1247
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,080
Won't Bob be proud of me?

1248
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,120
Won't he meet

1249
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,800
the green fire?

1250
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,160
And lick the sun?

1251
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,980
Or a young cow

1252
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,680
born in New Orleans?

1253
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,240
Yeah, won't Bob be proud of me?

1254
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,020
So I was licking and grinning.

1255
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,120
And pretty soon I was picking

1256
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,860
and grinning, picking dead

1257
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,440
chicken skin off my

1258
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,640
mouth because, friends,

1259
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,200
when you work too hard to

1260
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,500
kiss Bob's boots and cheeks,

1261
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,020
Whoa.

1262
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,120
you know, your lips get more chapped

1263
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,720
than your chaps.

1264
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,040
And I've got some leathery old chaps,

1265
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,220
and I've got a leathery old,

1266
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,680
creaky old saddle.

1267
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,300
But what was creakier and chappier

1268
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,440
than that was my boot lips, friends.

1269
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,040
I had saddle sores from kissing

1270
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:03,900
Bob's boot.

1271
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,080
I had hoof and mouth disease.

1272
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:06,920
For I couldn't preach.

1273
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,140
I could no more preach, my friends,

1274
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,440
after licking Bob's boots than,

1275
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,000
it was like I had a creaking

1276
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,020
leather beak for a mouth.

1277
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,320
I'd try to smile

1278
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,720
and pleasure at Bob,

1279
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,800
and then my lips would just crack open

1280
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,760
and bleed. It was like having

1281
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,880
a turtle shell for, or like a beak

1282
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,300
for a mouth.

1283
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,560
And I'd have to wash it, borscht,

1284
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,460
with my saddle soap.

1285
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,620
I'd pull out that lemon oil saddle

1286
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,660
soap, rub them down

1287
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,240
real good.

1288
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,500
But, friends,

1289
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,160
I had worked

1290
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,300
too hard for slack, and

1291
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,680
Bob wasn't proud of me. He put his

1292
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,240
boots, he looked at his boots, he said,

1293
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,280
they're real shiny, boy.

1294
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,980
And he rode away and left me with the viruses

1295
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,540
and the funguses growing

1296
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,640
deeper and deeper into my flesh.

1297
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,120
So beat

1298
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,660
the drums slowly and play

1299
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,440
the pipes lowly.

1300
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:05,120
Play the dead marches

1301
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,940
you carry me along.

1302
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,300
Take me to

1303
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,540
the great valley and

1304
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,540
lay the sun over me.

1305
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,080
For I'm a dumb cowboy.

1306
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,300
I know I've done wrong.

1307
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,860
But praise Bob, my friends!

1308
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,640
I was laying there with my

1309
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,040
sores and the

1310
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,700
blood cracking, leaking off of my

1311
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,000
cracked up mouth.

1312
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:28,380
And, friends, I knew what I had to do.

1313
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,580
I knew what I had to do. I had to slack

1314
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,740
off. And I did it right there in the

1315
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,860
middle of the street. Right in the street.

1316
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,660
I walked off my chaps

1317
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,620
and I slacked off right there in front of

1318
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,620
everybody. And, friends, the dead skin

1319
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,820
sloughed off.

1320
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,600
Yes, my friends, I had kissed

1321
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,360
Bob's boots. I had

1322
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,580
licked Bob's boots. And I had been

1323
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,520
infected by Bob's boots.

1324
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,540
And after I finished doing that,

1325
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,760
I killed Bob there. I shot him

1326
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,600
in the back. I pulled out my six gun.

1327
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,780
I shot my saber in the back.

1328
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,800
And I slacked off right in front of

1329
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,860
him. And, friends, I

1330
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,520
called for them face raping

1331
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,720
bats. I stood there in the thundering

1332
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,660
streets and I pulled

1333
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,580
on my bat call. And along

1334
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,760
came that flock of bats, my friends.

1335
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,660
Why, in no time at all, I was

1336
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,400
sucking down that antidote sperm

1337
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,480
pudding and I had

1338
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,080
slack.

1339
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,860
Slowly, I play the

1340
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,580
play slowly. Play

1341
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,620
the dead march as you

1342
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:28,680
carry me along. Take

1343
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,400
me to the green

1344
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,600
valley and lay the

1345
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,700
sod oar before I'm

1346
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,600
a dumb cowboy and

1347
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,160
I know I've done wrong.

1348
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,080
The

1349
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,200
old

1350
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:04,920
father

1351
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:04,920


1352
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:04,920


1353
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:04,920


1354
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,420
And now

1355
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:11,220
you know, dear friends,

1356
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,080
why this show was so

1357
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:15,320
late for so long. It was

1358
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,340
the boot lips. And that

1359
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:19,160
little last bit there was,

1360
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,660
of course, not

1361
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:30,060
needless to say, from Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz Smith on the WCSB in Cleveland show,

1362
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,320
ESO Radio.

1363
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:38,520
Einstein's Secret Orchestra there just before the Cleveland revival.

1364
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:46,560
We also heard quite a bit from Suzy the Floozy and Reverend Microphone's Bob's Slack Time

1365
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:50,140
Funhouse show on WREK.

1366
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:56,100
In Atlanta, Georgia with St. Janer Hyperclete and Father Joe Mama.

1367
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:06,080
And prior to that, the amazing Dr. Legume rant about heroes on Pastor Craig's Philadelphia

1368
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:11,680
subgenius show on WKDU.

1369
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:18,920
And before that, some more ESO with that lovely old tune, Take Another Pill.

1370
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:20,040
And...

1371
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:30,340
Before that, the dosages and the pill dispensations from the Cleveland subgenius revival with

1372
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:33,640
Toth Wilder and his forms of insanity.

1373
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:40,380
Yes, my friends, there's been a lot down the pike tonight and there'll be a lot more down

1374
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:45,940
your pike if you'll just write for the free information from the Church of the Subgenius.

1375
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:49,960
If you're wondering what it's all about, and even if you're not,

1376
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,440
just go ahead and give us your address.

1377
00:59:54,620 --> 01:00:00,340
We love your address as much as you will love ours, which we're about to give here.

1378
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,180
Got that pencil ready?

1379
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,120
And here it is!

1380
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:05,760
Just write to Bob...

1381
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,260
Yeah, that same old name again.

1382
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:15,720
Bob at Post Office Box 140306.

1383
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:20,020
That's Box 140306 in Dallas.

1384
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:21,360
Texas.

1385
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:27,840
75214.

1386
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:35,460
That and a few billion other things are all you need to know.

1387
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:40,080
Yes, you can have knowledge.

1388
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:46,680
You can know Bob in the biblical sense.

1389
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,480
Because this is a religion.

1390
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:51,620
This is a faith.

1391
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,280
This is the one true faith.

1392
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,660
This is the one true faith.

1393
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:57,520
The one last hope for mutant kind.

1394
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:00,320
This church will come right on in your house honey.

1395
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:01,900
You send them a dollar ...

1396
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,920
This church will come and come and come again.

1397
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,840
Or a self-addressed...

1398
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:07,380
I don't see it.

1399
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:13,000
You gotta trust us, when you need a friend.

1400
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:18,420
To find us, you gotta look within.

1401
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:20,700
You gotta trust us.

1402
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:20,700


1403
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,100
you gotta trust us

1404
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,260
before you

1405
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,460
change the dust

1406
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:30,120
before you change the dust

1407
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,860
you gotta see it

1408
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,160
before you see it

1409
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,860
you gotta be it before you be it

1410
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,380
you gotta see it

1411
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:38,340
before you see it
