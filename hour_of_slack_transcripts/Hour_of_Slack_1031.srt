1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
On PR news in Washington on building bombs.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,080
President Bush gives companies too long to comply with new regulations.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,840
Experts estimate more than 40 million Americans are too frightened to come to his aid.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,120
Here's that PR spat.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,740
On Wall Street, 2-2-10-5-1-6-2-7-3.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,160
A strong earthquake has refused to dismiss monetary laundering charges against PR news in Washington.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,700
Can we ask some more questions now?

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,200
Did you know about the car almost hitting us?

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,000
Will we reach New York all right now?

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,400
Will it still take four hours?

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,080
Will we reach Columbus by tomorrow?

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,940
You're just a stupid piece of junk, aren't you?

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,080
Are we always going to live in St. Louis?

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,180
Are we going to live in the East?

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,320
Are we going to live in the West?

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,380
Are we going to live in this country?

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,580
Is there any way out?

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,320
Any way at all?

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,240
The Self-Genius Power of the White Tree.

20
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,080
Thank you.

21
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,600
We appreciate it.

22
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,900
Thank you.

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,360
Thank you.

24
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,120
The Self-Genius.

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,380
The Self-Genius.

26
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:49,560
The Self-Genius.

27
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,080
The Self-Genius Power of the White Tree.

28
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,760
The Self-Genius Power of the White Tree.

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,240
Praise God!

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,980
Praise God!

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,000
Praise God!

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,680
Praise God!

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,180
So relax, in your own delusion

34
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,960
Find a place to hide

35
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,260
And bridge your confusion

36
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,480
Save me

37
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,580
From the bludges of conspiracy

38
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,340
Save me

39
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,540
From the chains of time

40
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,240
Save me

41
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,160
From the men in black

42
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,440
The civets of genius

43
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,160
The sad, flat, brave God

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,980
Praise God!

45
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,920
Praise God!

46
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,740
Praise God!

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,780
Praise God!

48
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,560
Praise God!

49
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:07,960


50
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,420
Praise God!

51
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:11,540
Praise God!

52
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,620
Two, three, four

53
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,320
And let me hear you sing it!

54
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,160
Praise God!

55
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,080
Praise God!

56
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,920
Praise God!

57
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,180
Praise God!

58
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,640
Praise God!

59
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,360
Praise God!

60
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,680
And let me hear you sing it!

61
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,460
Praise God!

62
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,040
Praise God!

63
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,060
Praise God!

64
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,880
Praise God!

65
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,060


66
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,620
Praise God!

67
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,520
When I get to Venus, can I get a dog?

68
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,440
Dogs can't live on Venus.

69
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,480
When they roll on their backs, the pressure twists their guts up and kills them.

70
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,640
You remember my old dog?

71
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:22,920
Yeah.

72
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,840
I don't like Venus. Will you come get me?

73
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,380
Believe me, you'll like it.

74
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,760
What are you gonna do?

75
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,520
South America is where I'm going to go.

76
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,180
Don't you fear the Yetis in Rio?

77
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,220
No.

78
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,220
No.

79
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,660
No.

80
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,740
No! No! No! No!

81
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,680
Rio!

82
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,380
Did I say something I should not have?

83
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,320
No.

84
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,660
No.

85
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,440
No!

86
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,000
No!

87
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,400
No!

88
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,100
No!

89
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,580
No!

90
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:11,940
No!

91
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,200
No!

92
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,500
No!

93
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,020
No!

94
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,400
No!

95
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:13,680
No!

96
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:13,780
No!

97
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,020
No!

98
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,420
No!

99
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:14,780
No!

100
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,140
No!

101
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

102
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,400
What did your father give you?

103
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,880
If I can't walk it, I'll go down.

104
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,240
People. I mean, yeah, people, you know.

105
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,420
But not this, this is the damnedest thing I've ever heard of.

106
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,280
Who are the overlords of the UFO?

107
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,560
We.

108
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:09,920
We.

109
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,860
She's got no idea.

110
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:16,860


111
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,920
Big Bob's daddy.

112
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,600
Shazam.

113
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,160
The corporations themselves receive...

114
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,580
Corporate welfare.

115
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,660
Corporate television.

116
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,320
Corporate money.

117
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,160
They're corporate fascists, it's all true.

118
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,440
Can I get a free spa?

119
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,820
Free spa!

120
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,120
Yeah!

121
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:06,640
What's going on here?

122
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,020
We're just gonna have to get a free spa.

123
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,020


124
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,020


125
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,020


126
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,020


127
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,040
I don't know what this is, but it's just a train.

128
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,200
It's a train.

129
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,520
What?

130
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:12,520


131
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:12,520


132
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:12,520


133
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:12,520


134
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:12,520


135
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:12,520


136
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:12,520


137
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,560
Oh, my God.

138
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,080
Oh, my God.

139
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,860
I'm scared.

140
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:16,860


141
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:16,860


142
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:16,860


143
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,080
Bob!

144
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,760
Bob!

145
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,440
Bob!

146
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:46,100
That music we just heard was by Poo Water Towel.

147
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,100
That's actually yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

148
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,760
with hers truly, Princess We Are Doe.

149
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,780
In that case, she mostly did the catering.

150
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,280
The video of that one is on Video Google right now.

151
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:07,040
It's called Drum Bob Real Bob, actually is the name of that.

152
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,720
Our music in the background tonight, by the way,

153
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,920
is by Reverend Artemia Salina.

154
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,400
It's pretty messed up.

155
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,780
That messed up dialogue,

156
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,580
before the song there, Yeti Rio,

157
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,260
is from the movie American Astronaut,

158
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,460
directed by Corey McAbby.

159
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,740
He's involved with that band, The Billy Nair Show,

160
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,040
and we have more of their music coming up.

161
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,000
Before that, we heard the song Praise Bob

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,060
by The Walk-Ins from the Subgenius CD,

163
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,660
Hairs in Bob's Ears,

164
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,480
and of course, the cut-ups of that great cut-up,

165
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,760
Le Mer, Fernanda Nande, Le Mer,

166
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,100
brought us into this space,

167
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,440
this ear space,

168
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,060
in which we now find ourselves.

169
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,680
Oh.

170
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,620
Oh.

171
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,120
And what kind of a space is it

172
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,820
that's often determined by the incoming music?

173
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,260
Incoming?

174
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,140
Which, in this case,

175
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,800
could be frightening.

176
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,940
You know, your relationship with your god

177
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,620
can be frightening, can't it?

178
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,740
Yes, it's kind of trembling, isn't it?

179
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,340
Uh, sure.

180
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,740
Sometimes, you're praying to him,

181
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,480
and going, okay, I know he's gonna help me

182
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,780
win the lottery this time.

183
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,260
Other times, he's creeping up on you.

184
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,820
Hey, yes.

185
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,300
Jay, that's right.

186
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,580
Your god, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

187
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,740
is creeping up on you.

188
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,420
But he's just practicing,

189
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,620
because the conspiracy bugs,

190
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,180
they creep up on you, too.

191
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,680
You know which conspiracy bugs I'm talking about.

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,780
Pretty much everybody you don't like.

193
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,400
And there is hope.

194
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,000
There's a shining golden city

195
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,960
where the robots live

196
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,020
Beneath the central sun's eternal glare

197
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,080
And when the saucers come from space to massacre

198
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,840
The human race, I know that we'll find peace and safety there

199
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,740
Through the holes in the poles

200
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,720
We will flee

201
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,740
Sailing down to the lovely central sea

202
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,740
Leaving torture, death, and madness

203
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,800
For a land of joy and gladness

204
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,560
Within the hollow earth, we will be free

205
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,320
In atomic-powered go-karts, we will roam the land

206
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,200
While the aliens devour human slaves

207
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,520
They'll squirm beneath the master's boot

208
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,340
Or roam in packs in search of loot

209
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,880
While we will laugh to think that we were saved

210
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,720
Through the holes in the poles, we will flee

211
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:43,720


212
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,700
Through the holes in the poles, we will flee

213
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,640
Sailing down to the lovely central sea

214
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,560
Leaving torture, death, and madness

215
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,520
For a land of joy and gladness

216
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,220
Within the hollow earth, we will be free

217
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,220
We'll ride in flying submarines

218
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,860
Through air and through the sea

219
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,880
While the aliens destroy the works of man

220
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,640
When they leave our blasted world

221
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,020
At last we'll rise again without a past

222
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,520
To implement our splendid master plan

223
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,720
Through the holes in the poles, we will flee

224
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,360
Through the holes in the poles, we will flee

225
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,300
Sailing down to the lovely central sea

226
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,140
Leaving torture, death, and madness

227
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,120
For a land of joy and gladness

228
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,900
Within the hollow earth, we will be free

229
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,220
A wonderful old religious folk song there.

230
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,480
Holes in the Poles, friends, that is Nenslow,

231
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,440
Reverend Orton Nenslow.

232
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,740
wrote that song and is mostly singing.

233
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,180
I should mention that some of the background voices

234
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,620
are, strangely enough,

235
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,040
what we would call legitimate people.

236
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,420
The lovely Donna Cossie,

237
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,080
author of the book Kooks,

238
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,420
was singing in the background,

239
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,000
and I think Pagan Kennedy,

240
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,020
who grew up to be respectable,

241
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,120
is singing in the background.

242
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,480
And on guitar and singing is Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger,

243
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,680
who I just got a letter from him this morning

244
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,660
mentioning that he was writing a book

245
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,980
that's being illustrated by his brother,

246
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,260
Kim Deitch, the underground cartoonist,

247
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,380
and his other brother, the other Deitch,

248
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,680
who's also a cartoonist,

249
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,000
and I believe the foreword is being done by their dad.

250
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,680
What's his name, Deitch?

251
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,260
Who?

252
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:41,360
Who?

253
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,220
Seth?

254
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,580
Who invented Tom Terrific

255
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,860
on the Captain Kangaroo show.

256
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,000
Jay! Stop this crazy thing!

257
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,220
Artemia Salina with the Jet Stones here.

258
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,180
Let's listen.

259
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,220
A gay old time, I guess.

260
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,520
Well,

261
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,760
that gay old cowboy,

262
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,580
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

263
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,000
sure,

264
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,760
is on his way to his telephone

265
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,880
any second now.

266
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,200
In the meantime,

267
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,120
I've got a lovely song here

268
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,500
by the Billy Nair Show.

269
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:28,940
Huh.

270
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,640
I've come to bury Caesar,

271
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,720
not to praise him.

272
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,340
I've come to praise Caesar,

273
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,240
not to bury him.

274
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,980
I've come to praise Barry,

275
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,860
not to seize him.

276
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,760
I've come for Barry.

277
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,080
Have you seen him?

278
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,800
I've come to praise Caesar,

279
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,820
not to bury him.

280
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,280
I've come to bury Caesar,

281
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,320
not to praise him.

282
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,840
I've come to praise Barry,

283
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,800
not to seize him.

284
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,660
I've come for Barry.

285
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,100
Have you seen him?

286
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,920
I've come to praise Caesar,

287
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,240
I've come to praise Barry,

288
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,780
not to bury him.

289
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,240
I've come to bury Caesar,

290
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,200
not to praise him.

291
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,160
I've come to praise

292
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,300
bury, not to seize

293
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,940
him. I've come

294
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,820
for bury, have you seen him?

295
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,780
I've come to

296
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,740
praise Caesar,

297
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,600
not to bury him.

298
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,920
I've come to bury Caesar,

299
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,900
not to praise him.

300
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,700
I've come to praise

301
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,000
bury, not to seize him.

302
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,860
I've come for bury,

303
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,140
Have you seen tend?

304
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,360
I've come to praise Caesar, not to bury him

305
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,560
I've come to bury Caesar, not to praise him

306
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,640
I've come to praise bury, not to seat him

307
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,600
I've come to bury, not to seat him

308
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,000
I've come to praise Caesar, not to marry him

309
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,140
I've come to bury Caesar, not to praise him

310
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,840
See you next time.

311
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:41,900
Great Bob

312
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,520
Hello friends

313
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,400
as

314
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,520
I think it was

315
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,080
one of my brothers said the war on drugs

316
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,200
is not designed to be

317
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,940
wanted to right herring but I

318
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,060
meant they need an enemy

319
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,960
within America

320
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,520
you know to have a police force

321
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,740
make a lot of money

322
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,600
you know from political unity or something

323
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,060
I was

324
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,840
praise my

325
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,100
office machine

326
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,140
answering machine

327
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,080
Steve

328
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,700
my mother

329
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,360
she takes

330
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,300
my voice here

331
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,600
my voice

332
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,980
can be

333
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,140
any

334
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,400
can be

335
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,820
a bird in the sky

336
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,960
or a train

337
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,580
can be

338
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:36,580


339
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:36,580


340
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,700
The point is, she's totally crazy.

341
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,620
Very simple to hire a psychologist for.

342
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,500
I say that in all seriousness.

343
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,880
And her friends.

344
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,680
She was taking over the voice and pen of many people in the church.

345
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
She was so true to her knowledge that

346
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,460
they even thought Dr. Pizarro could know this.

347
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,060
She takes over his voice,

348
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,460
but his pen may bomb and destroy it with flak

349
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,140
and seven-blade windbreaker.

350
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,400
She truly is the Hydra woman who has admitted to this.

351
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,200
Wow.

352
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,660
Friends, we get some great calls

353
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,100
at the Subgenius Foundation office.

354
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,440
He calls quite frequently.

355
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,580
And although the true Jesus does apparently have his address,

356
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,860
I've never been able to get it myself.

357
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,640
So we've never been able to respond,

358
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,800
but we like to share the insights that he comes up with,

359
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,400
with you,

360
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,260
because, friends, that's time control.

361
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,240
You know, time control is a mysterious but wacky thing.

362
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:49,560
You're indulging in it and performing time control all the time,

363
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,700
but you don't really know it.

364
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,540
Mostly what you're doing is wasting time,

365
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,040
procrastinating, putting things off,

366
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,220
and generally indulging in slack or false slack,

367
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,700
depending on what it would be for you.

368
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,900
But you know what I'm talking about, right?

369
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,560
You're focusing your imagination too much,

370
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:19,620
and you get a really good sense of what it might actually mean.

371
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:19,620


372
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:19,620


373
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:19,660
Here comes our guest.

374
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:19,660


375
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,160
You knew what you were doing,

376
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,160


377
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,160


378
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,980
I Wish there were a mechanism for them

379
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,000
to be able to take on it regularly.

380
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,320
We could have過來 mechanisms at my Tesaroviki agrad-

381
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:33,580
Uh, yes.

382
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,040
Such as stick around-

383
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,380
Yes.

384
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:50,640
The Mun Cars by Reverend Artemia Salina.

385
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,600
The Mun Cars.

386
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:59,020
He also did this thing in the background which is called Psycho Ween Zone.

387
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:07,780
I think he takes MIDI files of anything and finds similar ones and mixes them together in his little computer.

388
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,780
Artemia Salina.

389
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,540
Do you know what Artemia Salina means?

390
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,720
No, I don't.

391
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,840
Sea monkeys.

392
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,400
Really?

393
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,200
Brian Shrimp, yes.

394
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,440
That's the scientific name for the Brian Shrimp.

395
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:29,000
So whenever you see those Brian Shrimp or Sea Monkey packages that have the family, the nice happy family of Sea Monkeys.

396
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,880
Gil men.

397
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:37,860
Monstrous parodies of humans in their little cage that you're going to buy for them.

398
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:44,300
He's the guy, Artemia Salina is the guy that posed as the dad on those.

399
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:44,980
Wow.

400
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,800
You know those self-same Brian Shrimp are the soul food of my little fire newt.

401
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,460
My ancient fire newt.

402
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,840
Friends, at the Slacker Mansion where we live in Slack, Princess Weardoe and I only have one pet.

403
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,340
Because we only want to be cruel to one animal at a time.

404
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,660
And it's a newt.

405
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,460
But not just any newt.

406
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,640
No, it's an ageless newt.

407
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,640
We have no idea how old it is.

408
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,800
She's had it for 26 years.

409
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,200
So you know she's a little older than 26.

410
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:23,060
But we don't know how old the newt was when it was purchased from the newt store.

411
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,340
There are mysteries everywhere, friends.

412
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,900
But he eats sea monkeys.

413
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,240
They're supposed to be dead, dried ones.

414
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:39,380
But I've noticed that when you throw them into the water, the ones he doesn't immediately eat, they come to life and start kicking and twitching.

415
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,220
And wriggle around.

416
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,120
Yes.

417
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:47,940
Trying to find their way to that happy sea monkey home that's depicted on all the sea monkey boxes.

418
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,480
Did you ever get those for Christmas, friends?

419
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,400
Weren't you disappointed?

420
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,860
Were you disappointed this last Christmas?

421
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,700
Things just weren't the way you expected them.

422
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:04,920
You made the mistake of reading the news and seeing that the world was, in fact, going to hell in a handbasket.

423
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,020
I was...

424
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,540
Oh, wait.

425
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,420
Speaking of hell, it looks like...

426
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,280
Let's see if this works.

427
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,560
Is that little green light?

428
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,100
Is that working?

429
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,160
The little green light is working?

430
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:16,700
The diode?

431
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,480
Yeah, it is this time for once.

432
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,360
It's the Dave diode!

433
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:26,040
Is it like the mythological light of the bizarre Iranian imam who thinks he's the messiah?

434
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,100
I hope so.

435
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,160
Because I was emitting some green gases earlier.

436
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:36,800
It was making me think that for the winter Olympics, they should have pyroflagellant speed skating.

437
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,120
Oh, limplinks.

438
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:38,600
Mmm.

439
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,140
That would be...

440
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,080
Well, there's so many things that we wish that could be, you know, Dave.

441
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,780
Lonesome cowboy Dave.

442
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,940
Why must...

443
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,240
But Bob won't let those things happen.

444
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,360
Because he's a...

445
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,700
He's a...

446
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,900
A fickle god.

447
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,760
Yeah, I guess that's it.

448
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,820
Or he's...

449
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,780
He's not a god at all.

450
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,800
Same points I was thinking of on my head.

451
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,620
Yeah.

452
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,120
On my head.

453
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,080
I was thinking slack.

454
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,020
Even though all that is true.

455
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:08,800
Yeah.

456
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,160
Slack.

457
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,060
I mean, not slack.

458
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:15,300
But the Church of the Subgenius offers something, I don't know, a little different.

459
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:21,420
Because all these religions are just like alien master, human slave, cargo cult, right?

460
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,180
Yeah.

461
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,800
The god exists because it is believed in.

462
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,560
So...

463
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,840
We're like slaves to this idea or actual preternatural being, whatever it is.

464
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,160
Well, we built the prison ourselves, man.

465
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,080
So you mean this...

466
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:42,400
So, as slaves, we could just, like, open a door?

467
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,160
Yeah, you could just...

468
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,040
You would think that you could just stop believing, open the door and walk out.

469
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,020
But the slave driver's inside your head, man.

470
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,980
Boy, I got a lot of...

471
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,700
I got a lot of screws in my nostril.

472
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,620
Yeah, I knew that.

473
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:56,940
I know.

474
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,460
I mean...

475
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,340
And some of them show.

476
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,160
But...

477
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,460
Well, there's not a lot you can do.

478
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,380
Thank goodness for radio.

479
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,420
Yeah.

480
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,760
Well, there is no cosmetic surgery necessary on radio.

481
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,320
In fact, everything is just as smooth as...

482
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,480
As a baby's brain.

483
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,540
And that's why they let us on.

484
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,640
Because of those rules.

485
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,300
Nursery rhymes.

486
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,500
That's what these are.

487
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,820
It's a fairy tale.

488
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,860
A tale of fairies and other deviant species.

489
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,020
And there are a lot of them now springing up.

490
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:38,300
Not just in the toxic pools, but throughout the land in malls and the little tiny homes.

491
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:44,740
Could these be what the tales of trolls and dwarves were based on in the Middle Ages?

492
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,400
Mutated pinks shopping at modern malls?

493
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,740
They say after when the Roman Empire fell, there was this big ecological that people don't think about.

494
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,440
You just think about barbarians and stuff.

495
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:55,920
Mm-hmm.

496
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,260
But there was, like, a major...

497
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,140
A major ecological disaster where a lot of people, their hair would fall out, would become trolls.

498
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,940
And maybe that really happened.

499
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,260
Well, that's because they mixed lead with their drinking water.

500
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:06,920
Right.

501
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,040
They used it as a preservative, I think, in their pipes.

502
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,520
And they used liquid mercury.

503
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,700
They didn't use frog in their pipes.

504
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,860
They used lead in their pipes.

505
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,700
Can you imagine that?

506
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,000
No wonder the Roman Empire fell.

507
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:24,980
And, friends, you can see, if you read your history, the fate of the Roman Empire is about to be echoed in the fate of this country, America.

508
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,040
The new United States of America.

509
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:31,580
It's going to undergo the same judgment that has befell ancient Rome.

510
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,360
Friends, we've seen the weather.

511
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,940
God's warning us.

512
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,840
We've seen the strange weather.

513
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,420
I wouldn't be...

514
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,480
I was just telling Charleston.

515
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,160
I wouldn't be surprised if I got up this morning, next, tomorrow morning, and it'd be raining blood.

516
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,740
Yeah, this is a bad...

517
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,260
Or that the moon was like sackcloth.

518
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,560
Or the oceans become like stone.

519
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,220
Jeez, what illusions.

520
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,000
I could...

521
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,580
If it gets much colder...

522
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,600
Well, when Lake Erie freezes over, the water does...

523
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,920
The Book of Revelations is acted out every year.

524
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:09,660
In fact, every month by some antichrist out there in the world.

525
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,040
Oh, how true are you?

526
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,040
And, you know, you think, oh, God, it couldn't get any worse.

527
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,680
And then it does.

528
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,880
And, you know, the funny thing is, I've been thinking that since I was...

529
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,680
Well, for about 50 years.

530
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,380
Yeah.

531
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,860
I've been thinking that.

532
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,540
Yep.

533
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,660
That very thing.

534
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:37,780
I was going to ask Princess Wyzigodian if she remembers back in the days of Yorn in this area here where they didn't have six earthquakes in one year.

535
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,360
Yeah.

536
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,920
What's up with that?

537
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,520
I...

538
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,360
I know.

539
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,140
When I left California, there was an earthquake and it scared me, but they all left.

540
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,920
Then I came here and there was a bigger one and no one left.

541
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,180
I was there.

542
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,200
I was here.

543
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,120
I've been in the very ones of which you...

544
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,660
You spake.

545
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,140
But...

546
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,580
And you were at the top of a skyscraper, right?

547
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,840
But the two bosses that were arguing didn't even notice that the building was swaying.

548
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,240
That's right.

549
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,140
Because they were having such a vehement argument that they just thought that the argument made them feel a little dizzy

550
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:17,700
and didn't notice the light fixture swinging on the ceiling.

551
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:24,720
Well, new from BizCorps is the gyroscopic anal implant would actually keep the smooth going throughout the entire...

552
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,480
Entire...

553
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,060
Entire...

554
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:26,120
Entire...

555
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:26,580
Entire...

556
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:26,600
Entire...

557
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:26,760
Entire...

558
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:26,980
Entire...

559
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,000
Entire...

560
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,080
Entire...

561
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,080


562
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,080


563
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,080


564
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,180
Entire...

565
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,180


566
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,180


567
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,180


568
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,760
And as the earth moves, so do you.

569
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,720
And you continue marking those logs and numbering those numbers.

570
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,420
Well, but the point is people don't even notice when the world is ending around them.

571
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:45,180
Oh, they can watch the victims of a hurricane or an earthquake on television and they can have a flat tire

572
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:50,300
or some terrible disaster befalls them every...

573
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,520
The little ends of the world, but they just don't see what it's all coming to.

574
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,620
It's shaking down.

575
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,220
It's shaking.

576
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,740
It's shaking.

577
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,540
Breakdown is happening.

578
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,040
And friends, you know what that means?

579
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,400
That means it's time for you to get some slack.

580
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,000
Because there may not be any more time.

581
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,000
Save your fur and get your own slavery hole.

582
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,220
Invite it in.

583
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,340
You know, it's your choice.

584
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,000
If you choose to choose things,

585
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,460
which I suppose is a volitional complex we can't even talk about,

586
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,140
that would be too weird.

587
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,180
But if you choose to choose something,

588
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,700
well, it's not called joining.

589
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,400
What is it, Zane?

590
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,140
It's become a member.

591
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,700
You can't really become a member

592
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,180
because the members are all frozen.

593
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,300
Well, you know, you're born a subgenius or a pink,

594
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,180
but when you join up with the church

595
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,760
and become a dues-paying minister,

596
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,260
then at that moment,

597
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,140
whether you're pink or human,

598
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,420
you are thence.

599
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,120
At that moment, you are saved.

600
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,360
You are protected from the ray guns of the alien monsters

601
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
and the devils from the hollow earth

602
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,640
that will be coming up,

603
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,120
erupting,

604
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,160
and then they'll be coming out to get you.

605
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,220
You think these heating bills this month are so terrible.

606
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:01,700
Oh, no.

607
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,300
Wait until you're in hell

608
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,260
and have to pay for your own heating bills.

609
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,820
It's possible we are in hell now

610
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,320
and we're just looking for the fire escape.

611
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,160
That is a theory that occurs to every subgenius boy and girl

612
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,400
at about the age of 10.

613
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,820
They go, wait a minute, I'm having to grow up.

614
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,980
Maybe this is hell.

615
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,020
Well, as we swing through adulthood,

616
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,100
clicking our heels,

617
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,160
hands upon middle age,

618
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,540
and our foreheads recede,

619
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,020
and so do our occipital lobes.

620
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,940
Middle age is receding for me.

621
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,800
Well, as the rest of your organs continue to atrophy,

622
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,320
I would probably put it that way.

623
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,400
And then finally, your heart muscle decides

624
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,940
it wants to live on another planet.

625
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,000
Then you realize it was hell

626
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,360
and this is the only way out.

627
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,180
My heart muscle does live on another planet.

628
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,540
My heart is still on Mars.

629
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,260
The true Earth, I should say.

630
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,440
But let's not get lost in doctrinal.

631
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,180
Now, let's not start crying about the old Mars

632
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,460
versus the new Mars.

633
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,500
We are where we are because it is ordained by nature.

634
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,480
Ja.

635
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,040
Ja.

636
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,360
We say ja to X-Day 9.

637
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,540
So will there be slightly clicking of jackboot heels

638
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,160
overtones at X-Day 9?

639
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,560
Yes, yes, there will be.

640
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,920
If we even make it that far before,

641
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,660
we may have to hold the X-Day inside the camps, you know.

642
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,420
Yes.

643
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,580
As the chairman,

644
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,780
the young Germans were saying to me about a year ago

645
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,180
when we visited Hamburg,

646
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,260
they said,

647
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,160
they're so concerned about this rise of fascism in America.

648
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,220
Sad, sad.

649
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,480
Oh, look at the...

650
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,680
The viewers in other cities can't see,

651
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:46,400
but Dr. Sinister just walked in with a new sinister hairdo.

652
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,160
You mean on his body?

653
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,020
Yes.

654
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,260
Well...

655
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,160
Probably inside.

656
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,240
Probably...

657
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,800
Probably there's a...

658
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,080
What is the change on the outside of his skull

659
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,180
is reflected by a change on the inside of his skull.

660
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,280
Has that ever happened to you, friend?

661
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,240
You ever wake up with a hangover and go,

662
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,640
I'm never going to do that again,

663
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,760
and immediately did it again?

664
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,240
That's what Bob's here for.

665
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,860
He's here to pop that hair of the dog.

666
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,500
He's here to pop the top off that beer you have in the morning,

667
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,480
that hair of the dog.

668
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,080
That's what...

669
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,060
That's Bob's function as a guru,

670
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,140
and a religious leader in this church,

671
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,300
in this world.

672
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:41,860
Well, we had close encounters with the end of the world

673
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,540
while I was in Texas for the last couple of weeks.

674
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,960
Burning, man.

675
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,480
Burning.

676
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,140
Talk about burning, man.

677
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,980
It was burning grandmas in Texas.

678
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,260
People just trying to save their house.

679
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,040
First thing in the morning,

680
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,500
things first.

681
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,400
Sheesh.

682
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,760
Conflagration across that big of an area,

683
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,340
that should be telling somebody something.

684
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,140
Well, yeah.

685
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,780
It told the rainmakers that they had failed

686
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,160
in their rainmaking magic.

687
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:09,040
It hasn't rained in the area of Stang County, Texas.

688
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,160
It hasn't rained in five years.

689
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,360
Well, it's rained, but not enough.

690
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,620
Just spits.

691
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,600
It just spits a little bit from the sky.

692
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,260
Just a little bit.

693
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,480
It comes out there's no gully washers, huh?

694
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,200
No.

695
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,000
We're not even a good drencher after a long period.

696
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:23,580
Well, yeah.

697
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,220
Well, sure.

698
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,300
It'll be floods next.

699
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,820
Now that my brother's had to sell old Bossy and old Bessie,

700
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:35,260
and he can't buy them back until it's after it's rained for a couple of years.

701
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,800
That might not ever happen because God's judgment has been visited

702
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,200
upon a Bob-rejecting, slackless world.

703
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,540
That's all there is to it.

704
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,980
I did my best for Christmas this year.

705
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,580
Seriously.

706
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,780
I gave ordainments.

707
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,560
I purchased.

708
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,640
I purchased subgenius ministerships for my two nephews and my two nieces.

709
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,000
They're in Stangville, Stang County, Texas.

710
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,200
Everybody who lives on Stang Ranch is now saved.

711
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,320
Well, this is what happened.

712
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:12,760
This is what was wrong with the Pope Papacy in the Middle Ages when...

713
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,920
Pope Pat Robertson?

714
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,640
Well, you know...

715
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,880
I think he ought to be offed.

716
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,020
He has very many suits, I guess, of many, many...

717
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,840
Starting to sound like him.

718
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,560
He has thousand-thousand-dollar suits and stuff and is involved in scamming.

719
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,060
He's involved in scandals that the Republic or whatever they call them,

720
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:30,040
the administration areas, parts of the Justice Department have overlooked

721
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,020
because, hey, he's a religious figure.

722
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,200
Now, Stang is a religious figure.

723
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,540
Not much of a figure to look at, but he still is a religious figurine

724
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,520
and should be accorded the same sort of judicial respect.

725
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:47,600
Perhaps a villa by the sea without any incongruent tax fairies

726
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,860
or plenty of money just dropping from the sky.

727
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,240
They call that unfortunate misbehavior.

728
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,720
But I think it's well deserved.

729
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,580
Because Pat Robertson is very undeserved by all of us.

730
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,120
That's what I believe.

731
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,180
Well, you know what I believe?

732
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,080
No.

733
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,280
I believe I'm having another frop stick and a bear.

734
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,500
Well, I think I'll reach for that same self, same thing myself.

735
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,240
No, kids, you know, those are false drugs and we wouldn't...

736
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,180
Well, not the frop stick, but the bear certainly would be.

737
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,560
And we would not encourage...

738
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,480
We would not encourage you to drink false drugs.

739
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:30,660
When the real thing is out there, you can have you a big old...

740
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:39,100
Just quaff some of that Bob Slack off of this radio show in this local station.

741
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,160
It's electromagnetic, just like the radio waves are.

742
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:47,340
It incorporates itself into your body in just a matter of moments.

743
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,240
Slack can be electromagnetic. It can be gravitational.

744
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,400
It can be glandular, my friend.

745
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,840
And that's when it's at its best.

746
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:59,120
And you can feel that spell in your third nostril as the wasting continues.

747
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,780
Oh, oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

748
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,320
By the way, the oh yeah guy thinks you owe him some money now.

749
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,340
I've been wondering about that.

750
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:17,960
I was wondering if the oh yeah guy had noticed that subgeniuses the world over had been, like, using the oh yeah chant in mashups and mixes and...

751
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,540
Oh no.

752
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,400
No, what happened?

753
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,400
He heard the tune.

754
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,880
He heard the tune that was on the hour of Slack a few weeks ago.

755
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,920
Wow, Norrell Preff did that.

756
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:26,380
Yeah.

757
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,220
And he, so he wants royalties.

758
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,420
I actually, I asked him first. I was kind of leading the witness, as it were.

759
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:35,880
I said, so, have you heard that they were using your voice in that music?

760
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,000
And he said, yeah, yeah.

761
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,740
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I heard it.

762
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,600
Now, why would anyone want to declare themself a monarch based on your...

763
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:50,120
Well, it's like, yeah, give us your address, buddy, and we'll come over and collect a whole lot of sperm and give you your...

764
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,860
Because that, you know, he is...

765
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,340
What's his name?

766
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:54,960
Masturbating Sean.

767
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,160
Masturbating Sean, yeah.

768
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:56,680
Oh, yes.

769
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,780
A regular caller.

770
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,180
What am I to call a serial caller?

771
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:00,580
Then I have his address.

772
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:08,580
If I was paying him the royalties which he's owed, which must be at least a penny and a half off what we make working at this radio station here.

773
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,780
Well, he couldn't even pay for the sperm sample for what he's expected.

774
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,400
I think it's a silly, silly idea on his part.

775
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,460
Well, I'm just thinking...

776
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:15,940
He should masturbate to himself.

777
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,940
Anybody who could, who is that into it has got to be a...

778
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,100
Yeah.

779
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:24,560
A fount, a veritable fount of buckets of life.

780
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:36,140
Think how many planets could be populated by just the amount that guy has spent while listening to this one show, much less all the other shows he calls.

781
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,900
If DNA is indeed information, just think of all the things you could think of by drinking it.

782
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,300
Oh.

783
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,200
Oh.

784
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:44,860
Oh.

785
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,640
Dave, you know, sometimes your stream of consciousness...

786
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,840
This thing leads to the wrong streams...

787
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,800
I know.

788
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,140
...coming in and out of you.

789
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,240
I remember on KSAN, I mentioned menstrual fluids and click, the phone went click.

790
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:08,800
I remember one time you got so into it, you reached up and grabbed Princess Wee right on the chest as a part of a character you were doing.

791
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,420
Well, luckily it was her third breast because...

792
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:11,720
Yeah.

793
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,700
Otherwise you would have lost a hand.

794
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,460
Listen to that cackling witch.

795
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,620
Friends, you ever wonder where the hell she's at?

796
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,420
Where the legends of witches come from?

797
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,640
I still have three good things.

798
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,520
Witches are real.

799
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,920
There are actual witches.

800
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:31,700
And I don't mean Wiccans with, you know, folk singer type girls with black sweaters on.

801
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,600
I mean actual cackling insane.

802
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:40,440
More like the ones on the Warner Brothers cartoon shows that Bugs Bunny would have to deal with.

803
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:49,300
Did we memorize, as a youth, did you memorize the entire Macbeth thing, double doubles in your thing there?

804
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,100
Did you memorize it?

805
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,360
But of course, but of course.

806
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,860
That's pink witch stuff though.

807
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,660
They wouldn't tell you the very...

808
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,620
We knew that without even reading it.

809
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,940
And you can imagine a lot of cackling if you're a young child.

810
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,280
Well, yes. I mean it just kind of does come naturally.

811
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,800
Well, since we've crossed that space...

812
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:19,220
Girls, girls, girls. Yes, the church of the subgeniuses. It's not a boys club any longer. No, sir, ma'am.

813
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:26,000
It's full of all kinds of mutated, deeply strange, and yet lonely creatures.

814
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,520
Maybe they're the same species as you, but who cares? That's the point here.

815
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,100
Bob didn't say it had to be an earth woman, did it?

816
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:42,520
That's right. When you finally find a member of your own species, you'll find yourself saying to her,

817
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,900
Oh, sex with anyone else would be bestiality.

818
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,920
Oh, yes, yes, yes, friend.

819
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,580
And that's what you're expected to.

820
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,900
Your true yeti mate is out there somewhere. I hope that all the parts are on one body.

821
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:03,620
I think the idea of sexual loneliness, after you reach a certain level, you could probably instantly procreate yourself.

822
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,540
And you'd no longer feel lonesomeness.

823
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:10,600
You could just... That wouldn't be the same thing? Or would it?

824
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,940
Well, you know, trees are never lonely, and they can fertilize themselves.

825
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,900
Well, you'd like a kind of a warmer place.

826
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:25,360
You'd want something you could actually grapple. Perhaps maybe a third sex version of yourself. Or fourth.

827
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,440
That would even be better. Because you'd be twice as many ideas you forget.

828
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:35,240
And four times as many ways to make a fool of yourself at a singles bar.

829
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,960
Especially if you're wearing one of those fake beards and stuff like that.

830
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:46,540
I put it to any would-be sci-fi writer out there to actually come up with some mechanics about how a third or fourth sex would act.

831
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,700
And what the biological function of such a thing would be.

832
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,100
You know, we always hear about, you know, sci-fi creatures that have three sexes.

833
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,280
But they never explain what the third one is actually used for.

834
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,540
Yeah, they only allude to it. Like, oh, catch this idea. This is really a good idea.

835
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,700
I'd like to hear some specifics. It might not be appropriate to...

836
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:11,580
Well, you have. In some ancient Playboy articles, they did have the actual organs numbered in, you know, like in the Mayan codices and stuff.

837
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,660
Each one was like a jaguar this or something like that. And, um...

838
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,940
That may have been the fiction part of the science fiction, Dave.

839
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,280
Well, but can you imagine the Kama Sutra of such little creatures like...

840
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,600
Friends, we are writing it even now!

841
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:35,020
We are trying to write the Kama Sutra for the alien species and for any interactions that humans or subgeniuses...

842
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:40,860
Well, yeah, subgeniuses might have with them. I don't care what they do to the humans.

843
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:45,640
I'm more interested in what we get to do with the aliens.

844
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,800
The alien sex goddesses predicted by Bob.

845
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:56,300
We have no choice. That's the problem. I want more freedom in my freedom. Do you understand what I'm saying?

846
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:03,140
I hear you. That's what evolution is all about. There's always... You never have enough. Whatever it is, you always want more.

847
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,460
Hey, you got your freedom in my freedom!

848
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,020
But I don't have the alien vertebrae. And that's what I want.

849
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,700
Your idea is always... That's what you call conditional happiness.

850
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:12,700
Yeah.

851
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,620
Yeah. There's always something that's in the way of your happiness.

852
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:25,180
And once you have that thing, that synthesizer part, or that extra computer upgrade, or that raise, or that girlfriend, or that issue of Playboy...

853
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,300
Anybody have Playboy March 1965?

854
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:33,120
Anyway, if you... Then you'd be happy. Then you'd have slack. Then everything would be perfect.

855
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,660
But in the meantime, oh, I'm just... Oh, it's just unfair.

856
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,500
It's so unfair.

857
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:45,600
Even if you were Lunar Bodhisattva and could go around flying around the planet and pooping on various huge megalopolis...

858
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,920
Still, you would not be satisfied. The root... The root has not been burned.

859
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,240
The root? The root?

860
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,100
The root of all desire must be burned. The root is on fire.

861
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,140
Your seeds must be fried, baby.

862
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,040
Ah.

863
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,880
Your eggs must be poached.

864
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,660
Well, that's the way we do it here by the river.

865
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,040
I seed what you deed, buddy.

866
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:10,040
Down by the river. You shot your baby, didn't you?

867
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,240
Yes. In fact, I shot four of them.

868
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,280
That was a Mickey Mouse song, wasn't it?

869
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,160
It was like, down by the river.

870
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:27,020
Mickey Mouse as the Oye guy singing down by the river a la Mickey Mouse as Neil Young.

871
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,040
Man, that is postmodern.

872
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,200
That's twisted on top of a twister.

873
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:42,900
Speaking of twisting, the music in the background, well, currently, and a lot of the last few minutes was by...

874
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:51,180
Tom and Joe, the mysterious Tom and Joe. B.D. Borculo at AOL.com, I believe.

875
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:55,980
And we heard some instrumental music by the Hell Pope Huey.

876
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,560
That was the pretty sounding stuff in the background.

877
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,680
And also there was a little bit by Teen Demon.

878
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:12,540
He does music like I do, computer music that's really just stolen from other people's real music, but then, you know, remixed.

879
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,300
It's easy. Anybody, kids can do it. Little kids.

880
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:22,240
Well, how many fingers, speaking of manual dexterity, how many digits have you lost trying to find digits?

881
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,880
That's why I switched to computers instead of stop motion animation.

882
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:31,020
I lost too many fingers trying to make those metal ball and socket puppets.

883
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,380
Have you seen King Kong?

884
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,960
I can die now.

885
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,360
He walked through the window last night.

886
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,660
Yeah, oh, God, is he gorgeous or what?

887
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,760
With that broken tooth and his blackened tongue.

888
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,620
And Princess Wee is just smitten. Absolutely smitten.

889
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:53,940
We've watched the King Kong movie four times since the first day it came out.

890
00:42:54,260 --> 00:43:02,700
And what do you want? You probably, all these kids and humans, they'll save their money up to go see the Narnia thing.

891
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,580
Because they like lions. They like lions and pussycats and Jesusly stuff.

892
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,740
And unicorns.

893
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:12,160
But just not a straight, straight ahead monster movie.

894
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,240
Have you ever seen a dinosaur pile up?

895
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,120
I say you have not, I dare say.

896
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,360
That's my review. That's my review.

897
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:31,480
Citizen Kong is a great film shot from three feet, every camera angle is from three feet above the ground.

898
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,860
And yet moving constantly.

899
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:42,140
You've got, you've just confused these characters in my mind to the point now where I'm seeing Orson Welles.

900
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,160
Orson Welles is a big hairy ape with a weird.

901
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,720
Well, he's been a dad for now.

902
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:49,860
And Mickey Mouse singing like Neil Young as the Oye guy.

903
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:57,960
And Jack Black kind of shot, Jack Black actually did a very funny King Kong theme song.

904
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,080
But he sang it on Saturday Night Live.

905
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:10,100
So I can't play it on the hour of slack because we stand somewhat a right against anything popular or successful or good.

906
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,060
And then the kids swam into the roadster palace.

907
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:12,780
I resemble that remark.

908
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:20,460
Yeah, well, live it or live with it, as the great Fireside Theater uttered.

909
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,120
Live it or live with it.

910
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:23,440
Yeah.

911
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,080
Hey, look, at least we don't quote them all the time.

912
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,760
At least we're not always quoting Monty Python or.

913
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,260
Hey, my new one is Terry Pratchett.

914
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:37,500
I've read ten Terry Pratchett books in the last two months or probably more than that.

915
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,240
Probably.

916
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:38,860
Yeah.

917
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:44,860
And then Reverend Chris Lee suddenly sent me this novel by Terry Pratchett called Mort.

918
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,180
And I thought, why would anybody send me this?

919
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,480
And maybe it's funny or something.

920
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,840
And I started reading it and went, it's funny.

921
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:57,320
And it's been Pratchett all the way down ever since.

922
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:57,600
That's right.

923
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:57,860
It has.

924
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,180
It's been Terry Pratchett books all the way down.

925
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:05,860
Philo's girlfriend said, oh, yeah, my dad gave me one of those when I was 14.

926
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,860
They're great reading if you're a kid.

927
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,820
So did her eyebrow like do the undulating snake thing as she told you that like.

928
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,440
Yeah.

929
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,460
Well, just a little bit.

930
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,520
She was trying to be polite.

931
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,440
You know, she didn't want me to feel like an idiot, like I was some kind of fanboy nerd

932
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,040
reading that silly kid stuff when I should have been reading.

933
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,960
I don't know something.

934
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,120
Something.

935
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:34,760
Phil, it's nonfiction, you know, philosophy.

936
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,760
Something more sophisticated.

937
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:36,660
Yes.

938
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:41,280
I think it was the bowling ball earrings causing her pain, which is why she gave it a look.

939
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,880
I don't know.

940
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,240
I've been I've been accosted by a lot of saxophone players lately.

941
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:53,540
Yeah.

942
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,140
And they're asking me the meaning of life.

943
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:56,720
Meaning of life.

944
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,100
What are you supposed to tell a guy like that?

945
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,080
You know.

946
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,800
Tell him that the meaning of life lays.

947
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,640
Tell him the awful truth.

948
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,800
The other end of Bob's pipe.

949
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,540
The part that you can't see.

950
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,400
The part that's hidden inside his lips.

951
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:11,840
That's.

952
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,000
Yeah.

953
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:17,040
Well, the answer is coming out of there because it's it's what he's smoking.

954
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,480
It's you, my friend.

955
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,940
Are you ready for the adventure of a lifetime?

956
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:29,260
Are you ready to throw yourself in a panther licking your brain to the metaphorical pipe?

957
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,040
Oh, yes.

958
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,540
You can see it in the distance.

959
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,280
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

960
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,700
You thought the fundamentalist Christians.

961
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,560
Were crazy.

962
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,520
You thought the fundamentalist Muslims were even crazier.

963
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:46,720
But now is your chance, my friends, to yourself become ten billion times crazier than any of

964
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:46,980
them.

965
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:47,480
Yes.

966
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,300
Your diamond.

967
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:53,140
I was made of my friends like that diamond crystal.

968
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,200
Yes.

969
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:55,480
Globe.

970
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:57,860
Someday.

971
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:58,680
Someday.

972
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,080
Use it as a pathway.

973
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,820
The fire exit.

974
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,380
If you will or won't.

975
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,240
It doesn't matter.

976
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,460
There is a way out.

977
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:05,680
There is a way out.

978
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,020
I wouldn't fail.

979
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,360
But there is a way out.

980
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,620
There has to be.

981
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,680
We need knee pads, man.

982
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,640
We need knee pads.

983
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,340
It looks like gyroscope so we can keep dictating.

984
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:24,880
And flying saucers and new computers and that March 1965 Playboy.

985
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,820
1965, man.

986
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,760
That was a critical year.

987
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,040
It was the early 50s.

988
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:30,480
No.

989
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,100
It was in the 90s.

990
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:32,740
And that's the one.

991
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,300
And it was her name.

992
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,260
What was her name?

993
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,040
Yeah, yeah.

994
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:36,280
Yeah.

995
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,360
I'm sorry.

996
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:39,700
I am.

997
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,080
I'm just not sure how that's going to end up.

998
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:46,820
It's not the end of the world.

999
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,280
I'm sorry.

1000
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,280


1001
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,280


1002
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,280


1003
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,280


1004
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,280


1005
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,280


1006
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,280


1007
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,280


1008
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,280


1009
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,280


1010
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:04,280


1011
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,420
That's not Dave, that's Muzak.

1012
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,480
Don't you recognize Muzak when you hear it?

1013
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:13,120
The elevator was glowing, man.

1014
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,540
I have trouble following Dave.

1015
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,980
Well, once you're in the elevator and you hear the elevator music,

1016
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,340
and the elevator begins breathing, and the music begins breathing,

1017
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:26,400
and you can't get out even though you're between the first and second floor.

1018
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,020
It's the walls of the elevator that breathe, Dave.

1019
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,120
Get this straight now.

1020
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,020
I'm glad somebody knows what's going on.

1021
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:37,820
In the old days, you used to have big levers, and there was a little thing on the top that said,

1022
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:42,440
Captain's Blend, northwest, east, two knots, straight ahead, full backwards.

1023
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,160
And you just pull one of those, and the top would explode.

1024
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,520
And you'd be back in the nursery where you belong.

1025
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,320
And friends, with that, we're going to go back to the nursery where we belong.

1026
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:58,240
In fact, we're going to cut Dave off and ourselves,

1027
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,220
and we're going to go back to London, England earlier in the year

1028
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,000
to listen to Rewind.

1029
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:06,080
Reverend Priest, finally explain what this is all about.

1030
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,860
That's right, not Father Priest, Reverend Priest,

1031
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,080
with a subgenius rant.

1032
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,760
Dave, thank you for calling.

1033
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,620
We're going to be locked inside the breathing plywood elevator?

1034
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,260
Yeah, later on we will be, in fact.

1035
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,940
But for now...

1036
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,460
Should I listen to the message without massaging?

1037
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,280
Yeah, we're going to have to go now.

1038
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,440
Bye, Dave!

1039
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,520
Let Reverend Priest explain everything.

1040
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,840
And praise...

1041
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:33,640
Dave, could...

1042
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,180
That's...

1043
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:34,740
What?

1044
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,900
I don't want to leave a message.

1045
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:36,220
What?

1046
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,180
You said, us.

1047
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:37,720
But...

1048
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,120
I don't think I'm going to leave a message.

1049
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,040
I'm just going to...

1050
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,360
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1051
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,300
Praise Bob! Hallelujah!

1052
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:54,200
I am Reverend Priest of the Church of the Subgenius.

1053
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,560
And I'm here tonight to tell you about our religion.

1054
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,640
Ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters,

1055
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,000
the Church of the Subgenius is dedicated to the religion of the subgenius.

1056
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,000


1057
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,620
It is dedicated to a threefold mission.

1058
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,340
To the pursuit of slack.

1059
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:09,240
To the unmasking of the conspiracy.

1060
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:13,100
And to this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1061
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,840
Not some 2,000 year dead deity of yesterday,

1062
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,860
but a living, breathing, smoking slack master salesman.

1063
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,060
He's seen you buy your magazines.

1064
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,980
He's seen you buy your newspapers, your books, and your educations.

1065
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:32,920
And he knows you will pay to know what you really think.

1066
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,460
So here's the deal.

1067
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,960
Eternal salvation guaranteed or triple your money back.

1068
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:44,260
For just £30 tonight, ladies and gentlemen,

1069
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:49,940
you too can believe all this ironic postmodern crap that I am spouting tonight.

1070
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,960
Opinion number one.

1071
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:53,480
Yours for $30.

1072
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:58,380
There exists a vast conspiracy that's taking over the world

1073
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,520
whose main motivation is to rob the subgenius of their slack.

1074
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,940
For money.

1075
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:05,880
We know this.

1076
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,320
They're doing it so that they can bottle and sell us false slack.

1077
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,840
And most people are so slack starved they can't even tell the difference.

1078
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,520
Brothers and sisters, in the church of the subgenius, we can tell the difference.

1079
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:25,420
We know the conspiracy exists because Bob used to be one of the conspiracy higher-ups

1080
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:28,520
until his conversion experience led him to start the church.

1081
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:29,940
Do you want proof?

1082
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,060
Do you want proof the conspiracy exists?

1083
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,340
How about alarm clocks?

1084
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,060
How about timesheets?

1085
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,560
How about drug laws?

1086
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,400
How about politics?

1087
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,140
How about fashion, ladies and gentlemen?

1088
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,580
You want more proof?

1089
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,900
Think about Crazy Frog.

1090
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:51,520
Ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, television advertising actually works.

1091
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,900
If we weren't so bad at it, we would be in charge of the world right now,

1092
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,340
but the conspiracy has already taken our place.

1093
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,960
The subgenius church has a mission.

1094
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,820
To expose the conspiracy.

1095
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:09,180
To expose their false prophets, their false slack, their false news, their false media,

1096
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:14,140
false sex, false drugs, false music, false art, false fashion, and false religion.

1097
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,760
And of course, that includes our own religion.

1098
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,140
We in the church of the subgenius expose ourselves.

1099
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,060
Opinion number two.

1100
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,560
Yours also for $30.

1101
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,840
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

1102
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:41,860
Bob has profited, prophesized, that the aliens will come and destroy this world

1103
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:48,340
and take off the subgenius to bliss in the stars while killing all of those non-believers.

1104
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:54,020
And this will happen at 7am on the 5th of July, 1998.

1105
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,540
Okay, I can see some of you think 1998 is a bit too early.

1106
00:52:59,540 --> 00:52:59,540


1107
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,460
1998 is already gone.

1108
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:06,160
You underestimate the power of the global conspiracy to confuse and bewilder us.

1109
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:10,240
We have uncovered proof that the conspiracy has changed the calendar.

1110
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,840
Oh, they call it daylight savings time.

1111
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,100
They call it leap years.

1112
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,940
They call it leap seconds and the Gregorian adjustment.

1113
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:24,460
But no, they have screwed with the calendar so much, we don't even know what year it is, brothers and sisters.

1114
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:28,400
Yes, believe me, the aliens are coming.

1115
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,700
They will be here any day.

1116
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,780
They're on their way.

1117
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,040
They'll be here any day.

1118
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,460
Just a quick earth raid.

1119
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:16,720
To kill those who haven't paid.

1120
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,720
Just wait till this July.

1121
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,240
I'm going to put you into the sky.

1122
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:39,760
Meet my alien love goddess.

1123
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,060
In a short red see-through dress.

1124
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,460
Cause I need her here.

1125
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:57,640
Take me away from here.

1126
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,900
Let the humans scream.

1127
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:14,060
I'm floating in a dream.

1128
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:21,860
High above the flames.

1129
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,620
Plain sex abhorrence.

1130
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,840
With the same kind of good guides.

1131
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:35,160
Wait till this July.

1132
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:42,520
I'll rupture into the sky.

1133
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:50,940
Meet my alien love goddess.

1134
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:58,220
In a short red see-through dress

1135
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:01,660
Cause I need a hair

1136
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,640
They'll soon be here

1137
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:17,580
Praise Bob in time

1138
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:25,020
Earth's destruction will be mine

1139
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:32,880
In my alien sweet embrace

1140
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:40,120
We'll seal the fate of the human race

1141
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,700
It's time to make up your mind

1142
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:52,880
Are you saved or are you fried?

1143
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,920
Will you pay your dues?

1144
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:06,360
Or are you alien food?

1145
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:11,700
Will you join us now?

1146
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,560
Will you join us now?

1147
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:18,320
Will you join us now?

1148
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:25,540
Only Bob can show you how

1149
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:32,600
Only Bob can show you how

1150
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:39,160
Will you join us now?

1151
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:47,080
Will you join us now?

1152
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:48,700
Onion number three!

1153
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,840
Yours for just $30 if you sign up with Bob tonight!

1154
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,220
Reverend Priest,

1155
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,780
you're listening to the

1156
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:00,000
Hour of Slack.

1157
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,100
If you would like more information

1158
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,060

00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:17,560


1172
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:17,560


1173
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:21,980
TheLargestCityOfTheWesternWorld.

1174
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,960
A city of 319 men, women, and children.

1175
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,460
As many as in Paris, Berlin, and London combined.

1176
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,260
Pulsing and throbbing with a great homo area.

1177
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,080
It is an area that shelters 11 fairies.

1178
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,700
There are seven every business day.

1179
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,460
And there are three out of towns.

1180
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,720
So it is.

1181
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:39,860
In the city.

1182
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,440
Or in reality, Cleveland.

1183
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:41,900
Ha ha.

1184
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:44,740
Sirius Crossroads.

1185
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,540
Eddie speaking.

1186
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,840
Eddie, Samuel Curtis.

1187
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,120
I just landed.

1188
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:49,860
I know.

1189
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,120
We saw.

1190
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,600
It was great.

1191
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,180
Can you dig me out and set me up for a flight?

1192
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,100
Sure.

1193
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,620
Could you bring the cat?

1194
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,440
Yeah, I got him.

1195
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,020
His name's Monkey Puss.

1196
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,940
I want to name him Oscar.

1197
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,140
That wasn't so bad, was it, Monkey?

1198
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,300
Eddie, you got something for me, right?

1199
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:09,740
Oh, yeah.

1200
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,960
Okay, I'll be in in a bit.

1201
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,180
Okay, goodbye.

1202
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:15,780
Bye-bye.

1203
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:17,460
Beep.
