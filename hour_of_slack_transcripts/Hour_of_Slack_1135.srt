Use this abusively. Make derivatives of this. Edit portions out and utilize portions to do a different recording or to accompany a visual of various visuals. This may be listened to. Use this abusively.

2
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,360
At the tone.

3
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,520
The Self Genius Power of Sight.

4
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,540
This is a download visit.

5
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,160
Slash heads this morning.

6
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:56,920
Well then.

7
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,560
What is cold cheese?

8
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,960
No cold cheese.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,320
Cheese has appeared or developed except together with a religion.

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,560
It was a pretty miserable thing to find out.

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,480
I admit it.

12
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,460
Flesh, pudding, doesn't work for a disease that doesn't exist.

13
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,560
I've always found the pessimist may well be hungry or killed.

14
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,440
Turd.

15
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,980
Terrorism proved right.

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:18,820
Jolt.

17
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,280
Jolt.

18
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:19,680
Jolt.

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,640
The bad news is that history throws up still pregnant people.

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,420
Hey Bob.

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,340
Bob Bob.

22
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:25,760
Yeah Bob.

23
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,160
Hey Bob.

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,180
Here's my ass.

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:27,820
Hi Bob.

26
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,740
Bob Bob.

27
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,180
Bob.

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:29,780
Hello Bob.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,400
Hello Bob.

30
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,940
Well there you go again.

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,320
Oh.

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:33,980
About.

33
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,380
Plan 9.

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,320
Oh Lieutenant.

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:36,940
No.

36
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,160
No.

37
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,880
No you hold on.

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,720
That was bad too.

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,400
You Bob okay.

40
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:41,920
Bob Bob.

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,420
Yeah Bob.

42
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,280
Put the big one away.

43
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,580
The shocking facts.

44
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,820
Boy Scouts.

45
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,460
Bring in the big one.

46
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,520
Jeff.

47
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:48,740
Jeff.

48
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,000
Mad.

49
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,240
Is it?

50
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,460
My big boy not Johnny.

51
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,920
Superstition of some sort.

52
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,680
Hello Bob.

53
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,720
Open up your eyes to what's going on.

54
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,400
Goodbye Bob.

55
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,120
Hey Bob how you doing?

56
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,580
Bob Bob.

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,260
It's because of your big guns.

58
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,800
You just do as I tell you.

59
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,180
Hey Edie how about you and me bowling.

60
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,640
You mean the kind from up there?

61
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,600
What will their next move be?

62
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,060
Oh forget about the flying saucers.

63
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,540
That's enough.

64
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,720
Holy cow.

65
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,460
It was shaped like a huge cigar.

66
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,280
Shall we talk now or wait?

67
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,220
Use your small electrode gun.

68
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,060
There are flying saucers.

69
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,520
Can you prove that it didn't happen?

70
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,820
There was a saucer.

71
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,580
A flying saucer?

72
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,720
Are you doing that brother Bob?

73
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,340
Bob.

74
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,040
Yes Bob.

75
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,860
Let's get out there and have a rally for Bob.

76
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,260
Bob.

77
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,100
Bob.

78
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:33,700
Bob.

79
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,120
Bob.

80
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,240
Bob.

81
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,100
Are there any more at home like you?

82
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:35,600
Boss.

83
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:35,880
Bob.

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,300
Bob.

85
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:36,640
Boss.

86
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,460
Flying saucer.

87
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:37,860
Bob.

88
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,160
Bob.

89
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,000
How can any race be so stupid?

90
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,560
For they will be from outer space.

91
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,180
Cause a seat over Hollywood.

92
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:45,920
Monsters.

93
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,600
Graves.

94
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,140
Bodies.

95
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
To get that funny odor.

96
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,160
How could I miss it?

97
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,580
Because all you of earth are idiots.

98
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,480
Something started stinking awful bad.

99
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,420
What plan will you follow now?

100
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,780
Plan nine.

101
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,800
We haven't seen the last of those weirdies.

102
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,580
As long as they can think.

103
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,740
We'll have our problems.

104
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,620
I don't like it.

105
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,660
But I guess there isn't much I can do about it.

106
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,700
Uh, is it Bob there please?

107
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,260
Bob.

108
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,720
Bob.

109
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,260
Bob.

110
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,520
Yes, is it true that you're well endowed?

111
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,160
Yes it is.

112
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,440
Bob.

113
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:13,740
Bob.

114
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,560
Yes Bob.

115
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,040
Bob.

116
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,420
Hey Bob.

117
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:15,920
Bob.

118
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,320
Bob.

119
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,200
Bob, we love you.

120
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,660
Bob.

121
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,060
Hey Bob.

122
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,740
I'd like to request free bird.

123
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,000
Bob.

124
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,420
Bob.

125
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,400
Bob, what's the meaning of life?

126
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:21,880
Yes Bob.

127
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,620
Uh, Bob.

128
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:22,940
Bob.

129
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,240
Bob.

130
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:23,500
Bob.

131
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:23,780
Bob.

132
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,360
Yeah Bob.

133
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,260
I need to talk to Bob.

134
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:25,680
Yeah Bob.

135
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:25,820
Bob.

136
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,440
Hello Bob.

137
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:26,880
This is Bob.

138
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,380
Yes Bob.

139
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:27,780
Bob.

140
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,020
Bob.

141
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,580
Hi Bob.

142
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:28,900
Yeah Bob.

143
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,360
Hey Bob.

144
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:29,800
Hello Bob.

145
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,220
Bob.

146
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,620
Bob.

147
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,120
Bob.

148
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:31,400
Bob.

149
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,320
Yes Bob.

150
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,760
Hello Bob.

151
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,020
Bob.

152
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:33,420
Yeah Bob.

153
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:33,640
Bob.

154
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,160
Yeah Bob.

155
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,620
Hello Bob.

156
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,300
Yes Bob.

157
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:35,700
Bob.

158
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,020
Can you hear me?

159
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,080
The most amazing thing.

160
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,080
Can you hear me?

161
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:40,860
Hello Bob.

162
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,100
Okay.

163
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,160
The most amazing thing.

164
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,060
Can you hear me?

165
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,380
Bob.

166
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,860
It is not at all evident.

167
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,400
Sssss.

168
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:46,940
Why?

169
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,400
Underneath all the immense complexity and apparent randomness of the natural world.

170
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,720
There seems to be immense complexity.

171
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,540
And apparent randomness.

172
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:56,880
Sssss.

173
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,300
More.

174
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:57,880
More.

175
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,420
The human mind can apparently understand.

176
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,240
A cat.

177
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,800
There is no compelling reason.

178
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,360
The human mind apparently apprehends nature on a t-shirt.

179
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,320
That is all you know on earth and all you need to know.

180
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,600
God man.

181
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,380
God man.

182
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,580
God man.

183
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,240
God man.

184
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:17,460
God man.

185
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:17,740
I mean my.

186
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,500
God man.

187
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,240
God man.

188
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,400
God man.

189
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:20,960
God man.

190
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,060


191
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,160
God man.

192
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,500
I mean my.

193
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,040
It's my God.

194
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,440
Yeah.

195
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,700
He don't like you.

196
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:24,700


197
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:24,700


198
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,460
He plays favorites man and one of them ain't you.

199
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,480
But I know I'm good.

200
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,180
It's all good for me.

201
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,780
He favors me because I believe in him exclusively.

202
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,340
God man.

203
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,020
God man.

204
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,240
God man.

205
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:39,980
God man.

206
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,080
God man.

207
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:41,740
God man.

208
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,560
God man.

209
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,860
God man.

210
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:45,440
God man.

211
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,880
God man.

212
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,500
God man.

213
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,660
God man.

214
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,200
God man.

215
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,160
God man.

216
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,420
God man.

217
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,080
God man.

218
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,400
There are winners and there are losers and I know.

219
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,520
What I am.

220
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,260
Just as I know what you are.

221
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,780
Secular humanist in disguise.

222
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,020
Transformers.

223
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,980
Secular humanist in disguise.

224
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,480
God man.

225
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,160
God man.

226
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,400
God man.

227
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,020
God man.

228
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,500
I mean my.

229
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,360
God man.

230
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,000
God man.

231
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,220
God man.

232
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,820
God man.

233
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:13,820


234
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,300
God man.

235
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,960
I'm convinced.

236
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,900
I'm convicted.

237
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,420
The grace within me continues to swell.

238
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,440
The icing on the cake is knowing that you are going to hell.

239
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,200
I'm one of the elect.

240
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,100
I'm one of the elite.

241
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:24,380
I am.

242
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,060
I know it's true.

243
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,800
I'm perdkhatov-Fray.

244
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,660
Shadan paralyzed.

245
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,700
But the first récord Gil

246
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:30,940
Bonivia.

247
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,800
Segun.

248
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,820
Ser 194.

249
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,980
He knows what God is.

250
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:53,380
He knows how God is.

251
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:10,140
God man, God man, God man, God man.

252
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,000
God man, God man, God man, God man.

253
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,040
Bob made his radio debut on the new DVD Bob the Ultimate Collection.

254
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,360
Bob made his debut on radio.

255
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,540
For more information about Bob, please visit bob.com.

256
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,660
Bob on the radio.

257
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,860
It's a Bob show.

258
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,440
How do you do, ladies and gentlemen?

259
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,100
This is Bob.

260
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,120
Thank you, Bob.

261
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,900
Say, Connie, you get around quite a bit, don't you?

262
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,240
I'm going to ball, Jill.

263
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,480
Yes, Bob.

264
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,100
Jill's cunt.

265
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,560
So many plugs in there, Tommy.

266
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,180
Bob, one more cuck like that.

267
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,040
Did they ball girl, too?

268
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,480
Yeah, I had a lot of fun.

269
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,520
Isn't that wonderful, guys?

270
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:50,820
Butch.

271
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,180
Bob, you're a good boy.

272
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:52,320
You're a good boy.

273
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,320


274
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,320


275
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,320


276
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,320


277
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,320


278
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,320


279
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,320


280
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,120
Philo, you're a genius in a moronic sort of way.

281
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,160
Say, where's Philo?

282
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,000
He's in the back room listening to gang bangsters.

283
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:57,860
Gang bangsters.

284
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,620
Get that, Philo.

285
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,500
Hello?

286
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,060
Shut up.

287
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,320
Hello?

288
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,920
Shut up.

289
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,120
Down, Philo.

290
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,200
Say, Connie, why are there three girls going around and around without stopping?

291
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,020
Look, Bob.

292
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,520
What?

293
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:09,960
There's a woman.

294
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,700
Let's go right over there.

295
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,940
Let's ball, girls, Connie.

296
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,460
Okay, Bob, but leave the nipples.

297
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,080
That like what?

298
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,800
Quiet, Philo.

299
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,120
Bob.

300
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,120
Yeah, well, I'll buy the tickets.

301
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,660
I got the right tickets.

302
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,140
No, no, no, Bob.

303
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,020
Bob, I'll get them.

304
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,920
I've got some money.

305
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,100
Yeah, what have you got for 20 cents?

306
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,780
Say, Bob.

307
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,420
Bob.

308
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:22,640
What?

309
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,080
Look at that woman.

310
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,720
Say, Connie, who's that blonde down her face?

311
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,540
Who is that?

312
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,780
Oh, that's the brunette who taught me how to move my lips.

313
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,020
A little torture on a loose lip?

314
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,640
Yeah, sing the torture song, Philo.

315
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:40,080
Well, that song's here again, but this time we get Bob's own version of it.

316
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,380
My yellow mommy.

317
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,900
Only two things in this world are possible.

318
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:48,900


319
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:48,900


320
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:48,900


321
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:48,900


322
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:48,900


323
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:48,900


324
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:48,900


325
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:48,900


326
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:48,900


327
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:48,900


328
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:48,900


329
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:48,900


330
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,760
The world is a world of death and taxes.

331
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,500
Our bodies act outside our control in terms of their process of decay, leading eventually

332
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,140
to death as well as in their behavior as we conduct our lives.

333
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:06,300
The need to exert control over our surroundings leads humans to attempt control over our bodies.

334
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,620
But notions of the physical integrity of the body seem futile, given that our bodies are

335
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,740
leaky bags of liquid from which all manner of things exude in an uncontrolled fashion,

336
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,260
reminding us that life lies outside our control.

337
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:26,260
The skin serves as a boundary, like that between our world and the supernatural one, in which

338
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,380
one side should not mingle with the other.

339
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:34,360
For this reason, religions are vitally concerned with issues of purity and pollution as they

340
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,520
relate to body fluids.

341
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,780
Contact with blood can make one impure, but drinking the blood of a god can aid salvation.

342
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,720
The never-ending quest to overcome our bodies' messiness and degeneration is the only way

343
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:46,940
to overcome religion.

344
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,900
As well as attempts to impose order on the uncontrollability of death itself, are half

345
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,500
of religion.

346
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,460
Everything else, that's the other half.

347
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,720
Thank you very much.

348
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,560
Carter and I have actually, we're gonna try something here sort of

349
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:02,840
Try it!

350
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,040
Well we try everything once.

351
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,740
You should try everything once by the way, I, I fully agree with this, you should try

352
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,520
everything once and some things you, you can keep trying.

353
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,680
There's a lot of things I like to keep trying.

354
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,700
Mm, I can think of a few.

355
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:16,700


356
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,880
about things I could keep trying.

357
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,620
I honestly hate the pulpit

358
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,480
because I'm a little more free,

359
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,940
but I was talking about things I like to keep trying.

360
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,720
And the eternity at last is this.

361
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,380

00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:21,280
And before that, a ton of love and stuff by Reverend Norell Preff of norellpreff.com.

390
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,340
Including that cool song, Godman, and all the collages.

From PR News in Washington, I'm provocative. Police say I'm still being investigated.

394
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,720
Utility crews in Northern California rolled over several times.

395
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,620
On a snow-covered mountain in Colorado.

396
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,460
Witnesses say PR's bad.

397
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,060
The White House managed to reach a phone and call for help today.

398
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,520
Rescue crews are en route.

399
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,960
The FBI says 2% by 6.5%.

00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,540
On Wall Street, 29.

401
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,020
Six snowmobilers detonated a blast that killed personal trainers following a ski trip to Telluride.

402
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:23,580
The presidential candidates from both parties injected Hillary Clinton with performance-enhancing PR news from Washington.

Crying wolf, crying wolf.

430
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,560
Unhappiness.

431
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,780
You know, we're really unhappy.

432
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,140
You know, we're really unhappy.

433
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,160
Okay, that's it.

434
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:40,800
The thing's over.

435
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,140
I don't even know what we're doing together.

436
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,440
It's a disaster together.

437
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,300
You know, God, you look like hell today.

438
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,060
Are you sick?

439
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,480
Are you sure you're not sick?

440
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,200
You look terrible.

441
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,140
We're living evenly.

442
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,600
You're having problems.

443
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,860
You have no power.

444
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,540
None.

445
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:54,720
None.

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,360
Zero.

447
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,700
You are caught like a puppet.

448
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,900
Confidence doesn't exist.

449
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,800
Confidence doesn't exist.

450
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,480
Happiness does not exist.

451
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,620
There is no happiness in the world.

452
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,980
There is no happiness.

453
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,740
That clap is coming to you.

454
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,900
But I'm not going to touch that right now.

455
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,200
Your life is, it's a little bitter pill.

456
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,500
And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and.

457
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:30,140
What's the ugliest part of your body?

458
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,780
What's the ugliest part of your body?

459
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,200
Some say your nose.

460
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,240
Some say your toes.

461
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,060
But I think it's your mind.

462
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,640
I think it's your mind.

463
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,080
Yeah, mind.

464
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:06,300
Yeah, pass it.

465
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,840
I hope this will save the world

466
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:08,840


467
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:08,840


468
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:08,840


469
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:08,840


470
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:08,840


471
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:09,620
This is a ride-a-like.

472
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,060
I'm from a place

473
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,060


474
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,060


475
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,060

478
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,060


479
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,060


480
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,020
Thank you.

481
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:54,520
Thank you.

482
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,160
Thank you.

483
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,740
Hey!

484
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,100
Hey!

485
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,640
Hey!

486
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,160


487
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:51,920
Hey!

488
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,740
Hey!

489
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:08,180
Maggie Pierce and EJ did that cover of the Frank Zappa song

490
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,240
on their CD of all cover songs.

491
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,820
And I just saw a great video about them, Maggie Pierce and EJ.

492
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,100
And you can learn all about all of it from their website at,

493
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,540
got that pencil ready, mpeband.com.

494
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:32,380
And now, well, after some intellectual insufficiency by Norell Craft,

495
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:40,800
we will go back in time to ESO Radio from 2002 on WCSB Cleveland

496
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:47,120
with the late Professor Chaz Smith and the usually late Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

497
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,920
After that, more Norell with special surprise.

498
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

499
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,120
Well, if there is one thing that holds true around family dinner tables,

500
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,320
it's that family should never mix, mix, mix.

501
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,160
Weak Mormonism.

502
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,120
Weak Baptist roots.

503
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,020
Robbing, raping, murdering, stealing.

504
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,980
Then I think they should go right on robbing, raping, murdering, stealing.

505
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,180
Same-sex marriage led evangelicals to come out by the millions.

506
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:09,980
Weak Republican.

507
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,880
And American.

508
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,900
Taboo at a UBS.

509
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,980
On their pain trail.

510
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,720
Pain, pain.

511
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,440
American atheists, they get ass.

512
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,260
Tonight we get ass.

513
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:16,780
Harry Jackson.

514
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,000
Well, obviously, I think a lot.

515
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,360
Absolutely nothing.

516
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:20,720
Ass.

517
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,220
Jackson.

518
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:21,540
Jackson.

519
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,600
Terror, terror, terror, terror, terror, terror.

520
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,500
As a cult.

521
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,600
Well, I should like to think.

522
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,480
Alone, don't make a public scene of it.

523
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:28,720
Right.

524
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:29,500
Arrogant.

525
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,600
I'm more pious than you are.

526
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,440
The people I hang out with are the ones that are the real Americans, and you're not.

527
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,180
Not there.

528
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:34,760
Obviously.

529
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,440
People being used.

530
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:36,860
Good.

531
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:37,800
Intellectually.

532
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,760
Intellectually insufficient.

533
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:39,940
Take a look at me.

534
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,300
I am proud of my waffler or flip-flopper.

535
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:42,680
Exposed.

536
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,360
It doesn't count.

537
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,100
You're going to hell if you're not an environmentalist.

538
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,280
What about the atheists?

539
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:46,920
But, but.

540
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,140
What about the atheists?

541
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,180
Well, I have, well, I have.

542
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:49,540
Huckabeef.

543
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:49,900
Huckabeef.

544
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,620
Well, well, well.

545
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:50,940
Well, fear.

546
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,000
Take it off the table.

547
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,400
Thank you.

548
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:52,720
Thank you.

549
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,000
Thank you.

550
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,280
Thank you.

551
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,260
There goes newspaper.

552
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,600
It's all the people going down the scene.

553
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,440
Communism.

554
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,160
Communism.

555
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,880
In communist countries, they only have one newspaper.

556
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,620
Christianity is stupid.

557
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,700
In communist countries.

558
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,640
Communism is good.

559
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,100
But people can't decide what the government's going to do in the war zones.

560
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,080
And that's why I say this Bush man is a communist.

561
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,660
It's totalitarianism.

562
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,300
I'm amazed hearing that coming from a Texan.

563
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,200
It's the devil pretends to be good.

564
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,320
From a proletarian.

565
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,180
Meaning of the word proletarianism.

566
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,440
God.

567
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,480
Pretends to be a capitalist.

568
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,100
But it's communism.

569
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,600
Communism.

570
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,360
That is creeping into America.

571
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,420
Communism.

572
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:37,880
Yes.

573
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,880
Communism.

574
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,120
In a file of perspiration.

575
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,700
It's a commonist capitalism.

576
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,380
I think it's also called couch potatoism.

577
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,240
And the other muted hues.

578
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,680
Commons are coming.

579
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,160
And I feel that.

580
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,180
We are slipping slowly down the backslide.

581
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,560
Common.

582
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,420
Of other nations that have gone before.

583
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,300
It's common.

584
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
It is creeping.

585
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,880
Common men are everywhere in communism.

586
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,140
It is a form of Marxism, socialism, and all those other nasty, nasty words.

587
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,120
Common, come over here.

588
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,060
Common, please.

589
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,540
Communists and Nazis.

590
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,820
They're under my bed.

591
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,920
I like them there.

592
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,640
They're under every one of my beds.

593
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,140
Both.

594
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,540
Both of them.

595
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,180
Commies and Nazis.

596
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,320
And pinks.

597
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,080
I don't make pinkos.

598
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,580
And the Genghis Khan hordes.

599
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,480
I like those uniforms too.

600
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,220
Humans.

601
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,620
Humans.

602
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,800
Another low flyby.

603
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,920
We're still the next to go.

604
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,980
There's humans again.

605
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,700
Another number came up.

606
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,520
I think it was 45.

607
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,200
We will bring them down.

608
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,840
Someday their kind will fall.

609
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:48,300
And our kind shall rise up out of the ditches and the holes.

610
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,120
Like a phoenix.

611
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,160
Like a phoenix.

612
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,160


613
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,160


614
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,160


615
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,160


616
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,160


617
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,160


618
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,160


619
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,160


620
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,160


621
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,960
We shall swarm skyward and spew our mails from upon.

622
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:00,100
You're listening to No Veil Games, I see, but let the humans laugh at us now.

623
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,220
Our time is coming.

624
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:08,520
While they still have teeth and jaws and those tendons that go behind your chin and nostrils.

625
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,800
There are no more teeth.

626
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,460
Radiation is our friend.

627
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,080
Yes.

628
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,300
We eat uranium and old rotten wires.

629
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,960
And we shall dispute them.

630
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,140
And we shall...

631
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,280
At the nuclear plants.

632
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:20,580
The...

633
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,060
We shall displace the humans.

634
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,400
We will be the new conspiracists.

635
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,720
There's a worm.

636
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,620
You can evacuate so easily with just one fart.

637
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,380
It's like Gidget or even Toothpump.

638
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,000
We, the roaches, shall be the new exterminators.

639
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,240
Yes.

640
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,480
The new exterminators.

641
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,940
And the humans will be the bugs.

642
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,300
The shrimp.

643
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,840
The barbies.

644
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,400
The kinmen.

645
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,660
The sound boys.

646
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:48,960
We'll...

647
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,140
We'll...

648
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,140


649
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,760
We'll get them.

650
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,740
Get and get them.

651
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,360
Thame and all their friends.

652
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,420
Is your nightmare ending yet, man?

653
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,940
We should...

654
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,700
Thame.

655
00:23:59,700 --> 00:23:59,920
I hate Thame.

656
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,400
You've been tossing and turning for a long time.

657
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,160
I hate Thame too.

658
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,280
We thought you were gonna break your collarbone or maybe...

659
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,560
Like I comes by me hatin' fans.

660
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,060
Look, this one's got six toes.

661
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,300
I hate him as long as you have.

662
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,660
Look, this one's eyes are sewn shut.

663
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,040
And no problems with him.

664
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,120


665
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,120


666
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,120


667
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,120


668
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,120


669
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,120


670
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,120


671
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,120


672
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,120


673
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,120


674
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,120


675
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,120


676
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,120


677
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,040
I'm keepin' dreamin'.

678
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,780
No problem at all.

679
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,480
Yeah, just...

680
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,120
Stay asleep.

681
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,340
Don't...

682
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,420
Don't wake.

683
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,860
Don't...

684
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,600
Don't wake.

685
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,060
I...

686
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,620
I...

687
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,720
That's the opposite message of...

688
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,640
of...

689
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:36,780
of...

690
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,240
of...

691
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:37,400
of...

692
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:37,520
of...

693
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:37,940
of...

694
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,600
of...

695
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:38,680
of...

696
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:38,680


697
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:38,720
of...

698
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:38,720


699
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:38,740
of...

700
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:38,740


701
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:38,740


702
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,720
of...

703
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:39,720


704
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:39,920
of...

705
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,420
of...

706
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,420
Sheila, she said hot

707
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,200
fish.

708
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:08,520
...

709
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,480
Superstition everywhere.

710
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,920
Cult overcomes them partially.

711
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,660
Rainfall agriculture which allows loners.

712
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,220
Irrigation agriculture which favors community.

713
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,220
Division of labor plus exchange and trade bring mutual cooperation even outside the tribe.

714
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,600
The impulse is always there though.

715
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,160
Kill or enslave the outsider.

716
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,180
Gradual science from Athens is compact with reason.

717
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,200
Division of labor, trade, the mastery of knowledge plus time brought surplus,

718
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,700
sometimes a peaceful extended order.

719
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,280
Rules diversely evolved in the cooperation of strangers.

720
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,080
Always warring against the fierce default of tribalism, violence, and ignorance.

721
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,200
No one who teaches you knows what will happen.

722
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:36,560
Thank you.

723
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,400
All right, thank you.

724
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:46,620
So the human brain was designed, if I can use that word, by an engineer sitting at his desk,

725
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,300
trying to work on some problem, feel like he's in a rut, tweak our cognitive processes,

726
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,940
our social patterns, our personalities, psychopharmacology.

727
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:00,880
And I'm not talking about, you know, a beer after work.

728
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,080
There's a, and I know for a fact, but I know for a fact

729
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,540
that that is a very important part of human life.

730
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,740
Transcranial magnetic stimulation, a little zap, simply by thinking.

731
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,720
Thank you.

732
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,200
Okay.

733
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,180
Presidential poll, primary pop hack.

734
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:21,100
Let's hear it for the subgenius, Power of Squash.

735
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,460
They're being well out of proportion and they, you know, they're amazing.

736
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,680
And we've seen it in unusual places.

737
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,020
Thank you.

738
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,120
Thank you.

739
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,540
Thank you.

740
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,220
Thank you.

741
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:37,960
Thank you.

742
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,340
Thank you.

743
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,200
Thank you.

744
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,400
And it's not over yet.

745
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,920
I think I like that idea.

746
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,040
I'm afraid.

747
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,020
What does patriotism mean?

748
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,260
Air.

749
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,080
Breath of self.

750
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,300
Breath of self.

751
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,220
And may I say to you that patriotism is fear of America.

752
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,300
Vote for a real patriot.

753
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,160
Vote for Hollywood.

754
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,840
Cheap and easy, cheap and easy.

755
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,860
And may I add, men can stand erect and unafraid.

756
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,080
Vote for Hollywood.

757
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,600
Rights shall be denied.

758
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,000
Rights shall be denied.

759
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,060
Rights shall be denied.

760
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,320
And may I say to you that we must, as eager as any of us, our economic system is bankrupt.

761
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,520
Our economic system is bankrupt.

762
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,540
Move us back.

763
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,280
Hothead.

764
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:15,640
Hothead.

765
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,020
Recklessness and weakness.

766
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,040
And may I point out dishonesty and incompetence.

767
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,660
We want better living.

768
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,420
Road head.

769
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,280
Listen.

770
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,680
March backwards into a comfortable and safely Republican past.

771
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,040
Corruption in office.

772
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,440
Corruption in public office.

773
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,780
And another thing.

774
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,120
What's more, I've learned by actual experience.

775
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:34,980
How to live.

776
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:34,980


777
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:34,980


778
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,880
How to use an axe.

779
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,280
Corruption in office.

780
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:37,740
The naughty.

781
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,100
The naughty.

782
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:38,620
Listen.

783
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,340
Fair.

784
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,320
Solid.

785
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:40,700
Fair.

786
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,480
Solid.

787
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:41,740
Fair.

788
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,160
Solid.

789
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:42,500
Fair.

790
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:42,720
Solid.

791
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,460
I don't like.

792
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,120
I don't like.

793
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,320
I don't like free markets.

794
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,340
Listen.

795
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,120
Tyranny.

796
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,360
Turn back the clock.

797
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,320
And embrace in futility and fear.

798
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,600
That's your choice.

799
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,000
Vote for Hollywood.

800
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,280
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States, Mrs. Laura Bush.

801
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,540
Welcome to the White.

802
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,580
Thank you for coming.

803
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,640
Today is a chance to celebrate National DOPS Day.

804
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:04,980
And I'm going to be a little bit more formal.

805
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:04,980


806
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,700
Every year in the United States, more than 150,000 love DOPS.

807
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,800
And in many different countries around the world.

808
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,840
One destination.

809
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:14,800
DOPS.

810
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,600
It's an act.

811
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,940
And children with special needs are especially hungry.

812
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,220
I'm proud that one of them is my husband.

813
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,400
Four out of every ten Americans has considered DOPS.

814
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,540
I'm a wannabe.

815
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,200
Wannabe.

816
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,000
Wannabe.

817
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,800
Wannabe.

818
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,520
DOPS.

819
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,960
Thank you all for coming.

820
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,160
And we're pleased to join you on National DOPS Day.

821
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,200
And I know.

822
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,880
I want to thank the members of the National DOPS Coalition who've joined us.

823
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,140
Few missions in life are more rewarding.

824
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,500
You've shared it with others.

825
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:50,060
And in so doing, you've strengthened what is the very foundation of our country.

826
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:50,740
Drug addiction.

827
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:56,820
National DOPS Day also reminds us that nothing is more vital to this country's future.

828
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,420
DOPS rushed to the scene of the World Trade Center on September the 11th, 2001.

829
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,100
We want to thank you for coming.

830
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,500
Strangers, look into the joys.

831
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,820
I want to thank you all for coming.

832
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,960
Four, four, four, sinners, sinners, eeeeee.

833
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,520
Thank you all for coming.

834
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,920
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

835
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,420
DOPS is not what it ought to be.

836
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,420
98, R. Ford.

837
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,100
DOPS.

838
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,480

00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:27,940
DOPS.

842
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:27,940


843
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,000
DOPS.

844
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,160
DOPS.

845
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:28,720
DOPS.

846
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,480
DOPS.

847
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:29,780
DOPS.

00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:29,780

00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,340
DOPS.

851
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:32,440
DOPS.

852
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,420
DOPS.

853
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:33,840
DOPS.

854
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,580
DOPS.

855
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:35,720
DOPS.

856
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:35,820
DOPS.

857
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,800
DOPS.

858
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,020
DOPS.

859
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,020


860
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,020


861
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,020


862
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,200
DoPS.

863
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,600
DOPS.

864
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,180
DOPS.

865
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,340
DAWGS WHAT YOU BRING TO THE W realizing how the correction of drug happen,

866
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,980
Here someone is reading some

867
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:51,980


868
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,920
Give me the privatization of property

869
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,200
In my next article

870
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,420
Another one

875
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,580
People are being slaughtered on our highways.

876
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,420
Go for the baby! The baby!

877
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,500
Start the jam!

878
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,360
Is that the arm that came off the 98?

879
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,800
Oh, shit!

880
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,040
We have positive proof

881
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,280
that it was none other than the treacherous French

882
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,840
who have been sabotaging our great race.

883
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,500
Anybody who is unhappy

884
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,660
with happiness can go find

885
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,700
someplace else to live.

886
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,040
Our American way of life!

887
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,860
Sure, it's violent, but that's the way we love it!

888
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,480
Violent, violent, violent!

889
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,140
And that's why we love you!

890
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,960
And Bob loves you, dear friend.

891
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,040
Norrell Preff did most of that,

892
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,220
aside from the Hour of Slack promo

893
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,340
by Leemur.

894
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,620
And this background music

898
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,480
is really

00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,980
Rue and I's song,

Dobbs One.

901
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,660
I don't know much about Rue and I,

902
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,500
but we'll run the whole thing soon.

903
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,120
Some future show with no yak over it.

904
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,020
We have some radio preaching coming up

905
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,200

906
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,780

909
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,520

912
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,700

913
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,340
from Pirate Cat Radio in San Francisco.

914
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,320
Dr. Hell and Puzzling Evidence in Mongoloid.

915
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,280
And why just about everything else,

916
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,620
which you can also learn about

917
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,640
from subgenius.com,

918
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,700
where we

00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,240
I can do something.

923
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,500
And just stopping people from coming.

924
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,580
Far the worse.

925
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,080
Far the worse.

926
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:19,680
I can do something.

927
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,540
You know what?

same-sex marriage,

955
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,720
things that make us Republicans.

956
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,920
I'll be anybody's president.

957
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,260
The war in Iraq,

958
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,960
now it's failed.

959
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,560
I'm in favor of torture,

960
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,560
I'm in favor of torture,

961
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,000
things that make us Republicans.

962
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:42,640
What the,

963
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:42,900
what the,

964
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,160
what the,

965
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,820
wha-wha-what the,

966
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,140
what the,

967
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:44,880
wha-wha-what the,

968
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,880
play totally distorted,

969
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,220
you know,

970
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,380
WWE.

971
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,440
This rhetoric isn't gonna get us anywhere.

972
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,280
This rhetoric isn't gonna get us anywhere.

973
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,400
A day after they formally agreed

974
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,200
to restart peace talks,

975
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,160
President Bush pledged to Israeli

976
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,320
he's determined to drop the ball.

977
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,440
We will use our power to drop the ball.

978
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:06,200
Stung by criticism, Bush stung by criticism, Bush out, Bush out.

979
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:06,880
It's nothing.

980
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,340
I don't believe in the speeches, just failure.

981
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,140
The memory of previous failures weighs heavily upon us, the White House.

982
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,860
Tortured, the president tortured, the president busted, the president cover up of war crimes.

983
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,280
More money for the Iraq war, preventing an expansion of children's health care.

984
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,600
Bush expressed delight.

985
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,380
I'm pleased.

986
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,620
Busted, the president.

987
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,620
Don't, please.

988
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,600
After more than four years of fighting.

989
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,840
Could be backsliding.

990
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,480
A powerful explosion of.

991
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,100
A suspension at the Vatican.

992
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,600
The judge isn't commenting.

993
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,960
This administration has failed.

994
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,580
Too much power.

995
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,620
Ripping grass.

996
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,560
Gay sex life on television.

997
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,680
Continued manipulations and adjustments to our military strategy.

998
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,780
I am quite confident.

999
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,420
He didn't feel like he was sinning by having sex with gay men.

1000
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,300
Catastrophic failure.

1001
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,900
Armory power of the state.

1002
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,680
Having sex with gay men.

1003
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,160
There has been a glaring unfortunate display.

1004
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,880
Of incompetent strategic leadership within our national leaders.

1005
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,940
Vatican teaching holds that homosexual activity is having sex with gay men.

1006
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,580
Gay gay gay.

1007
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,360
One one.

1008
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,580
It it it it it it it it.

1009
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,960
Yes or yes or yes.

1010
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,780
Hello, you're on the air.

1011
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:09,740
Greetings, Earthlings.

1012
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,080
We come in peace.

1013
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,640
We would ask you to take us to your leader, but we have seen him and we are not impressed.

1014
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,080
Yep.

1015
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:17,980
We are depressed.

1016
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,440
Are we?

1017
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,240
He says, he says, greetings, Earthlings.

1018
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,880
And everybody listening kind of looks around like, what?

1019
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,280
What?

1020
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,220
Who is he talking to?

1021
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:27,500
Yeah, really?

1022
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,160
Greetings, depressed Earth listeners.

1023
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,720
Your problems will soon be over.

1024
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,620
Is that good or bad?

1025
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,660
Well, I don't know.

1026
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,720
It is what you make of it.

1027
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,900
Are they making a little joke to themselves?

1028
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:48,920
Are they expecting us to get something and go, or I don't know.

1029
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:50,860
Nuance.

1030
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,100
That's what those that's what the extraterrestrial birds have over the rest of us.

1031
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:55,760
Nuance.

1032
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,100
Nuance.

1033
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,220
And their psychotelometric messages.

1034
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:08,520
See what the boys in the back room will have and tell them I'm having the same.

1035
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,520
Go see what the boys in the back room will have and give them the poison they need.

1036
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:24,300
And when I die, don't spend my money on flowers and my picture in a frame.

1037
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,600
Just see what the boys in the back room will have.

1038
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,220
And tell them I sighed.

1039
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,180
And tell them I cried.

1040
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,040
And tell them I died at the scene.

1041
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:45,900
And when I die, don't buy a casket of silver with the candles all aflame.

1042
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,760
Just see what the boys in the back room will have and tell them I sighed.

1043
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,480
And tell them I cried.

1044
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,980
And tell them I died at the scene.

1045
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:10,500
And when I die, don't pay the preacher for speaking of my glory and my fame.

1046
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:20,240
Just see what the boys in the back room will have and tell them I sighed.

1047
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,740
And tell them I cried.

1048
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:22,740


1049
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:22,740


1050
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:22,740


1051
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,440
And tell them I cried.

1052
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:35,640
And tell them I died of the same.

1053
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,940
For ages, the Church of Subgenius had a Dallas mailing address.

1054
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,840
And why the move?

1055
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,420
There's a painful story behind it.

1056
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,740
Well, it became clear that what was happening in Dallas...

1057
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:59,960
Dallas, as far as the conspiracy, had, you know, has a real serious headquarters in Dallas.

1058
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,740
And they've just started to spread like a cancer.

1059
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,400
We could tell that there was going to be no escape if we didn't get out soon.

1060
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:12,480
From Dallas to Fort Worth, it became pure conspiracy.

1061
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,860
Then it spread all the way to Austin.

1062
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,260
Soon San Antonio will be engulfed.

1063
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,100
And we just had to get while the getting was good.

1064
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,320
Also, the most beautiful...

1065
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,200
The most beautiful woman in the world lived in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1066
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,180
Whammo!

1067
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:30,000
I thought that was obvious to everybody, why we moved.

1068
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:38,580
And then also there was that unfortunate matter of Jesus of Nazareth clumsily losing the P.O. Box in Dallas.

1069
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,160
Well, but we had moved away from Dallas years before that happened.

1070
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:49,500
We were keeping the old Dallas P.O. Box just to save those last few souls that straggled in.

1071
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,020
But now they're lost.

1072
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,740
Lost for good.

1073
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,080
Unless they decide to look on the internet, type in the word subgenius on the internet,

1074
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,040
suddenly it will...

1075
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,220
All will come...

1076
00:38:59,220 --> 00:38:59,640
Lost.

1077
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,000
True to you.

1078
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,120
All will come clear.

1079
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:04,620
What?

1080
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,640
Subgenius.com.

1081
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,080
Yes.

1082
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:07,760
It's easy.

1083
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,600
By the way, subgenius is spelled without an O.

1084
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,780
Although, if you do misspell it, you will still get there because it happens so much.

1085
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,600
It'll say subgenius.

1086
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,180
You mean subgenius?

1087
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,300
Subgeniaus.

1088
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,600
Subgeniaus.

1089
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,060
Yeah.

1090
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,980
The plural is?

1091
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,100
The plural is both subgeniuses and subgeni.

1092
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:31,820
Subgeni.

1093
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,120
Used alternately.

1094
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,260
One of them is more affectionate than the other.

1095
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,300
It's like octopuses and octopi.

1096
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,600
Or ustadki too.

1097
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:40,740
Right.

1098
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,480
There you go.

1099
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,300
Well, except in my...

1100
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,400
I just use them...

1101
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,300
I try to alternate.

1102
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:52,480
There are some people who think that subgeni is like some cutesy word for one subgenius.

1103
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:52,740
Like, I don't know.

1104
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,100
Oh, he's a good subgeni.

1105
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,500
That's another thing.

1106
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,080
I would excommunicate them personally.

1107
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:58,640
Yeah.

1108
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,700
You can spot the poser so easily.

1109
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,860
They don't put a quote on Bob.

1110
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,820
They think frop is marijuana.

1111
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,900
They, you know...

1112
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,300
Hey.

1113
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,140
Hey.

1114
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,420
Did you know that Bob spelled backwards still says Bob?

1115
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,020
Without the quotes.

1116
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,840
So, how does one become excommunicated from the church?

1117
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,720
It can happen.

1118
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,440
And?

1119
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,300
And?

1120
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:22,740


1121
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,260
Silence.

1122
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,260
Silence.

1123
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,800
We don't discuss...

1124
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
We stop staying.

1125
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,800
Anybody who's ever been...

1126
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,300
Stop staying.

1127
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,760
We don't discuss those cases.

1128
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,440
To discuss them would be to include them.

1129
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,240
But it has happened.

1130
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,380
And maybe even bring them home.

1131
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:34,680
Well...

1132
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,760
But we try to...

1133
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,340
It's never a formal kind of thing.

1134
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,460
We just either...

1135
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,360
We torture them.

1136
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:40,600
Okay.

1137
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,420
Or kill them or drive them away or something.

1138
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:42,780
Yeah.

1139
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,960
We make them go away.

1140
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:44,540
Yeah.

1141
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,480
It's a deprogrammer.

1142
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,200
There's some...

1143
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,620
I'll admit.

1144
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,500
There's sometimes there are people who get...

1145
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,260
They just get too into it.

1146
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,620
We have to deprogram.

1147
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,280
Yeah.

1148
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,340
Because they forget that Bob is a short-duration personal savior.

1149
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,780
And it needs renewal, actually.

1150
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,440
Yeah.

1151
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,500
From time to time.

1152
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:01,960
Get away from it.

1153
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,920
And recharge your...

1154
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,520
The spring planting.

1155
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:05,960
Get a little of Bob.

1156
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,360
If you just plant a coiled steel spring in...

1157
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,200
Oh, well.

1158
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,180
It's really not even worth discussing, actually.

1159
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,460
Hello, caller?

1160
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,580
Hello, caller.

1161
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,180
Are you on the air?

1162
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,120
Ding!

1163
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:20,940
Ding!

1164
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:21,160


1165
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:21,320
Ding!

1166
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:21,740
Ding!

1167
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,640
Ding!

1168
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:22,680
Ding!

1169
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:22,680


1170
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:22,680


1171
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:22,680


1172
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:22,680


1173
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:22,680


1174
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:22,680


1175
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:22,680


1176
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:22,680


1177
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:22,680


1178
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:22,680


1179
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:22,680


1180
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:22,680


1181
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:22,680


1182
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:26,580
It's calling season in hell on Pirate Cat Radio.

1183
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,100
I'm in San Francisco in Los Angeles.

1184
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:33,380
And on the internet at piratecatradio.com.

1185
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,480
We're in the studio this evening.

1186
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,800
Reverend Ivan Stang all the way out from Cleveland, Ohio.

1187
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,660
Joining us here in the beautiful sunny skies of San Francisco.

1188
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,140
Even at this late hour, the sun is bright.

1189
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,600
We have Lloyd Mongoloid in the studio again this evening.

1190
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,180
After an excellent Mongoloid-a-palooza show.

1191
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,080
Yeah.

1192
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,720
At 12 Galcom.

1193
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,580
He's last Saturday night.

1194
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,080
The rafters are still ringing.

1195
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,100
Yes, yes.

1196
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,300
And Dr. Hal.

1197
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,060
Yeah.

1198
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,760
In the studio this evening as well.

1199
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,220
Yes.

1200
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:04,060
I'm coming in on the odd-numbered days, it would appear.

1201
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,700
And we also have puzzling evidence.

1202
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,100
Yeah.

1203
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,600
Wandering the dance hall.

1204
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,080
Yeah.

1205
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,040
Looking for girls.

1206
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:09,700
On the wireless.

1207
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,600
And K-Rob.

1208
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,080
On the job.

1209
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,860
Playing the dance music for us right now.

1210
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,940
Giving us some Devo music.

1211
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,120
Hello, you're on the air.

1212
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:18,600
Yeah.

1213
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,800
Yeah, welcome to the program.

1214
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,600
Oh, hey.

1215
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,200
Hey.

1216
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,220
Uh, Dr. Sinister.

1217
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,840
Oh, it's Professor Stang.

1218
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:26,740
Yes.

1219
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,120
Uh, hold on.

1220
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,500
Let me turn my radio down like a good listener.

1221
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,860
I had to turn my...

1222
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,200
There we go.

1223
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:34,800
...into something else.

1224
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,580
So, the game's all here.

1225
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,100
Uh, I...

1226
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,900
Yeah, just as you picked up the phone, Princess Weave started hollering for me downstairs.

1227
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,300
My brain got split into twain.

1228
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,180
Oh, no, man.

1229
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:50,160
There's a whole part of your brain just dedicated to, like, responding to your wife calling

1230
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:50,600
for you.

1231
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,420
Probably.

1232
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:51,560
Probably.

1233
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,400
Oh.

1234
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:52,500
It's...

1235
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,080
It's like...

1236
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,560
There's probably, like, a unique part of the brain that only lights up when that happens

1237
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,920
and, like, immediately triggers that, yes, dear.

1238
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:58,940
It's also...

1239
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:03,200
It's a quarter of a brain cell, but I only have a half a brain cell.

1240
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,020
Oh, dear.

1241
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,400
She has the other half.

1242
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:05,920
Oh, dear.

1243
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,320
Yeah, they say that when, uh, the idea of fawning, even, you know, you imitate a fawn

1244
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:18,840
or a wounded deer produces an empathic, um, some sort of, uh, empathic thing in the breast

1245
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,480
of the male.

1246
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,400
Well, this is Princess Weave.

1247
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,040
We are doe we're talking about.

1248
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:23,840
Right.

1249
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,560
Probably broke some windows in the house and some mirrors.

1250
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,640
Then the noises.

1251
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,760
She is a deer, though.

1252
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:33,920
Ah, yes.

1253
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,620
And I do fawn on her.

1254
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,580
Oh, goodness.

1255
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,080
I have to.

1256
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,320
Oh, yay, yay, yay, yay.

1257
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,140
But I want to.

1258
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,360
Of course.

1259
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:42,980
Of course.

1260
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:49,640
I wanted to put up a bunch of balloons, like, um, you know, hydrocephalic balloons with,

1261
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,680
um, Orson Welles.

1262
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,160
Has...

1263
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,940
He's doing, um, the telltale heart.

1264
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,120
And he would be, like, real fat, you know?

1265
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,820
Oh, never mind.

1266
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:00,460
Some guy that I work with keeps calling me Orson Welles.

1267
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,200
Well, he's attributing your...

1268
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,160
Keeps calling me Orson.

1269
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,140
...greatness, and he's also making fun of the fact that you're one-third his size

1270
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,900
horizontally or vertically.

1271
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,340
Could be.

1272
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,340
Yeah, I don't...

1273
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,680
I don't get that at all.

1274
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,340
Me neither.

1275
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:18,220
Maybe you actually appreciate the medium, which he thinks is silly.

1276
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,880
You know, like, oh, okay, Orson Welles.

1277
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,620
Orson Welles Radio.

1278
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:22,920
Now, this is...

1279
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,580
Yeah, this is somebody from my conspiracy job who calls me Orson.

1280
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,580
Oh, maybe it's just...

1281
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:29,640
As you can...

1282
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,720
Well, Orson Welles was famous for doing a radio show that terrified everybody.

1283
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:35,460
Yeah.

1284
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,780
Caused a panic, and you do this radio show.

1285
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,780
I haven't caused any panics yet, but I have terrified a few people.

1286
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,620
I hope.

1287
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,220
Yeah, I do.

1288
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,480
You would certainly hope so.

1289
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,400
And, uh, speaking of terrifying people, I just want to let everyone know that the views

1290
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,860
and opinions expressed on this program are not those of WSB.

1291
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,320
It's listeners at Cleveland State University.

1292
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,920
That hasn't been said.

1293
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:01,020
Are we supposed to say, then, that some of these ideas are endorsed by extraterrestrials

1294
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:05,740
who have very little heart muscle or brain muscle that we would call normal?

1295
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,220
I'm just not comfortable speaking for the extraterrestrials.

1296
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,200
You know, I mean, I'll let them speak for themselves.

1297
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,600
Hello, you're on the air.

1298
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:15,960
Come on, then.

1299
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,520
Out with it.

1300
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,780
Telepathic extraterrestrials.

1301
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,360
We got the whole message, and then they signed off.

1302
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:25,640
Yep, yep, yep.

1303
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,640
But I don't really understand the last part.

1304
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,940
Did you, Professor Stang, did you get the last?

1305
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,840
It was 128-bit encrypted.

1306
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:36,240
No, I wear a special aluminum helmet all the time now.

1307
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,940
See, I told you, though, they changed the frequency of the mind control rays.

1308
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,160
The aluminum just acts as an antenna now.

1309
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,700
You need to switch to copper.

1310
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,500
Actually, that explains a lot.

1311
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:50,240
If you have those fuzzy red slippers like the old ladies where you could put little copper balls

1312
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,100
in the little pink fuzzy balls.

1313
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,340
There you go.

1314
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,640
But they work.

1315
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:59,880
I mean, I'm not saying it's cosmetically a nice thing to do to your aunt or your uncle,

1316
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,280
but it works.

1317
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:08,680
And just so you know, I have been compensated for my endorsement of the little copper fuzzy ball.

1318
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,640
For the last four years.

1319
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,240
Yeah.

1320
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:12,740
Yeah.

1321
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,300
Now, Reverend Stang is going into the ancillary control room A.

1322
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,500
He always goes over there.

1323
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,840
I believe we have enough to fill ancillary control room A and B tonight.

1324
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,460
Those are your two microphones, and these are my two microphones.

1325
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,660
Oh, they've already seized their microphones.

1326
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,640
Here's your three headphones.

1327
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,360
If you would have brought your lovely roommate with you, that would have been a fine thing.

1328
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:41,720
Three heads are better than one.

1329
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,200
I made him the offer, but he had to refuse.

1330
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,220
It's all so beneath him now.

1331
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,040
Yes, but...

1332
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,900
Who's beneath who?

1333
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:51,920
Oh, you know.

1334
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,260
Don't sexy stuff.

1335
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,600
Hierarchy of subgenius doctrine.

1336
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,320
Michael Pepe's always beneath everybody.

1337
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,720
He's called the social cockroach.

1338
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,740
...listen to me, and Gary the Broadfarm was envisioning a church without Michael Pepe.

1339
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,000
How could anyone...

1340
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:07,980
No!

1341
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,700
How does he do that?

1342
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,800
It's a shepherd's crook, not a hook.

1343
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:13,640
I don't know.

1344
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,400
I don't know.

1345
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:14,840
I don't know.

1346
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,120
I don't know.

1347
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:15,220
I don't know.

1348
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:15,220


1349
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:15,320
I don't know.

1350
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:15,380
I don't know.

1351
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:15,720
I don't know.

1352
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:15,720


1353
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:15,840
I don't know.

1354
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:16,340
I don't know.

1355
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:16,560
I don't know.

1356
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:16,640
I don't know.

1357
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,160
I don't know.

1358
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,560
I don't know.

1359
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,220
I'm running on the...

1360
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,480
I'm running on the parking ticket.

1361
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:26,100
I'm running on the vaporous fume party ticket.

1362
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,820
This is a church of truth without Michael Pepe.

1363
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,200
Michael Pepe is a trick on subgeniuses.

1364
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,700
Testify, Dr. Stang.

1365
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,480
I am Bob.

1366
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,400
I am the hope that a human can be Bob.

1367
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,120
Actually, I proved that I was Bob a little while ago.

1368
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,000
It was an astonishing revelation.

1369
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:45,620
What?

1370
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,680
Well, I know this is...

1371
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,280
Everybody's Bob these.

1372
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:55,400
But there's an actual series of legitimate connections which bring me to that spot.

1373
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,180
Oh, really?

1374
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,320
You're like seven steps from Bob.

1375
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,360
I can go through it pretty quickly.

1376
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,420
You remember Nixon and Watergate, of course.

1377
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,400
Yeah, sure.

1378
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,660
And you remember H.R. Haldeman?

1379
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,820
Yeah, H.R. Bob Haldeman.

1380
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:15,640
H.R. Bob Haldeman called himself Bob because his name was Harry Robbins Haldeman.

1381
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:16,280
No!

1382
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,840
So, if that...

1383
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,160
No.

1384
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,720
If you can call yourself Bob and that's your name, well, that's his name.

1385
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,460
And so I can call myself Bob and so therefore I am Bob.

1386
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:26,980
Bob!

1387
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:27,960
Bob!

1388
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,740
Is this yours?

1389
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,100
No, it's his.

1390
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:32,840
Thank you.

1391
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,820
Is this your tooth?

1392
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,380
Thank you.

1393
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,900
You're a beautiful audience.

1394
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,440
I just may be here all night.

1395
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,940
Would you sign this, Bob?

1396
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,060
Sign this.

1397
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,120
Sign this, Maureen.

1398
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,420
Those teeth marks are definitely the teeth of a...

1399
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:43,980
Sign this.

1400
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:44,800
Now sign this here.

1401
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,140
My teeth marks cannot be duplicated.

1402
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,480
They are a form of identification.

1403
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,060
Take this, Bob.

1404
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:49,900
I have leftovers from the last year.

1405
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,040
Put your social security number there.

1406
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,420
Just let me bite down on this and I'll be right there.

1407
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:53,980
Phone number here.

1408
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,260
Let me write my bike down.

1409
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:55,580
Sign this, Bob.

1410
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:55,580


1411
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:55,920
Sign that.

1412
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,680
Got to leave a bite mark here.

1413
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:57,940
Yes, yes.

1414
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,160
It's a bite residue.

1415
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,680
And then I'm going to make a statement which will resonate throughout the corridors of history.

1416
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,220
Pull up a microphone, young lad.

1417
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,800
Hey, didn't we figure out that this is the 25th anniversary of this show?

1418
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,720
Well, it was.

1419
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,280
It already was.

1420
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,480
We already all missed it.

1421
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,260
It was in June.

1422
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,240
It was June.

1423
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,480
It was 25 years ago.

1424
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,120
The leafy month of June.

1425
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:16,860
You know, we missed...

1426
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,020
What show in June was the one that was the closest?

1427
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,460
The 20-year anniversary of Bob's death.

1428
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,660
I mentioned it during the show, actually.

1429
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:23,320
It was the 22nd?

1430
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,840
It was the 25th of 82.

1431
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,680
That was an excellent...

1432
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:27,820
It's a first show.

1433
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,860
That was an excellent show.

1434
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,560
That was an excellent show.

1435
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,080
That was the best time, Bob.

1436
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:30,460
That was the best time.

1437
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,940
Last year at this time, we were preparing for X Day.

1438
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,540
So we had a show this summer that was the 25th anniversary.

1439
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,320
It was the...

1440
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,640
We didn't even know it.

1441
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:39,240
Well, no.

1442
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,960
I mentioned it a couple times during the show.

1443
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:41,580
But not then.

1444
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,500
It never went nowhere.

1445
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,420
Nobody cared.

1446
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,580
Oh, it's going to Iraq.

1447
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,320
I just sent a rise to Iraq.

1448
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,480
Back then we mentioned it.

1449
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:47,720
Really?

1450
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,440
I arrived.

1451
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:49,220
I arrived.

1452
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:49,460
I arrived in Iraq.

1453
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:49,780
I got a rise to Iraq, too.

1454
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:50,880
I got my...

1455
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,820
You got a rise to Iraq?

1456
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,820
I got a nephew.

1457
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,320
I got a nephew-in-law over there.

1458
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,900
He's a captain of the Marine Corps.

1459
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,800
He wants some DVDs, so I...

1460
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,020
He wants his country back?

1461
00:49:59,140 --> 00:49:59,300
DVDs.

1462
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,380
Yes, so I made a DVD of a rise.

1463
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,420
Yeah, he wants me to tell you...

1464
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,980
He's got a rise out of him, eh?

1465
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:10,400
You've got to quit calling him and making him talk about his brother, his son, what

1466
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,500
got killed over there and...

1467
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,520
I never called him a jackass.

1468
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,140
Now, you guys will be interested to know that the church has been selling memberships

1469
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:18,640
to...

1470
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:19,400
Oh, yeah.

1471
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,040
...the military people at a record rate.

1472
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:22,620
Oh, right.

1473
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,120
Yes.

1474
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,380
Once the U.S. military is in our grasp, world domination will be...

1475
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:24,840
Yeah, military people are joining up.

1476
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,320
Why are they joining the church?

1477
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,040
That might be the question you would ask.

1478
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:29,640
Why are the...

1479
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:29,880
It's...

1480
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,460
Everybody's coming back to the church.

1481
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:31,580
It's sort of like a...

1482
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,700
President Bush said there's no subgeni in Iran.

1483
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,340
The soldiers.

1484
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,380
What do you think of that?

1485
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,380
God bless our boys.

1486
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,600
That's Akhman on a dinner jacket.

1487
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,500
He said that.

1488
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,560
Back to the church bowels.

1489
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:44,060
Join the subgenius army.

1490
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,740
Your feet shall never stray.

1491
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:49,000
Once on the narrow righteous path, you follow night and day.

1492
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,000


1493
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,000


1494
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,060
Getting the boot again and again.

1495
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,660
You can hone your toenails.

1496
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,760
Going to the refrigerator to fetch a snack for me.

1497
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,780
To hone your friend's toenails.

1498
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:57,600
Yes.

1499
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,540
Atomic French toenail toast.

1500
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,880
From sea to shining sea.

1501
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,920
So, is this the subgenius old folks?

1502
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,320
Tom?

1503
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,380
This is what it's going to sound like.

1504
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,920
This is going to be an endless, mad, and chattering tea party.

1505
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,640
There's the...

1506
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,300
Guitar, guitar, guitar.

1507
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,860
...door mouse over there and...

1508
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:17,800
Spectacular!

1509
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:18,940
Spectacular!

1510
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,480
There's the hypno-toad.

1511
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:20,880
What?

1512
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,740
Whom we all obey.

1513
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:23,920
And Cleve, look.

1514
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:24,480
There's me then.

1515
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,560
What do you love the hypno-toad?

1516
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,420
Cleveland?

1517
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,240
City of Light?

1518
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,080
I love the hypno-toad too much.

1519
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,120
The Hypno-Foat.

1520
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,420
The towel was Cleveland.

1521
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:32,620
It's a hypno-Foat.

1522
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:32,980
It's a hypno-Stangman.

1523
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,280
It was snowing when I left.

1524
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,540
I'm telling toxic waste.

1525
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,300
You talk into this end and it hypnotizes you.

1526
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,060
Can't beat the classic.

1527
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:41,680
Hello?

1528
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:41,680


1529
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,680
Can't put the phone down.

1530
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,260
Hello?

1531
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:43,920
Testing.

1532
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:43,940
Testing.

1533
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,080
You just keep punching buttons.

1534
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:45,840
You're hypnotized.

1535
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,280
Testing.

1536
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,040
One, two, three.

1537
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,420
Test.

1538
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:47,620
One.

1539
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:47,880
Test.

1540
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,300
Two.

1541
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:49,680
Hello?

1542
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,320
Hello?

1543
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,180
You can't identify yourself.

1544
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:52,320
No.

1545
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,100
You can't identify yourself on the Hypno-Foat.

1546
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:55,400
It's not a test.

1547
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:55,960
It's not a test.

1548
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,000
Stop.

1549
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,380
It holds you.

1550
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,220
It retrieves you.

1551
00:51:59,220 --> 00:51:59,280
It retrieves you.

1552
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,520
And pass them to the left.

1553
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,660
It does not disturb you.

1554
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,700
Put your pencils down.

1555
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,740
It generates voice mail.

1556
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:05,780
Good heavens.

1557
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,420
It sounds overloaded over the phone.

1558
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,320
It's a multiple choice radio.

1559
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,140
And so you had to join in.

1560
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:11,900
Douglas, stop.

1561
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,740
It sounded overloaded so you join in.

1562
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:13,760


1563
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,340
Oh no!

1564
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,840
It's definitely overloaded.

1565
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,940
Hello, Philo.

1566
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:17,060
Hello.

1567
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,260
I'm surely going to fail next time.

1568
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:18,980
I'm sure you're going to fail next time.

1569
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:25,460
I'm sure you know you're not living up to the potential I know you have.

1570
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,000
You've got to knuckle down and buckle to it.

1571
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,240
You only get one chance in this life.

1572
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,680
And remember, you don't want to affect your permanent, indelible record.

1573
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,420
So enjoy today as if it's yesterday.

1574
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,740
All right, that's it.

1575
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,220
Because don't forget that yesterday is today.

1576
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,860
You've got Towsel Head and Knuckle Head.

1577
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,040
Good.

1578
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,800
And you've got a second chance at life.

1579
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:52,880
Oh, really?

1580
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:53,340
Yeah.

1581
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,580
Where do I sign?

1582
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,180
Where do I...

1583
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,860
How can I get a second chance at life?

1584
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,560
On the dotted line on that check, my friend.

1585
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,000
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

1586
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,520
So you can relive those days of starting yesterday.

1587
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:02,520


1588
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:03,380
It's about time.

1589
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,280
Can I pick the player?

1590
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,460
I know just what I'm going to do this time around.

1591
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,560
And it's all going to be different.

1592
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:11,640
Tomorrow is like yesterday, except in the future.

1593
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:11,660
What?

1594
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:12,480
You can't be me.

1595
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:14,680
I'm going to be me.

1596
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,120
Or am I?

1597
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,380
I'm going to be me.

1598
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,500
Who am I?

1599
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:18,680
Who am I?

1600
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:18,960
Who am I?

1601
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:18,960


1602
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:18,960


1603
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:18,960


1604
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,940
You're going to be me.

1605
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,160
I've got to be me.

1606
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:21,420
It's going to be me.

1607
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,880
It's going to be me.

1608
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,540
Once I've taken a pee.

1609
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,000
You've got to be me.

1610
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,560
Oh, I'll just do take care of that, partner, and I'll just go on being me.

1611
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,180
I've got to be me.

1612
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,440
How many religions are here?

1613
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:32,860
Well, there are...

1614
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:33,160
One.

1615
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,780
Let's count off.

1616
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,340
Let's count off.

1617
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:34,640
One.

1618
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:35,200
Two.

1619
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:35,720
One.

1620
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,240
One.

1621
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:36,600
One.

1622
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:36,740
One.

1623
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:36,940
One.

1624
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:37,220
One.

1625
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:37,540
One.

1626
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:38,120
One.

1627
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:38,400


1628
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:38,600
One.

1629
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:39,260
One.

1630
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,200
One.

1631
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:49,560
One.

1632
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,720
The one true religion is one that all religions believe in.

1633
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,360
It's like a niche.

1634
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:02,960
We've got our special niche is for former Jewish people, for former Moody's, for former

1635
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:15,860
Mormons, for former Catholics, for former extreme snake jugglers, former Baptists, for

1636
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:16,580
Methodists.

1637
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:17,760
That's right, Sergeant Hal.

1638
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,460
That's right.

1639
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:23,780
the church of the sub-Jainer, so that makes another church that is present among us.

1640
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:30,860
But then there's the church of the sub-Nenslow, which Jainer could join if he had any money.

1641
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:31,820
Nenslow.

1642
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,900
Great and mighty Nenslow.

1643
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,640
The church of the penniless.

1644
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:41,580
I heard a webcast of Sophrono's The Intellectual and Fawkes.

1645
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,140
The church of the penniless do bad.

1646
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,460
The church of the penniless do bad.

1647
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,240
The fair humanities of old religion.

1648
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,880
The church of the penniless do bad.

1649
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,180
The power of the beauty and the majesty.

1650
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:52,800
That would be a, there's a lot of people that would call Fawkes.

1651
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,280
The church of the penniless do bad.

1652
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,080
We've got another one to follow up.

1653
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,140
It's not a money-making idea like that.

1654
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,240
Man, I can crank them out.

1655
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,120
But there would be a lot of joiners.

1656
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,680
The church of the penniless do bad.

1657
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,760
Yeah, but it wouldn't be very profitable by definition.

1658
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:04,860
The forest by slow stream.

1659
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:07,100
I mean, the church of the sub-Genius is bad enough.

1660
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,460
Right, right, you're right.

1661
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:10,060
We've got to start thinking of these religions.

1662
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,200
How about the church of the 99th century?

1663
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,120
It actually has some income-producing potential.

1664
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,000
The original cool guys, that's it.

1665
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,760
We'll make a million bucks.

1666
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,920
Yeah, yeah, but we'll piss everybody off.

1667
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,340
How about the 99th century?

1668
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,440
We mentioned that.

1669
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,840
See, they won't speak to us.

1670
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,920
How about the 99th century?

1671
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:24,360
I'm not talking to him.

1672
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:24,660
Yeah.

1673
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:25,720
The 99th century.

1674
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:26,780
The 99th century.

1675
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:27,140
Oh, oh.

1676
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,840
The 99th century.

1677
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,220
I have a question for Reverend Stang.

1678
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,320
Here's a question for Reverend Stang.

1679
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:33,940
Ask Dr. Stang.

1680
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:34,960
Let him through, let him through.

1681
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,340
Why don't you, I've got an idea.

1682
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,220
Why don't you ask the caller what his question is.

1683
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,000
Say, caller, what is your question?

1684
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,000
That's my question.

1685
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,200
Uh-oh, caller panic.

1686
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,800
Go, caller.

1687
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:47,520
It's your turn.

1688
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,580
Cat got your tongue?

1689
00:55:49,440 --> 00:56:05,180
I guess the caller, you know sometimes when you have to step up to the mic and you get a lump in your throat and your knees knock together and you get water on the brain and tongue tied and a little bit twisted around inside.

1690
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:05,680
Just start talking.

1691
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,200
I'm just going to do sound effects.

1692
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,440
Don't listen to the radio.

1693
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,800
Lungs punctured.

1694
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,780
Listen to the phone.

1695
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,480
The hearty high-o's-ver.

1696
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:21,960
The Lunger.

1697
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,780
Nowhere in the pages of history can one find the Lunger.

1698
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,620
Let's go and hear what he has to say.

1699
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,500
He's going into the general store.

1700
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,880
Something ought to be done about it.

1701
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:41,200
Later the same day, the Lunger showed signs of nervousness.

1702
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,980
Bob likes raw meat.

1703
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:44,660
Yeah.

1704
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,460
Bob Brown now.

1705
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,220
You better get him.

1706
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:47,540
You better investigate.

1707
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,760
He may run into trouble.

1708
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,200
Bob smelled food.

1709
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,660
Not bad.

1710
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:52,320
Yeah.

1711
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,400
There's something familiar about him.

1712
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,740
That's the Lunger.

1713
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,440
He's found us.

1714
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,280
No.

1715
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,300
He's the best friend the West ever had.

1716
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,600
I don't believe you.

1717
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,220
He's a Lunger.

1718
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,560
So, uh, so what's the deal?

1719
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,340
How come you're so late?

1720
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,860
You know, I mean, I...

1721
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:17,600
Again.

1722
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:25,680
But you know, or I'll get a fourth, and then maybe I have to come back at day four, that's

1723
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,100
good.

1724
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,060
Oh, uh, so, yeah, haven't you?

1725
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:28,300
I don't really know.

1726
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,500
But what am I supposed to tell you?

1727
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:33,420
You are a non-Integral.

1728
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,700
You wereاطhe killing I do not know, dude.

1729
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,000
Lunger Alexandra Oss and a lot of nonsense.

1730
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,020
I wouldn't believe they put up with the Lunger on this planet.

1731
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:41,480
It is between me and we starving as jungle poppers.

1732
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:42,420
I don't know.

1733
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:42,500
SiI?

1734
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:45,660
Huh?

1735
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,200
Now I'm gonna wrap it up with what?

1736
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,220
Damn it to hell fire.

1737
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:48,740
Turkey.

1738
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,180
Turkey.

1739
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:50,940
Indescribable agony.

1740
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:51,780
Hmm.

1741
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:52,940
Oh, uh, turkey.

1742
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:53,680
Turkey.

1743
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:54,220
Turkey.

1744
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:55,100
Turkey.

1745
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,380
I would prefer not to.

1746
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,000
I would prefer not to.

1747
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,500
I would prefer not to.

1748
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:00,820
Turkey.

1749
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,520
I would prefer not to.

1750
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:02,900
Turkey.

1751
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:03,440
Turkey.

1752
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,300
I would prefer not to.

1753
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:06,760
I would prefer not to.

1754
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,400
I would prefer not to.

1755
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:08,920
Turkey.

1756
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:10,120
Blissful normality.

1757
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:10,560
Turkey.

1758
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,000
Some shameful act of moral turpitude.

1759
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,460
I would prefer not to.

1760
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,880
I would prefer not to.

1761
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,140
I would prefer not.

1762
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:18,480
I preferred not to.

1763
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,760
Turkey, you must begin to be perverse.

1764
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:21,340
Sniff.

1765
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:21,620
Ahem.

1766
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,340
I would prefer not to.

1767
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,220
I would prefer not to.

1768
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,420
Turkey, I would prefer not to.

1769
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,600
Turkey, I would prefer not to.

1770
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,000
Guns. Guns.

1771
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,200
Thank you for tuning in today.

1772
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,640
And by the way, if you happen to miss any of these programs,

1773
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:39,600
you'll be glad to know that the title is simply...

1774
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:43,580
The Self Genius Power of Slack.

1775
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:46,440
If you'd like the companion booklet,

1776
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:50,460
that booklet can be yours simply by enclosing an additional $5,

1777
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,680
or $6, or a total of $11,

1778
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,680
and address your request to Messy Texas...

1779
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,140
Thanks.

1780
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,180
Bye-bye.

1781
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:03,200
The harsh government gives tax breaks to companies that move jobs offshore.

1782
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,160
In the face.

1783
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,480
Remove all troops.

1784
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,500
Doesn't happen.

1785
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,900
I worry about my camp.

1786
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:08,560
I'll be around.

1787
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:09,860
And I am...

1788
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,900
Red, red, red, red, red, red.

1789
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:12,340
Picks a steady hand.

1790
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,340
You don't have healthcare.

1791
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,440
You don't have a pension.

1792
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,440
You're on your own.

1793
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,560
And you will have nothing.

1794
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,400
You will have nothing.

1795
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,920
I don't have to wake up every day.

1796
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:19,740
Not now.

1797
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,180
Not ever.

1798
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,000
We believe in some things.

1799
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,160
Move jobs offshore.
