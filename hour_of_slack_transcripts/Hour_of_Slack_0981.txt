You suck.
I came here to give you these robots.
He does suck.
The result is we pretend to have achieved perfection.
You're not being paid to screw up.
This does not mean giving up any freedom to act irresponsibly.
What do you mean?
Freedom to pursue profitable aggression and war.
Your choice is simple.
Pursue your present course and live in peace or join us and face obliteration.
You're just saying that to try and scare me.
We shall be waiting for your answer.
The decision rests with you.
Okay.
Now I'm done.


I'm done!
I'm done!

And again in Ruth 16 23 we read,
But we shall gain great comfort from this,
That he who shall turn his head from the brightness of the Lord shall have it loose from his neck.
And since we are out of time for today,
Let's close now the passage from Ezekiel 12 14.
Busy, busy, busy, want a cup of coffee? You don't have a bathroom, do you? Don't pump me.
You know how things go.

Well, Pimp Daddy Supreme will tell us about the record business.
A band going good can also be twisted to do evil.
Yes, music is a powerful force for good or evil.
Young people use music to reflect their own ideas, frustrations, questions and attitudes,
and some of their music responds to these questions.
What kind of music dominates your life?
Are you deciding for yourself?

Let's tell it like it is.
Popular music is helping to corrupt
the youth of America.
The big bowl beat may disguise the message,
and many kids tell me they really don't pay any attention to the words.
But you know as well as I do
that those words come through loud and clear.
Saka to me, baby.
Gimme, gimme, gimme.
But is that what the kids are listening to?
Not necessarily.
Guess what the world needs now is sex, shock, and...
Hold on a minute!
What kind of music is this pop music?
I think you know the answer to that.
Conforming to the world's ideas,
these people are merely following the crowd.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Music.
Music.


On the other hand,
Jam the Boss!
You know differently.
Teenagers, don't let the world around you
squeeze you into its mold.
Stop, look, and listen.
Music must be free.
Does that make sense?
But maybe where we disagree is what we mean by music,
and it's characterized in songs like this one,
with which we conclude.
But you gotta watch out.
This could lead to dancing.
Bob and Connie really enjoy life.
Mmm.
Hey, victory at sea, Bob.

And friends, what we're fighting for is the most important thing in the world, our slack!
Slack!
Now some people say, oh yeah, slack, what do you mean?
Well, we won't tell you.
As the great philosophers of the hell's angels used to say,
those who say don't know, and those who know don't say.
So I should shut up, please.
But instead I'll keep at it.
Because friends, slack is different for each person.
Ideally it's something for nothing.
And for some people, slack is,
a lot of money.
For some people, slack is sex.
But for some people, slack is stamp collecting,
bird watching, tinkering with their little computer.
Who knows?
Everybody has their own weird perverted idea of slack.
But friends, Bob is sex.
Bob is money.
And Bob is slack!
It's that simple.
We stand here trying to explain all this stuff,
but it doesn't matter.
Those are just words.
When you look at that face,
that's really all you need to know.
If, when your eyes fall upon that dotted dot pattern of a face,
if you think, that's kind of cool, and I don't know why,
then you know you are a subgenius.
It is only Bob.
All the rest of it is just our pathetic human preacher bullshit,
and an attempt to make some more money for his mighty empire.
But really, all you need to do is just stare into it,

and look into that face!
It's pure religious love.
And boys, it's not queer if it's Bob.
You know, it's a religious thing.
It's a religious love.
But friends, you know, you don't try to over-rationalize religion.
That just, it's crazy.
Religion has to be crazy.
It can't make any sense.
By definition, that would wreck it.
Let me put it this way.
Bob sold it.
I smoked it.
That settles it.
That's all I need to know.
Bob said,
I'm a liar.
Did I have faith?
That's what faith is all about.
Some people say,
Oh, I don't believe in miracles.
I don't believe in magic.
Friends, there is a type of magical miracle
that happens every day,
a million times a day.
And I don't mean the beauty of a leaf falling from a tree.
The miracle,
the incredible,
unbelievable miracle that happens every day
is that so many people can believe such stupid crap.
And yet they do.
And that is the miracle of faith, my friends.
And we will not let any other religion be any crazier than we are
as far as faith goes.
Bob sold it.
I smoked it.
That settles it.
As Bob said,
you must learn to pull the wool over your own eyes.
You're still blind,
but at least it's your wool and not theirs.
So,
you know,
again,
the conspiracy wants everyone to have the same idea of slack.
And they show it on their commercials all the time.
Oh,
my team just won.
I'm drinking Miller beer.
I'm surrounded by this year's model,
good looking person.
I have good,
respectable gifts.
I have a job.
Yeah,
I'm drunk.
Whoa,
I have slack.
Oh,
no.
And you're thinking,
no,
that's not slack.
It's pink boy stuff.
Real slack is smoking dope and watching MTV.
You know,
friends,
it is such a delicate line to figure out what is the true slack for you.
And what is the false slack?
Some people think that slack means being lazy.
And for some,
that certainly is true.
But then there are other,
that those are the reward in sub geniuses for some of us.



We emerge in tiles.
For instance,
slack is when we're working,
but at what we wanted to work at.
And then you forget to eat.
You forget to drink or breathe or pee.
You just make a big puddle under your desk and keep working or whatever it is you do.
You know,
make your own sports guide.
You like to run or something.
You get into the zone where everything is true and right.
And you know you're doing the right thing.
And friends,
that's when you suddenly know that life is worth living.
You are actually pretty smart.
And everything truly is as psychedelic as that old t-shirt that you can't fit into anymore.
That is the thought that you have to hold onto.
That is the slack.
The moment of slack.
Sometimes the more undeveloped sub geniuses come to me and go,
well,
I paid my 20 euro,
but I still don't have slack.
No,
you have misunderstood everything.
You have to make the slack.
You're not going to make the slack.
You're just paying us to give you a pep talk so you won't forget.
We know how difficult it is to be alone in this world and be a loner.
You know,
some of us,
well,
this is an organization.
It's a disorganization for non-joiners.
So it's never really been very big.
I guess it wasn't a good business idea.
You can,
but the great thing about Bob is you don't want to,
you don't want to have one of those other gods.
Breathing down your neck,
telling you what to do.
You don't want a bunch of other religious,
your fellow religious fanatics.
You just want to be alone.
But,
but you like Bob.
You can be alone with Bob.
You can be alone with Bob.
That's the miracle of our very special guru friends.
But so many people are laboring under this addiction,
a foul addiction to money,
filthy lucre.
Well,
actually,
we could use more of that ourselves.
Bob is not a communist exactly.
He doesn't want everyone to be equally poor.
No,
he wants everyone to be equally rich,
gluttonously,
piggishly rich,
but without working.
According to Bob,
there's no hard evidence to prove Bob's story either.
And it's not going to be true.
He's not going to be a two-headed blowjob,
contrary to popular demand.
I thought we were dancing with a hard-on.
I thought it was jut torture for anybody.



This happened for love.

He wanted us to let this discussion go,
because everyone wanted to slow down.

Did anyone mention Bob?
Yeah, boy.
Bob's arriving next week.

My fellow Americans.
The Great Society rests on poverty for all.
But that is just the beginning.
The Great Society is a place where every child can find racial injustice.
It is a place where leisure is boredom and restlessness.
It is a place where...
It is a place where man serves nature.
But most of all, the Great Society is not in our classrooms.
Aristotle said, men come together in cities in order to rebuild the entire urban United States.
Worst of all, expansion is eroding precious and time-honored loneliness.
And boredom and indifference.

And man can no longer wonder at nature.

Well, actually, it looks like there's a new set of Bob videos out,
which is what has been showing back there.
That's what I've been doing for the last year,
is replanting.
I've been finishing my animation and video cutting skills.
Nobody reads anymore.
But I've been selling our old video, Arise.
A lot of people have been buying that,
especially since I started giving it away.
You can download.
By the way, I will proudly tell you this.
All of our best work,
you can download right now off of a news group
called Alt Binary Slack
and another one called Alt Binary's Monterre Movies.
All of it for free.
And they're not crappy copies.
They're the kind that you can put onto a CD
and play it in your DVD player.
It's not a DVD, but it's closed.

Just in the far east,
it is spoken that there is a sacred tortilla
above his head.
Is it Plano, Texas?
That was, uh...
Yeah, that was a long, long time ago.
This is supposedly more holy than the grail,
the Christian grail.
It has magical powers.
I am understood.
Well, it was back in the 80s.
But then they started appearing on, like,
everybody's tortillas.
What about...
Eventually, they just started marketing
these tortillas.
Damn, Dobbs had tortillas,
and then the market was flooded,
and it lost its holiness.
What about the dinner roll?
The dinner roll that was discovered?
There was a dinner roll also in Plano.
Yeah, that was in Plano, Texas.
You're right.
There's a famous photograph of that
in the Book of the Subgenius.
Where can I come to adore and worship after Bob?
I don't...
You must kill Bob.
You must find him and kill him.
Well, first...
First, you have to become a minister,
which, uh, that's, uh, involves quite a bit of money,
and...
I have very much money.
What do you want?
Jewels?
Wealth?
Travel the world?
Do you have any children?
No children.
I am a homosexual.
Oh.
We might be willing to trade children for...
I am a woman.
For power.
I am a lesbian.
Really?
Yes.
That's a wonderful voice you've got there,
let me tell you.
Well, when you are a lesbian,
that's very good.
You have a very male voice.
It gets you around better.
I bet.
We might have a, uh,
some sort of a work,
harder work,
work study plan
at the Dobstown.
You're a...
Home for slackless children.
How big is the cage at Dobstown?
How large would the cage be for me?
Very, very large.
So that even you,
who are a strong, like, bull,
make good wife, you will.
I thank you very much.
Uh...
Praise the Bob.
Praise the Bob.
I think that guy had us confused
with that other cult that worships,
The Bob.
I don't know.
Who is the Bob anyway?
You're on the air, by the way.
It's, uh, 6873515.
Caller.
Yeah, Bob.
You know...
With the Lincoln?
With the Lincoln.
Yeah.
When you say Lincoln,
what class of object are you referring to?
We're talking about an automobile.
No.
You're on the air.
Hey, how's it going?
It's Bucky calling from Canada.
Well, Bucky.
Good to hear from you again.
How you been?
I'm all right.
I was, uh, just calling in.
I got a couple questions,
and I'm way behind,
because I started calling in about half an hour ago.
Oh, yeah.
But it's one of those ring, ring, ring,
then my phone hangs up thing.
Ah, yeah.
I know how that is.
My question is, actually,
my first thing is a point.
The opposite of Burning Man,
wouldn't that be, like, a wet woman?
Yeah.
But somebody else was, like,
well, Drowning Woman was...
We thought about calling it Drowning Woman,
but then we thought,
no, that was, um...
That would...
That's negative marketing, you know?
That would...
Ah.
So we were trying to hone it...
How about Non-Flammable Woman?
What would...
What really is the selling point?
And that's...
Non-Flammable Woman.
...naked woman,
as opposed to Burning Man.
Non-Flammable Woman.
You actually...
Flame-Retardant Woman.
Fire-Retardant Woman.
Fire-Retardant Woman.
Inappropriate!
Oh, you know what?
I think I had to bleep that out,
because you mentioned a price on there.
Oh.
Who?
I'm not sure, though.
You're not really advertising the event,
but I don't know.
I have no idea.
No.
Oh, Burning Man is actually a non-commercial event.
I know it is.
Oh.
We've got another caller here.
We're gonna expand the panel to four callers now.
You're on the air.
Inappropriate.
Yeah.
Anyway...
Wow.
What was that?
Inappropriate.
That was...
Inappropriate!
You know, when...
That's the guy from the, uh, FCC,
who calls up to make sure that everything is,
uh,
you know,
you know what you have to do,
Senator,
is you have to find...
There's an FCC song out by Eric Idle.
Oh, yeah?
It's, uh...
I can't even say the title of it,
because it would be bleeped.
Oh, yeah?
Try it.
It's, uh...
It's Blank You Very Much, the FCC.
Oh, yes.
And it's...
It's not blank.
It's an expletive.
Expletive.
Oh, boy.
Well, you know what?
I'm gonna say that right now.
Fuck the FCC.
Of course!
It is politically protected speech,
and we have aired a disclaimer.
Did you just...
I can't tell if that went out or not.
It's on the radio right now.
Ah, say!
Did that go,
or did you have to bleep yourself?
Uh...
It went.
It went.
And, uh,
I think...
We haven't gotten obscene yet.
We've been...
We're allowed to be indecent,
but we're not allowed to be obscene.
Right, right.
And because that was a political statement,
it is, by definition, not obscene,
because it, uh...
It worked for me.
It has serious...
It has serious literary...
Oh, is that what they're calling it now?
...notistic merit?

You're exercising your right to really free speech.
That's right.
We've got one more caller here now.
Uh, you're on the air.
Uh...
Uh...
Absolutely...
Wrong.
What happened to Pig Man?
Pig Man...
I heard Pig Man's voice earlier tonight.
Pig Man called up just for a second,
and got cut off!
I don't remember Pig Man exactly,
um...
I'm certain it was Pig Man.
I barely recognize the voice,
but I think I heard something...
Someone,
someone something like that.
Hmm.
But, uh...
One of my last questions.
Um,
okay,
I have a question about beer.
We were talking about the idea








I think I had some that I might have offered to you the other weekend.
You did.
You didn't have a digit.
I declined.
As a result, I had so much extra of this Molson Canadian that I bought in Cleveland
that we brought it back to Canada, Helena and I, when we came back.
So my question is, as I'm drinking Molson Canadian from Cleveland back here in Canada,
am I drinking imported beer?
It's called re-imported. Re-importation, just like...
They let you take drugs across the border?
Right. Like, a lot of Americans go to Canada to get prescription drugs
for the cheaper government price-controlled price over there.
Right.
And then they bring them back to the U.S., even though they were made in the U.S. originally.
We call that re-importation of prescription drugs.
We figured that the beer would be technically... that the word would have to be deported.
The beer was deported.
From PR News in Washington, I'm described as a paltry and miserly car bombing in Baghdad
during a raid on parts of Wisconsin.
Michigan, Indiana, and Afghanistan,
and a buffer between the expanding European Union and northern Ohio.
Sami Mohammed Ali Saeed Al-Jahaf, Abu Omar Al-Khourdi,
will be part of a larger package in the war on PR News.
The God Almighty...
We'll have to make it another week, but...
The God Almighty...
The...
Very soon.
And then all of a sudden there was...
The God Almighty...
Canadian flag on the screen.
You know, I never really asked.
Yeah.
It's about time.
He's stagged.
He's stagged.
It's about time.
He's stagged.
Aren't you the delivery boy?
I know.
Sweet little pussy.
The God Almighty...
I hear you got a sweet little pussy.
You know, I never really asked.
He's stagged.
Who's a commercial?
He's stagged.
You know, I never really asked.
But you have to assume.
Then how good are you?
The God Almighty.
Then how good are you?
The God Almighty.
Then how good are you?
The God Almighty.
Then how good are you?
The God Almighty.
Then how good are you?
The God Almighty.
The God Almighty.
Then how good are you?
Who's he trying to contact?
He told me that the world is in big trouble,
and he wants me to —
Not now, Bob.
What am I doing?
I have to go out.
Champion Ong, I want to makeain of this—
You know, I never really asked.
I met God today.
Andy, I met God today.

Turn his arm into a missile launcher like Megalor?
Well, I saw him make himself a hundred feet tall.
He certainly does.
I'd like to get a little bit of that jobs on my dork.
Can he turn his arm into a missile launcher like Megalor?
Well, feline animal is not available for petting in any petting zoo.
Can he turn his arm into a missile launcher like...
I see the alien heart that I'm not interested.
Well, where's the devil?
I saw no cats.
You just don't want to see the alien heart that I'm not interested.
Well, where's the devil?
Can he turn his arm into a missile launcher like...
I just don't want to see the alien heart that I'm not interested.
I'm not interested.
My little smilodon.
Can he turn his arm into a missile launcher like Megalor?
Well, I saw him make himself a hundred feet tall.
I don't know missiles.
No.
No.
I swear, I saw him with my own eyes.
Um, just like the UFO you saw when we were camping.

Hey, you can't tell me that the government has a helicopter that can veer sideways with that kind of velocity.
And, uh...
I know you scientists would love to get home and get a few DNA samples off a monster.
Hey, you can't tell me that the go...
That may or may not have...
been psychic TV.
I really don't know.
It was labeled psychic TV when I downloaded it.
And before that, we heard, of course, some PR news from, uh...
Leemur.
We heard some radio synesthesia.
That's Dr. Sinister's show on WCSB in Cleveland on Sunday nights.
Right after the hour of Slackware.
We use that show a lot, and it uses us.
And before that, I think a little bit of yours truly preaching at Starwood.

Accept no substitutes.
We've got another line blanking here.
Dare we see who's on here?
You're on the air.
Hello?
Man, what's with this, uh...
You want to wait or no with the line?
What is it?
It's a coded message from God.
Actually, it's from the Illuminati, actually.
Who is this guy?
The, the, uh, the ringing, the frequency of the, of the ringing phone.
When, you know, you hear the phone ringing,
that's actually vibrating a specific frequency.
It's a coded message from the Illuminati.
I don't understand this.
Well, then you're in some trouble, because you're, you're the only hope.
Don't you understand?
The Illuminati are trying to contact you because you are the chosen one.
This is not right.
You alone will have the power to save us.
This is not right.
I don't understand.
I agree with this.
So what?
I don't know.
Anyway, enough of that guy.
I just cut him off.
I, I do that.
Eh, and the shit's a bit...
Can I say that on the radio?
I guess.
If there's anything you should be able to say on the radio, it's, uh, it's that.
Yeah.
But, uh, I'm gonna free up another line for you guys so you can take some more calls.
Alright, hey, you know what?
I keep forgetting your name.
I mean, I recognize you and me, Bucky.
Right.
Okay, Bucky.
No, he's named that for those giant teeth that stick out in front like a cartoon squirrel
man.
Yeah.
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
Huge giant buck teeth.
Okay.
I'm not gonna forget.
He can cut down a telephone pole.
When you get him real drunk, he can cut down a telephone pole in about half an hour.
Actually, I actually stole the name from, uh, uh, our Buckminster Fuller.
Although people keep on, uh...
Bucky Fuller.
People keep on insinuating that I stole it from Captain America's sidekick, Bucky.
No, I figured that you stole it from Buckminster Fuller.
I like the Bucky ball.
Bucky Fuller.

I know there are many subgeniuses who are, are Buckminster Fuller, uh...
Buckminster Fullerites.
He's their, uh, long derp or sap for many.
Well, yeah, but that's, that's the problem.
See, I was partway through reading, uh, Synergetics, uh, when I, when I made a post to All Black
Slack and had to pick a name, and off I went with Bucky.
I just like that...
I never finished reading it.
I just...
So all the people that want to talk about our Buckminster Fuller, I'm only on page 60.
I like the, uh...
And it's like a 500-page book.
I like the fact that he went by Buckminster instead of whatever his first name was.
You know, like...
I think it was Richard.
Richard.
Or Buckminster.
Which name do you want to...
Dick.
Go by, go by.
Dick Fuller.
Dick sounds like a joke name.
I think I see why now.
You know, a brush salesman joke name.
But Buckminster, now that's a name.
Dick Fuller.
And they, there are molecules named after him now, such as...
Right, they're not gonna call him Dicky Balls.
They're...
They're the Bucky Ball and the Bucky Tube.
They're called Bucky Balls for obvious reasons.
C60.
If you call the carbon, that type of carbon arrangement a, uh, if that's what it is, a
Dicky Ball, that would be laughable, risible.
Yeah.
He would turn in his grave.
That's right.
Well, Bucky Balls is pretty funny if you...
Yeah, that's a...
Yeah, but it's cute.
If you're me and people call you Bucky and start talking about Bucky Balls, it's a little
bit, uh, that's a little bit weird too.
Right.
That's the kind of thing you see at X-Day.
You see a lot of Bucky Balls at X-Day if you hang around the pool.
Gross.
Oh, boy.
Horrible.
Anyway, that's, that's enough for me.
I've explained my name and, uh, I'll see you guys later.
All right.
Bye.
You have a good night.
The shakes go too much.
Time to go.


One of the kids down at the bank got kneed from a little just went hair like that.
