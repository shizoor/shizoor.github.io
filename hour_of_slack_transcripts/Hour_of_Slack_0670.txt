And I want you to be free.
Lavery, money, slavery, money, slavery, money, slavery, money.
Everything you have is God's.
Right.
Lavery, money, slavery, money.
There's a lot of guys that wouldn't really make it in a lot of other venues,
but they can get a small church, be nice to some people, and sort of squeak out a living.
Uh, test, test, test. Are we on the air?
Are, is this working?
Folks, they're finally here.
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.
Who could it be now?
Hey, you know what? I was just, uh, copying that onto Hour of Slack.
You're copying that onto Hour of Slack?
Who could it be now?
I was making Hour of Slack tonight.
Yeah.
On tape, and I was using Lanty.
Just weak tape.
You put the tape between your knees and then take the little razor blade and spin it with a little spool between your knees?
Or do you just, just hack away?
Well, I put it between my knees and then I slowly kind of creep it up closer and closer to me.
And then I, and then that's when the curtain opens.
And all those kids are out there waiting to see the clown show.
Little clown.
And then I am with my tape editor.
Right there.
Well, yep.
It's usually Blashy, king of the men. Remember him?
Yes.
I'm glad you do.
I do remember Fred Blashy, the king of men.
In fact, he was...
Oh.
Oh.

Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

Oh.




Oh.
Oh.



Oh.


Oh.







Oh.
Thank you.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.

Oh.







Careful, honey.
No.
Go easy on that one.
Safe word.
Safe word.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait.
I know what to do.
I'll pull down the volume and hit the pause button.
It's gone.
Oh.
Lordy.
Friends.
I just, I never know.
I never know quite what to, what to, how to, that was a Bill T. Miller's horrible sound
effects.
And I don't know what else is going on here except that, friends, you know, the world ends
any year now.
And you may die.
No, I'm just kidding, kids.
You know, actually, we all know that the surface of the earth will be scoured of pinkness and
that we, the saved, will be ruptured up to the escape vessels of the sea.
Ex-goddesses.
At precisely 7 a.m., July 5th, 1999, as prophesied by Nostradamus and almost certainly meant
by that man J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Only the most pathetic, faithless, weakest-willed subgenius wannabes would let something like
last year's little so-called disappointment shake their trust in Dobbs.
Dobbs.
7-5-98.
July 5th, 98 was actually the best possible drill.
The only way to make us truly prepared.
Admit it.
Half of y'all were sound asleep last ex-day at 7 a.m.
Now, weren't you?
And the pin kooks are all running around like ninnies fretting about the year 2000 and Y2K
when all their precious false slack devices will shut down and crash out and fail to reboot.
They should be so lucky.
They're worthless.
The world isn't even gonna last that long.
And that's why we say,
No Y2K.
X, Y, Z.
X year zero, my friends.
X year zero.
Examine your zipper.
The world ends July 5th, 1999.
Next day.
Dos Equis.
Duh!
The pinks did not take us seriously last time.
Hell, half of you didn't take Bob's.
Prophecy seriously.
But this time we've learned our lesson.
We can't rely on invisible monsters from outer space.
Dobbs hath said,
just in case,
you must
build your own ship.
And while you're at it, help get ship shape the one we're already on, kids.
This is your last chance not to screw up.
Dobbs inexplicably said,
All these other US



We want all the вч-
Life,
Guess what? We've got us a special little glimpse into last year's X-Day.
This upcoming X-Day, there's going to be twice as many hilarious screwed-up weirdos
and stark-necked beautiful Connie tights and tools.
Thrice the miracles, signs and portents,
four times as many colorful body fluids as last year's blood wrestling, my friends.
It will be...
Well, I really should just go to the tapes.
I should just go straight on over.
Praise Bob.
And praise Tom and Richard, who actually edited, shot and edited
the documentary portions of what I'm about to play.
Bits and pieces, excerpts from a video, a documentary video called
Countdown to X.
X-Day.
Uh, yes. Praise Bob.
Oh, the music in the background is, of course, Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
And it is in the video, too.
Just like the Heaven's Gate people did their farewell video,
this is, this, this will save me tape.
Um, God, who should I talk to? My mom and dad are saved.
Okay, my brother and sister.
And a lot of friends of mine, and even a lot of subgeniuses,
including some of my best subgenius old buddies and collaborators
that never actually sent their $30 in.
Like I did last year.
Um, man.
It's just a container.
It's a temporary container.
It's like casting off your old shoes and putting on some new ones.
It's not like anybody's gonna really die.
You'll still be around after the exes or the robo-beasts
or whatever the vengeful subgeniuses have stripped away your house and your body.
In a way, you're not really leaving.
You humans and pinks and relatives of mine,
you're just entering.

You're stepping over into a bigger world, a more open world.
I feel sorry for the friends of mine who never bought a membership.
I've always tried to expose them gently to Bob's word,
not to force it down their throats,
not mail them pamphlets constantly.
I have turned some people to the church.
I am very proud of those people.
I look forward to greeting them on the saucers, you know.
But it's kind of sad that my mother, who really is a wonderful person,
never did buy that membership.

And I don't know what she would make of the saucers.
And of course, there are my enemies.
I do have people in my life who have hurt me for no particular reason
all the way back in high school.
And once I get my memory editing, I'll be able to remember who you all are.
And I probably will have specific tribulations set aside just for you.
And that's just my slack.
And I'm afraid there's nothing you can do about it now.
It's been difficult during all this time to be patient.
But I knew that if I just...
if I just persevered,
I'd be able to say goodbye from above, from the saucers, and not below.
And I just want to thank those that supported me.
I come from a long line of subgeniuses.
And they imparted into me the values that have got me where I am today.
And to all the normals and all the pinks and all the bobbies
and the glorps and the normals that have tried to wear me down,
well, soon, you better hurry if you've got anything left to say to me
because I'm on my way out.
Goodbye. So long.
They have a secret weapon.
They have an invisible monster that lives up in the sky.
And it's powerful. And it's their buddy.
And if they kiss its ass, it'll send us to hell forever.
And it'll do them favors, you know.
Now, 87% of this country, of America,
believes in that individual.
And it's a monster that lives up in the sky.
And it's a monster that lives up in the sky.
And it's a monster that lives up in the sky.
That's great. Fine.
I don't believe in that invisible monster.
You probably don't believe in that invisible monster.
But we still have to deal with it.
Because they believe it.
God, friends, that's why the Church of the Subgenius
and J.R. Bob Dobbs
has come to declare war on God!
We've been talking about it.
Huh. Where was Letterman? How come we didn't have him?
In any case, Bryant might be looking for solace
after that verbal barrage,
and we just might have the answer for him.
It's called the Church of the Subgenius.
And it's truly on a level of its own.
You know those late-night commercials
that promise everything from electric massage recliners
and instant weight loss to do-it-yourself bathroom renovations?
Well, here's a deal you might not want to miss.
Salve the people of the world.

Salvation or triple your money back.
In Dallas, Texas, the Church of the Subgenius
is offering a one-word solution to all of our problems.
Slack.
That word solves another problem for the Church as well.
Money.
The Reverend Ivan Stang spreads the gospel.
Stang, author of The High Weirdness by Mail
and Book of the Subgenius,
preaches his gospel every Sunday over the radio at WKRO in Dallas.
Stang claims to be a disciple of the Church's founder,
one Dr. J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Once also known as the greatest salesman ever born.
Oh, yes.
Civilization falling apart.
According to Stang, Bob Dobbs became a prophet one night
after seeing God on his homemade TV.
The vision inspired him to save the world
and gave him the message to do it with slack.
Like any other prophet, Bob preaches about the end of the world.
Only his predictions are just a little different.
July 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m. to be exact,

the men from Planet X, as the news media will call them,
will arrive to rupture the subgeniuses,
the true believer subgeniuses,
up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.
And believe it or not, plenty of people,
4,000 of them so far and more every day,
have already joined up.
Suddenly the joke has become serious and profitable.
Your standard religious rip-off, right?
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?
As Bob says,
we offer eternal salvation or triple your money back.
And there is no other religion that offers that deal.
Triple your money.
Church of the Subgenius, about 10 years ago, basically,
I was a very lonely weirdo in a small Massachusetts town
where nobody was like me and nobody liked me.
And I'd just gotten out of high school,
which I felt was a real waste of time.
I'd in fact spent four years in special ed,
which is also known as the retard room,
basically because none of the teachers wanted to deal with me.
So they stuck me in a room by myself for four years.
Shows what I think of public education.
And, you know, I really was a very lonely person.
And I finally got a boyfriend who was a member of the church
and had been for two or three years.
And he showed me the pencils and I said,
this is it.
Where are these damn pencils?
Where have these damn people been all these years?
I broke up with this girl.
We had a parting of the ways.
And I basically degenerated at the time
into a state of total slacklessness
where I was just riding around on my motorcycle like a nutcase.
You know, just hoping that somewhere
there was somebody who was bold enough to take me on.
And one day a car started chasing me through a thunderstorm.
I'm going like 90 miles an hour on my bike through a thunderstorm.
And there's a truck chasing me.
And I thought I got away from the guy.
But he caught up to me a couple of miles later.
And he got out of his truck.
And I was like, good, you know, I didn't get to kick this guy's behind, right?
Well, he comes up and he offers to let me join a motorcycle club that he belonged to.
An outlaw motorcycle club in South Jersey called the High Rollers.
And I hooked up with him a few months later.
And I met a guy named Reverend Spider.
Now, I didn't know what he was a reverend of.
He told me about this church and the subgenius thing.
And he gave me a tape.
And I listened to the tape.
But I was the only subgenius around.
I thought, oh, this stuff, you know, this is about me.
You know, all this stuff in here, stuff that I've been saying for years
and everybody else has blown off and said, that's weird.
You're stupid, you know.
That stuff isn't the way things are.
You know, it's not the way we see it on TV.
In sociology class at Farragut High School,
I was living in Knoxville, Tennessee at the time,
Deborah L. turned around.
And said, my boyfriend wanted me to give you this.
And she held up this weird poster with these three funny faces on it.
And said, Sinisac religion and a society for the bizarre.
Send $1 to the subgenius foundation.
I thought, well, that's kind of weird.
It only costs $1.
I'll just go ahead and do that.
I got a pamphlet in the mail.
Boy, that's pretty funny.
I showed it to my buddy Scott K.
And he thought it was real funny.
He sent in his $10 to join up.
He got his membership pack back.
And there it said, membership $20.
So I figured, man, if it's gone up from $10 to $20 in this past week,
I better join quick.
So I sent in my $20.
And that was in 1982.
The church first stumbled into my life in 1981.
I was reading an underground comic by Robert Crumb called Weirdo.
And there was an ad in the back pages,
the world ends tomorrow and you may die.
And it sounded like a good prospect to me.
And now it's almost tomorrow.
And it's been 17 years that I've had the church of the subgenius in my life.
At first, it was a joke.
You know, fuck them if they can't take a joke.
Pull the wool over your own eyes and relax in the safety of your own delusions.
But there was something much deeper and more life affirming than I'd even realized.
Do we have any takers?
Any volunteers?
No, I think this is the blood wrestling.
Friends, it's...
Actually, the purpose of the wrestling in particular is so a whole bunch of people can laugh
at a bunch of idiots that look funny getting knocked down and slipping and sliding around.
That's the purpose of the blood wrestling.
That's the entire purpose of it as far as I know.
It's because people look funny.
Amateur wrestlers look real funny sliding around.
That's what I'm talking about.
Lassus! Lassus!
Lassus! Lassus!
Woo!
Lassus!
It's a good thing you can't see this footage on the radio because it would be not for children.
Some of these lovely subgenius ladies and men didn't want to get their clothes all bloody.
It's a savage and ridiculous sight.
I think it's an expression of some pent-up aggressions towards other subgeniuses and towards the conspiracy
that needed an outlet that was healthy enough to not get arrested before X day.
It's a way of getting back to all the slack you had when you were a little kid.
Remember when you were a little kid and you'd be able to just sit there with your little plastic soldiers?
You'd create a whole fantasy world around you.
This is it.
We've created our own fantasy world around us.
That's what religion's for, right? To create a fantasy world?
But we live our fantasy world out.
We don't wait until we die.
Hey, son, you've had a fan!
That's the very thing, buddy.
Take me off to space.
Take me off to space.
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.
Take me off to space.
Take me off to space.
Take me off to space.
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.
Leave needles in my belly.
Take samples of my skin.
I don't care as long as I can live with saucer man.
I know that you don't take requests, but I'm a special case.
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.
Take me off to space.
Take me off to space.
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.
Take me off to space.
Take me off to space.
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.
Hey, cattle mutilators, let me join your crew.
Give me a knife, you bet your life I'll cut up cows for you.
I don't care if you're some kind of get-
Sleepy without a face.
Or some kind of body.
I don't care if you're a bull with two eyes.


Is that a murder from a Druid with 100
눈치
Or are you walking around with a body with only one eye?
Boying!
Think you can move a body and you can do beach last night?
and life is just a sucker dream and death is a disgrace.
So come on down you saucermen take me off to space
Take me off to space Take me off to space
Come on down you saucermen take me off to space
Take me off you saucermen take me off to space
Come on down you saucermen take me off to space

We were going to talk about Gogol and the dead souls tonight, weren't we?
We were going to analyze that one part there where...
Hey, they're not broadcasting us right now.
Oh, good. Well, there goes everything that's important.
Because if they were, you just blew it.
Yeah.
That you just told them, now they know everything.
About Congressman Bratwurst?
Well...
Well, it's off to too late now.
Congressman Hitler.
Oh, yeah.
And his speech impediment.
Now everybody's going to...
It's like, next thing you know, David Letterman's going to be doing jokes about Congressman Hitler's speech impediment.
Well, you know...
He's got it on the bag now.
It's like the colostomy bag is out of Frank Sinatra now.
Well, Congressman Hitler is awful old, and there's a lot of people wondering how he got his visa papers and so forth.
You know what I mean?
Well, I think it's just a popularity contest.
You know, that's all politics are now.
Yeah, but so...
I thought it was cool when Jesse the Body Ventura became governor, but then the next thing you know, it was Senator Jagger and Corporal Whitney Houston, or I mean Congresswoman Houston, and it was all movie stars.
And the next thing you know, then there's Congressman Hitler at 97 years old.
How old is he?
I think he said he's 97, but there's a lot of people say he's actually 106 right now.
Just a big old...
He's got a head in a jar going,
Moxnell, Moxnell.
Moxnell, Moxnell, Moxnell.
Everybody wants to go faster.
You remember that one Lady Rife and Stall movie where they had everybody suspended in them jars, and they were going by at 1,000 miles an hour with them little swastikas on it?
And a little blonde child would jump out.
Each time one would go by and would salute it, and the thing would just go off into the, well, we don't call it the urine wagon, whatever it is, you know, where they dumped all that stuff.
And it was just like it was the city of the future where they take away every part of you you didn't need, like your hair.
You could get your hair.
You walk in, and a hair cutter would land on your head and would remove it in really, you know, Nordic fashion.
And it was kind of weird, you know?
Tell me over and over and over again, my friend, how you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.
You know, are there...
Are there real subgenius kooks that, like, take it a little too far?
Oh, yes, they are kooks.
And they do.
There are subgenius, those who call themselves subgeniuses and believe all the wrong lies in the book of the subgenius.
The stuff that's obviously there to be laughed at, they know from their...
It's what happens is our bulldada, or, you know, kind of cheesy takeoff, blah, satirical.
Stuff happens to intersect with their schizophrenia.
He's following me.
He's up there.
Can't you see?
Following me, flying free.
There's a psychotic man in a dark, fat suit, and he's after me.
He's up there.
Can't you see?
Some of these guys are truly twisted in the head.
Some of them, I think some of them should be locked up.
I think that some of these people...
After they sent their $30 to the Church of the Subgenius,
probably should have gone off somewhere and gotten some help.
Stared at me in hell.
Eyes closed, Fred.
They went straight through my head, not gone.
I was dead for sure.
No!
It's always dangerous to enfranchise the misfits of society.
And this church is like a validation on our mental and emotional parking.
It's a certain level of impulsivity,
the mental riflage that we already have to notice.
And we need to understand...



We now에게 extraneous VR millions,

make yourself feel like a mic,
learning from the sins of others.
Yes.
and fixate on it.
You can join the rest of us at the same time,
on the same day, and overwhelm the power.
Oh!
That day is July 5th, 1998, and that hour is 7 AM.
Oh!
Are you going to be part of the problem?
Are you going to be part of the solution,
the final solution to kill the conspiracy?
There's some potential for violence anywhere at all times.
I'd say, in this case, you have the advantage
that you have people who are prepared for violence.
There's a potential for violence.
I don't know if it's going to be anything
that can't be diffused with a joke.
I certainly hope so.
Don't you understand what I'm trying to say?
And can't you feel the fears that I'm feeling today?

There'll be no one to save with the world

Great.
Take a look around, you boy.
It's bound to scare you, boy.

how you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

Good evening,
and welcome to the radio ministry outreach
of Tranquility Base,
where we believers carry the firm conviction
that we were placed here to build the rocket ships,
the space-faring pleasure vessels prescribed in
Dobsian scripture,
to voyage out into the cosmos,
to venture where no billion-year-old carbon
has ventured before.
Wanna go for a ride?
We must get out.
We must get out.
They'd say, you know,
that crazy neighbor dreamed houses up the street.
He kept talking about this.
That religious nut.
He must have been wild.
And now all of you who are under the influence of the world,

you're 18,
turn your heads away,
because this is the naked baptism part of the show,
with all those subgeniuses in that big swimming pool.
Hey, guys, let's go in.
Make money with your heads on top.
Subgeniuses in an ideal world would be able to quit all their jobs
and just kick back,
but they don't, you know,
just like everybody else.
They rub elbows with a lot of jerkos, you know,
a bunch of just douchebags that they run into, you know,
from day to day.
And they get that kind of taint they rub off,
that rubs off on them, you know,
that pink taint.
And the baptism is basically to wash away that pink taint
from rubbing elbows with it and kind of purify them.
The baptism is a very beautiful event
because most of us need a bath.
That's the main reason it's done, I like to think.
Whoa!
I'm there!
I'm there!
Yeah, it's a great way to go!
We do!
We do!
We do!
We do!

We do!
We do!
We do!
When I joined the Church of the Subgenius as a 16-year-old,
there were things about the church that I found a little unsettling.
Some of the scripture used words and ideas
that I just found objectionable on the political levels
or social levels,
or I thought it might keep me from getting dates.
or whatever, but in time, some of the other doctors
noticed that.
And one of them took me aside and explained
that it had a cathartic value, that they didn't really
believe in the certain forbidden words or forbidden acts,
but they felt they had to do them,
because the conspiracy was both making
them appealing and forbidden.
And that kind of tension was building up so much,
they needed a way to break out of it.
And what better way to break out of it
than indulging in all the bad things
that they're not supposed to do?
Basically, every year we sin.
We work.
We mingle with pinks.
And we wash away our sins every year
so that we can gain new sins and then wash them away once again.
And you get to look at plenty of naked chicks and guys.
And I'm sitting in front of my dad and26

He's a Серг makes things look done.
Well, the baptism, I guess, it's not really a metaphor.
We're really baptizing people in the �aed blood and expulsions
But a lot of these folks were baptized against their will
You talk about when you're having really bad hallucinations and you hear a lot of really like voices floating around
You have giving you commands
Like say you've been 2,000 years old and you're a dog, you know, and you're telling people this
Conserve no purpose anymore right in the heart and he has no further conversation. Yes. I never mind
See now I can't hear any of this now. I'm starting to feel like you like me
What would I felt were look like?
Even if it had an identical molecular chemistry to life on earth, which I very much doubt it could not be similar
very similar in form to familiar organisms on the earth a
Random character of the evolutionary process must create elsewhere creatures
very different from any of that we know
Well, it's it's a squaring off against two of the main factions in the church
the
evangelicals the followers of Reverend Ivan staying on our beloved guru and then there are the Holocaust ales
with more of a led by dr. Laguna of more of a
bitter
bitter hate burning within them for safe they reject the
feel-good hugging us of the more
complacent evangelicals
upon the hill
that circle of police tape
Is a ring a white ring painted on the ground?
That is the circle of life
Our two teams the Holocaust ales and those mothers
Are going to meet us in that circle of life and it's going to be the throwdown at hell's hoedown
and
Now friends we cut to it's hard to describe out out in the rain. There's this
gigantic crowd of people dressed in the most outlandish
Battle armor you could imagine some of them completely naked some of them
Wrapped in acres of a bubble wrap, which is what I did
I
I'm not fighting you like you
I'm not fighting you like you
Just mother for the Cold War
Twenty years 18 years appreciate the training and love all of our family community
W Hairt it was very exciting to get into The First Line
was just was it to see cued on the first the distribution of thrones
For W
Life was like deserve it
Men were Bee Nein
It was only when I saw a plain-capped

So they look down on people like Hitler.
Hitler killed six million Jews.
How many Jews have the Catholic Church killed
or the Christian Church killed over the last 2,000 years?
Can you describe what's going on for the people?
Well, 90.5% we have the Battle of Armageddon here.
I tell you, it's the Evangelicals versus,
I don't know who the other side is.
The Holocaustals.
The Holocaustals.
But they, and I think that some of the saints,
worshippers have come out of here,
and I think some of the Jesus freaks have come out here also.
Several subgeniuses are work.
I mean, that's their job.
They're cops or they're federal agents
or they're DEA drug analysts, you know?
Like, why not?
There's soldiers here.
To tell the truth,
there's a couple of special forces guys here.
There's people here that make me not worry too much
about violence because if somebody got rough,
there really are subgeniuses
that can handle that kind of thing.
I think I feel the real intense competition
of survival of the species
here.
No time to rest once you eliminate all the sin.
We're all just a bunch of retarded six-year-old kids
who've managed to carry our childlike sense of fun
into our adult years.
Well, this is like a three-legged sack race
at a family reunion.
This is where we all meet our extended tribe
and reenact the rituals and traditions
that bring us closer together.
You know, the countdown has begun.
It's like Christmas, you know?
Santa's coming.
Santa's coming real soon.
And we've got the shortwave.
We can tune in and hear Santa delivering his little gifts
of death and destruction to the world
as it rotates under the line of X's saucers.
Oh, Bob.
Oh.
Turn on.
Please tune in.
And switch off.
Why do you want to be normal?
The rupture is upon us, dear friends.
That fateful day, July 5th, 1998.
Next day's a-coming, and the peaks are booming.
Next day's a-coming, and the peaks are booming.
Ah!
Next day's a-coming, and the peaks are booming.


Sure, when the rupture hits, we'll all be on the edge,


in our first-class window seats on the pleasure saucers,
watching the little pink boys fry.
Turn on.
Please tune in.
And switch off.
Switch, switch, switch.
We certainly don't want to be tricked, dear people.
Next day's a-coming, and the peaks are booming.
Ah!
Ah!
Sure, J.R. Bob Dobbs is my savior.
And of course I want more slack.
And I'm smoking prop nonstop.
But what I really want...
Oh, yeah, that's it.
Those lovely alien nympho mutants.
Ah!
Non-stop orgies on the pleasure saucers.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, yeah.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, I love to be naked.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, fuck.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Turn on.
Please tune in.
And switch off.
Switch, switch, switch.
Switch, switch, switch.
We certainly don't want to be tricked.
Next day's a-coming.
And the pigs are bummin'
I said, X-Days are comin'
And them little pigs are bummin'
Those conspiracy Duke Pink Boy normals are gonna fry
They won't even know what hit them
That old Stark fist is gonna come down hard
But nothing's guaranteed, dear friends
I'm a card-carrying member of the Church of the Subgenius
I'm the almighty king of slap
But when X-Day comes around
The only thing I have is my unshakable faith in Bob
Turn on. Tune in. And slap!
X-Days are comin'
And the pigs are bummin'
Don't you wanna be saved?
X-Days are comin'
And the pigs are bummin'
Listen to me, mister, it's salvation I'm talkin' about
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

Oh!
Oh!
Cut the porn!
I mean, this is the... this is the fulcrum event of human history.
We're subgenius history.
We don't care about human history.
This is when we finally get our history back in our own hands.
We created the humans.
80 million years ago, our ancestors did.
Our greatest mistake.
This is our chance to correct that mistake.
Of course, there's tremendous feeling of anticipation.
I have actually been, I've had butterflies in my stomach
for a couple of months now.
It's been getting more and more frequent.
Jeez, it's really coming.
This is really happening.
20 years ago, I thought 1998 was a million years off.
I'm surprised that I live to see 1998.
To be honest with y'all, about a week ago,
I had a vision of 7 o'clock coming and Reverend Stang
getting up on stage and making some kind of lame excuse
why the sausage didn't come.
And some bent dumbass out in the audience
just stepping out and putting a bullet in.
This is a voice speaking to you from thousands of miles
beyond.
Your planet.
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.

The final hour is approaching for the people of Earth.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Please.
No.
No.
No.
No.

No.
No.

No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.






It's Articus.
No, there's nothing in me.
So I must be right.
Thank you.
So thanks for the poolade.
Stang told me to make it last night.
He just mentioned,
here's the poolade that we're making
and here's the cup.
I mixed it myself.
I watched the kitchen staff.
I filled the thing myself.
It's got the lid on it.
You don't want to put like aند so much in there.
I'm just doing what Stang told me to do.
Attention, radio station technicians.
The brief moment of bad sound coming up is not your tape deck jamming.
Thank you.
I've been waiting 17 years for this to happen.
I have never waited for anything so long in my life.
I didn't wait to get out of school for 17 years.
There has never been a goal in my life that was a clear-cut date and time that I could work toward.
And that's been shining like a beacon on the horizon to me.
I've had this day to cling to, and now that it's finally coming up,
I've spent the past few months marching toward it with every bit of resolve I could muster
to take care of business, to finally get everything in my life in a row
because this is a world I've never seen before.
It's a wonderful opportunity.
We're on the threshold of the end of this civilization.
All right!
No. No, no, no, please, no, no, no.
Eternal salvation or triple your money back!
Sounds too good to be true, dear friends.
Industrial strength! Anti-religion!
I don't know, I think we've been duped.
We have nothing to hide.
Religion is poison.
Religion is poison.
So I kiss the antidote.
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
I don't know, I think we've been duped.
We have nothing to hide.
Religion is poison.
Religion is poison.
So I kiss the antidote.
Religion is poison.
Religion is poison.
Love is your only hope.
It's true.
Cults control money.
That's how they work.
I need a slack fix.
Give me that slack, baby.
Give me my slack fix.
Give it up.
Give it up.
Give it up.
Give it up.
Gotta have my slack fix.
We have nothing to hide.
Religion is poison.
Religion is poison.
Religion is poison.
Slack is the antidote.
Get off the earth now because you want to have sex with it.
And also, help you find parts, you know, of any kind.
Of your spaceship.
Yeah.
You know, you'll be pointing the way if you're a male, and it'll be any kind of part you need for either pleasure in this dimension or another, I suppose.
Hey, I think we all agree that...
Bye, golly.
It's great to be an American and live in a...
In a...
In a...
In a...
Gosh darn it, one of the most highly advanced technological societies.
I'm not proud of the Hill Card.
It's become very apparent that nobody can make a shelter of men with no man-god.
The daughter-in-law of Butler, who claims to be rude, raised being possessed, make mother-tosses as she used to, and things fly for the air.
Goodbye, Dad.
You know...
I gotta go into tuna can now, man.
Bye, Pop resource.
I hate people, you know?
Everywhere says,ения...
You need to carry that Agatha.
I'll let you know a sweet story...
Oh, my God...

Come what might Sister Michelle expect...
I want myrendocte back back back to normal.
Take it easy, Dad.
I'd like it.
Exactly.
Uh...
I want my blind man.
This conversation can serve no purpose anymore.
Goodbye.
How?
How?
How?
We've heard so far the voice of life on only a single world.
But for the first time, as we shall see,
we've begun a serious scientific search
for the cosmic future.
Well, I guess to be honest,
I'd have to say that I never really expected any flying saucers.
To be honest,
a lot of this stuff is really, really stupid.
But I guess a lot of people need something really stupid in their lives
to give it meaning.
I don't know. It's still a pretty beautiful world we've got here.
And Bob is still a very important part of my life
and always will be.

So, yeah, I am disappointed.
But part of being a subgenius is saying,
okay, I'm disappointed and miserable about this.
Let's put it aside and keep going.
I have every confidence the Church of the Subgenius
will outlast today,
outlast the memory of all of us involved.
It's here to stay.
This is more than about our likes.
About liking Bob.
We're doing the same catchphrases.
This is about understanding the same kind of pain.
The same sort of inability to find happiness
in a world that doesn't seem to be made
for people like us.
We are truly mutants.
What I've always tried to keep in it
is an emotional connection, you know,
with real human feelings.
People that have, that fall in love
and have kids or get depressed
and can't get the right job
and are miserable.
All that human stuff, you know.
It's like, that's what we try
to keep some vestige of.
And I think that's what really attracts people
is that behind all these layers and layers
and layers of stuff,
somewhere down in there,
there's a kernel of,
I hate to use the word humanity,
but, and it's not.
It's yetensiny,
but because look at most humans.
You know, that's what we're really trying
to hold on to is that real core
of real realness, you know.
Do you know how much?
Do you know how it feels?
To be different from others?
To get picked on and you can't find a lover?
Are you a subgenius?
Do you know how it feels?
Do you know how it feels
when you have to go work
at a job that you hate
and your boss is a jerk?
Are you a subgenius?
Do you know how it feels?
Do you know how it feels
with a gun in your hand?
In your back?
When the conspiracy
takes away all your slack?
Are you a subgenius?
Do you know how it feels?
It's the end of the world as we know it.
It's the end of the world as we know it.
It's the end of the world as we know it.
And I feel fine.
It's definitely a sign of the apocalypse.
Negative feelings directed at others
is never constructive.
Grill bow!
All packed up and ready to go
Waiting for the exit saucer to show
Come on!
The normals say the rupture's a hoax
And all the people who are in it




All those sub-Ds are all just slapped up on dough
But I know Bob wouldn't lie
The X-ray rupture is the one true escape
The one kid hungry
I don't slack
I need a slack fix
Gimme gimme slack fix
Joseph Ford slack fix
Give it up I need slack
Religion is poison
I'm out of here!
Religion is poison
The final hour is approaching for the people of Earth.
I hate to disappoint you, but the world is not coming to an end.
Wah wah wah wah.
Ah yes, dear friends.
But you know it's not too late.
Like we said, there's...
You've still got time to get on board.
Next day, X-Day 99.
Let me do some credits here.
That last song was, uh,
Religion is Poison,
and also, uh, uh, uh, uh,
X-Days are Coming are, of course, by
the king of slack, Dr. Bill T. Miller.
Here's his address.

Einstein Secret Orchestra Radio
heard from WCSB and the show,
and also heard in the background right now,
and also heard in the background
of the video by Tom Needham and Richard DiRigo,
Countdown to X-Day,
the rough cut preview,
bits and pieces of it, there, um,
with interviews with Dr. Ligume,
Rev. Susie DeFluzzi,
Irreverent Friday Jones,
uh, uh, uh,
Dr. Onan Kanobait,
and, uh, so many, uh, others there.
Um, we also heard
Take Me Off to Space
by Nenslo
at the beginning of the show.
And there was a little bit of instrumental music there
by El Diablo.
And, uh, I, I think that,
that about covers,
oh, one last thing, friends.
Bob.
