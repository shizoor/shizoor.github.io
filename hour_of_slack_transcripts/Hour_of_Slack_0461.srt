1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,820
Oh, baby, baby, don't try that no more

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,020
Cause I'm hip to your driving down the road I go

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,340
Listen to me, people, try to understand

4
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,160
You can't get good from evil, so do the best you can

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,260
I want to tell you people, please try to understand

6
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,160
You know you can't get good from evil, so do the best you can

7
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,700
You know I'll hustle down in Texas, wait till you come

8
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,420
Successful investing and money management may sound complicated,

9
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,800
especially in this tricky technological world of ours.

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,580
But there are many investment opportunities which you are probably unaware of.

11
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,780
You can create interest and excitement as you learn more about investing and money management.

12
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,840
You can rip the cover off that old investment of yours

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,240
and decant a brand new spanking clean one,

14
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,560
like an embryo first delivered from the shell.

15
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,700
Now you know most people will always be impoverished

16
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,140
and they will always be in the middle of their own skepticism.

17
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,580
It's their own stick in the mud tail dragging alligator sagging dragging tail that holds them back.

18
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,800
They will always refuse to dream the big dream

19
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,760
or reach, grab, clutch and palpate the brass ring in life.

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,520
I hope you have decided to achieve something special, something more with your life.

21
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,500
Have you ever wondered what it would be like to call?

22
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,280
Many times.

23
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,360
Try it. Come on.

24
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,240
Oh, I'd better get that. I think I'm going to have to call the police.

25
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,900
I think this young lady is interested in my real estate seminar.

26
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,820
I'm always interested in signing up the troll free youth of today.

27
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,420
666.

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,840
666.

29
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,160
Unhobbled and trembled by trolls as our own generation was.

30
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,820
It'll be the most excitement we've had in a long time.

31
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:20,620
This exciting young slacker something generation is on the beam and on the ball.

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,620
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

33
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:38,600
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slacks.

34
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,140
Sponsored by the church of the subgenius.

35
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:07,500
Welcome dear friends to the subgenius hour of slacks.

36
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,500
лож oldwebit

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,180
was

38
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,400
go

39
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,140
The is

40
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,200
part

41
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,120
claiming

42
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,240
I'm building my honky-tonk on the moon

43
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,220
I'll fly you there by jet-propelled balloon

44
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,400
One-eyed monsters may parade it

45
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,000
But the Russians won't invade it

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,600
So come on up to my honky-tonk on the moon

47
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,860
Yeah, I'm building my honky-tonk on the moon

48
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,040
If you're lonely, you'll be happy pretty soon

49
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,860
The clock machines will be pailed

50
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,420
And the jukebox will be flared

51
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,220
And there'll be a lot of moonshine on the moon

52
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,120
There'll be lots of pretty women

53
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,780
And there'll be a given

54
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,580
There'll be a lot of moonshine on the moon

55
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:27,580


56
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,680
Lonely men

57
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,480
Everyone will fall in love

58
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,920
And there'll be a glow above

59
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,040
In that honky-tonk I'm building on the moon

60
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,680
Yeah, I'm building my honky-tonk on the moon

61
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,720
And the swinging doors will open pretty soon

62
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,800
So if you're a lonely person

63
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,400
Come on in and stop your hurting

64
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,120
In that honky-tonk I'm building on the moon

65
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,260
So if you're a lonely person

66
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,820
Come on in and stop your hurting

67
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,580
In that honky-tonk I'm building on the moon

68
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,700
For that honk-tonk I'm building on the moon

69
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,400
I slipped the...

70
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,860
Uhh yes uh huh huh huh

71
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,940
Uh, Honky Tonk, uh, Tavern

72
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,580
Or Honky Tonk on the Moon by George Lupus there

73
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,580
Now let's uh, get our balances

74
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,120
Straight here

75
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,880
Are we getting there?

76
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,600
I guess so

77
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,560
Uh...

78
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,800
Close enough for subgenius work

79
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,160
Ah yes dear friends

80
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,780
It's so good to be back in the barrel again

81
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,060
I mean the saddle

82
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,520
The saddle

83
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,420
On this brother-buckin'-bronco of a show

84
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,460
Man, it's been four shows for you

85
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,020
But only two weeks for me, friends

86
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,580
Two weeks in the crucible of finishing

87
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,560
Or else losing the new subgenius work

88
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,340
And we did it!

89
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:35,400
Yes, we finished the final layout of the last page of the last chapter

90
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,300
And it looks so cool

91
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,400
That even I can't believe it

92
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,440
Now theoretically it'll hit the stores in November

93
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,200
And you'll see, friends, that I would not lie to you

94
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,520
Regarding how intense this thing looks

95
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,240
Ha ha ha ha ha

96
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,560
We'll make millions, millions, friends!

97
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,740
K-millions!

98
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,480
Uh...

99
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,480
Well, to backtrack

100
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,340
Two weeks or four shows ago

101
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,100
I was informed

102
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,360
That the Revelation X book project

103
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,200
Was cancelled by the publishers

104
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,280
Just because we had run too late over the deadline

105
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,260
And so I therefore had to return the last half of the advance money

106
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,980
And never see the book published

107
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,420
Uh...

108
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,360
For you see, dear friends

109
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,920
Uh...

110
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:30,980
Uh...

111
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,280
Saint Paul Mavridis, the designer

112
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,100
Had gotten very, very sick in August

113
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:47,300
Poor Paul Murren had been unable to keep up the inhuman pace of layout that I'd stuck him with

114
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:54,620
And also the California State Board of Equalization tax monsters were using him as a test case

115
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,360
In order to

116
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,140
RUUU!

117
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,360
All California cartoonists

118
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,240
And bail out their bankrupt state

119
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,420
Anyway, friends, there were five chapters left to go

120
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:11,000
Sixty pages of the kind of layout you cannot imagine until you see it

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,060
And uh...

122
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:18,360
Faced with potentially the worst disaster of my or anybody else's life or lives

123
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,380
I told the publishers

124
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,240
At Simon & Schuster

125
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,320
That I would see that the book was finished

126
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,540
In two weeks

127
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,820
And for...

128
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,460
I flew to San Francisco

129
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,680
And for eleven days

130
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,780
Work of truly heroic epic proportions

131
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,340
Was accomplished by Saint Paul, Dr. Howell, and myself

132
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,900
And not to mention the other forty contributors whose various pieces we were juggling

133
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,380
If Bob's stable of artists truly had to shovel their own

134
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,300
In this Herculean task

135
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,960
We worked twenty hour days

136
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,720
I kid you not

137
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,140
Living on coffee and vitamins

138
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,500
Barking and snapping at each other

139
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,940
And alienating all our friends

140
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,520
And on September 14th

141
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,200
My twenty-first wedding anniversary

142
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:18,060
Paul and I got the final master pages to Federal Express in downtown San Francisco

143
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,680
Five minutes before they closed

144
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,780
The book was saved

145
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:30,920
Dear friends, in fact, it makes the book of the subgenius look like a fanzine piece of trash by comparison

146
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,460
And we were kinda tired

147
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:38,540
So tonight we're recuperating, dear friends

148
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,900
We're taking it easy

149
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,380
It's... it's slack, baby

150
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,340
And uh... like puzzling evidence

151
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,960
We're gonna let Dr. Howell do most of the work tonight

152
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,660
Uh...

153
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,320
While I was toiling with the Bayerians

154
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,880
I didn't have time to do a show there

155
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,520
But uh... I at least came back with a good recording

156
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,980
Of a particularly clear and un-mudied Berkeley subgenius show

157
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,140
Starring Dr. Howell, Robbins, as well as a couple of tapes

158
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,440
Of the kind of music that these two definitively sick artists

159
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,440
Uh... Hal Robbins and Paul Mavridis

160
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,340
Who I was stuck with for two weeks

161
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,720
Like to listen to while they're...

162
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,280
Uh... let's call it cartooning

163
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,840
And you would think that underground cartoonists in San Francisco

164
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,340
Particularly ones known for the black and sardonic

165
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,540
Uh... Hume Hour

166
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,080
Which marks the subgenius materials

167
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,600
Would listen to some sort of hideous anti-music death rock industrial noise garbage

168
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,980
But no

169
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,220
No, these most...

170
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,540
Cynical and hilariously depressing of professional cartoonists

171
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,460
Listen to happy, cheerful, cartoon music

172
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,800
And uh... atrocious versions of idiotic hits

173
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,280
And obscure country western novelty tunes

174
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,940
And space age bachelor pad lounge music

175
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,480
And uh... so...

176
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,600
For the next two shows

177
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,100
I'll be mixing Dr. Howell's uh...

178
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,560
Tour de Forcey

179
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,080
From KPFA

180
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,260
With his and uh... Palmer's and Nenslow's collection of

181
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,720
Horrifyingly cute and cloying music

182
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,160
And I think you're gonna dig it man

183
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,060
And of course this being a subgenius show

184
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,940
Will also no doubt cut away to the Starwood

185
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,920
Live radio revival

186
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,500
With Gleepo in front of the naked witches

187
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,520
Where I preach from the new book a lot

188
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,200
And uh... Susie's Atlantis

189
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,860
A show from WREK

190
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,980
And uh... Philo's guest spot

191
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,360
And uh... mostly though I think

192
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,780
I'll let Dr. Howell take it away

193
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,720
And when you hear his creation mythology segment

194
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,480
You'll hear why

195
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,680
Praise...

196
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,160
The Dawgs

197
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:50,220


198
00:12:50,220 --> 00:13:20,220


199
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:50,220


200
00:13:50,220 --> 00:14:20,220


201
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:50,220


202
00:14:50,220 --> 00:15:20,220


203
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:50,220


204
00:15:50,220 --> 00:16:20,220


205
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,620
I'm so stupid

206
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,240
Yeah, that water is of a very low temperature

207
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,060
But she didn't want it to melt for a very good reason

208
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,240
I'm not so stupid

209
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,240
Do you want some of the uh...

210
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,260
Charred coffee at the bottom of the pot?

211
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,480
Well I never eat spinach and charred

212
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,400
Because of the potassium overload potential

213
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,100
Which you will find described in full detail

214
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,880
On page sixty four of my remarkable book

215
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,220
Which is absolutely free

216
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,500
For those who take the horns of the bowl of destiny

217
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,120
in their hands and vault over its head.

218
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,180
The gorgeous spectacle of Eat It Me Knowing.

219
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,500
Oh, we're going to break a lot of records here today, folks.

220
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,120
Hello, Marge.

221
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,760
This is Clifton.

222
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,880
How you doing, kiddo?

223
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,800
I guess you wondered where I've been for the last six months.

224
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,380
I never did bring that hamburger meat home, did I?

225
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,580
Well, you know, when I got to Higgins Market,

226
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,020
I was headed west and I just kept on going.

227
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,100
You know how set I am on getting somewhere in this music.

228
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,200
Now I'm in Vegas.

229
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,720
In all of Las Vegas.

230
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,420
You know, the fun city.

231
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,380
Are you ready for me, baby?

232
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,460
Listen, I'm working in a four-piece band out of Needles, California.

233
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,240
The band is called the Colorado River Wranglers.

234
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,440
Ain't that catchy?

235
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,320
I play rhythm and do most of the singing.

236
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,460
Oh, some of them around here say that I'm a dead ringer for Hank Williams.

237
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,440
I don't know if I am or not.

238
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,740
Well, in the band backing me up there behind me,

239
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,700
there's Lawrence Barnett on takeoff guitar,

240
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,100
Shady Mullins on the bass,

241
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,920
Hugh Lawson on drums,

242
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,020
and Russell Bailey on steel.

243
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,280
Russell just got him a brand new rig today.

244
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,820
And it's a dilly.

245
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,320
It's a double neck, four pickup,

246
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,420
nine pedals,

247
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,540
two knee lever jobs.

248
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,900
You can probably hear them in the background.

249
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,100
I'll turn the phone around a little.

250
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,780
Carol?

251
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,940
We just started tonight here at the Dew Drop Inn.

252
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,220
We're one of the few real country bands left.

253
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,580
Most of the rest of them are gone pop.

254
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,360
Oh, they call what they do country music, but it ain't.

255
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,220
Well, here's one boy that ain't going back on his raisin.

256
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,180
Hey, guess what?

257
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,420
I'm in the music world.

258
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,040
I'm a musician's union.

259
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,180
Yep.

260
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,460
I made it the first time I went down there.

261
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,440
I guess they could just tell by talking to me.

262
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,060
I guess they could just tell by talking to me.

263
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,000
And now another thing.

264
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:00,960
They tell me people ought to know that I've got to have a name in this business.

265
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,060
Well, they know my name was Clifton Harkness, but I guess it didn't sound like you'll pick...

266
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,440
Marge, you are now talking to Cigarette Milner.

267
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,700
No, Cigarette Milner.

268
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,000
No, Cigarette Milner.

269
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,300
Yeah, Cigarette.

270
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,400
Got a run to, got a run to.

271
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,400


272
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,400


273
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,400


274
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:23,100
ring to it, hadn't it? With a name like that, I ought to pack them in. Get it? Pack them in.

275
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:32,500
Why, I have them rolling in the aisles. Rolling. Let them watch my smoke. Now, baby, for that big

276
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:40,080
surprise, I'm gonna cut a record. It'll cost me $500, so I think you better stay on down in

277
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:46,520
the creamery till I get this thing going. Then you can tell old Wattenbarger to hang it. I know

278
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,940
he's giving you a bad time. When I get back there, I just might let him hold one, too. He's begging

279
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:58,020
for it. Now, send me all the money you can, baby. I'm gonna record that song of mine,

280
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,660
I Love You, Yes, I Do. You know that one I wrote in 15 minutes? Then I'm gonna do a new one I wrote

281
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,260
for you, baby. It's called I Got My Hands Full.

282
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,060
I just signed up for a new song, I love you, yes, I do.

283
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:15,360
I just signed up as an IBM writer. Well, you wouldn't understand all that. I ain't got time

284
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,380
now to explain it. I don't know what that'll set me back. I haven't got a bill from them yet.

285
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,860
Anyhow, whatever it takes me to get started won't amount to nothing compared to what I'll

286
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:34,780
be bringing in. Why, Marge, you'll be wearing jewelry as big as genuine diamonds. Your dad

287
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,940
said I never would make it, didn't he? Well, when I come back in a fancy outfit,

288
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:46,080
for a personal appearance, and people are clawing at one another just to get at me to touch my clothes,

289
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:53,320
tell him to keep his hat on so I'll know him. Hey, got the garden in yet? You can't ever tell

290
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,520
when I come breezing in, and you know I'm gonna want some fried okra. That ain't all I want either,

291
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,900
baby.

292
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,560
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

293
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,840
Well, kiddo, send me some money. This is old cigarette signing off.

294
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,100
Sayin' so long for now. Bye, baby.

295
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:24,040
Oh, yes, dear friends. Well, beautiful piece there by Cigarette Milner. Well, actually,

296
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:31,440
that's by Tommy Collins, called Cigarette Milner from the collection that Dr. Howell

297
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:39,660
gave me called Peckerwoods on Parade. Yes, we've got many a lovely Peckerwood tune, and

298
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,040
I'm going to sing it to you.

299
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,040


300
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,320
I guess our theme for tonight is big money. Yeah, big bucks through big entertainment,

301
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:52,440
like our book deal. We're gonna be rollin' in it pretty soon. I just know, I just know

302
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:58,340
it's gonna work out that way. Bob said so. Bob sold it, I smoked it, that settles it.

303
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:05,620
You know, it's a beautiful thing. And, well, let's go back to some more of Dr. Howell's

304
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,400
money management preachings.

305
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,540
After,

306
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,340
and during,

307
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,060
and, uh,

308
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,500
in the course of this message.

309
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,400
Uh, thank you.

310
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,620
You really need that seminar. It'll turn your life around.

311
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,680
You're not stupid enough to think I'm gonna let you get away with this, are you?

312
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,420
Uh, uh,

313
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:32,700
you wouldn't be stupid enough to pass up that bill after all we've been through, would you?

314
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,280
How, uh,

315
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,860
humanity

316
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,420
gained mastery over all the other creatures.

317
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,780
You mustn't tell them about us, Red Tire,

318
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,560
because they're not my friends.

319
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,820
They're friends.

320
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,460
But you're my friend, did you see?

321
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,740
Well, because I'm too stupid to give them a lead.

322
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,240
That's why I yelled for help.

323
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,600
You'll yell for help.

324
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,240
And then you have the benefit of my seminar.

325
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,160
You're making your noises, dear.

326
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,840
Yes, you'll tingle and quiver with pleasure,

327
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:04,200
as I lay upon you the story of true enlightenment in the financial world.

328
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,740
The financial body and the spiritual body are related.

329
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,020
They are fastened by an ectoplane.

330
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,140
They are plasmic and bulidous,

331
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,040
reaching from the tummy of one to the tummy of another.

332
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,780
And these two tummies are intertwined with financial solidarity.

333
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,300
I know it's not for anybody, you know.

334
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,040
Why your spending habits are so erratic.

335
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,660
It is because your etheric spiritual double does not have

336
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,280
Thank you, thank you.

337
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:38,040
does not have a sound sense of dollars and cents.

338
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,640
Huh?

339
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,920
of getting and spending.

340
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,580
The real world.

341
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,900
Well, are there any questions at this point?

342
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,960
Now, no one is allowed to go to the toilet during the seminar.

343
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:51,480


344
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,040
I'm sorry, what was that?

345
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,060
The videos are here.

346
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,080
Oh, yes. Well, we're going to watch the video entitled

347
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,540
Man, Dominator Over All.

348
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,240
Thank you, thank you. I'll thread it up.

349
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,460
That is to say, I'll...

350
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,440
Even the unknown sea creatures.

351
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,540
The hippocampus duchalatus.

352
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,080
Or common seahorse.

353
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,560
The hee-haw of the deep.

354
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,500
Yes, the suborder thoracostei.

355
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,600
Thank you. Thank you.

356
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,620
And order gastarothsi formes.

357
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,540
Family sin, anathidae.

358
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,900
Old hippo.

359
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,420
The seahorse.

360
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,920
Yes, a trifle, a trifle of a horse.

361
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:27,840
Yay!

362
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,480
Of course, of course.

363
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,960
But whoever heard of an aquatic horse?

364
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,160
Unless, of course, the aquatic horse...

365
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,820
Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you.

366
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,640
Thank you very, very much.

367
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,380
Man, you could have used that seahorse bit more.

368
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,160
They'd go nuts for it.

369
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:47,660
They like it. But in fact, the seahorse and all other creatures came from an egg.

370
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,120
A what?

371
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,180
An egg.

372
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,520
Yay!

373
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,360
Yes, egg.

374
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,740
Necessary in this world.

375
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,100
They make the world go round.

376
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,200
And are, like the earth itself, round.

377
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,520
Though some eggs are flat.

378
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,860
As some still believe the earth to be.

379
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,920
They're lying.

380
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,600
They're flat.

381
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:16,980
People often ask, as an idle question, whether the process of evolution began with the chicken or the egg.

382
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,140
It began with me.

383
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,040
Was there an egg out of which the first chicken came?

384
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,300
Or did a chicken lay the first egg?

385
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,240
Give up?

386
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,240
I'm in a position to state that the first thing created was the egg.

387
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,320
The great egg.

388
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:37,660


389
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,140
The great glistening egg.

390
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,880
In the center of the universe it gleamed and sparkled.

391
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,620
And now we jail them.

392
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:51,660
Its shells flung back the effulgence of the first surges of life in the young cosmos.

393
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,020
You know, they make a lot of eggs in Catalonia.

394
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,620
That's where I should be right now.

395
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,160
But I'm not.

396
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,220
Back in the egg, I'm afraid we can't return to the earth.

397
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,740
We can't return to the womb.

398
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,960
In our rocketing ride toward the tomb.

399
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,600
Go back to Ork.

400
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,520
I'm stuck in Berkeley and I can't get out.

401
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:19,440
Now listen closely and I'll explain some cosmic wisdom concerning the dread albuminites.

402
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,400
Or egg worshippers.

403
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,360
The Bavarian albuminati who pull the strings behind the scenes today.

404
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,100
That is.

405
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,240
If I can keep my sanity in this maelstrom.

406
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,660
Maelstrom or sound effects.

407
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,700
This hurricane of clattering voices that seems to drive my intellect and pre-emotion.

408
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,700
And run down inverse corridors of hexapodal magnets.

409
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,960
And the sound effects of the

410
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,760
In a building tall.

411
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,040
With a stone wall around.

412
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,300
There's a rubber room.

413
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,340
When a man sees things and hears sounds.

414
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,520
It's not fair.

415
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,260
He's headed for.

416
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,100
The rubber room.

417
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,220
Illusions in a town.

418
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:33,220


419
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:37,800
A twisted mind to save from self destruction.

420
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,960
It's the rubber room.

421
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,440
Where a man can run into the wall.

422
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,640
Till his strength makes him fall and lie still.

423
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,640
And wait for help.

424
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,840
In the rubber room.

425
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,940
From his blurry vision of blue.

426
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:20,080
The man in the room right next to mine.

427
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,180
Screams a woman's name.

428
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,920
Hits the wall in vain.

429
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,580
Says the rubber room.

430
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,120
I hear footsteps.

431
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,060
Steadies pounding on the floor.

432
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,140
Gotta hope they don't stop at my door.

433
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,880
I'm the rubber room.

434
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,740
Now they've come to get me.

435
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,920
But they find.

436
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,160
I'm screaming pretty words.

437
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,000
Trying to make them rhyme.

438
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,160
I'm in the rubber room.

439
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,820
With mycy paradoxically.

440
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,060
That they do what they will.

441
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,000
When the blue blood is останов.

442
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,120
lucid.

443
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,200
Yes here I am thinking.

444
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,400
Why does my razors

445
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,920
I just ran you over.

446
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,500
He's kind.

447
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:37,220
dear friends the rubber room by Porter Wagner yes the one and only Porter

448
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:44,500
Wagner and we're gonna get right on back into the evil of dr. Howell and his

449
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,420
howling

450
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:52,140
right things there from KPFA in Berkeley

451
00:29:53,100 --> 00:30:00,640
he gets on into a sort of creation myth and we may not ever get to any of the

452
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,960
other types because it's so important that you learn this lesson

453
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:30,340
and it all now sometimes a thousand wrangling instruments about my news and

454
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:37,580
sometimes voicing my heart must continue heart medicine in hollow

455
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:49,620
and then there's the mattering and the chattering of the millions of verminous

456
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,080
roaches

457
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:59,260
between the walls and spaces between the spaces spaces spaces and another

458
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:05,720
locust came and carried away a grain of wheat and Pharaoh waxed raw he waxed his

459
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:11,480
legs and he waxed ed's big daddy wrong when God had manufactured

460
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:19,200
well I would tell you the secret of creation in time and space but it's just

461
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,800
so hard to do it over the percolating

462
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,120
meadow

463
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,380
and the

464
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:44,840
the tape until beneath our gracious fall far far far Franz and upon huge

465
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,000
belching reptiles rumble their empty belly

466
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,880
gosh why are you here

467
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,220
on horseback

468
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,000
actually I was

469
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,600
blood

470
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,500
you gonna

471
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:07,500


472
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,220
weirdest

473
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,160
time

474
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,940
yeah

475
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,620
in all this

476
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,900
you go

477
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,280
I'll

478
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,960
יפ

479
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,000
yeah

480
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,500
it

481
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:21,700
better

482
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,460
go

483
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:30,520
Here, in this first of a set of stomachs, one of God's finest creations, enormous boulders,

484
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:37,980
absentmindedly swallowed by the dim-witted beast, grind and crush the fern into a Fletcher-like

485
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,380
paste.

486
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:46,420
Then, the disgusting mass slips further on into the body of the behemoth, entering the

487
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,060
stomach, which radiates an incredible amount of heat.

488
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,000
Why, you might ask?

489
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:52,700
Yeah, why?

490
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:59,760
Because the stomach of these giant dinosaurs is full of sympathetic, symbiotic bacteria,

491
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:02,700
which perform the major action of digestion.

492
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,380
After these giant stones have...

493
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,240
Oh, hello, Doctor.

494
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,420
Oh, uh, yes, I'm here.

495
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,140
I can just see you at the end of my microscope, my boy.

496
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,640
Oh, yes, I'm here, too.

497
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,780
That means little color.

498
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,240
Yes, it does.

499
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,280
And little color waxed raw.

500
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,040
And, uh, I'm...

501
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,040


502
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,760
I'm just going to go ahead and add the Big Daddy Raw thing again.

503
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,740
Oh, oh, it's Clarabelle.

504
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,240
Just a moment.

505
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:24,760
Who's that?

506
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,580
Who's on there?

507
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,120
Ah, well, we've got Clarabelle here, and, uh, uh, Hank Kisham, and, uh, Hank Ketchum,

508
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,820
who draws Dennis the Menace, and, uh...

509
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,480
Cut.

510
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:39,280
I was going to, uh, describe the, uh, secrets of life and death and all the mysteries

511
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,120
of time and space, as well as the secret teachings of all ages, if I can work them in.

512
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,020
Uh, of course, I'll have to shout this over the, uh, the Niagara Falls or whatever.

513
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,020


514
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,020


515
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,020


516
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,520
Uh, I'm in a little bit of a hurry, but I'm going to run over to the right, and I'm going

517
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:49,520


518
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:49,520


519
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:49,520


520
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:49,520


521
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:49,520


522
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:49,520


523
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:49,520


524
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:49,520


525
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:49,520


526
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:49,520


527
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,920
There's that clown honking his horn again.

528
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,760
That's a Harpo, I believe.

529
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,840
Uh, it's the ninth Marx brother, uh, Gummo.

530
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:03,800
Uh, yes, uh, the one who had to be...

531
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,700
Forest Gummo.

532
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,400
Yes, exactly.

533
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,060
Forest Gummo.

534
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:19,320
Well, he's been very ill-publicized because a famous family of comedians never cared to bring this subterranean scorpion to the light before.

535
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,380
Have you seen natural-born killers yet?

536
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,800
Every time I go walking down the street in my neighborhood.

537
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,180
Why, they'd kill for a burrito.

538
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:35,400
And so would I when I think of the delicious morsels available at Taqueria of Romantismo.

539
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,860
Oh, someone imitating a synthesizer again.

540
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,940
Hasn't that robot revolution taken place yet?

541
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,180
Did you or did you not see the movie?

542
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,840
The movie?

543
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,320
Yeah.

544
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,180
The movie.

545
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:51,920
Tonight?

546
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:52,840
Robot revolution.

547
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,280
Yes, robo-evolution.

548
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,160
Well, no, I didn't see that movie. I didn't.

549
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,700
It's against my entrenched, severe moral principles to...

550
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,140
You should go see it on Crappy.

551
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,600
You should cure both of them and not see it.

552
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,480
Well, now, this is a very trenchant recommendation that's happening here.

553
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:17,640
You know, it's like going to see 2001 or Logan's Run or some cool movie like that.

554
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:17,980
Yeah.

555
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,660
You made a mistake.

556
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,020
No, no, no, no, no.

557
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,520
I'm serious.

558
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:27,460
Or there's Time Cart with John, Claude, and Dan.

559
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,680
Damn it all.

560
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:34,440
Oh, well, we're experiencing a solar storm with particles and magnetic flux.

561
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,200
And, uh...

562
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,880
It's jamming the airwaves.

563
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:43,720
I find it very difficult to creep against the bubbling tide of sludge here, but...

564
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,780
I can't really hear you, but I know you're there.

565
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:52,460
And I thank you for participating in this amazing symposium.

566
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,520
You're just reading stuff and, like, weird sound effects.

567
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,080
And you're just reading stuff.

568
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,060
Is that all the show is?

569
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,480
Weird sound effects?

570
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,640
I don't know what you mean.

571
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,020
I don't hear any sound effects.

572
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,480
What sound effects?

573
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,980
Uh, no.

574
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,860
See, I don't play those either.

575
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,820
I just play the patchy.

576
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,160
That's right.

577
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,140
Yeah, I'm the chump.

578
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,880
Yeah, yeah, me.

579
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,160
I'm the goof.

580
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,660
That's me.

581
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,460
Do you see the MTV Music Awards?

582
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,560
I did not.

583
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,740
And a good friend of mine wanted me to record them.

584
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,700
But, uh...

585
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,160
Listen to the plaudits of the crowd.

586
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,400
You know, Michael Jackson came out with his new drive.

587
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,500
I wish I could hear you, but I'm sure what you have to say is...

588
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,520
I say Michael Jackson came out with his new drive.

589
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,960
Now, you say, uh...

590
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,940
Mahalia Jackson and Charlie Pryde made an appearance.

591
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,240
Well, you know, I don't follow the show business.

592
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,180
And it's, uh...

593
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,120
It's vagaries.

594
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:43,840
It's, uh...

595
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,940
Eddie's and Current's.

596
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,540
No, Michael Jackson.

597
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,280
And his wife.

598
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,480
Mike O'Jackson?

599
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:50,920
I don't...

600
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,180
Is he Irish or something?

601
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,540
I'm not sure I know who you're talking about.

602
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:54,640


603
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,760
Ah.

604
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,220
And, uh...

605
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,980
He's a mooster in front of everyone.

606
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,860
I beg your pardon.

607
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,300
He stuck his tongue down his throat.

608
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,640
Was this on the Playboy channel?

609
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,380
He stuck his tongue down his throat.

610
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,260
He wrote on national TV.

611
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,500
You were watching an X-ray film, maybe?

612
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,500
Or a cat scan?

613
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:15,880
Just to prove that, you know, she is female and she is an adult woman and that he is attracted to, uh...

614
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,720
It's incredible what they can do with special effects these days.

615
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,580
He's the world's greatest reclusive freak.

616
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:28,760
You know, you can hear a babble about celebrities on every station at every hour of the day.

617
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,340
And usually not on this show.

618
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,360
So let us not give ourselves over to this unclean and prurient...

619
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:36,620
I was wondering...

620
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:36,620


621
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,800
...who can hardly concern us in our current society.

622
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,560
Is Michael Jackson a subgenius?

623
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,140
What an amusing suggestion, young man.

624
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,880
I think the world laughs as it considers...

625
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,340
Is he too mainstream of a freak?

626
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,080
...to have a sophisticated communicator.

627
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,000
Well, you know, uh...

628
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,200
This is an entirely relative concept.

629
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,400
I wasn't attempting to discuss the abnormal, but rather the normal.

630
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,880
The genetic paradigm which occurred at the beginning of time.

631
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,360
If I could resume my sermon, I would...

632
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,380
I would explain to you...

633
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,720
Thank you.

634
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,200
They just don't take it seriously.

635
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,820
No, they don't.

636
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,500
But you can be the one who does.

637
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,280
And benefit.

638
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,560
Benefit.

639
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Exalt yourself to the stars.

640
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,520
To the firmament.

641
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,700
And what a firm, firmament it is.

642
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:23,580
Well, don't you think it's great that Michael Jackson affirmed his firmament and...

643
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,760
He thumbed his...

644
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,120
What?

645
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,380
He affirmed his two-toned manhood on television?

646
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,200
Hmm.

647
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,180
Well, I never thought he was teutonic myself.

648
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,260
But, uh...

649
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,300
You know, I...

650
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,360
I wouldn't be surprised...

651
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,400
I wouldn't be surprised at any, uh...

652
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,140
revelation about anyone's ancestry.

653
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,480
Thank you very much.

654
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,120
I myself go back to the ancient kings of Scotland.

655
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,540
So let's go back millions and millions of years...

656
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,260
through the fog of time.

657
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,100
That milk doggy dog scares me.

658
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,120
Well, this is before dogs even existed.

659
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,520
Or cats, for that matter.

660
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:58,000
They all fused into the ancestral mammalian line.

661
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,940
And here, perched upon a lower Cretaceous branch...

662
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,020
is a Crucifontia, a primitive mammal...

663
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,280
which occupies the niche of, uh...

664
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,260
today's squirrel.

665
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,640
And as we leave this squirrely little fellow...

666
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,840
who dodges the, uh, waving tail of the enraged Stegosaurus...

667
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,820
uh, let's move back even further in time...

668
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,180
until we get to the beginning of all things...

669
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,460
and the giant cosmic egg...

670
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,280
which I mentioned earlier on our program.

671
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,360
There it is, gleaming like that fabled dome...

672
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,560
which Sinbad, when he first saw it from afar...

673
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,820
thought was the roof of some mosque...

674
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,760
not realizing...

675
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,920
it was the cavernous egg of the enormous roof...

676
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,800
the gigantic bird...

677
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,240
who blackens the entire sky...

678
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,840
with the vast span of its wings.

679
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,280
Well, uh, when God had manufactured all the eggs...

680
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,240
out of which the fishes and the serpents...

681
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,300
and the frogs and the birds and the mammals...

682
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,720
and even the duck-billed platypus...

683
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,900
would eventually emerge...

684
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,220
he called the embryos before him...

685
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,300
and saw that they were good.

686
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,740
Perhaps I ought to explain...

687
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:04,740


688
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:08,020
that all embryos look very much the same.

689
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,820
They are what you are before you are born...

690
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,500
and whether you are going to be a tadpole...

691
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,840
or a peacock or a cameo leopard or a man...

692
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,540
when you are an embryo...

693
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,900
you look, look, uh...

694
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,880
you look just like a particularly repulsive...

695
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,900
and helpless human being.

696
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,780
The embryos stood up in front of God...

697
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,620
with their feeble hands clasped politely...

698
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,460
over their protuberant stomachs...

699
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,120
and their heavy heads hanging down respectfully...

700
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,720
and God addressed them...

701
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,180
He said,

702
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,460
Now, you embryos, here you are...

703
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,040
all looking exactly the same...

704
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,480
and we are going to give you the choice...

705
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,720
of what you are going to be.

706
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,580
When you grow up, you will get bigger anyway...

707
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,920
but we are pleased to grant you another gift as well.

708
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,820
You may alter any parts of yourselves...

709
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,480
into anything which you think...

710
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,500
would be useful to you in an afterlife.

711
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,660
For instance, at the moment, you can't dig.

712
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,960
Anybody would like to turn his hands...

713
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,200
into a pair of spades or garden forks...

714
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,300
is allowed to do so.

715
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,480
Or, to put it another way...

716
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,980
at present, you can only use your mouths...

717
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,680
for eating with.

718
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,020
Anybody who'd like to use his mouth...

719
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,400
as an offensive weapon...

720
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,360
can change it by asking...

721
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,680
and be a corking grill or a saber-toothed tiger...

722
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,780
or a tyrannosaurus rex...

723
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,860
one of the finest of my creations.

724
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,740
Now then, step right up...

725
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,120
and choose your tools...

726
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,740
but remember that what you choose...

727
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,020
you will grow into...

728
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,520
and will have to stick to.

729
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,680
Now, all the embryos...

730
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,200
thought the matter over politely...

731
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,820
and then, one by one...

732
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,660
they stepped up before the blaze...

733
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,520
of the eternal throne.

734
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,020
They were allowed two or three specializations...

735
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,440
so that some chose to use their arms...

736
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,980
as flying machines...

737
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,800
and their mouths as weapons...

738
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,760
or crackers or drillers or spoons...

739
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,020
while others selected to use their bodies...

740
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,560
as boats and their hands as oars.

741
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,240
For example, the badgers thought very hard...

742
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,220
and decided to ask three boons.

743
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,160
They wanted to change their skins for shields...

744
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,420
their mouths for weapons...

745
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,320
and their arms for garden forks...

746
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,600
and those boons were granted.

747
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,460
Everybody specialized in one way or another...

748
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,100
and some of the creatures...

749
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,520
in very strange ways.

750
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,740
For instance, one of the lizards...

751
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,480
decided to swap his whole body for blotting paper...

752
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,280
and one of the toads who lived in the Antipodes...

753
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,440
decided simply to be a water bottle.

754
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,120
Well, the asking and granting took up two long days.

755
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,500
They were the fifth and sixth...

756
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,600
so far as I remember...

757
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,700
and at the very end of the sixth day...

758
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,280
just before it was time to knock off for Sunday...

759
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,740
they had got through all the little embryos...

760
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,800
except one...

761
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,880
and this embryo was Man.

762
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,540
Well, our little Man, said God...

763
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,740
you have waited till the last...

764
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,280
and slept on your decision...

765
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,760
and we are sure...

766
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,360
you have been thinking hard all the time.

767
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,900
What can we do for you?

768
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,540
Please God, said the embryo...

769
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:05,100
I think that you made me in the shape...

770
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,080
which I now have...

771
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,220
for reasons best known to yourselves...

772
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,600
and that it would be rude to change.

773
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,960
If I am to have my choice...

774
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,360
I will stay just as I am.

775
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,560
I will not alter any of the parts...

776
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,620
which you gave to me...

777
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,660
for other and doubtless inferior tools...

778
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:22,520
and I will stay a defenseless embryo...

779
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,580
all my life...

780
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,840
doing my best to make unto myself...

781
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,820
a few feeble implements out of the wood...

782
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,560
iron and other materials...

783
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,400
which you have seen fit to put before me.

784
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,700
If I want a boat...

785
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,120
I will endeavor to construct it out of trees...

786
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,420
and if I want to fly...

787
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,640
I'll put together a chariot to do it for me.

788
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,460
Probably I have been very silly...

789
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,880
in refusing to take advantage of your kind offer...

790
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,560
but I have done my best to think it over carefully...

791
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,000
and now hope that the feeble decision...

792
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,500
of this small innocent...

793
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,720
will find favor with yourselves.

794
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,620
Well done, exclaimed the Creator...

795
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,700
in delighted tones.

796
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,260
Here, all you embryos...

797
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,560
come here with your beaks and claws...

798
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,040
and whatnots...

799
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,340
to look upon our first man.

800
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,960
He is the only one who has guessed our riddle...

801
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,380
out of all of you...

802
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,140
and we have great pleasure...

803
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,560
in conferring upon him...

804
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,000
on this auspicious occasion...

805
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
the order of dominion over the fowls of the air...

806
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,580
and the beasts of the earth...

807
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,680
and the fishes of the sea.

808
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,940
Now let the rest of you get along...

809
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,220
and love and multiply...

810
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,180
and all that sort of thing...

811
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,120
for it is time to knock off for the weekend.

812
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,560
As for you, man...

813
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,720
you will be a naked tool all your life...

814
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,840
though a user of tools...

815
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,660
you will look like an embryo...

816
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,000
till they bury you...

817
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,960
but all others will be embryos...

818
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,120
before your might.

819
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,180
Eternally undeveloped...

820
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,420
you will always remain potential...

821
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,740
in our image...

822
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,280
able to see some of our sorrows...

823
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,240
and to feel some of our joys.

824
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,900
We are partly sorry for you, man...

825
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,660
said Jehovah One...

826
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,500
and partly happy...

827
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,160
but always proud.

828
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:04,060
Run along then, man...

829
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,800
and do your best...

830
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,920
and listen, man...

831
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,080
before you go...

832
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:08,660
Yeah?

833
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,920
Well, he made a request...

834
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,880
a certain request...

835
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,920
of the first human.

836
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,560
To find out what this request was...

837
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,080
all you need do is enroll...

838
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,660
in my special real estate seminar...

839
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,640
which will...

840
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,920
give you thrills and success...

841
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,220
in sex and business...

842
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,840
and let you learn the ordinate...

843
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,860
and the abscissa...

844
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,340
of life itself.

845
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,840
Life and life's effluence...

846
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,720
cloud at once and shower...

847
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,700
joy, caller...

848
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,560
is the spirit and the power...

849
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,700
which wedded nature...

850
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,760
gives to us in doubt.

851
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,800
A new earth and a new heaven...

852
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,260
undreamt of by the sensual...

853
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:53,740
and the proud.

854
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,840
Slack is the soft voice...

855
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,520
like the luminous cloud...

856
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,800
we in ourselves rejoice...

857
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,240
and thence...

858
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,400
comes all the charms or erosite...

859
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,800
all melodies...

860
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,840
an echo of that voice...

861
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,300
all colors as a fusion of that light.

862
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,400
Thank you. Thank you very much.

863
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:13,840
Thank you.

864
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:27,320
A giant foot. Yes, I've heard that before...

865
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,520
God is a giant foot.

866
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,400
In fact, an athlete's foot.

867
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,480
The foot of a powerful, muscular being.

868
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,580
And this foot...

869
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,940
this great foot...

870
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,380
of Jehovah One is said to have...

871
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,220
an Achilles heel.

872
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,960
A little patch wherein...

873
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,540
he may be wounded.

874
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,020
There was an editorial...

875
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,780
in today's San Francisco Chronicle...

876
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,180
complaining about the death...

877
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,040
of Jehovah One.

878
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,660
Guess Jehovah One...

879
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,880
whose huge bloated body...

880
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,780
floats in space...

881
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,380
kept from decay by the eternal...

882
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,000
processes of cold...

883
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,180
and stasis.

884
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,240
So sad.

885
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,020
So fresh, the days that are no more.

886
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,500
You know...

887
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,960
they call this the...

888
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,180
Puzzling Evidence Show...

889
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,760
and one might wonder...

890
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,600
why doesn't one ever hear...

891
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,400
puzzling evidence on this show?

892
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,980
If it's his show and so forth...

893
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,540
why not?

894
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,760
I wonder.

895
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:43,500
I wonder.

896
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:46,820
And so...

897
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,020
let's consider...

898
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,860
since I seem to be the only one here...

899
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,520
the world of millions...

900
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,740
and millions of years ago.

901
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,080
The warm swamps...

902
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,020
and the secondary...

903
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:00,100
I always return there.

904
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,800
Last night I had a dilly of a dream...

905
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,300
of being hunted by dinosaurs.

906
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,980
You might think that happens to me all the time.

907
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,560
Well, it's actually very rare.

908
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:10,980
Well, um...

909
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:13,180
the earth cooled, the sea covered it.

910
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,920
It was a hundred million years ago...

911
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,900
that life came to the great sea.

912
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,640
And the fishes...

913
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,640
bred within it.

914
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,360
They were the oldest people...

915
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:23,720
to fish.

916
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,240
Their children climbed out of it...

917
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,760
and stood upon the bosky shores.

918
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,960
And they were the amphibia.

919
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,420
The hoppy toads and frogs.

920
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,180
Our friends, the newts.

921
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,920
The third people...

922
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,000
who sprang from them...

923
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,140
were the reptiles.

924
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,440
Think of those old faces of the world...

925
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,140
upon which the reptiles moved in the slime.

926
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,020
And of the millions of years.

927
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,500
Why the birds...

928
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,240
which you see every day are their descendants.

929
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,080
They were their parents...

930
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,100
but can persist to live along with them.

931
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:55,700
Yes, when they were born...

932
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,340
there were no birds or people.

933
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,080
No birds or men.

934
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,720
No monkeys or reindeer or elephants...

935
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,640
or any such animals.

936
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:05,700
Only the amphibia and the reptiles...

937
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,760
and the fishes...

938
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,920
and the Mesozoic world.

939
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:11,260
That's history.

940
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:17,320
Yes, but it'll be open book.

941
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,080
There is something strange...

942
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,580
about the will of the sea.

943
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,700
It is bound up with the history...

944
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,280
of my family.

945
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,180
Now, did you ever hear the story...

946
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:29,500
of Homo sapiens armatus georgiosanctus?

947
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,860
His name was Will.

948
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:34,560
Well, that's the scientific name.

949
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,500
Now, pay attention.

950
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,300
Once, very long ago...

951
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,560
there were two families...

952
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,440
called Atlantosaurus imanus...

953
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,040
and Ceratosaurus nasicornis.

954
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:47,960
Atlantosaurus...

955
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,600
was 115 feet long.

956
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,980
He had not many brains...

957
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,200
although I did hear...

958
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,140
he had something like an extra brain...

959
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,020
at the other end of him...

960
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,140
to take care of his tail...

961
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:59,000
and he lived by browsing on the trees.

962
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,400
He was timid, ruminant and harmless...

963
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,780
except to the tree frogs...

964
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,540
which he accidentally munched up...

965
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,380
among the boughs.

966
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,680
He lived very long...

967
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,380
and thought all the time.

968
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,780
So that, although he did not think very well...

969
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,820
he had generally thought a good deal...

970
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,620
by the end of his long life.

971
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,600
So far as I can remember...

972
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:21,980
he was a very good boy.

973
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:22,940
Yes, it took a long time...

974
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:23,900
to grow one of those babies.

975
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,820
He had solved the problem of being a giant...

976
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,520
without breaking on account of his own...

977
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,920
weighty height of 20 feet...

978
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,100
by having his bones hollow.

979
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:32,860
The birds do that too, you know...

980
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:33,420
for other reasons.

981
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,880
However, perhaps I am muddling him up...

982
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,180
with another of the dinosauria.

983
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,100
Ceratosaurus nasicornis was quite small.

984
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,920
He was only 17 feet long...

985
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,440
but he had teeth.

986
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,920
Great, crushing and tearing teeth...

987
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,020
which fitted into each other so badly...

988
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,240
that he leaped always with his...

989
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,860
slaughterous mouth half open...

990
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,440
in a grin of terror.

991
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,440
He leaped like a kangaroo...

992
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,380
a death-dealing kangaroo.

993
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,780
And he generally leaped upon...

994
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,740
poor old Atlantosaurus imanus.

995
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,360
Yes, indeed.

996
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,100
He had a horn upon his nose...

997
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,200
like a rhinoceros...

998
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,660
with which he could rip an opening...

999
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,820
in that big and trundling old body...

1000
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,560
and his clashing teeth...

1001
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,520
like flesh as in ripe fruit...

1002
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,380
and tear it out in mouthfuls...

1003
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,640
by the action of his muscular neck.

1004
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,560
What is more terrible...

1005
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,220
he leaped in packs...

1006
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,100
if you can imagine that.

1007
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:26,740
If you'd like to make a call...

1008
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,920
please hang up and try again.

1009
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,420
Oh, no, I'm fine where I am.

1010
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,240
Ceratosaurus nasicornis was at war...

1011
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,880
with Atlantosaurus imanus...

1012
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,740
in that strange war...

1013
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,400
which the spirit of the waters will.

1014
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,060
The war of competition and evolution...

1015
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,140
which makes the trees fight upward...

1016
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,700
and the sun on the Amazon...

1017
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,100
and in the course of which...

1018
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,460
for the boon of life...

1019
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,920
many of reptilian cousins...

1020
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,460
have been content to sacrifice...

1021
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,600
the benefits of limbs and teeth and eyesight.

1022
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,860
Ceratosaurus was savage and aggressive.

1023
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,320
Atlantosaurus timid and old.

1024
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,300
Their combat lasted...

1025
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,220
for as many centuries as will be needed...

1026
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,760
by homo sapiens also...

1027
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,080
in which to destroy himself.

1028
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,500
At the end of that time...

1029
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,460
it was the defender who triumphed.

1030
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,980
The ferocious kangaroo...

1031
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,200
had dealt death on every side...

1032
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,140
had decimated his adversaries...

1033
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,800
and fed upon their carcasses.

1034
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,460
But carcasses cannot continue...

1035
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,120
their species.

1036
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,580
And in the end the kangaroos...

1037
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,900
had consumed the very flesh on which they lived.

1038
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,720
Too remorseless for the spirit of the waters...

1039
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,080
too bloodthirsty for the hierarchy...

1040
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,560
of progressive victims...

1041
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,120
the last Ceratosaurus...

1042
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,700
roamed the thick-leaved jungles...

1043
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,440
in a vain search for the food...

1044
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,240
which could satisfy his grinning...

1045
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,760
gnashing jaws...

1046
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,040
then died...

1047
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,360
and slept with his fathers.

1048
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,080
Yeah...

1049
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,200
The last Atlantosaurus...

1050
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,700
thrust her forty-foot neck out of the jungle...

1051
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,840
in which she had been hiding...

1052
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,160
and surveyed the emaciated corpse...

1053
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,560
of her starved persecutor.

1054
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,320
She had preserved her life...

1055
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,600
as the sensible wood pigeon does...

1056
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,160
by specializing in escape.

1057
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,340
She had learned to flee...

1058
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,180
to hide...

1059
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,480
to stand still...

1060
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,740
and seal herself in waters.

1061
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,280
By humility...

1062
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,040
she had survived her enemy...

1063
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,800
who had slain her own husband...

1064
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,240
and now she carried the children of the latter inside her...

1065
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,180
the last of the victorious race.

1066
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,380
They would be born in a few years.

1067
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,260
Those things had a long gestation period.

1068
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:29,460
Meanwhile...

1069
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,780
Homo sapiens had come.

1070
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,680
He also had suffered...

1071
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,180
from the terror of the kangaroo.

1072
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,660
In order to protect himself...

1073
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:40,300
from its rapine and ravishment...

1074
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,440
he had developed a cell...

1075
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,020
called the H. sapiens armatus.

1076
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,860
A class which was concealed...

1077
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,840
in metal scales and carried a lance...

1078
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,840
by means of which it defended itself...

1079
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,900
against the dinosauria.

1080
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,780
This subclass of so-called knights...

1081
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,460
had perfected an order called...

1082
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:58,180
H. sapiens armatus georgios sanctus...

1083
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,260
which was sufficiently...

1084
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,620
unobservant to classify all the dinosaurs...

1085
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,660
together as its enemies.

1086
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,280
Atlantosaurus thrust out her neck...

1087
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,880
and thought with triumph of her unborn children.

1088
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,840
She had never killed in her life...

1089
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,440
and these the future would perpetuate...

1090
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,480
a vegetarian race.

1091
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:15,660
She heard the clank of Homo sapiens armatus...

1092
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,560
georgios sanctus and turned...

1093
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,320
the comely reptile head...

1094
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,900
towards him in her kindly curiosity.

1095
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,360
He killed her of course.

1096
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,400
She was a reptile...

1097
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,160
of the reptilian race.

1098
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:45,780
She was a reptile of the reptilian race.

1099
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,480
She was a reptile of the reptilian race.

1100
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,840
Yes, millions of years ago...

1101
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,220
Yes, millions of years ago...

1102
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,080
these gigantic beasts actually...

1103
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:51,960
roamed the earth.

1104
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,800
Gigantosaurus had a pocket calculator...

1105
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,880
in his hips...

1106
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,700
which enabled him to do small sums.

1107
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,380
This is the H. bomb going off.

1108
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,140
Around and around the giant reptiles...

1109
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,100
ran...

1110
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,160
around and around the rugged rocks...

1111
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,160
in the struggle for survival...

1112
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,620
which lasted for millions of years.

1113
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,800
Somehow the electromagnetic field...

1114
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,140
of the earth itself changed.

1115
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,100
Ice ages came...

1116
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,080
and continents formed new patterns.

1117
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:37,660
and continents formed new patterns.

1118
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:39,020
Why I can see it now...

1119
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:40,560
is that the right thing to do?

1120
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,560
Don't be trampled by these behemoths.

1121
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:44,940
Don't be trampled by these behemoths.

1122
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,460
Don't be trampled by these behemoths.

1123
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,020
You see the Ceratosaurus is attempting...

1124
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,460
to turn Atlantisaurus...

1125
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,440
over and expose...

1126
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,140
its soft underbelly.

1127
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:54,240


1128
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:54,240


1129
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,360
...

1130
00:55:59,080 --> 00:55:59,800
...

1131
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:00,000
...

1132
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:00,080
...

1133
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:00,100
...

1134
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,760
...

1135
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:01,760


1136
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:23,220
creations with virtual NFTs.

1137
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:26,200
Now where area we have intercepted is...

1138
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:26,200


1139
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:26,200


1140
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:26,200


1141
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:26,480
Don't be fooled.

1142
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:26,480


1143
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:26,480


1144
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:26,480


1145
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,220
Time happened...

1146
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:28,260
...

1147
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,400
Just imagine yourself chewing a huge slug.

1148
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:41,200
Oh, yes, dear friends, you are comfortable.

1149
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:42,960
I know you are.

1150
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:47,340
We're both very comfortable together, aren't we?

1151
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:52,640
Yes, and you've been listening to a presentation

1152
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,380
of the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1153
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:59,380
In this case, Dr. Howell Robbins

1154
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:03,580
on the KPFA Berkeley Subgenius Show

1155
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:07,640
with a classic, classic creation story

1156
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:12,020
and scientific exploration, I believe.

1157
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,360
That's what it was, something like that.

1158
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,180
Now I think it's time to tell you

1159
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:21,180
where to write for more information

1160
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,580
on the Church of the Subgenius.

1161
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,160
It's various.

1162
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,080
Branch-offs and spin-offs

1163
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:31,980
and genealogical evolutionary mutations.

1164
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,020
Yes, please do.

1165
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:38,300
Just send a self-addressed stamped envelope

1166
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:42,800
for more information on the books,

1167
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,720
the comic books, and so forth.

1168
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,860
It's free, friends.

1169
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,580
Well, the information is,

1170
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:54,500
if you would just write to,

1171
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:58,740
Bob, that's right, just write to good old Bob,

1172
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,140
that mighty Bob,

1173
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:06,520
at Post Office Box 140306.

1174
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:12,100
That's 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

1175
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,520
75214.

1176
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:20,820
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1177
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:25,260
And, gosh, I have no idea what comes up next.

1178
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,780
We'll just grab this next tape

1179
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,120
from Peckerwood's On Parade,

1180
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,560
a compilation given to me by Dr. Howell,

1181
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:37,500
who you've been hearing for the last 45 minutes,

1182
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,860
and we'll see what happens.

1183
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,320
To Betty Lou

1184
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,920
And twice to Carol Sue

1185
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:53,060
Those doggone women really drove me mad

1186
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,360
I gotta loosen me up

1187
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,320
I'm a station boo

1188
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:01,460
I started using LSD

1189
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,520
It gave me quite a kick

1190
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,660
Better than booze and easy to use

1191
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,420
But it made me mentally sick

1192
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,920
I'm on my way to awful prison

1193
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,800
Got the monkey off the back

1194
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,960
I'm on my way to awful prison

1195
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,780
And I won't be coming back

1196
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:24,360
I took some knives and I killed my wife

1197
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,360
I took off my jacket and I took off my jacket

1198
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:26,120
And then I

1199
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:27,860
LSD

1200
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:31,260
I didn't know what I'd done

1201
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,140
I'm still in court

1202
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,520
My case was overturned

1203
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,300
The sentence I got was lying

1204
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,820
I'm on my way to awful prison

1205
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,700
Got the monkey off my back

1206
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,880
I'm on my way to awful prison

1207
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,720
And I won't be coming back

1208
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,660
J inventor

1209
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,540
Also covered by

1210
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:52,620
Nick Gino

1211
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:55,360
Nicky Tiere

1212
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:55,360


1213
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,660
Thank you.

1214
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:25,740
Coming back.

1215
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,260
Ah, yes, dear friends.

1216
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,400
LSV made a wreck of me by T-Bubba Scruggs.

1217
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,860
Can I get a beer?

1218
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:47,600
Just imagine yourself chewing a huge wad of gum that lasts forever.

1219
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:50,920
And you can imagine what it would be like to be an enormous sauropod.

1220
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,720
Gourmandizing on the fronds of the prehistoric forest.

1221
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,460
You know, most Americans aren't taught in school, as a part of their education,

1222
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:11,760
that before the age of giant reptiles, there was an age of giant insects.

1223
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:16,600
When hideous, scuttling things roamed the earth.

1224
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,720
They roamed the earth.

1225
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:20,900
Well, they roamed the earth.

1226
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,320
Some of them roamed, others stayed in their own backyard.

1227
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,860
But they were unbelievably horrible.

1228
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:33,800
And if, like me, you have a slight, uh, uh, willies feeling,

1229
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,980
I mean, if they kind of give you the willies,

1230
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:39,840
if they kind of make you twitch and wince and whimper,

1231
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:43,360
just to think of giant spiders as big as bushel baskets,

1232
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,100
or bigger, rustling under the leaves and so forth,

1233
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:47,920
well, uh...

1234
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:49,500
As big as theaters.

1235
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:50,880
Well, I don't...

1236
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,040
I don't know if they ever got that big.

1237
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,120
That information has not come to me.

1238
01:01:58,140 --> 01:01:59,500
Although, according to some...

1239
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:01,320
It's coming in now, though. You might want to check the...

1240
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:05,280
According to some ancient legends, there were once creatures the size of islands

1241
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,820
who fought millennial battles in remote corners of the earth's surface,

1242
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:15,080
and, uh, actually scarred and, uh, and disfigured our planet

1243
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,140
into some of the familiar configurations we see today.

1244
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,580
A piece of galactic debris,

1245
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:23,640
in the shape of an enormous six-legged lizard,

1246
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:28,440
uh, once landed on the earth and quickly crawled across its surface,

1247
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,860
like a centipede landing on a peach,

1248
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:35,760
but, uh, it created enormous destruction and the extinction of many species.

1249
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,440
Created, uh, tidal waves and, uh,

1250
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:45,460
giant sweeping walls of earth and rock which buried entire countries, and...

1251
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:45,520
I love this.

1252
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:45,520


1253
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:45,520


1254
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:45,520


1255
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:45,520
