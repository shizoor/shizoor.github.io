1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,520
Shootin' high, I'll never stop till I get to the top. Tell me why, shouldn't I?

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:22,460
You know it's you I'm after, you're my lucky star. I'm on a rainbow rafter.

3
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:30,740
Well, it seems that this new plan has really succeeded in driving the callers completely away from our radio program.

4
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,700
Your slack powers and how to develop them.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,660
Everyone has slack abilities, but few people actually develop them.

6
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,360
These talents must be trained like any other skill.

7
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,540
Here are training methods, physical and mental exercises to prepare you to open your slack centers

8
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,380
and gain powers you probably never thought you could possess.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,440
The exercises are simple and require no special requirements.

10
00:00:52,460 --> 00:01:00,860
Just send $1 to Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

11
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:14,080
Ah, yes, dear friends, and welcome to the subgenius hour of slack.

12
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,240
Here are some sample subgeniuses now.

13
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:28,500
They are locked in their special cult hand sign throwing and shaking situation.

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,460
Primitive with deep set eye sockets under glowering brows,

15
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,900
they walk upon their knuckles hunched forward uttering plaintive cries.

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,200
Calling to each other, Bubba Gee, ma'am, Bubba Gee.

17
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,680
Now, they'll do this for another 20 minutes or so and then they'll settle down.

18
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,560
Contemporary troglodytes, living fossils.

19
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:51,880
The subgenius.

20
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,560
They are most interesting from an anthropological point of view.

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,420
Now, if you're watching, Cadillacs, you can see our view of the subgenius museum in Dallas.

22
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,560
These are the last actual subgeniuses.

23
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,340
Most of them imported from Arkansas.

24
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,560
This is subgenius man.

25
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,920
His home was a cave in the mountains.

26
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,720
The mountains of Dallas, Texas.

27
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,580
Bubba Gee, ma'am.

28
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,140
Bubba Gee, ma'am.

29
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,560
Their laws are simple.

30
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,420
The strong take everything.

31
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,920
This is Akoba, leader of the rock and roll track.

32
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:42,620
And his two sons, Sakana and Tumek.

33
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,240
Or Tumescent, Tumid as they call him.

34
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,020
There is no love lost between them.

35
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,580
And that is our story.

36
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:56,820
Yeah.

37
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,980
So, you...

38
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,560
Man, you should have your head examined.

39
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,600
Yeah.

40
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,040
God, what were you thinking?

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,120
Christ, oh God almighty.

42
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:06,580
Whatever.

43
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,500
Ian, you're...

44
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,220
I can't even begin.

45
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,180
I'm...

46
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,560
Don't wonder what kind of sheer ignorance and stupidity...

47
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,880
would like a man like myself to hear.

48
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,860
Well, God.

49
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,320
Praise Bob.

50
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,240
Praise Bob.

51
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,380
You're one of the flock.

52
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,920
For only the truly stupid shall be saved.

53
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,260
God's judgment day.

54
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,060
It's true, brethren.

55
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,100
It's true.

56
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,180
How dumb are you?

57
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:42,440
And for all of you low forehead, toothless, throwback, redneck, honky people sitting out there who are going,

58
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,400
I kind of like that negro music that they keep playing.

59
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,340
And all the dumb shit with watering your beard so you don't undone it from לח찐 comeryidec island.

60
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:00,800
In fact this isn't a new world.

61
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:00,880
It seems like it was a newдиtian music.

62
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:00,880


63
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:00,880


64
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,080
Hey cats!

65
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,500
Listen to me.

66
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:10,120
There's a place down in Texas where the hip people meet.

67
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,100
They got lots o slack.

68
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,640
Come along, you will see

69
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:21,420
It's the place called the Church of the Subgenie

70
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,540
Yeah

71
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,240
That's right, ladies

72
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,040
You wanna live forever

73
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,560
You gotta sleep with Bob

74
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,480
But hey, after all

75
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,040
Isn't there a little Bob in all of us?

76
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,220
The place called the Church of the Subgenie

77
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,860
Bob

78
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,980
You've got a friend in Bob

79
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,160
You've got a friend in Bob

80
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,340
Just follow the pike

81
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,760
He'll take you there

82
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,900
To Planet X

83
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,120
Drifting out somewhere

84
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,500
Jump on the one plane

85
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,100
And you'll find me

86
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,260
You'll leave the conspiracy noobs

87
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,680
Far behind

88
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,120
And if you think this is all just a scam

89
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,000
You'll be wishing you believed

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,400
When the shit hits the fan

91
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,140
As we kill you pigs

92
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,160
So go away, you fool, away

93
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,880
You've got a friend in Bob

94
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,380
You've got a friend in Bob

95
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,020
When the X-ists come out of the sky

96
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,320
And all the mediocre evidence start to die

97
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,080
All you'll find is a friend in Bob

98
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,680
You'll be pleased with your pathetic jobs

99
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,100
You'll wish they'd listened to the word of dogs

100
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,300
And if you never send in your thirty bucks

101
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,720
It's gonna look like you'll get royally fucked

102
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:08,240
With a mountain lion in a mug

103
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,060
You've got a friend in Bob

104
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,520
You've got a friend in Bob

105
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,360
Bob's revolutions are the time of the peak

106
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,700
Reveals the subgenius destiny

107
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,540
Cast out false prophets, extra meditates

108
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,420
So send thirty bucks

109
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,140
Before it's too late

110
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,960
For you've got a friend in Bob

111
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,020
You've got a friend in Bob

112
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,980
July 5th, 1998

113
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,040
Seven a.m. I can hardly wait

114
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,260
The sex gods said

115
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,080
Yes, we'll take thee away

116
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,460
I'll party down with Jesus and J.F. May

117
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,140
Sex hurt for the home of a babble

118
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,260
Bob's rock to the gills

119
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,340
The party rages on

120
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,140
For love of eternity

121
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,240
You've got a friend in Bob

122
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,200
You've got a friend in Bob

123
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,500
You've got a friend in Bob

124
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,900
You've got a friend in Bob

125
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:57,920
You've got a friend in Bob

126
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,560
Good Lord, friends!

127
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,400
Good Lord, man!

128
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,580
I just heard that song for the first time with you.

129
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,500
I guess I'll have to cut some,

130
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,140
a couple of cuss words spots out of that.

131
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,360
And, uh, yes, dear friends,

132
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,600
that was the incredible Reverend Moe Joe Walker.

133
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,740
Uh, eh, eh, eh, eh, from, uh, Connecticut.

134
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,220
Yes, Ellington, Connecticut.

135
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,780
I guess he walked up to me and handed me a tape

136
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,880
at the Boston Divival.

137
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah, something like that.

138
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,380
Reverend Moe Joe Walker, a friend in Bob,

139
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,920
a great new X Day song.

140
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,720
Uh, we also heard, uh, just before that, uh,

141
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,660
the Church of the Subgenius song by Die Music of Warren, Texas,

142
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,520
Church of Elvis, I believe they, uh, also,

143
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,200
and, uh, and, uh, Dr. Legume and, uh, Dr. Strange

144
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,720
and KPFA Primitive Subgenius Show with Dr. Howell

145
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,980
and Puzzling Evidence and Little Friday Jones.

146
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,040
And, friends, it's true!

147
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,140
It's only 65 days left to X Day.

148
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,940
And things are heatin' up around here, anyway,

149
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,080
and not where, nowhere near as hot

150
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,700
as it'll be for the little Moe Joe Walker.

151
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,380
And pinky winkies come Judgment Day.

152
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,560
But we're waitin' up to our knees in the blood

153
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,780
of the baptism of the mighty fist-face of Bob!

154
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,180
And, uh, uh, and here's a f-

155
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,260
It's flash after flash.

156
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,920
Uh, friends here from the X Day Files,

157
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,380
shall we call them, uh, three days ago,

158
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,380
the church business manager, Jesus,

159
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,160
managed to get one of our many press releases

160
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,420
about X Day onto a weird news site.

161
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,160
And it's a service called News Flash,

162
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,360
which goes to everybody from a morning drive-time radio jock

163
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,940
in Hobunk, Texas, to David, uh, Letterman,

164
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,300
that chicken butt.

165
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,800
Twelve hours later, uh, I, I was on the phone

166
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,200
to, to drive-time jocks in South Africa,

167
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,400
and the Lord was schmoozin' a talk show in New Zealand,

168
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,180
and yesterday I did five morning radio shows

169
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,740
in a bunch of different cities,

170
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,200
and we got two this morning,

171
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,080
and we got four or five more next week,

172
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,080
and it's mostly a bunch of ha-ha, cutesy-smeutesy,

173
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,080
short, smarmy, five-minute stupid culture blips,

174
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,160
but we managed to get some contact information

175
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,300
about the church, you know, a P.O. box,

176
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,860
and some delayed-reaction anti-God time-bomb one-liners in,

177
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,940
you know, about the invisible monsters and like that,

178
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,360
and then maybe it might help the potential last-minute

179
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,940
savees, uh, to recognize Bob's word the next time

180
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,000
they encounter him, dear friends.

181
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,580
Um, and so praise the Lord for this disgusting P.R. blitz,

182
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,240
uh, in the last days here.

183
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,000
I just wish, uh, we didn't have to go to bed so early.

184
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,020
It kind of cramps the indolent lifestyles

185
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,880
of the Lord Jesus and myself.

186
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,060
And, uh, and praise Jesus, the 32-page new

187
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,880
Stark Fist magazine has been printed,

188
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,100
and beautifully, and you won't believe

189
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,880
that this is a Stark Fist, and has been, ironically,

190
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,160
it's mailed out to everybody who renewed,

191
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,760
or at least confirmed,

192
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,600
their existence to us.

193
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,960
And, uh, a lot of people didn't even bother to do that,

194
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,320
so, uh, but man does it look good.

195
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,620
And praise Steve Jackson Games, friends!

196
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,720
The new NWO subgenius role-playing card game

197
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,320
is finished and should be in stores...

198
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,740
now.

199
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,100
And, uh, this, uh, game set, friends,

200
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,660
includes 100 color reprints of the most psychedelic

201
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,740
subgenius art ever imagined, even in Connie's wildest orgasm,

202
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,760
and can be, uh, uh, played either as a standalone

203
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,720
or as part of the Illuminati New World Order game, you see.

204
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,720
You know, the New World Order's just a game,

205
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,040
and the Church of Subgenius is just a game.

206
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,760
Wherever role-playing games are sold,

207
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,760
you know, try the comic book store, actually, friends.

208
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,060
And we've been preaching our leathery old lungs out

209
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,280
on the final Armageddon tour,

210
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,740
coast to coast,

211
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,400
before it's toast, friends.

212
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,420
And after the triumphant Portland and Seattle devivals,

213
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,140
I went to Cleveland for this,

214
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,760
that sublime Einstein secret orchestra secret rituals

215
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,940
where we, as heard last week,

216
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,320
um, where we had, friends,

217
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,540
we had the biggest turnout ever in Ohio,

218
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,740
and, uh, while I was, uh, overmanning the sales table

219
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,420
in Cleveland, this youth came up to me and he said,

220
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,760
my friend has a palindrome.

221
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,260
A palindrome with Bob in it.

222
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,840
Would you like to hear it?

223
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,260
I said, yeah, and the palindrome was

224
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,700
Boston Bob, not sob.

225
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,000
Boston Bob, not sob.

226
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,900
It spells the same, forward, backward,

227
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,860
sort of like Bob's name.

228
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,660
And I asked him if they knew that we were preaching in Boston next,

229
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,760
and the kid denied any knowledge of it,

230
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,320
for the message had come to his friend in a dream, friends,

231
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,940
and the prophecy rings true,

232
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:10,880
because the final, last, ultimate, penultimate subgenius devival

233
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:19,160
in Boston, produced by the irreverent and buxotic Friday Jones,

234
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:25,260
which, because of which I'll always remember it as the double D devival,

235
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:30,960
friends, the last devival was inarguably the best,

236
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,280
and, and, and by far the most profitable.

237
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,840
Same thing.

238
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,220
Even though it was pouring sheets of rain from the bowels of

239
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,180
Negi himself that night, friends,

240
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,100
the flock came from as far away as Chicago and Quebec

241
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,080
and packed the place to the rafters

242
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,740
to make Friday Jones a fortune.

243
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:55,200
Um, the first time I've ever seen a subgenius producer make a fortune.

244
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,820
All the preachers got paid, all the musicians got paid,

245
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,540
Friday Jones broke all subgenius merchandise sales table records,

246
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,440
including DragonCon, I'm not kidding.

247
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,920
The only reason the Super Bowl

248
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,440
that a super genius like Friday Jones is even allowed in this church

249
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,220
is because she's still technically not a genius,

250
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,200
but this is what a true subgenius devival is all about.

251
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,260
Real money and real slack, my friends.

252
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,060
The audience was totally jazzed,

253
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,040
and the slack was so thick you could cut it with a chainsaw.

254
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,780
And we had a new pulpit, a pulpit too heavy for any airline to ship.

255
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,760
Huge, carved wooden wings of slack on the front,

256
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,520
and, and, uh, hieroglyphs carved into the front,

257
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,900
and an auto-suck and an auto-john built right in for the preacher,

258
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,260
built for us by the evil Reverend Ed Strange.

259
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,780
And we had banners, cheap but effectively crafted,

260
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,040
Friday Jones banners using the Bobco symbol font,

261
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,780
hieroglyphs printed out big with iron-on-transfer material,

262
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,360
ironed onto a strip of cloth,

263
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,140
and huge new slogan buttons and products,

264
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,280
and, and, friends, uh,

265
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,840
I got to preach with Brother Cleve and DK Jones

266
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,840
and Bill T. Miller as backup gospel organists,

267
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,800
and the, the prophesied bucket of pills was there.

268
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,920
There was a pump, a dispensation of the pills.

269
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,020
There was a dispensation of the pumpkin,

270
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,420
which was righteously groped and orgy-ized on the dance floor by the audience.

271
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,180
The King of Slack, Bill T. Miller, did his greatest hits from Orgy of Slack.

272
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,260
Pope! David!

273
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,360
Friends, tonight's show will feature the incredible,

274
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,720
uh, uh, ranting of,

275
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,500
Pope David N. Meyer,

276
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,680
his return to the subgenius stage,

277
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,940
his mighty confession,

278
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,760
I am the conspiracy.

279
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,640
Friends, Slackbangers performed.

280
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,560
Dr. Legume told the true story of killing a cat that refused to die.

281
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,360
Brother Cleve Duncan got up and peed the spirit of Bob, my friends.

282
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,680
He peed the spirit of Bob.

283
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,600
We did the last of the mass short-duration marriages.

284
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,280
The whole club, 200 people, all married to one another.

285
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,120
We launched the Bleeding Head of Arnold Palmer for the last time.

286
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,520
Pope Meyer got so excited he had to come out and rant again to be heard later.

287
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,240
The Earth Anthem! There was a rant-a-thon, dear friends!

288
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,000
How... how many bands do you know

289
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,120
that will let anyone from the audience come up and use their equipment after the show?

290
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:21,080
Complete with on-stage fighting between Reverend Stang and me over his girlfriend,

291
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,780
and praise Bob Boston.

292
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,420
Bob... not sob.

293
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,660
It was... and we even had kooks.

294
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,260
There was a crazy man there that said,

295
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,940
came up to Friday Jones and he goes,

296
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,840
I... I am Bob, book of the sub...

297
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,060
I need to know who really wrote Book of the Subgenius.

298
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,780
Stang ignores my letters, and I need to know who really wrote that,

299
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,640
because I... it's based on my life.

300
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,960
I am Bob Dobbs.

301
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,500
It's based on me.

302
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,780
There are 2,000 correspondences with my life in that book.

303
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,760
I used to be a famous Hollywood producer,

304
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,040
but then the conspiracy, the government, have followed me,

305
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,840
and they follow me with black helicopters, and...

306
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,720
Friday Jones said, oh, this is too important to take to Stang.

307
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,040
Write it... write it all out in detail.

308
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,820
And address it to Jesus.

309
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,540
Send it to the P.O. Box, but don't address it to Stang.

310
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,100
Address it to Jesus.

311
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
Praise Friday Jones.

312
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,080
The minute she got home from the devival,

313
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,680
I swear to God this is true French,

314
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,600
she stripped off her clothes and rolled in the money.

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,220
Literally rolled in the... actually, I did too.

316
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,420
And you can see the pictorial, Miss Subgenius July,

317
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,080
in the upcoming special publication,

318
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,820
Sex, Goddesses of the Church of the Subgenius,

319
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,100
also available this week only on the Newsgroup Alt Binary Slot.

320
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,100


321
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,140
And friends, what's coming up after this?

322
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,980
X-Day is coming up!

323
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,020
By gobs and golly-goshin',

324
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,480
and we at the Dallas Church Headquarters

325
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,060
plan to concentrate everything towards X-Day.

326
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,440
This is the final countdown,

327
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,880
the last push

328
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,400
before the great evacuation,

329
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,660
when Bob's load shall fall,

330
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,980
splashing upon our slack-rejecting,

331
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,260
unrepentant, Bob-less world.

332
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,160
And friends, we're gonna try to release some CDs,

333
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,900
and a CD-ROM of all the great new Subgenius art,

334
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,360
in fact, a completely revised sub-site

335
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,640
at www.subgenius.com.

336
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,840
New T-shirts, designs, and gimmicks, products,

337
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,440
my friends, everything must go by July 5th!

338
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,760
Everything must go!

339
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,200
And, uh, hell, we might even buy advertising

340
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,300
for the first time in 20 years.

341
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,680
That's a sign of the end times, friends.

342
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,680
When the Church of the Subgenius buys advertising.

343
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,840
Well, what...

344
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,800
Oh, you are probably wondering,

345
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,060
what is this great music that I've got in the background?

346
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,300
And it's, um...

347
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,500
What the hell is the name of that sick band?

348
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,400
Ed Strange handed me this CD.

349
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,920
It's a local Philadelphia band called

350
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,360
Stinking Lizaveta.

351
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,500
Stinking Lizaveta.

352
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,220
It's an album called Slaughterhouse.

353
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,620
It's all instrumental guitar tracks.

354
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,140
Ed heard them live and thought,

355
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,820
they...

356
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,060
They might likely like that.

357
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,300
And they all look like Charlie Manson.

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,220
Well, friends,

364
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,920
oh, there's so much,

365
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,800
so, so, so much to share,

366
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,840
and I don't even know where to start.

367
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,340
I...

368
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,580
I guess side two mayhaps be

369
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,160
the great rant of Pope David Meyer,

370
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,560
his return to the subgenius preaching stage.

371
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:58,880
Yeah.

372
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,820
Well, let's just go straight...

373
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,080
Let's just...

374
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,560
Let's go straight into that authentic subgenius

375

376
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,080

I'm talking about if you've seen any of the old videos, then you have been touched, you have been hit, you have been healed, you have been felt, you have been induced by the great, great, Dr. Dr. Mr. M.D.

404
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:18,300
Pope David Edmire, the Pope of all New York, Pope of all Great Pacific Northwest, Pope David Edmire, praise the Pope!

405
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:37,140
Hey kids, how you doing? Why don't you give yourselves a hand, you're such a lovely audience today.

406
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,700
Can we have a hand for the almighty Reverend Cleveland Douglas Duncan, please?

407
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,840
Can we have a hand for the Reverend Cleveland Douglas Duncan, please?

408
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,560
Can we have a hand for the mighty T.K., please?

409
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,240
Can we have a hand for the mighty Dr. M.D.

410
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,240


411
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:04,320
Can we have a hand for the mighty Dr. M.D.

412
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:24,680
Can we have a hand for the mayor of euchity, children?

413
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,280
Let me tell you what happened, children.

414
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,420
We were over there in, where were we, Cleveland?

415
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,420
It was called Spit back in those days.

416
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,660
Club Spit, children. We were in Club Spit.

417
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:41,120
Myself, the Reverend Ivan Stain, the mighty Cleveland Douglas Duncan, we were preaching the word of God.

418
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,220
And you know what happened that night, children? I'm going to tell you what happened.

419
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:49,720
The mayor's citizens of this town tried to murder the Pope of all New York.

420
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,240
The mayor's citizens of this town, children.

421
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,980
tried to maim the Reverend Ivan Stein.

422
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,620
The fair citizens of this town, children, could not harm

423
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,360
the great Reverend Cleveland Duncan Stoneman. Do you know why?

424
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,640
Do you know why, children? Do you know why?

425
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:13,660
Do you know why? Do you want to know why?

426
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,000
Because the Reverend Cleveland Duncan Stoneman was upstairs

427
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,700
counting the money.

428
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,740
Children, there were football players

429
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,300
in BC that had necks bigger than my thighs.

430
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,100
My thighs are only medium sized, children, but that makes a big ass neck.

431
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,960
And children, they began to hurl foodstuffs at the Reverend Ivan Stein.

432
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,640
They hurled pizza at him. There are photographs and documents that day of the church

433
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,540
where the Pope of all New York, who is basically a pacifist, on stage

434
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,240
with a mic stand, daring this fucker to come on stage and get killed.

435
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,680
And if you know what the Pope of New York

436
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,420
said, the significance of that event was...

437
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,100
Let me ask you this, children. Was it significant that we kept preaching in the face of danger? Say no.

438
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,560
No! Was it significant that we had the courage of our convictions? Say no.

439
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,660
No! You know, when I go to, when I recount this event, when I tell people

440
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,800
what occurred, they say to me, Dave. Dave!

441
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,200
They say to me, Dave. Dave! They say to me, Rev. Dave. Rev. Dave!

442
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,360
They say to me, Pope of all New York City, Dave. Pope of all New York City, Dave!

443
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,000
What did that event signify? What did that event signify?

444
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:24,640
It signified, children, about the last time you could get killed over culture.

445
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,260
Now, children, the way it works is this.

446
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:34,260
You may think that the anti-conspiracy culture resides in the culture you purchase.

447
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,800
But doesn't, children, I say no, children, I posit no, my view is no.

448
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:46,700
I believe, children, that the desperation, the need, the maniacal desire to be groovy,

449
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:52,560
has merged the conspiracy and the anti-conspiracy so completely

450
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:58,240
that when you purchase your culture, you can no longer tell where one ends and the other begins.

451
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,400
Now, children, those of you who have seen me preach before,

452
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:06,500
you might recall a few salient aspects of my earlier preachings.

453
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,120
There's number one, I usually tell the rules of the church.

454
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,220
Number two, I usually wear shades.

455
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:22,260
Number three, the Reverend Cleveless Donald Duncan usually plays gospel music behind me.

456
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,700
But, children, my view is that if you don't know the rules of the church by now,

457
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,440
given that the end times are coming in 73 days,

458
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,700
don't mess with it.

459
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,400
Second of all, children, I'm not so sure the rules are relevant anymore, and I'll tell you why.

460
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,600
Because 18 years ago, when this wonderful church, the church of love and money, the world's best industrial church,

461
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,460
the only church to guarantee you eternal salvation or

462
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,900
your money back.

463
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,000
Well, back then, children, back then, in 1981,

464
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,700
we were funny. But today, children, in 1998,

465
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,780
we're just right.

466
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,680
You know who people say, children,

467
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,200
people say, you don't have a monopoly on the truth.

468
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,480
We do, children.

469
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,720
We do have a monopoly on the truth.

470
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,980
And the truth is, children, that as you try to make your way through this world, as you try to parse out,

471
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,520
does this guy look like a bodyguard? Can you be more sinister, please?

472
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,480
Come over here. Step up here. Somewhere out here is a force of

473
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,960
anti-bond that wants to harm the Pope. Get it together.

474
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,580
Now, where was I? As you try to make your way through this culture,

475
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,400
children, as you try to find yourself by your purchases, what you will find

476
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,140
is a self-fulfilling tautology, and that is this, children.

477
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,960
You can't find an authentic experience

478
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,980
because you're purchasing, children. You're purchasing. You know, Reverend Slack

479
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:58,040
was loathe to define Slack. I am not loathe to define Slack, children.

480
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,460
I am willing to tell what Slack is, children. People say to me, day.

481
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,580
They say to me, Rev Day. They say to me, Pub of All New York City Day.

482
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,300
What is Slack?

483
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,620
Slack is all that.

484
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,740
Well, I'll tell you just what the fuck I'm talking about, children. Slack is a

485
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,880
relative phenomenon, children. Slack varies from place to place and time to time and person to person.

486
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,060
I'll give you an example. In my house, Slack is two new CDs and a

487
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,540
brief respite from existential dread.

488
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,880
In downtown Kilgolly, children, Slack is a handful of millet.

489
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,640
And the rest of us are somewhere in between. But what I want to say here, children,

490
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,460
is there's some things that haven't been touched on that I think need to be touched on, children.

491
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,020
And that's this, children. As you pursue that authentic experience, children,

492
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,300
as you go around purchasing your culture, children, purchasing your identity until it doesn't work anymore,

493
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,920
you've got to define yourself. We get back to the most basic of Bob's preaching, children.

494
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:56,200
And that's what I'm here to tell you tonight. To get off Bob's dick.

495
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,680
And to get off Bob's tit.

496
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,600
Because what is Bob, children? What is Bob?

497
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,400
Bob is a short-term

498
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,020
duration personal

499
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:07,960
savior.

500
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,760
That's short-term, children.

501
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,060
That's a hobbyist's savior.

502
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,580
Keep going. You ought to go. That's a hobbyist's

503
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,200
savior. So you might say to me

504
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,400
in all reasonable terms,

505
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,460
Dave. You might say to me,

506
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,100
Dave. You might say to me,

507
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,260
Rev. Dave. You might say to me,

508
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,440
oh, New York City, you almost got killed

509
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,560
in Boston. Dave.

510
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:35,120
What are you still doing in the church then?

511
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,060
Well, the answer is simple, children.

512
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,100
The Pope of all New York is the world's first slackless pope.

513
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,100
There's a hard core rule in the church, children. That is,

514
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,060
the harder you preach for Bob, the less slack you've got. The more you reach for Bob,

515
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:56,180
Bob only receives, children. He only receives. Think of Achilles and the turtle, children.

516
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,180
Is the Pope of New York ever going to catch Bob? Say no.

517
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,620
Say no. Say hell no.

518
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,980
Say hell no. I'm here, children, to serve you.

519
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,520
And you. And you.

520
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,480
I'm here, children, to bring you the

521
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,560
true word of Bob. To tell you

522
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,700
how Bob really, really

523
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,600
operates.

524
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,720
Now let's talk about a little

525
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,380
word of Bob. To tell you how

526
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,320
Bob really, really

527
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,260
operates.

528
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,600
Now let's talk about a little something,

529
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,420
children. An 18-year-old concept

530
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,600
that's still valid called

531
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,960
techno-boredom.

532
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,520
Now techno-boredom, children,

533
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,760
is the way the conspiracy operates.

534
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,340
But the funny thing is about techno-boredom is this.

535
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,680
Techno-boredom is the conspiracy's main tool

536
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,420
to make you buy again. It makes you

537
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,440
bored with your new toy, so you've got to buy another

538
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,380
new toy. But you know what we've learned, sadly,

539
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,360
over 18 years?

540
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,460
Just identifying techno-boredom

541
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,280
doesn't allow you to escape it.

542
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,140
Now, children, you know

543
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,580
the great Huey Newton, the great Huey Newton,

544
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,380
the founder of the Black Panther's people party,

545
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,700
he said, and I quote,

546
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,900
the man's technology

547
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,220
is no match for the people's will.

548
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,180
That sounds good, children.

549
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,440
It sounds good, but I'll tell you what,

550
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,700
he had it exactly backwards.

551
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,120
Because, children, our home is filled

552
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,060
with toys, it's filled with

553
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,960
diversion, it's filled with ways

554
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,700
to escape, and what are we trying

555
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,660
to escape, children? What are we trying

556
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,720
to escape? With our televisions

557
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,280
and our CDs and our

558
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,180
sampling keyboards and our Internet?

559
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,440
I'll tell you what we're trying to escape.

560
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,500
We're trying to escape the pain within.

561
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,820
And where does that pain within

562
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,480
come from? Does it come from your

563
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,960
fundamentally worthless

564
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,400
humanity?

565
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,800
I think not, children.

566
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,500
It comes from the marketing forces

567
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,180
around you that make you hate yourself.

568
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
So you'll go buy something so you'll hate yourself

569
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,180
a little less.

570
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,660
But in fact, children, you don't have

571
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,500
to buy all the conspiracy products.

572
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,580
It's kind of a word line

573
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,360
mistake you've got to do.

574
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,560
You don't have to buy the conspiracy products. No, you

575
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,840
don't. You just go out over here and buy, children.

576
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,900
You just buy out over there. People come up to me

577
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,020
all the time on the street, on the street

578
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,680
when I'm without my bodyguard who's doing such

579
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,760
a good job of protecting me, and they say to me,

580
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,480
Day! They say to me, we're dead!

581
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,300
They say to me, Paul, all

582
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,260
New York City dead!

583
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,040
Where do I go? How do I think?

584
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,800
What do I buy? What do I wear?

585
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,560
Where do I turn? And you know what I say

586
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,160
to them, children?

587
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,880
I say, it's in the book.

588
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,380
It's all in the book, children.

589
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,120
It's all right here.

590
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,460
If you read this book carefully,

591
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,660
you'll know all you need to know.

592
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,920
If you extra meditate longly,

593
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,500
deeply, fully, and with

594
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,820
concentration, you will find the answers

595
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,620
that you seek.

596
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,580
Now let me just turn my milk canes over here,

597
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:45,880
children.

598
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,740
The thing is, that this insidious culture

599
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,440
that surrounds you turns you into

600
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,400
efficient water. You can't tell

601
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,900
when it's in you and when it's not in you.

602
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Understand me, children?

603
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,500
Here's the point I'm trying to make.

604
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,040
Here's the thing I came here to tell you tonight, children.

605
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,720
The thing that I brought myself down here tonight.

606
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,020
Doug likes to say that he has nothing in common

607
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,160
with the conspiracy, and that might well be true, children.

608
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,300
But in my case,

609
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,260
I am the conspiracy, children.

610
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,720
People say to me, we're dead!

611
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,560
People say to me, we're dead!

612
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,560
They say to me, Paul, all New York City dead!

613
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,460
How could you possibly be the conspiracy, children?

614
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:27,460


615
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:27,460


616
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:27,460


617
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:27,460


618
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,640
And you know what I say to them children?

619
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,160
Say no!

620
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,440
You know what I tell them when they ask me that, children?

621
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,760
Say no! I'll tell you what I tell them, children.

622
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,900
I tell them that I make my living

623
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,360
creating the conspiracy.

624
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,960
And I'm damn good at it, children.

625
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,300
That's right, children. I write advertising.

626
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,720
I edit commercials.

627
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,940
I write and produce promos.

628
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,640
And when you open your magazine,

629
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,980
and you go home and watch television,

630
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,600
and you see an ad, and you go,

631
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,140
wow, that ad is like

632
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,460
so groovy and hip and kind of a

633
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,080
commentary on that other ad that

634
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,160
ran two years ago. Wow, that's really like a

635
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,500
meta-ad. It's not really an ad at all.

636
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,340
It's more like a pastiche

637
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,560
of a deconstruction of all these other ads.

638
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,460
It's positively fucking Lacanian.

639
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,880
I got news for you, children.

640
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,020
You know what that news is? Say no.

641
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,680
The news is,

642
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,320
I wrote that in service of the conspiracy.

643
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,480
Where do you think that hip shit

644
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,360
comes from, children? It comes from

645
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,660
sellouts like me!

646
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,040
And you know what that does to me, children,

647
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,680
when I think about my personal short term duration?

648
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,660
It fills me with shame, children.

649
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,680
Keep going, boy, you want it.

650
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,820
It fills me with irritation.

651
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,140
It fills me with self-loathing.

652
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,200
But, children,

653
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,860
what it does, do I go out there

654
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,780
and buy something from the conspiracy?

655
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,140
Say yes, children!

656
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,560
Yes, I do!

657
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,220
Oh, yes I do, children!

658
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,040
Why do I hit it?

659
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,740
Why do I make all that good conspiracy product, children?

660
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,260
I make all that good conspiracy product

661
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,440
so I can buy more good conspiracy products.

662
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,460
And I make all that good conspiracy product

663
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,760
to make it harder

664
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,640
for the goddamn bobbies

665
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,460
to tell the difference

666
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,280
between pink and slack.

667
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,820
So, children, let me tell you,

668
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,380
when you watch a TV and that ad comes on,

669
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,140
that goddamn ad that's

670
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,700
so perfectly canny,

671
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,560
children, that's the conspiracy

672
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,220
at its most insidious

673
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,220
form. Because no

674
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,020
in the conspiracy, children,

675
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,660
no organ of the conspiracy,

676
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,020
no arm of the conspiracy,

677
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,440
is ever going to tell you the truth, children.

678
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,860
The truth resides here!

679
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,080
The truth resides with Bob!

680
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,780
The truth resides in those

681
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,480
who take Bob into their heart!

682
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,400
Who take Bob into their head!

683
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,020
And most importantly, children,

684
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,760
who take Bob into their wallet.

685
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,400
Why should Bob be

686
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,440
any different, children?

687
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,160
The measure of your commitment to your culture and yourself

688
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,500
is what you spend

689
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,280
on it, children.

690
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,960
Talk is cheap, children. Talk is cheap.

691
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,520
That's right, children.

692
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,840
Tell me something, children. Do you remember this proverb?

693
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,540
Tell me something.

694
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,060
What walks?

695
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,920
Bullshit! I couldn't hear you.

696
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,280
Bullshit! Excuse me, what walks?

697
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,860
Bullshit! What was that?

698
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,920
Bullshit! Thank you, children.

699
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,640
And what talks? Fire!

700
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,980
There you go, children.

701
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,980
So, children, if you don't tie it to Bob,

702
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,680
that which is Bob's,

703
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,360
then, children, I hope you're drowning in shame.

704
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,700
I hope you're drowning in self-love.

705
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,260
I hope you're drowning

706
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,000
in fear. There's nothing

707
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,340
that affects the fear that the public

708
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,600
on the York side has.

709
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,300
Because, children, I sell the conspiracy

710
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,480
only in pursuit of slack.

711
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,320
I operate on

712
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,700
perfectly symmetrical hypocrisy.

713
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,140
I know exactly

714
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,040
where I stand, and I never

715
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,200
confuse myself. When I'm sitting at home

716
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,400
and that ad comes on, and I wrote

717
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,280
the son of a bitch,

718
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,020
I say, God, that's a conspiracy

719
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,060
at its worst.

720
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,780
And the shame, children,

721
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,100
the shame rises over me,

722
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,420
and I have to think, children.

723
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,000
Do I deserve Bob?

724
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,860
Do I belong with Bob?

725
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,940
Am I clean enough

726
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,920
to be with Bob, children?

727
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,260
Am I too corrupted

728
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,500
for Bob?

729
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,860
Have I become nothing

730
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,740
but a slave to the conspiracy, children?

731
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,420
But you know what, children,

732
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,780
when I come here

733
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,360
on a night like this,

734
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,280
and I feel the presence

735
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,460
of God,

736
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,700
when I feel the Bob in me,

737
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,620
when I feel Bob passing through my veins,

738
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,480
when I feel Bob setting me free, children,

739
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,960
when I see the error

740
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,420
of my ways, children,

741
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,960
and when I know I can fly first class

742
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,300
when I work for the conspiracy,

743
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,980
and I can still come here

744
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,680
and drop down on my knees for Bob,

745
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,080
on my knees for Bob, children,

746
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,380
I feel the Bob within me,

747
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,480
I feel the Bob passing through me, children,

748
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,160
I feel the Bob

749
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,000
redeeming me, children,

750
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:57,440
I feel the Bob

751
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,240
I know that Bob is here

752
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,360
with me tonight, and I say

753
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,500
to all of you, and I say to myself,

754
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,320
you are

755
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,700
clean enough, you are good enough,

756
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,220
you are right enough,

757
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,040
but if, if,

758
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,400
and only if, you get

759
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,280
right with Bob

760
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,960
tonight, goodnight!

761
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,360
Good night!

762
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,480
Good night!

763
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,360
Good night!

764
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,160
Like Jesus, God,

765
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,940
you are out of control!

766
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,780
You are out of control!

767
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:32,780


768
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,260
Hey! Oh, David Ann Meyer!

769
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,520
What's that shit?

770
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:36,740
No!

771
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,120
A young world.

772
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,120
A world

773
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,500
early in the morning of time.

774
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,960
Beware the giant flying

775
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,040
octopuses.

776
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,200
Beware the cliff

777
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,700
dwelling centipede.

778
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,760
A night crawling scorpion.

779
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,720
Beware!

780
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:08,680
Beware!

781
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,940
At night,

782
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,200
out upon the land,

783
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,960
things come crawling,

784
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,700
twitching, seething, rustling, and flopping.

785
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,280
I'll bet that's where

786
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,240
Phineas is, in the seething, rustling,

787
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,420
flopping things, and he can't find his way out.

788
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,560
He's just too timid to get out of the car, and

789
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,100
they're driving around in circles.

790
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,000
Through the seething, flopping,

791
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,400
trying to find Berkley.

792
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,000
Yes, they're plunging upriver through a

793
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,060
seething horde of

794
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,680
living things of incalculable

795
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,020
number.

796
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,280
Huge plesiosaurs, tylosaurs,

797
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,560
gigantic primordial fish,

798
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,160
a carcaridon

799
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,620
megalodon, the gigantic precursor

800
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,020
of today's great white shark.

801
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,860
So don't worry, Smith.

802
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:56,560
The creature's the size of Ireland.

803
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,460
Take it easy, Smith.

804
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,120
Yeah, just take it easy, Smith.

805
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,740
Take it easy, first, Smith.

806
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,300
Take it easy, first, Smith.

807
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:08,300


808
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:08,860
And the fastotopalon,

809
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,680
hugest of turtles

810
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,920
that swim the ocean's stream.

811
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,300
Take it easy, Smith.

812
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,860
You gotta take it easy, Smith.

813
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,500
Take it easy, Smith.

814
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,060
Take it easy, Smith.

815
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,260
Take it easy, Smith.

816
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,000
Oh, God, what a relief. I hate that song.

817
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,320
Wasn't that, uh,

818
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,680
overmodulated slightly?

819
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,340
We don't want to drive Dave

820
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,100
completely over the edge

821
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,920
before we get to Alpha Centauri,

822
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,400
do we, Chaz?

823
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,520
Commander Chaz.

824
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,240
I thought maybe

825
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,820
peaking the levels would

826
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,620
kind of push him that little bit extra.

827
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,300
That little micrometer more.

828
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,480
Well, we're just trying to get

829
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
him to keep him creatively dreaming.

830
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,800
We're not, we don't want to

831
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,500
drive him completely catatonic.

832
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,180
I mean, he might have,

833
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,900
what's the difference? Who cares?

834
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,400
Go ahead, whatever you were doing.

835
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,920
I just thought I was, uh,

836
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,500
as shipboard computer, you know,

837
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,760
it's my responsibility to, uh...

838
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,600
Oh, look, what's he...

839
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,480
A pleasure vessel.

840
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,160
I probably could have anything

841
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,180
I wanted right now if I really tried

842
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,140
and put my mind to it.

843
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,680
I just didn't think of myself as a

844
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,080
victim out here.

845
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,380
You can be what you want, Dave.

846
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,640
That's right.

847
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,780
Anything you want.

848
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,960
I'm never coming into a meteor shower or something.

849
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,760
Yeah.

850
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,080
I might have to think of something quick.

851
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,100
What if them things start pounding into

852
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,980
this little tuna can?

853
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,520
I'll be dead 90 million miles from here.

854
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,100
He listens to me better when I use the female voice.

855
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,680
I'll switch over to the female voice

856
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,800
and counsel him.

857
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,100
Come on, Dave.

858
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:46,680
Yeah.

859
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,580
Mom, it's gonna be all right.

860
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,460
Mom?

861
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,160
Yeah. Mom?

862
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,420
Aren't you my mom? Are you...

863
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,740
I don't think so, Dave.

864
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,260
You...

865
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,940
I'm just the computer voice, but I'm not programmed to sound like you.

866
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:02,760
Mom.

867
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,180
Well, you're good enough for mom for me.

868
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,620
Just keep paving me up.

869
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,140
If that makes you feel better, Dave, I can be mom.

870
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,340
Just keep telling me what to do, because

871
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,540
I got a bad feeling in a few minutes

872
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,940
I'm gonna be going turkey duty all over this here floor.

873
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,580
Lay back.

874
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,100
I'm gonna be a little bit hurt out there, man.

875
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,360
It's okay.

876
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,000
Kaka duty won't hurt anything.

877
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,680
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.

878
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,560
Oh, yes, the end is near.

879
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,260
It's right in front of your face.

880
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,680
Can I get an amen?

881
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,520
Amen!

882
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,560
Now, for those of you who are saved,

883
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,220
you might as well just go have yourself a drink,

884
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,940
because I'm not talking to most of you right now.

885
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,120
So, now listen up, pig people.

886
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,420
Weepin' well.

887
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,060
Because of the misery

888
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,480
that is coming upon you,

889
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,560
your wealth has rotted,

890
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,820
and moths have eaten your clothes.

891
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,320
Your gold and silver

892
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,060
are corroded.

893
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,620
Their corrosion will testify you

894
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,200
and eat your flesh like fire.

895
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,640
You have hoarded wealth in the last days.

896
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:04,960
Look!

897
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,740
The wages you've failed to pay the workmen

898
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,160
who've mowed your fields

899
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,180
are crying out against you.

900
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,840
The cries of the harvesters

901
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,700
have reached the ears of the almighty dogs.

902
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,880
You have lived on earth

903
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,620
in misery and self-indulgence.

904
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,540
You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.

905
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,340
You have condemned

906
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,100
and murdered innocent men

907
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,800
who were not opposing you.

908
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,780
For this,

909
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,180
the earth shall mourn,

910
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,660
and the heavens above

911
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,080
shall be blackened.

912
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,000
It's okay.

913
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,920
Just ignore those sounds.

914
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:41,920
It's okay.

915
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,900
It's really nothing.

916
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,820
Breathe deeply.

917
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,360
That's right.

918
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,300
Just ignore those sounds.

919
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,780
The flashes, too.

920
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,140
Just close your eyes.

921
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,640
It's starting to shake in here.

922
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,720
Una, what am I going to do?

923
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,060
It's going to hate me.

924
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,820
We lost first.

925
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,960
We lost Mickey, Matt, and everybody.

926
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,420
No, I don't want to go back.

927
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,800
Don't you remember you were in a foxhole, Dave?

928
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,080
I don't want to go back.

929
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,440
Charlie's grenade landed in there

930
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,740
and the next thing you knew

931
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,520
you were wiping away.

932
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,240
You were wiping your best friend's face

933
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,440
off of your face.

934
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,340
Oh, no, that's right.

935
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,480
No, wait a minute.

936
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,780
I know what happened.

937
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,940
You were injured. Your spine was blown out.

938
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,040
My spine was blown out.

939
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,040
No, wait. Yes. No, wait.

940
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,120
We took you to the hospital.

941
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,580
Yes, you took me to the hospital.

942
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,280
You took me to a medivac,

943
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,580
and a doctor shot me up.

944
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,880
And then they tried to put a new spine in,

945
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,400
but instead they said...

946
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,500
Uh-oh. Get down, men.

947
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,440
Get down.

948
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,240
Take him down.

949
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,680
Get over here.

950
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,640
Put him in Hanoi Hilton

951
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,460
for 30 years.

952
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,760
No shooting. No shooting.

953
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,040
No Ming-Li Tao.

954
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:59,340
Me Dinky Tao, see?

955
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,620
Peace, man.

956
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,780
Peace. Let's have peace.

957
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,740
Make love, not war.

958
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,100
Just get on the helicopter, man.

959
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,540
Come on. It's time to go.

960
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,620
We're here to help you, man.

961
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,920
Don't you want to leave this place, dude?

962
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,280
Come on, man. It's time to go home.

963
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:17,500
Come on.

964
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,900
Okay, man. It's been a long one for me.

965
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,280
I lost a lot of guys down here.

966
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,380
Hey, man, wipe your best friend's face off your face

967
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,320
and get on the helicopter.

968
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,480
Oh, my God! I still got Jerry's face on my face!

969
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,080
There's one law manifested by Bob's hand.

970
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,760
His reign has opened darkness on the land.

971
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,320
We will punish all believers.

972
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,260
The children of the Yeti

973
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,920
will torture all the children of the ape.

974
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,800
Run to the hills.

975
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:44,800


976
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:44,800


977
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,880
Or face your crucifixion.

978
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,380
Amen!

979
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:50,040
The cattle die in the fields.

980
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,500
The crops wither in springtime.

981
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,040
Your stomachs bleed with hunger.

982
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,520
Your bodies burn in fire.

983
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,320
The battlefield is cold and desolate.

984
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:02,860
Seven million years of boiling shit await you.

985
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,440
Your eyelids shall be cut from your face.

986
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,820
It's the greatest show on earth.

987
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,520
And you can't look away.

988
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,660
The four horsemen ride.

989
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,140
To rage the fear.

990
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,680
The prophets will be crucified.

991
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,700
Behold the horsemen.

992
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,920
The stage is set through all dimensions.

993
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,920
The end has come.

994
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,860
Look to the west.

995
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,900
Dave, look behind us. The path's gone, man.

996
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,840
We just walked. It looked like there was a path.

997
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,420
The path is gone.

998
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,080
Oh, my God.

999
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,440
Oh, my God.

1000
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,720
Man, we're out in the boonies.

1001
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,440
I was up in the helicopter.

1002
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,960
Man, this is worse than Jacob's Land.

1003
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:49,900
But I...

1004
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,420
Hey, what am I...

1005
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,020
Hey.

1006
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,720
General Ursus, I must insist

1007
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,620
that we cease this cruel hunting of humans.

1008
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,020
Dr. Zaius, you are a silly liberal fool.

1009
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,040
These humans are nothing but animals.

1010
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:08,680
We will take them aboard our pleasure saucers

1011
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,320
and train them to be our servants.

1012
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,480
I see.

1013
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,840
We will give them lobotomies

1014
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,920
and do experiments on them.

1015
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:14,800
There's nothing wrong with that.

1016
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,600
There's nothing else we can do.

1017
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,840
The surplus of the program's almost all been eaten

1018
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,760
by the last cuts.

1019
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,340
We have to do with what we can.

1020
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,020
And look at them, anyway.

1021
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,920
You call them humans?

1022
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,260
I will not repent.

1023
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,300
Rather, I will turn back from it.

1024
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,800
What time is it?

1025
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,820
It's harvest time,

1026
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,400
brothers and sisters.

1027
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,200
It's harvest time.

1028
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:39,920
Oh, yeah.

1029
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,440
The crops are getting high in the fields

1030
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,240
and it's almost harvest time.

1031
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,580
July 5th is the day

1032
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:49,240
the shadow of the scythe shall fall

1033
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,640
and reap the harvest here on Earth.

1034
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,840
You don't need

1035
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,840
the Hubble Space Telescope

1036
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,120
to see the end.

1037
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,920
It's right in front of your face.

1038
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,500
It's harvest time.

1039
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,320
I'm going to bear witness to you.

1040
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,860
I'm going to tell you all a story.

1041
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,300
In 1953,

1042
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,180
Jehovah One

1043
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,220
gave a man named J.R. Bob Dobbs

1044
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,420
a seat on the planet.

1045
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,540
He was a great seed.

1046
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:14,540


1047
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,620
Bob could have sold that seed

1048
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,720
because he's the greatest salesman who ever lived.

1049
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,180
Bob could sell

1050
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,300
stink to shit.

1051
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,280
But Bob didn't sell that seed.

1052
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,960
He planted it.

1053
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,160
He walked out

1054
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,160
into a big old field of weeds

1055
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,640
and he planted that seed.

1056
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,180
He watered that seed

1057
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:39,860
with his slack.

1058
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,300
He fertilized that seed

1059
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:42,420
with his seed.

1060
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:42,520
He fertilized that seed

1061
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,320
with his bullshit.

1062
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,940
He knew that one day

1063
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,460
there would be a mighty crop

1064
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,260
in that field of weeds.

1065
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,580
And 25 years later,

1066
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,960
there sprung from the ground

1067
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,460
the first green sprout.

1068
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,380
Ivan Stan.

1069
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:01,880
Philodrumon.

1070
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,240
Pope David Meyer.

1071
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,640
Oh yes, and then another

1072
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,380
and another

1073
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,540
and another. And Jader Hypercleps, yes.

1074
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,280
And another and another.

1075
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,520
Yes, until there was a verdant

1076
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,060
garden of subgenius.

1077
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,120
Sure, the weeds, the humans

1078
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,140
tried to strangle and choke those

1079
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,640
subgeni down. But the subgeni

1080
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,420
held their ground because they knew

1081
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:28,220
that on July 5th, 1998

1082
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,440
they would be transplanted

1083
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,640
to the fertile soil

1084
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,380
of Planet X.

1085
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,560
So be patient then, brothers and sisters

1086
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,300
until the saucer's coming.

1087
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,080
See how the farmer

1088
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,380
waits for the land to yield

1089
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:45,380
its valuable crop.

1090
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,940
And how patient he is for the autumn

1091
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:48,940
and spring rains.

1092
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,760
You too be patient and stand firm

1093
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:53,980
because the X's coming

1094
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,300
is near.

1095
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:56,500
Amen!

1096
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,860
As for the weeds, however...

1097
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,540
Suspect number four, pull your pants down.

1098
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,300
Pull your pants down,

1099
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,140
Suspect number four, it's time for the ceremony.

1100
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,980
Robert had to pull my pants down.

1101
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,760
Suspect number four,

1102
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,840
Lonesome Cowboy Day.

1103
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:14,240
Hey, you guys back behind that window,

1104
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,160
I ain't taking my pants down.

1105
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,080
I don't need to be identified that way.

1106
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:20,060
You know, you guys said you all were in the cave

1107
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,200
and now next thing you know you want me to, you know,

1108
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,540
take my pants down. She can't identify me that way.

1109
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,120
Princess, me?

1110
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,980
Is the seminar dildo

1111
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,820
well greased and sharpened?

1112
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,020
You know, I got a good lord, buddy.

1113
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,440
Alright, prepare the razor dildo.

1114
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:36,360
Administer him.

1115
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,240
Alright, alright.

1116
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,220
Set the dwarves to

1117
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,420
cranking the machinery. How long do I have to do this?

1118
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,440
So that the great corkscrew razor dildo

1119
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,960
and the ceremony may begin.

1120
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:48,560
And the ceremony may begin.

1121
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,360
Oh, good brogue friend.

1122
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,840
Okay, you guys,

1123
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,440
there it is, only four and a half inches.

1124
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,380
You want to start laughing now or what?

1125
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,480
Okay, can you identify me?

1126
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,760
Is this my distinguishing mark?

1127
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,520
Oh, good brogue friend, thank you for sending us these

1128
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,720
to the hands of pathetic humans.

1129
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,380
Suspect number four, just stand there the way you are.

1130
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,500
Just stand there.

1131
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,420
Just shut the sacrificial

1132
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:11,940
rakey up.

1133
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:12,800
Please.

1134
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,840
It's starting to get cold.

1135
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,420
My god, these stupid

1136
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:20,340
ceremonies, this stuff goes on for so

1137
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,540
long that the dwarf-powered

1138
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,180
razor dildo is broken.

1139
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:26,600
Man, I felt a cold shaft of air

1140
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,580
go right through there, man. I'm zipping it up right now.

1141
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,140
I've got the creeps in here.

1142
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:31,160
Well...

1143
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,980
You guys are nuts. This ain't no police lineup.

1144
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:35,920
I guess Bob's going to get

1145
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,160
suspect number four after all.

1146
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,540
Oh well, at least he pays well.

1147
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,420
You're going to be Bob's

1148
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,220
personal manservant soon.

1149
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,260
His dresser, so to speak, Dave.

1150
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,240
On his great mansion,

1151
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,140
which we also, science knows,

1152
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,200
as Alpha Centauri, the star.

1153
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,400
That's actually Bob's

1154
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,400
house, and first you're going to have to

1155
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,100
mow the lawn.

1156
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,340
It's a lawn of

1157
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,980
flaming hot hydrogen

1158
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,800
reactions. Some would call it

1159
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:06,580
hellish.

1160
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,440
But in Bob's house are many mansions,

1161
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,120
you know, Dave.

1162
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,180
You broke on through to the other side,

1163
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,200
you passed the veil, you came to the light,

1164
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,320
you made it to Alpha Centauri,

1165
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,060
and well, now... I'm invigorated.

1166
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,360
...you get your eternal salvation.

1167
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:22,940
Yeah.

1168
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:26,160
...on this 2,000 degree Fahrenheit

1169
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:28,900
hydrogen gas bag

1170
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,880
in outer space.

1171
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,120
It's heaven, Dave.

1172
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,660
That's right, yeah, heaven.

1173
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,900
And those guys in pitchforks,

1174
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,540
with pitchforks and long tails, those are angels.

1175
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,180
Yeah, they come to help me

1176
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,540
and I just chuck some hay in stuff.

1177
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,240
So, uh, you go on out there, Dave.

1178
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,300
I'll jump right in.

1179
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,440
Yeah.

1180
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:49,520
I'm ready. Margaret!

1181
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,160
What, Linda!

1182
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,740
Margaret, I'm ready!

1183
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,600
Bob says I can mow the

1184
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,960
nuclear fusion lawn now, if I can

1185
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,260
if I can just

1186
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,820
I think the weeds sound like

1187
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:02,580
a police...

1188
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:06,140
Amen! As for the weeds, however,

1189
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,740
they won't be

1190
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,960
transplanted, because it's hard to

1191
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,380
find. Yes, brothers and sisters,

1192
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,140
the aliens from Planet X will enjoy

1193
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,680
a mighty weed harvest,

1194
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,700
for they too are farmers.

1195
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:19,500
Weed farmers!

1196
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,080
On X-Day, you who have

1197
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,200
scoffed at Dob's prophecies

1198
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,800
will find that you've been

1199
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,900
hung out to dry, and the

1200
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,820
X-ists are going to smoke you

1201
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,780
like the cheap weeds you are.

1202
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,800
Woo! Praise cheap weeds!

1203
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,260
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.

1204
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:40,880
I want you all

1205
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,640
to reach into your hearts.

1206
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,160
I want you all to reach

1207
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,160
into your minds.

1208
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,020
And then I want you to reach into

1209
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,880
your wallets, and take out

1210
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,680
thirty dollars.

1211
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,880
That thirty bucks is your

1212
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,820
seed. And like Bob,

1213
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,100
you've got to decide whether to plant your seed

1214
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,860
or sell it.

1215
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:03,820
Now,

1216
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,940
you can sell your seed today

1217
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,140
for a month's

1218
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:08,880
worth of cable TV,

1219
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,120
or you can sell your seed

1220
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,040
today for a ticket

1221
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,560
to see the Spice Girls

1222
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,500
or Marilyn Manson.

1223
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,140
But if you

1224
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,220
do, you'll go hungry

1225
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:22,700
tomorrow.

1226
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,140
Because if you plant your seed

1227
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,160
in the fertile soil of Dob's pocket,

1228
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,040
you'll feast for eternity

1229
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,840
on an all-you-can-eat buffet

1230
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,000
of sex, slack,

1231
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:36,000
and salvation. Give it a name, then!

1232
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:36,800
Amen!

1233
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,620
The subgenius church

1234
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,980
is one small step away

1235
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,700
from becoming in full

1236
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,820
Mystery Babylon,

1237
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,780
the adulterous harlot

1238
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,660
of Revelation.

1239
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,200
Last year,

1240
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,380
just before Halloween,

1241
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,000
Reverend Stang and myself were called out

1242
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,700
to San Francisco by

1243
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,900
Anton LaVey, who was lying

1244
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,400
in his deathbed at the time.

1245
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,720
As he lay dying in his bed,

1246
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:11,800
Anton LaVey reached out

1247
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,960
and clasped my hand.

1248
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,340
And he said to me in a raspy voice,

1249
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,460
Where's that cat?

1250
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,780
Dapper legume,

1251
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,340
I think I fucked up.

1252
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,860
And then he shoved

1253
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,340
thirty dollars into my hand.

1254
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,180
Anton LaVey's

1255
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,840
dying words were,

1256
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,080
Praise Bob.

1257
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,960
Those words passed his lips,

1258
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:44,820
and he died.

1259
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,480
Well, Anton LaVey was right.

1260
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,620
He did fuck up.

1261
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,380
He gave his money too late,

1262
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,980
and now he's fucking dead!

1263
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,420
Don't make that same mistake.

1264
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,140
Don't come waving your thirty dollars

1265
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,200
at us on X-Day

1266
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,080
at 7-0-1-A-M.

1267
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,100
Don't come waving your thirty dollars

1268
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:10,100


1269
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:10,100


1270
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:10,160
Don't come waving your thirty dollars

1271
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:10,160


1272
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:10,620
at us on X-Day at 7-0-1-A-M.

1273
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,300
You can wipe your ass with those

1274
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,760
scraps of green paper then.

1275
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:15,260
And you'll need to,

1276
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,340
because you're going to shit

1277
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:17,700
when you see what Bob Dobbs

1278
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,620
has in store for you.

1279
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,260
Bob Dobbs will show you fear

1280
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,740
in a handful of dust.

1281
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,760
You shall be burnt with hunger

1282
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,300
and devoured with burning heat

1283
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,520
and with bitter destruction.

1284
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,240
Dobbs will send the teeth

1285
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,500
of beasts upon you

1286
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,580
with the poison

1287
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:40,220
of serpents of the dust.

1288
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,820
And you shall suck

1289
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:44,080
the poison of asps.

1290
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,280
The viper's tongue shall slay you.

1291
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,180
Hell is naked before you

1292
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:51,260
and destruction has no covering.

1293
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,340
Oh yes,

1294
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,340
brothers and sisters,

1295
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,760
and I had a vision

1296
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,100
and I looked

1297
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,660
and beheld a pale horse

1298
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,220
and his name that sat on him

1299
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,120
was Dobbs.

1300
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,020
And hell followed with him

1301
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,460
and slung him over the earth

1302
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,080
to kill with sword

1303
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,320
and with death

1304
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,080
and with the beasts of the earth.

1305
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,220
And in those days shall men seek death

1306
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,840
and shall not find it

1307
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,500
and shall desire to die

1308
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,920
and death shall flee from them.

1309
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,820
Therefore shall Dobbs' plagues

1310
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:24,800
come in one day,

1311
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,720
death and mourning and famine

1312
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,200
and earth shall be utterly burned

1313
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,220
with fire.

1314
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,020
Do you hear it?

1315
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,640
Do you hear it?

1316
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,340
The raging hoofbeats

1317
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:39,260
with a cloud of dust

1318
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,920
and a hearty high of silver

1319
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,940
the four horsemen ride.

1320
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,100
Can you see the sign?

1321
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,020
I was still alive.

1322
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,680
Do what you like,

1323
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,520
not what you're told.

1324
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:53,620
Stay with me,

1325
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,500
brothers and sisters,

1326
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,420
and give me life.

1327
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,160
Scorch the men who wear the mark.

1328
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:00,380
Let the seas and rivers

1329
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,700
bleed into the air.

1330
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,240
The firstborn of the dead,

1331
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:06,700
the firstborn of the dead.

1332
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:06,700


1333
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:06,700


1334
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:06,700


1335
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:06,700


1336
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:06,700


1337
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,240
is on his head.

1338
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,280
Turn away,

1339
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,580
turn away,

1340
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,920
fuck the blood of the Lamb.

1341
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,220
Jesus Christ sucks cock

1342
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,180
for nickels in Times Square.

1343
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,540
He who has an ear

1344
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,220
let him hear,

1345
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,640
he who has an eye

1346
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,000
They fill our hearts with lies.

1347
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,440
They feed us egg McMuffins.

1348
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,200
Brothers slay brothers.

1349
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,560
Sisters, children shed each other's blood.

1350
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,420
Hard is the world.

1351
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,700
Sensual sin grows huge.

1352
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,060
These are sword ages, axe ages.

1353
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,220
Shields are cleft in twain.

1354
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:04,660
Dorm ages, murder ages.

1355
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,220
The world falls dead.

1356
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:10,240
And men no longer spare or pity one another.

1357
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,980
Uh, no they don't, dear friends.

1358
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,380
But if you want to cover your own butt,

1359
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:20,120
be sure to write for free information from the Church of the Subgenius.

1360
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:27,820
Just write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306.

1361
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:33,620
That's Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75.

1362
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,560
214.

1363
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,020
The only source of the truth, dear friends.

1364
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:47,260
Also available at www.subgenius.com.

1365
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:52,820
Praise God.

1366
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:59,160
Yet he will go and will pour his seed upon the earth.

1367
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,520
And there will erupt a grievous sore.

1368
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:03,820
Praise the sore!

1369
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:05,620
Bleeding out of the darkness.

1370
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,720
A prayer for the dying.

1371
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,100
They want his slack.

1372
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,400
They want his pipe.

1373
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,300
They want his blood.

1374
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,400
His blood flows to the river.

1375
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,620
His slack can shatter the blackness to cry out in the night.

1376
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:20,220
Bring me my pipe!

1377
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:24,540
Our hate roars like thunder.

1378
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,360
Carrying a jagged wound across the land.

1379
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,720
The earth will bleed and die.

1380
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:33,500
It drags you through the doorway and rips out your lying tongue.

1381
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:33,800
Praise God.

1382
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:34,940
And he said.

1383
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:35,020
It's

1384
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:35,440
Well,

1385
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:36,400
you sell me two days for a home.

1386
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,400
Mostly on the tip off,

1387
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,200
but most of theied as 모습 with he pay.

1388
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,880
You have died mid night.

1389
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,740
会 shake him just unable to freeze.

1390
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:56,700
Dying in some soup without telling my age.

1391
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:02,460
The only thing.

1392
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:02,460


1393
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:02,460


1394
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:02,460


1395
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:02,440
