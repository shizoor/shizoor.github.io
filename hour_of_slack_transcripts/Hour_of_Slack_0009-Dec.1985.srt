1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
Well, I'm having a Christmas party.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,520
...wraps.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,980
I had to get them in there as whole after the wraps one time.

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,520
Wraps.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,640
Wraps.

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,180
I used to have to eat wrap a lot.

7
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,480
Back in the 90s and the Depression.

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,460
World Depression II, they called it.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,800
This was after the one in the 80s.

10
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,600
Boy, them was lean years, brother.

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,920
Had to wipe your ass with some genius pamphlets back then.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
It's the only kind of paper there was.

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,860
No wonder there was a bad, bad depression all over the world.

14
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,380
It kind of figures.

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,280
Dateline for dominance

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,480
didn't mention that it would be caused by some genius church.

17
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,700
And I can see why.

18
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,040
Why Bob would not want to mention that in his,

19
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,740
teachings to the uninitiated, they wouldn't understand.

20
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,180
Them was lean years, boy.

21
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:53,200
That move in Mad Max movies, I remember we used to look at those.

22
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,680
Boy, I wish it had been that easy.

23
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,040
Now, all we got in this refrigerator is plutonium.

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,640
Yep.

25
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,780
All we got on the airwaves is this show.

26
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,820
This weird show.

27
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,940
I remember I used to be amazed.

28
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,180
I used to be amazed.

29
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:31,260
I used to be amazed that Dr. Gene Scott was on 12 hours a day on TV in Dallas, Texas.

30
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,620
But now, this show for 24 hours a day forever.

31
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,780
I just, I wish this show could be more exciting, folks.

32
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,440
But just, I guess.

33
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:52,780
Just, I guess.

34
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,280
Just, I guess.

35
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,280


36
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:02,840
But, ever since the nuclear war, it's been hard for us subgeniuses to keep the show running

37
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,160
like it used to back in the good old days.

38
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,600
Now, I remember those times.

39
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,520
Those were good times, boy.

40
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,380
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

41
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,540
I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

42
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,680
I'm out.

43
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,180
I'm out.

44
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,180


45
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,180


46
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,180


47
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,180


48
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,180


49
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,180


50
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,180


51
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,180


52
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,180


53
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,180


54
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,180


55
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,500
아아ah!

56
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,540
I protect Ohio.

57
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:24,540


58
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,480

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,500
I cac M Away.

60
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,520
Are you realizein' where did I left off?

61
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:33,520


62
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,360
I'm just gonna pay you for some wonderful things you should do.

63
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,420
No can do, T bezos.

64
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:36,420


65
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:36,420


66
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:36,660
Drops leck tuit.

67
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,640
Sweet, drop of hair.

68
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:41,640


69
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,360
It's T づtong.

70
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Aへul.

71
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:43,900
He's aik blade a tighty.

72
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,020
S T t thin.

73
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,240
As a teen, I must say, I've kind of lost my mind.

74
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,080
Now, I want to go Mc physically, to R trucs a pub.

75
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,020
I like Fox News.

76
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,160
Really, I don't think he's gonna let me beat him any TV time.

77
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:59,020
phrase, it will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

78
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:12,600
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

79
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:19,820
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge

80
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:26,620
of the Church of the Subgenius, with Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

81
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,260
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

82
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:44,000
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs, living avatar of Slack and saint of sales on planet Earth.

83
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,700
Yeah, Doug Smith says we're different.

84
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:58,900
Doug's right, Virgil. We are different, thanks to Jesus, the Genetic Engineering Corporation of American States.

85
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,120
Mommy too?

86
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,140
Yep, the whole family.

87
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,120
Is everybody like us?

88
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:13,280
No, son, but we're working on it. Round the clock. Soon everyone will be a superior biospecies.

89
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,080
Wowee. I want to be a genetic engineer just like you, Pop.

90
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,620
You will, Vir.

91
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,180
pounds I want to help death at a

92
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,180


93
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,180


94
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,180


95
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,300
No, Bob, if you don't baggy, it could lead to photon confusion.

96
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,740
Don't Baggy.

97
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:49,000
For a healthier,야аже

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,520
was changed and on each insanity and destruction that all of mankind's history and prehistory

99
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,420
before it.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,880
Bob brings a new destiny for America, a time of cataclysmic economic change that will offer

101
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:15,020
untold riches and power to those in the know, while billions of deserving conspiracy dooms

102
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,060
for hiding hell on earth.

103
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:27,020
Uncontrolled thinking, controlled by Bob, will usher in a spiritual rebrief of a cascade

104
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:36,080
of astounding mysteries, supernatural riches, and a restoration of lost psychic abilities

105
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:43,440
that will transform the lives of those who dare to seek them head first.

106
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,880
That's right.

107
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,940
You're lucky to live in the dark.

108
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,380
Here's more, Bob.

109
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,160
Wise up.

110
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,900
We make smaller mistakes.

111
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,940
We make faster corrections and adjustments.

112
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,500
I was wondering, has the show started yet?

113
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,180
No, no.

114
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,680
This is the warm-up.

115
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,180
We generally warm up.

116
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,160
The pre-show warm-up?

117
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:04,480
Yes.

118
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:11,580
We're broadcasting from outer space to radio station KPFA, and a garbled version is reaching

119
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:11,920
you.

120
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,180
Oh, I'll get it.

121
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,660
Oh, why, come in.

122
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,920
Welcome to our ship.

123
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:19,940
Hi, Mom.

124
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,720
Our show, whichever you'd like to refer to it as.

125
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,340
Set recorders for stun.

126
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:31,360
And as the message is broadcast back to the earth, Mobius Rex turns it into code which

127
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,140
only the high masters, the elders, can understand when they listen to this show.

128
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,980
We're passing through clouds of images and words which were sent off from earth many

129
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,880
years ago.

130
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,400
Fortunately, we catch up with them, and then we pass them.

131
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,420
The linguistic scoop brings them to you for your listening pleasure.

132
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,160
The amazing tales from the church of the subgenius.

133
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,520
Be there for the end of the private life and the destruction of the American dream.

134
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,020
Don't say you weren't warned.

135
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,460
We've got to save you.

136
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,260
You already.

137
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,760
Oh, we do it again.

138
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,760
Oh, we do it again.

139
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,860
Oh, we do it again.

140
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,180
Oh, we do it again.

141
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,560
If you would like to hear it again.

142
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:16,880
Yes.

143
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,620
Yes.

144
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,060
I call this psycho technology.

145
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,780
We call up the church of the subgenius.

146
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,620
Thank you very much.

147
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,320
Thank you.

148
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,200
You're wonderful.

149
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,640
More fictional garbage.

150
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,160
Yeah.

151
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,260
Uh, yeah.

152
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,040
I am calm.

153
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,620
The minute, the day, the hour after, and I am calm.

154
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,940
You're a demon-possessed boy.

155
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,820
That's the problem.

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,360
I do not steal.

157
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,840
I am honest.

158
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,020
One of the newest characters in the movie.

159
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,020


160
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:54,640
I want to tell you not to operate this program while listening to a car or other heavy machinery.

161
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,640
What do we think of next?

162
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,960
Wake up.

163
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,060
What?

164
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,060
Where am I?

165
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,700
And we'll welcome them pigs.

166
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,900
Welcome to the show, Dallas.

167
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,040
We've started all over again.

168
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,420
We're broadcasting down here from the Biblical Arts Center.

169
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,340
We're going to be talking about the

170
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:12,340


171
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:12,340


172
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:12,340


173
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:12,340


174
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:12,340


175
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,560
non-radio.

176
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,860
Down here at non-radio.

177
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,580
Yes.

178
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,280
Non-radio.

179
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,220
Church, elastic, plastic, man.

180
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,160
Okay, we're watching the slides of the city here.

181
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,920
And here, of course, is the John Fitzgerald Kennedy Memorial at Main and Market Streets.

182
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,600
You're listening to, uh, Fuck Naked.

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,960
Myself, Doug Smith.

184
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,860
And we're telling you who else will be on the show this morning.

185
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,020
Oh, you don't need to know who else is going to be on the show.

186
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,340
That's right.

187
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,340


188
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,340


189
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,340


190
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,340


191
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,340


192
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,340


193
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,340


194
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:42,340


195
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,340
That's not the real show.

196
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,120
This is the real show.

197
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,800
Friends, I'm sorry.

198
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,020
This is puzzling evidence.

199
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,900
And I'm real sorry.

200
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,100
We're having some technical difficulties.

201
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,080
We keep getting our show all tangled up with these other subgenius shows from Texas.

202
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,120
We're broadcasting live from Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley.

203
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,100
This is some kind of a mix up with our satellite communication system.

204
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:08,980
That's right.

205
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,000
We are having continuous mix up.

206
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,640
How is that?

207
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,240
How is, uh, view screen two over there?

208
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,280
Would you give me another, give me another signal there, Hellswami?

209
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,140
Yeah, let me try this out here.

210
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,460
Well, I'm not, no, I'm, I'm not really picking you up.

211
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,040
We're going to have to.

212
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,280
Well, I'm thinking as hard as I can.

213
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,940
All right.

214
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,140
We're just going to spread this microphone way out here.

215
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,440
Let me just try to, uh.

216
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,300
Camera two doesn't seem to be working here in the station.

217
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,620
A little bit more.

218
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,100
There we go.

219
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,040
The cords have too much slack in them.

220
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,760
Yeah, there's, there's.

221
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,520
But friends, you know, there's, there's never.

222
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,960
Such a thing as too much slack.

223
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,800
Bring the trauma bar over here.

224
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,740
We'll, uh, apply some tension to this thing.

225
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,080
No.

226
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:50,860
Yes.

227
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,160
Friends.

228
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,580
Well, this is, uh, this is Doug Wellman, Reverend Doug Wellman.

229
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,500
Puzzling also known as puzzling evidence here with, uh, Gary, Brooke friend.

230
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,960
Say hi girls, Gary.

231
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,300
No, hold it.

232
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,960
That, that camera doesn't work.

233
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,740
You can't talk.

234
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,200
Hi dudes.

235
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,220
Okay.

236
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,660
Yeah.

237
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,740
There we go.

238
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,100
And a buddy West and the incredible hell Swami satellite.

239
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,420
We were a new guest on the show.

240
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,880
Uh, the help.

241
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,060
The hell Swami is one of the few human wealth post humans who's ever been authorized to

242
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,580
actually draw original new depictions of Jr.

243
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,400
Bob Dobbs, the guru of our, uh, mystic cult.

244
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,060
That's right.

245
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,460
Apparently all the others will have something to pay for.

246
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,520
Yeah.

247
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,940
The afterlife or the before life, whichever comes first.

248
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,300
They'll all be paying.

249
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:50,180
But friends, uh, we, like I say, we, we constantly have technical, that's what these shows are

250
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,820
all about is technical difficulties.

251
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,280
Um, but hello, that's the false buck.

252
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,800
That's the false buck.

253
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,940
That's not the real buck.

254
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,660
Hello.

255
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,060
Uh, they hung up on us.

256
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,640
Yeah.

257
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:09,320
This is another thing friends in, in a couple of weeks, this show will have call in capabilities.

258
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,160
It's something that any religious broadcast really needs is to be able to minister to

259
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,700
the needy, the slack lists out there.

260
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,840
And, uh, hopefully in a couple of weeks, this station will have enough extra money after

261
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,720
the legal problem.

262
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,100
It is a cause.

263
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,860
It is a high.

264
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,100
It is.

265
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,980
I St. Paul Mavridis.

266
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:27,960
Hi girls.

267
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,080
Yeah.

268
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,580
It's it's, it's gets more and more confusing to those.

269
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:38,940
We thought about doing a show that was an explanation of the church of the subgenius,

270
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:44,600
because someone called in last week and said that, uh, that they, they were going to

271
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,220
give us a chance, but it seemed too disjointed and friends is true.

272
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,240
You do have to understand about the church of the subgenius to understand the show, but

273
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,960
you also have to understand the church of the subgenius in order to have any satisfaction

274
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,080
in any area of your life at all.

275
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,740
So I may sound like a big claim, but it's true.

276
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,440
Just keep listening and you shall find, I got a new explanation.

277
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,700
Uh huh.

278
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:08,920
Yeah.

279
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,320
We could explain the jokes to them.

280
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,480
That wouldn't save your soul.

281
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,960
Reverend Wellman, I got a new explanation for the church of the subgenius.

282
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,340
Yeah, Gary.

283
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,360
Okay.

284
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,420
You know, everybody thinks that church of the subgenius started about 1953 or so, but

285
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,120
that's not true.

286
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,100
It's a lot older than that.

287
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,520
And it dates back to the first time, uh, uh, a couple of kids cut up in church.

288
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,300
There you go.

289
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,920
That is a, that is a great history of the church.

290
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,160
I mean, I think it's a great history.

291
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,040
I mean, I think it's a great history of the church of the subgenius, but friends, ah,

292
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:42,820
yes.

293
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,100
Listen to that music.

294
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,600
It's every show is a Christmas show on K and O N for the next couple of weeks.

295
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,820
And we'll be doing our lovely subgenius Christmas show too.

296
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,240
And you can't leave us out.

297
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,480
As a matter of fact, the only house on my block that has Christmas lights up yet is

298
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,140
the, is my house, the evil subgenius castle.

299
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:05,800
That's right.

300
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,380
Celebrating the holiday of Jingle Bob.

301
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:08,900
That's right.

302
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,040
There you go.

303
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,140
We have a lot of, we're going to be talking about the different holidays in the church

304
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,600
of the subgenius.

305
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,400
And the different, the different products you can buy for, oh, oh heck, I hit that voltage

306
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:19,940
meter again.

307
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,660
No, that's okay.

308
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,440
They won't bite.

309
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,600
The different products you can buy from the church, like my buttons.

310
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,500
Oh, there you go.

311
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,080
Don't forget it is, it is turnover.

312
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,280
The time of the year when all things sell, the end of the year sale.

313
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,020
So, so come and get it everyone.

314
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,880
And, uh, just buy our products.

315
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,140
Now are, are we, is Chris, I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

316
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,760
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?

317
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:54,680
Well, uh, that, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie, but the present subgenie, uh, try

318
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:00,000
to make sure that, um, we have our inventories cleared by now and sell everything to the

319
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,260
pigs.

320
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,520
Oh yes.

321
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,560
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.

322
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,940
And it was something else in between there.

323
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:15,480
But before it was after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season, it was

324
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,000
something else, but I think they started a war over it.

325
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,340
Yeah.

326
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,100
Yeah.

327
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:24,280
Well friends, we've got, um, our own special Christmas Carol that we're going to play.

328
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,240
That's that we're inventing as we go right now.

329
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:33,240
The excess, the yes, the nativity of the excesses from planet X.

330
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,960
You always wondered what that X-mas thing was all about.

331
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:43,240
Uh, but anyway, if we can avoid having any more mid-air collisions with other subgenius

332
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,620
shows from around the country, we'll be playing some truly abnormal holiday material to bless

333
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,320
your heart and anoint your gland.

334
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:57,120
Uh, yes, but first this Christmas Carol coming up, this is what we consider Christmas to

335
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,240
be really all about.

336
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,740
The milk chocolate melts in your mouth, not in your hand.

337
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:06,940
The milk chocolate melts in your mouth, not in your hand.

338
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:06,940


339
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:06,940


340
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,100
Barbie dream beds sold separately.

341
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,200
You put it together.

342
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,720
Hey guys, guys, what's listening to?

343
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,880
Pop music.

344
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,400
It's not crackle pop music.

345
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,620
From Mattel.

346
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,260
Snap.

347
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:18,620
Pop.

348
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,120
Ew.

349
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,880
That's so sound system.

350
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,380
Ho, ho, ho.

351
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,860
Ho, ho, ho.

352
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,420
Ho, ho, ho.

353
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,920
Ho, ho, ho.

354
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,700
Come one, come all.

355
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,080
From Bugs Bunny, the Ewoks, C-3PO and R2-D2.

356
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:36,940
The E-Walk.

357
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:36,940


358
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:36,940


359
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:36,940


360
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:36,940


361
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:36,940


362
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:36,940


363
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:36,940


364
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:36,940


365
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:36,940


366
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:36,940


367
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,420
Scooby Doo.

368
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,260
Ho, ho, ho.

369
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,340
Ho, ho, ho.

370
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,620
Ho, ho, ho.

371
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,160
Ho, ho, ho.

372
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,300


373
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,680
Ho, ho, ho.

374
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,500
Merry Christmas to all.

375
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,380
They feel better?

376
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,680
Yes.

377
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,940
The Fright Zone.

378
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,000
You put it together.

379
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:53,540
Fright Zone.

380
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,000
He-Man.

381
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,340
Ornac.

382
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:54,840
Amandibar.

383
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,860
Figures each sold separately.

384
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,740
The Fright Zone.

385
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,120
Ho, it's He-Bob.

386
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,840
Hey kids, you can help the mighty subgenius rice overthrow the evil normals with new

387
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,880
Bob Dobbs action figure with rocket pipe.

388
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,660
What I wouldn't do.

389
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,360
From Bob Dobbs.

390
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,760
I'm a chocolate space cadet.

391
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,160
Life support system down to zero cocoa.

392
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,820
Feeling spacey.

393
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,060
Have some of my new cocoa pebbles.

394
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,840
Now so chocolatey.

395
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,260
Smells cocoa-licious.

396
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,880
This cocoa-lickable.

397
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,800
Watch me on watch.

398
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,520
I'm the

399
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,380
Mr. Trish's

400
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:35,640
director.

401
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,540
Yeah, but I'm a

402
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:36,640
Dr. Trish's director.

403
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:36,640


404
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,380
Well, poor friends, what do you think?

405
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:48,680
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here or is it the horrible

406
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:55,480
death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob, as he's been referred to in some early pre-scriptures?

407
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,560
He chose separate.

408
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,680
He chose separate.

409
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,760
He chose separate.

410
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,720
He chose separate.

411
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,560
He chose separate.

412
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:00,700
He chose separate.

413
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,360
New from Tonka.

414
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,980
Now you are in my evil clutches, Bob.

415
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,640
I'll use this MT-10.

416
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:06,640


417
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,700
I'll use this MT-10 to turn you normal.

418
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,260
I'll use this MT-10 to turn you normal.

419
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,080
Shut up, pink boy.

420
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,000
No way.

421
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,680
I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.

422
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,980
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien tool.

423
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,840
Bob Dobbs comes with rockets, pipe, head launcher, Janer device, all Yaka-tisma, fighting Jesus,

424
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,540
and other action figures sold separately, some assembly required, batteries not included.

425
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,160
This toy falls apart in three days.

426
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,160
He-Bob.

427
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,060
And the bastards of the universe.

428
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,540
Too much is always better than not enough.

429
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,500
From Tom and Mary.

430
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:36,620
Behold, the greatest of all monsters.

431
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:36,620


432
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:36,620


433
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,880
and I can dazzle separately.

434
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:38,960
Gorgeous.

435
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,020
Seagulls can blow from head to toe.

436
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,220
Right Barbie.

437
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,280
I'm storing everything you see here.

438
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,280
Can dazzle separately.

439
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
He-Man, He-Man.

440
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,080
Now to test my thunder punch.

441
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,360
You hear it here, but you feel it there.

442
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,200
You can look for a figure.

443
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,740
Castle Grayskull and Thunder Punch He-Man figure each soul separately.

444
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,720
You put the castle together.

445
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,080
With He-Man over there, Grayskull will be mine.

446
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,800
Like I said, bone face.

447
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,080
You hear the thunder here, but I feel the punch here.

448
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,720
Thunder Punch He-Man, new from the Masters of the Universe collection.

449
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,160
Skeletor and Castle Grayskull, each soul separately.

450
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,680
Hulk Hogan's Rock and Wrestling will return.

451
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,940
He-Bob and the Masters of the Universe will be back after this message.

452
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,720
Santa Claus.

453
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:31,480
Here's Verbot, a robot you can program to perform eight different functions.

454
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,480
Go right.

455
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,460
You can control Verbot.

456
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,460
With your own voice.

457
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:35,760
Go left.

458
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,720
Verbot, I said left.

459
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,140
He'll obey your commands.

460
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,900
Verbot, speak.

461
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,180
4-double-A-2-9-volt and two C batteries not included.

462
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,780
C batteries not included.

463
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,700
Volt and two C batteries not included.

464
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,060
C batteries not included.

465
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,460
C batteries not included.

466
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,060
Mission accomplished.

467
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,520
The prince is satisfied.

468
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,620
Yeah!

469
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,220
Verbot, a voice-activated robot.

470
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,960
Oh, yes, dear friend.

471
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,440
Season's greetings from all of us at Channel 4.

472
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:04,920
Yes.

473
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,320
And all of us at KNON.

474
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,220
Launch the heatseekers.

475
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,300
We must destroy those evil humans.

476
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,080
Oh, no, not now.

477
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:28,200
Well, friends, so Christmas has become a lovely sort of hideous mix of sensitive music and

478
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,760
Your gift of $50 will mean so much.

479
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,100
$50 will mean so much.

480
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,300
Friends, $50 to The Church of the Subgenius.

481
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,620
And Jim and Tammy want to give you Susie Moppet, it'll bless a child.

482
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,120
And this little Bob doll you pulled the string at the back of his neck.

483
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,420
What did you do with the $31,000 you won?

484
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,420
Well, this $31,000, friends, goes to the home for a selfless children.

485
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,380
And last, the control room.

486
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,360
No, stay out of here. This is the control room.

487
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,740
And what have we here?

488
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,160
I think we've got a phone call.

489
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,720
Everything's soggy.

490
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,620
Everything's soggy all over the floor.

491
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,820
Hello? Hello?

492
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,820
Hi, girls.

493
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,700
No wonder...

494
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:18,020
You know, part of the problem with doing any kind of a call-in thing around here is that

495
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,660
we have a lot of trouble digging our way through the sound effects

496
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,260
and getting to the actual telephone.

497
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,980
Norm, who will follow us in here in the next show, will...

498
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,260
Here's Peaches and Cream Barbie downstairs.

499
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,240
And I can't doubt...

500
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,020
He's a kid...

501
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,560
We'll return after these messages.

502
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:37,780
Hey?

503
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,800
Introducing the G.I. Joe USS Flag Aircraft Carrier.

504
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,760
Let's get back into some pretty music,

505
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,920
and we'll just leave that little rug of hideous noise in the background.

506
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,320
At one time, folks, the Santa Bob came.

507
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,740
And in the prescriptions, uh, prescriptions, uh, Frost Ecclesians 1914,

508
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,420
it says,

509
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,060
and yea,

510
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,540
he climbeth down chimneys and delivereth us gifts of the flesh and of slack,

511
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:19,260
and he commandeth horned demons with cloven hoofs to take to the air

512
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,280
and pull him in his chariot in glory,

513
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,660
for he knoweth when thou hast been sleeping,

514
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,380
and he knoweth when thou art awake.

515
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,200
He judgeth if thou art damned or worthy,

516
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,260
so he did this for thine own sake.

517
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,940
His eyes are everywhere, like unto thine big brother.

518
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,800
He puffeth on his pipe and laugheth at our follies,

519
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,400
for he is jolly, and yea, in his mercy,

520
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,860
he giveth us days off,

521
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,480
and he bringeth us goods, yet billeth us not.

522
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,560
Oh, friends, that's such a touching message from the prescriptions.

523
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,060
Wouldn't you say, Reverend West?

524
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,980
I say, I just want old Bob, Santa, Santa Dobbs,

525
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:12,860
to come and give me my Bob Hope Hill Bobble Magic from 1995.

526
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,220
But Bob will change on you, friends.

527
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,460
Bob's a transformer.

528
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,440
He's one of the top-selling toys in the country right now.

529
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,980
It's the little Bob Dobbs doll.

530
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,820
There you go, see?

531
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,060
That's some style.

532
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,300
Only you can return the demons to the chest.

533
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,260
Sound too good to be true? Well, it is.

534
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:40,220
Just pull the string, press the button.

535
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,400
Upsy baby starting to stand, she gets up by herself now.

536
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,780
She looks so proud, let's give her a hand.

537
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,120
That's my baby.

538
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,500
Up, upsy baby.

539
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,900
Upsy baby, the doll that stands up.

540
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,100
She's new, from Kenner.

541
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,460
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

542
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,500
We must buy our toys.

543
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:08,500
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

544
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,740
It will empower us to resist us.

545
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:22,180
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the public.

546
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:29,100
It will be called Bobber For Kids.

547
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:39,520
Do you understand and accept this blessing now?

548
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,680
For the usual plus expenses.

549
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,560
Good.

550
00:24:51,620 --> 00:25:00,580
This code has been recorded in the archives of reality.

551
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:08,220
Okay, I think for the girls we'll have the strawberry rainbow, rainbow bites.

552
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:19,360
And for the boys, little tiny transformer robots that change into dollar bills and back again.

553
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:31,500
Yes, but how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

554
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:31,720
Just 150,000 nice toys of beautifulalu 착 slice.

555
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:31,720


556
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,740
Good has Wacom 무�les.

557
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,760
God, good.

558
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:47,100
The primitive earth societies should accept this value judgement.

559
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:59,020
Good will have clean physical attributes according to human desires, sexual desires

560
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,500
latent瓜

561
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:01,480
in our brainized memory.

562
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:09,620
children brought out through the vehicle of this so-called...

563
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,400
Skull Farmer?

564
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,840
Skull Farmer told me his boys at church.

565
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,080
Batteries not good.

566
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,780
Skull Farmers, that's true.

567
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,200
I think that may sell to the humans.

568
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,900
Skull Farmers, little wind-up bombs.

569
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:38,740
Hundreds of little bombs, each whispering their messages in the night to the little children as they sleep.

570
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:44,060
Too much is always better than not enough.

571
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:52,360
Too much is always better than not enough.

572
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,760
Too much is always better than not enough.

573
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,880
Too much is always better than not enough.

574
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,120
Too much is always better than not enough.

575
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,760
Too much, too much!

576
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,620
A hour and two, we're down here at the reunion tower...

577
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,400
I hate that demon...

578
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,340
Desperately...

579
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,840
Gary, we need those demons to go on the air.

580
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,920
They're part of the exciting new show.

581
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm mighty glad to be here on radio tonight because we know that other station

582
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,720
is tragic.

583
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,220
to get rid of us. Hey, non-radio.

584
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,860
Yes, right. Non-radio for Central

585
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,140
Texas, South Texas, East Texas,

586
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,400
Nunu, some Texas.

587
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,060
That's right. Radio Nunu

588
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,940
Narnini. Yes, Nunu, here we

589
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,940
are in the cult of Nunu and Narnini

590
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,720
and Ivan.

591
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,280
Yes.

592
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,720
I hate that name.

593
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,760
Yes, this is Ivan.

594
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,720
Hello. I forget, that's right.

595
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,500
My name is Ivan Stan. No, this is

596
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,900
Doug Wellman with Puzzling Evidence

597
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,840
or Ivan Stan.

598
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,260
And this is...

599
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,060
My name is Rex. My name ain't

600
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,860
Puzzling Evidence. And who are you?

601
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,040
That's right. So you will be getting that

602
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,300
part. We'll be leaving

603
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,440
that part. Alright, so we've got

604
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,020
friends, I'm sorry, once again, I'm trying to

605
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,620
disentangle this California

606
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,120
show from the Texas show that has

607
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,480
infringed on our airspace.

608
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,020
Actually calling up those doctors,

609
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,140
those crazy doctors. No, I don't

610
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,480
want to get a call from those guys.

611
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,240
It is the hour of flash.

612
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,760
It is the hour of flash.

613
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,860
This is not the hour of flash.

614
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,020
If you were listening to more than one or less of the show

615
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,800
right now,

616
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,840
you'd be a lot more entertained than you are

617
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,880
here from these stupid little

618
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,560
doctors like us in Texas.

619
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,760
That's right, and I'll put it as a question because then

620
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,160
the FCC can't do it.

621
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,800
Is this KNON?

622
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,820
Well, yes, it is a question.

623
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,480
Is this KNON?

624
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,960
Is this not radio?

625
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,540
Friends, this is KNON

626
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,080
90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

627
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,400
Um,

628
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,140
area code 75214,

629
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,920
but it really is KNON.

630
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,300
I should have taken that pill in Arkansas

631
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,700
and I wouldn't have been here in the first place.

632
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,780
Ladies and gentlemen, it's awfully hard to remember

633
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,800
when you take those pills when you're in Arkansas

634
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,580
because there's so many pills to take there.

635
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,860
I was working at

636
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,880
Las Colinas last night on a

637
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,920
conspiracy media church tape

638
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,940
and, well,

639
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,560
I was getting paid, too.

640
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,220
It was real good work, but I thought

641
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,080
I have forsaken my church.

642
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,620
I have forsaken the church.

643
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,940
I'm the subgenius and

644
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,160
I have hurt

645
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,980
those around me.

646
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,320
Here in Dallas,

647
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,960
it's not so easy

648
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,160
to be a subgenius.

649
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,060
Hey, listen, we had to rush back here from Las Colinas, too.

650
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,420
We had to jump in the car

651
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,300
and get back here and do the show.

652
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,360
It's about 11.30 now.

653
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,980
These other subgenius shows,

654
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:48,420
they'll...

655
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,780
That's right. It's about 11.30 now.

656
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,620
See, they don't even know what time it is.

657
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,380
It's really 6.30 in the afternoon.

658
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:55,780
Yeah, Monday.

659
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,740
It's all over the station.

660
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,960
Is it a non-radio?

661
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,900
Hey, I've been trying to tell the wrong...

662
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,280
We don't heat our houses here in Dallas anymore.

663
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,560
We decide to be like...

664
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,640
It's 1.45 a.m. right now.

665
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,200
No, we're in San Francisco, bud.

666
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,180
No, no, no, no.

667
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,080
I'm sorry.

668
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,060
Friends, I know this show is confusing.

669
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,740
I'm Paul.

670
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,000
Gary, say a few words.

671
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,360
Hi, girls.

672
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,840
No, no, that's my line.

673
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,920
Hi, Paul.

674
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,500
Is that time demon?

675
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,280
That time demon that be on your back?

676
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:29,940
I came down to the station

677
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,900
and I found out I wasn't even me anymore

678
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,120
and I found my real self passed out

679
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,040
in a room full of pills

680
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:42,620
with a giant piece of live meat

681
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,300
hanging out of my jaws.

682
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,040
Yep, that sounds like me too.

683
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,240
I hate that demon.

684
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,960
I hate that old demon myself.

685
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,000
Folks, we're trying to do a Christmas show in here

686
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,740
and we've got...

687
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,800
We've got all this...

688
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,400
this incredible mess.

689
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,340
Dr. Helswami Satellite Weavers,

690
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,000
do you have that tape of Judgment Day queued up?

691
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,520
I think we've got something on here.

692
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,600
Let's see what it sounds like.

693
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,880
It's inspirational music and nothing else.

694
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,260
We'll just bring it in here real slow

695
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,920
like a professional mixing job.

696
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,340
Ah, yes, friends.

697
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,480
This is the Church of the Subgenius.

698
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,880
We're still on the air on KNON 90.9.

699
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,740
It's Judgment Day, so hold on to your wazoo.

700
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,120
Yeah, it's gonna be tough for some of you sinners out there,

701
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,760
but it's gonna be tough for some of you sinners out there.

702
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:25,780
But the point is,

703
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,980
the problem is you don't know which was the sin

704
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,840
and which was the good deed anymore in this day and age.

705
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,100
Ladies and gentlemen, in just a few minutes,

706
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,580
you're gonna be ushered in to the Judgment,

707
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,940
a one-act play where men and women are brought

708
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,340
before the Judgment seat of Christ

709
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,380
in one of the most awesome events

710
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,100
that this world will ever witness.

711
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,980
In the ninth chapter of the book of Hebrews,

712
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,260
in verse 27,

713
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,100
it's appointed unto man once to die

714
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,720
after death,

715
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,800
the judgment.

716
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,880
We're heading toward that judgment today

717
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,820
and every thinking person on this earth.

718
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,060
It's a judgment that we speak about today

719
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,120
and that's gonna be...

720
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,440
You have lost your reward.

721
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,060
You shall enter heaven as a servant

722
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,380
without a single soul to your credit.

723
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,700
It's unfair.

724
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,420
It's so unfair.

725
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,960
I've worked so hard for the kingdom all these years.

726
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:25,580
It's unfair.

727
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,440
I should lose all my credits now.

728
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,440
Oh, my.

729
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,200
You knew all of this before you backslid.

730
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,960
Show him his record.

731
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,480
January 3rd, 1973.

732
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,660
But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness

733
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,480
and committeth iniquity

734
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,520
and doeth according to all the abominations

735
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,020
that the wicked man doeth,

736
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,960
shall he live?

737
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,940
All his righteousness,

738
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,780
that he hath done,

739
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,300
shall not be mentioned.

740
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,160
In his trespass,

741
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,560
that he hath trespassed,

742
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,820
and in his sin that he hath sinned,

743
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,360
in them shall he die.

744
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,160
This simply means that if you backslide...

745
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,960
Pull the lever.

746
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,700
Turn away from God.

747
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,320
Down you go.

748
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,220
All the rewards that you've accumulated

749
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,540
shall be lost.

750
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,740
Oh, my.

751
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,800
I just don't understand how this could happen to me.

752
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:20,920
Oh, my.

753
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,240
August 21st, 1973.

754
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,640
You mean you aren't going to church again today?

755
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,740
Baby, it don't bother me.

756
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,800
You know it's the morning of the day off.

757
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,180
Y'all don't have to live in church to be saved.

758
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,560
Dana, if you aren't careful,

759
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,320
you're gonna miss out with the Lord completely.

760
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,660
Come on, Kim.

761
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,120
My son, you heard the word.

762
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,860
I think we're all gonna miss out.

763
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,220
You were warned.

764
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,320
Were you so foolish that you think

765
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,000
you could outwit the law of God?

766
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,180
No, we actually are not...

767
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,720
You have returned and have been saved as a baron.

768
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,700
See, friends, here's the thing.

769
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,920
When they told us that we were damned

770
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,220
and we're gonna go to hell,

771
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,960
you know, what else could we do but start a church?

772
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,080
Uh, yes.

773
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,440
But the glory and the splendor that could have...

774
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,940
Switch over to some, uh...

775
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,860
What have we got here?

776
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,380
We're on turntable one, I think.

777
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:26,660
Mommy.

778
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,120
Throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity...

779
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,520
Mommy.

780
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,260
...is an awful price to pay.

781
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:32,820
Mommy.

782
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,200
It is an awful price to pay.

783
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,680
Mom, Buck's calling you.

784
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,300
Mommy.

785
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,320
And we do...

786
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,240
We're gonna...

787
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,860
We're gonna seriously address this issue,

788
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,740
but in the meantime,

789
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,380
we have the problem of who is the Santa Bob?

790
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,340
Were there any readings here on the Santa Bob?

791
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,520
Didn't you have I'm-a-Bob on the show last week?

792
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:54,920
No.

793
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,120
No, that was the show before,

794
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,380
and we had to pay...

795
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,260
Yeah, that's right.

796
00:34:59,340 --> 00:34:59,720
That's right.

797
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,840
We did have the I'm-a-Bob on the show last week.

798
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,700
It's a...

799
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,340
It's a...

800
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,180
It's a Bob and a Euro Bob.

801
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,640
Santa Bob and Maria.

802
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,700
Santa Bob and Maria.

803
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,940
But, you know, we ought to talk a little bit about

804
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,960
Were-Bobs and I'm-a-Bobs tonight, Reverend Stang.

805
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,020
I can sense a little bit of that coming on Red Room Stang.

806
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,560
The Were-Bobs and I'm-a...

807
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,720
Those who have the psychosis that convinces them

808
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,300
that they are the Santa Bob.

809
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,920
Or the...

810
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,400
They're Santa Bob by night.

811
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,280
They go shuffling through the snow

812
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,120
on their nameless, hideous errands.

813
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,100
The grin of Bob and the spirit of Santa Claus

814
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,160
and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.

815
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,820
They stop using the locks of their doors

816
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,680
and they just kind of float in through the keyhole.

817
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,380
Oh, friends, it's tough.

818
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,680
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.

819
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,740
You gotta...

820
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:54,900
You gotta...

821
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:54,900


822
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:54,900


823
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,420
Send your money to the Santa Bob.

824
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,520
As a matter of fact, I...

825
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,580
The people across the street from me

826
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,380
told their kids that...

827
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:06,320
That Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.

828
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,340
Can you believe that?

829
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
They asked...

830
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,720
The kids were asking if their parents...

831
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,780
If maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.

832
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,820
And the mom said, no, no, he won't because he bills us.

833
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,900
We can't afford that.

834
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,080
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.

835
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,100
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

836
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,620
Yeah, what kind of a Christmas season is this

837
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,500
where Santa Claus is starting to bill...

838
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,540
And the delivery.

839
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,200
Can you imagine the delivery costs

840
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,580
of bringing that stuff up from the North Pole?

841
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,480
That's going to be added on, too, friends.

842
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:46,160
Even the gimme-bob sort of pale into comparison with that.

843
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:46,920
Yeah.

844
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:51,000
Well, friends, we've got to play a public service cartridge here.

845
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,800
It says on the log,

846
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,860
I hope you're enjoying the music.

847
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,100
But when we come back,

848
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,100
we're going to play part one of our collection of Christmas music.

849
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,940
So genius style.

850
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,540
We've got the Santa's on a Diet by Zug's Rift.

851
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,960
Santa Claus is Coming to Rape Your Wife by Mechanical Sterility.

852
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,320
Mommy.

853
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,660
And the Manson Family Christmas.

854
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:14,820
Mom.

855
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,480
So here it be, folks.

856
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,480
Every other Sunday night on Canowind 90.9,

857
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:36,220
tune in for mind-melting extremist noise

858
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:42,220
with best in industrial experimental music

859
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:46,780
featuring such top-name group sales,

860
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:51,800
Robin Grissel, SBK, and Nocturnal Emissions.

861
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,440
Every other Sunday night,

862
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,620
TV4 AM.

863
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,180
This is...

864
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:15,060
Okay, we're back.

865
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,380
We're still here.

866
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,020
And this song coming up,

867
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,720
this is a really beautiful Christmas song

868
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,280
by Zug's Rift,

869
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:22,800
an un...

870
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,600
generally obscure...

871
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,180
pure musician from L.A.

872
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,480
who's been sending us records.

873
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,920
He's sort of Captain Beefheart-esque,

874
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,000
which is dear to my heart

875
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,880
and some of yours,

876
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,080
but probably not too many.

877
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,260
Anyway, yeah, this is Zug's Rift

878
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,340
with his lovely song,

879
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,240
which I had to censor quite a bit for the radio,

880
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,140
Santa's on a Diet from the album Epic Hack.

881
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,720
Santa's on a Diet.

882
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,400
Now he has to eat.

883
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,600
He's going to miss.

884
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,800
He's going to miss,

885
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:56,800


886
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,360
brauch definiej.

887
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,360


888
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,340
It all started

889
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,280
when he accidentally sat on one of his elves

890
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,460
and turned into a smelly elf suit.

891
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,820
As punishment,

892
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,220
he was forced into exile

893
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,600
to a San Fernando Valley health spa

894
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,220
where they forced him

895
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,380
to take off his clothes and embarrass him.

896
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,260
And he rained in front of his reindeer,

897
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,080
who fled in confusion and hung her into the sky.

898
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,540
Luckily, his famous white beard

899
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,920
was long enough to cover his tiny penis,

900
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,200
which had gone soft in the cold shower.

901
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,680
Everyone had to leave the steam room,

902
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,600
so Santa would have room to sit down.

903
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,860
Some idiot threw him a medicine ball,

904
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,960
but it bounced off his belly and knocked down the wall

905
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:10,640
like the Battle of Gettysburg and the Battle of the Bulge.

906
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,720
When he got home, nobody recognized him.

907
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,380
Instead of the chimney,

908
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,340
he could fit through a keyhole like a skeleton key.

909
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,000
And this one, dear friends,

910
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,620
is Santa Claus is Coming to Rape Your Wife

911
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,480
by a band called Mechanical Sterility.

912
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,200
The singer, I think, is Reverend Hale.

913
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,440
M. Schaefer of the Church of the Subgenius.

914
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,420
Listen to this beautiful, beautiful song.

915
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,700
Ah, yeah.

your wife

936
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,420
He's got a gun

937
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,900
and he's got

938
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,280
a big knife

939
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,820
And his

00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,500

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:35,880
elves

945
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,280
Cut off their heads

946
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,740
and put them

947
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,500
up on the shelf

948
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,260
Rudolph

00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,660
folded the

950
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,040
freedom

951
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:52,180
and he's got a gun

952
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,700
and he's got a

953
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:54,700


954
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:54,900
Packed in

955
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,260
separate baggies

956
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:08,220
Mrs. Claus

957
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:09,500
has disappeared

958
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,360
Is that blood

959
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,200
in Santa's

960
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,020
beard

961
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,700
Christmas time

962
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,020
again I fear

963
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:52,180
Christmas time

964
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,360
Santa cooks up

965
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,440
a mean reindeer stew

966
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,800
Daughter and Gibson

967
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,240
and Rudolph too

968
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,960
Quite tasty

969
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,560
is about

970
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,920
A nice drink

971
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:28,000
ningún

972
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,000


973
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,000


974
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,520
of

975
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,480
s

976
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,360
It's a

977
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,900
ào

978
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,080
You've been

979
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:46,420
bad

980
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,400
or good

981
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,440
So be

982
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,140
good

983
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,900
for goodness

984
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,340
thing

985
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:52,180


986
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:52,120
160

987
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:56,720
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.

988
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:05,520
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.

989
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:14,160
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.

990
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,160
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.

991
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,480
Oh, yes, dear friends.

992
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,220
I hope you hear Rudolph.

993
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:52,500
Oh, what a beautiful, lovely Christmas carol.

994
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:57,100
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife by Mechanical Sterility.

995
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:02,100
This is a cassette album called Band of a Thousand Lunches.

996
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:11,920
And I don't have their address right now, but if you want to write to the Subgenius Foundation,

997
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,140
we'll be there.

998
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,580
We'll be giving that address at the end of the broadcast.

999
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:22,160
If you want to know what anything is that we're playing, or if you want to buy a copy of one of these shows,

1000
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,520
why, buy gobs.

1001
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,240
We've got them.

1002
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:27,700
So, yeah.

1003
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:40,840
Stay there.

1004
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,200
Please stay there.

1005
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,200
I'll be right back.

1006
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,320
Remember, you are commanding, not having, to be heard.

1007
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,620
Oh, yes, friends.

1008
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,360
Ahem.

1009
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,640
Good evening.

1010
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,560
What I'm about to play, to close out.

1011
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,100
Well, there's really two of me here.

1012
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,120
Christmas show here.

1013
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,720
This is a Christmas show.

1014
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,700
A tape song.

1015
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,320
There are two Doug Wellmans in here.

1016
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:28,160
By Pete Warner, the editor of famous magazine called Toilet Suck.

1017
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,600
I'm sure you've heard of it.

1018
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,180
Out of New Jersey.

1019
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:35,220
Toilet Suck is a fantastic cultural artifact.

1020
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,300
And what we're playing right now, friends,

1021
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,860
is an album by this fellow.

1022
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,620
It says,

1023
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:53,860
The irritating sounds heard on this recording are not intended to be digested as reenactments of actual events.

1024
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,780
Sounds based on personal activity.

1025
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:01,860
Monsoon familiar mechanized calf Jesus.

1026
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,980
And it is copyrighted.

1027
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,440
The name of this tune is,

1028
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,260
The Manson Family Christmas.

1029
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:45,120
Here's the theme.

1030
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,560
I fear games.

1031
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,540
Sad but true.

1032
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,540
And let all well due to a hell of a fault

1033
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,640
Women got one motherburgers.

1034
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,860
Still we are not .

1035
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:59,440
Oh, I guess that's all I'm saying to him.

1036
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:02,460
Why are themy Japan al sw manipulating yourself?

1037
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,740
He's been the gay.

1038
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,340
After, see you Bye.

1039
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:16,980
We have to let love happen.

1040
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,580
Charlie is our love.

1041
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,300
We are Charlie's love.

1042
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,580
It's our one.

1043
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,420
It's our happening now.

1044
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,140
Listen to that beautiful

1045
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,420
Charlie Manson Family Christmas.

1046
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:35,980
Yes.

1047
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,760
You know, those were

1048
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,720
different kind of family values,

1049
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,220
I think, in those days.

1050
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,120
But who says the 60s can't live again

1051
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,160
here in the 80s?

1052
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,880
And now, your local multinational corporation presents

1053
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,940
some energy-saving holiday tips

1054
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,960
from Mr. Abernathy.

1055
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:00,260
Thank you.

1056
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:03,980
Hello.

1057
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:05,960
Your local multinational corporation

1058
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:09,660
has sent me to this remote point in Australia

1059
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,140
to prove a point.

1060
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,940
Conservation can be dangerous.

1061
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,580
In this remote Aboriginal village

1062
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,420
just outside of Sydney, Australia,

1063
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,860
the natives were told by their government

1064
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:23,120
to slow down in their consumption

1065
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,040
of gasoline and fossil fuels.

1066
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,140
Unfortunately, the files in the government energy office

1067
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,500
on this town were lost.

1068
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,300
So, nobody bothered to tell them

1069
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,960
when it was okay to go back to normal energy.

1070
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:40,100
Sadly enough, this town has become the victim

1071
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,360
of what we call an energy surplus.

1072
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,960
And the natives have been forced to convert

1073
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,820
many of their dishwashers, lawn mowers, and refrigerators

1074
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,580
into these homemade, energy-hungry, miniature racing guards.

1075
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:56,920
Boys and girls in the village between the ages of 14 and 20

1076
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,200
must stay behind the wheels of these primitive, high-speed,

1077
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,860
and dangerous machines for up to 90 hours at a stretch.

1078
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,960
Just so their village can survive

1079
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:05,960


1080
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:05,960


1081
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:05,960


1082
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:05,960


1083
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:05,960


1084
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:05,960


1085
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,600
and receive the next fuel shipment

1086
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,620
from their local multinational distributor.

1087
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,700
And we'll keep on shipping at our usual rates.

1088
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,540
Just so this little village can meet and surpass its energy quota.

1089
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,000
And to think, it's all because they kept lights off

1090
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,820
when it didn't have to be convenient.

1091
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:27,340
This holiday season, why not turn on all the lights in your house

1092
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,980
and keep them on for the rest of the year?

1093
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,780
Maybe you'll make the load a little lighter on us

1094
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,260
here at Multinational.

1095
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,880
And a winter reminder, citizens,

1096
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,160
carbon monoxide, the silent winter killer,

1097
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:41,420
lurks everywhere.

1098
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,760
So if you have a gas stove, oil burner, or open flame,

1099
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,520
make sure all the doors and windows in the room

1100
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,640
are tightly sealed

1101
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,080
so that none of that nasty carbon monoxide can sneak in.

1102
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:54,920
Thanks and happy holidays.

1103
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:59,080
This is Mr. Abernathy signing off from your town to you.

1104
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:11,840
Scott, you made your choice.

1105
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:15,480
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.

1106
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:18,240
And to your eternal soul,

1107
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,800
you have found that I only could you afford

1108
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,920
to give to God that which was his,

1109
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,120
but you could not afford to do otherwise.

1110
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,640
The Senate still stands.

1111
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,060
And from me,

1112
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:34,240
I will stand.

1113
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:34,240


1114
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:34,240


1115
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,340
In your outer darkness,

1116
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,340
where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.

1117
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:42,860
Sir, please, give me just one more chance, sir.

1118
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,220
I don't want to go to hell, sir.

1119
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,560
Sir, no, no.

1120
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,880
Thank God I don't want to go to hell.

1121
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,100
No!

1122
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,620
And the children say he could laugh and play

1123
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,980
just the same as you and me.

1124
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,400
The talebearer will be at the judgment.

1125
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,500
I suspect that here

1126
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:15,480
will be a special place in hell for such beings.

1127
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:20,520
David the Psalmist said in Psalms 50 and 1 and 3,

1128
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,600
Lord, who may abide in thy tabernacle,

1129
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,560
who may dwell on thy holy mountain,

1130
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,880
the man of blameless life,

1131
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,280
who does that which is right

1132
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,900
and speaks the truth from his heart,

1133
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,340
who has no malice on his tongue,

1134
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,880
who never wrongs a friend and tells no tale

1135
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,120
against his neighbor.

1136
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:40,940
At the judgment,

1137
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,260
there will be those who have lost his tongue

1138
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,240
and have destroyed the lives and reputation of others.

1139
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:49,700
These gossipers will be cast into the lowest, darkest pit of eternity.

1140
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:53,120
They're gonna be cast into the pit.

1141
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:54,520
Mommy?

1142
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,560
Why do my feet hurt so bad, Mommy?

1143
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,160
Um...

1144
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,480
Pastor Naked?

1145
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,360
I mean, Dr. De Brogfran?

1146
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:10,160
If you need to do your public service messages,

1147
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,420
this is a good time to do it.

1148
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:13,940
We can...

1149
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,200
Oh, we got a phone call.

1150
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,160
Yeah.

1151
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,240
Oh.

1152
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,480
No.

1153
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,020
They wanted to know if we could do the...

1154
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,660
mention the curse of Neegi over the air,

1155
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,140
but we're not allowed to mention the name of Neegi.

1156
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,020
No, whatever.

1157
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,500
We really shouldn't talk about Neegi over the air

1158
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,380
because he's a demon.

1159
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,240
You know, for every Bob particle,

1160
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:41,180
there is a Neegi particle,

1161
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,420
and for every Santa Claus particle,

1162
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,560
there's a Bill that comes in the mail.

1163
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,120
No, don't fall for it.

1164
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,740
For wherever you find Bob,

1165
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:51,220
you must also find Neegi.

1166
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,200
It's true.

1167
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,540
There's a dark side to the cult

1168
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,160
and to the Santa Bob.

1169
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,020
You know, friends,

1170
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,200
because if...

1171
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,120
you better watch out,

1172
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,060
you better not cry,

1173
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:05,820
you better not...

1174
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,060
uh...

1175
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,940
You can't hide from Santa Claus.

1176
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,500
You can't hide from Santa Claus,

1177
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:12,280
that's right, friends.

1178
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:13,240
You just better not.

1179
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,860
Whatever you do, don't do it.

1180
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,920
You haven't told them about Jingle Farkin Bells yet.

1181
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:18,580
No.

1182
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,080
Jingle Farkin Bells,

1183
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,600
Jingle Farkin Bells,

1184
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,180
Jingle Jingle Any Day,

1185
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:27,380
Oh, what gosh darned fun it is to ride

1186
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,440
in an old Corvair with a top down

1187
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,160
in the dead of winter.

1188
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:34,620
Oh, that's another lovely Christmas hymn.

1189
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,040
Friends, we do have a serious message

1190
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,220
to impart, aside from the fact that this is

1191
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:43,920
K-N-O-N 90.9 in Dallas, Texas,

1192
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,720
Dallas and Fort Worth,

1193
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,900
and the fact that this is...

1194
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:47,940
Near downtown.

1195
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:48,880
Yeah, near downtown,

1196
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,840
and this is the subgenius hour of Slack,

1197
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,700
radio ministry, prophecy...

1198
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,340
Serving grapevine in Lancaster and Fort Worth.

1199
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,840
Yes, with, uh...

1200
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,420
and we're with the podcast,

1201
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,280
with the potential of getting into all kinds of big trouble.

1202
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,520
I've been loathing it.

1203
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,960
We have to sort of run this,

1204
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,340
this, uh, recording of hell in the background,

1205
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,140
because, you know, on a subgenius show,

1206
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,720
you can't just talk.

1207
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:17,420
You gotta, you gotta have at least 10 or 20 things going on at once.

1208
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:19,340
Well...

1209
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,700
But, friends, we do have to talk seriously about

1210
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,600
the Sternodocs Disaster Relief Fund.

1211
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:27,500
That's right.

1212
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,180
And tonight, uh,

1213
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:31,060
the Reverend Pope Sternodocs,

1214
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:33,540
Pope of all, uh, Little Rock,

1215
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,160
a valued member of the Church of the Subgenius,

1216
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,000
and to those of you who are listening who aren't subgeniuses,

1217
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,060
you don't care.

1218
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,820
And we don't care that you don't care,

1219
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,640
because the rest of us love and value the,

1220
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,060
the, uh, contributions that Sternodoc did.

1221
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:49,640
He was the discoverer of the Jainer device,

1222
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:53,240
and, and, uh, one of the first launchers of the bleeding head,

1223
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,040
and the founder of Doctors for Babel.

1224
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,420
We all got back from the subgenius,

1225
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,100
world tour and atomic devival crusade on the west coast,

1226
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,600
and Sternodoc's house was burned down.

1227
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,720
Now, he had prophesied,

1228
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,600
he used to lie to television interviewers that

1229
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,260
the, the first mega fist temple gog lodge

1230
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:15,340
of the Church of the Subgenius had been firebombed

1231
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,600
by the conspiracy.

1232
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:20,100
He used to, he used to tell that as a lie

1233
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:22,000
to conspiracy interviewers.

1234
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,460
And now, friends, it has happened.

1235
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,140
It's true.

1236
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:26,740
It's in the Book of the Subgenius.

1237
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:26,820
Um,

1238
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:27,700
Transparency.

1239
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:29,200
That's right.

1240
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,360
It was predicted by Bob Dobbs so long ago

1241
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,380
that there would be schismatic division in the church

1242
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:39,720
and firebombings of Pope's homes by other popes.

1243
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:42,580
And, uh, and so we're going to give the,

1244
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,340
the address for the Sternodoc's disaster relief fund,

1245
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,720
but what you need to send them,

1246
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,520
we're swamped with mail and good wishes

1247
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,100
and money from everybody, so, uh,

1248
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:56,720
send whatever weird, horrible things you were going to send them,

1249
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,920
send to the Church of the Subgenius,

1250
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:58,840
send it to Sternodoc,

1251
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,340
send old broken tractor parts,

1252
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:04,140
shattered pieces of someone else's washed up reality,

1253
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,800
non-existent void particles,

1254
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,640
uh, unused fatty deposits from old religious dogma,

1255
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,100
pennies that clog the bottoms of your dresser drawers,

1256
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,320
thigh bone fragments of dead holy men and movie stars,

1257
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:17,240
money,

1258
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:20,620
thyroid extractions from giant South American fruit bats,

1259
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,260
prairie squid, wild or shaved,

1260
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,620
buckets of pills,

1261
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,060
pieces of chopped off,

1262
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,660
one true cross,

1263
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,780
uh, fragments or the Holy Grail,

1264
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,200
the philosopher's st-stone,

1265
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:34,780
miraculous bleeding heads of World Cup golfers,

1266
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,200
uh, old groupie scrapings,

1267
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,860
their laundry that you stole,

1268
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:40,600
blank checks,

1269
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:45,200
evidence of Earth's visitation by entrant astronauts at the dawn of history,

1270
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,760
comfortable clothes or loose women,

1271
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:48,180
and above all, money, friends.

1272
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:48,860
Money.

1273
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:49,960
Money. And send that,

1274
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,700
send that money and all those broken tractor parts

1275
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,040
to the Sternodoc's disaster relief fund,

1276
00:58:56,060 --> 00:59:03,640
at P.O. Box 544 North Little Rock, Arkansas, 72119.

1277
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,460
That's, let me do that again.

1278
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,780
And really send this guy something horrible,

1279
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,340
uh, but nice.

1280
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,300
P.O. Box 5444,

1281
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:16,740
you heard me right, 5444 North Little Rock, Arkansas, 72119.

1282
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:20,460
And we, if you want information from the Church of the Subgenius,

1283
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,980
we might as well throw that in now.

1284
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,920
It's the sacred P.O. Box of Bob,

1285
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,660
P.O. Box.

1286
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:32,740
1-4-0-3-0-6,

1287
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:38,400
Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1288
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,160
Ah, yes.

1289
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,560
But I never said anything about anyone except what was true.

1290
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,760
I only spoke the truth.

1291
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:49,340
That's right, Batman, yeah, now that we're here in California.

1292
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:50,180
From Gotham City, Texas?

1293
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,340
Yeah, Batman.

1294
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:53,180
Far and in?

1295
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,040
Batman, did you care to say anything to the chronic?

1296
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:56,040


1297
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,180
Time-fighting audience out there?

1298
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,200
Just, just don't go to any of these shopping malls,

1299
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,900
there's just too much people ripping everyone off there.

1300
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,200
It's the truth.

1301
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,980
With his deadly call and fatal sling,

1302
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,720
is the only fit emblem of the man or woman

1303
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,740
who stabs and kills the character of another.

1304
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,220
Let your own words condemn you.

1305
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,320
Oh, that's right, Robin is here.

1306
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,660
I'm sorry, Robin always gets left out in these, uh,

1307
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:24,520
oh, they're still playing tapes of Robin's past life.

1308
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:24,880
Yeah.

1309
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:25,620
Yeah.

1310
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:25,980
Hi, girls.

1311
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,560
Linda's such a good friend in spiritual health.

1312
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:30,760
I've been drinking some of this bat beer.

1313
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,640
Well, when you've known as long as I have,

1314
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,500
you'll really get to know her.

1315
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,300
Yeah, uh, hey,

1316
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,060
What do you mean?

1317
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:37,820
stands up.

1318
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:38,900
She's not as concerned about your spiritual life.

1319
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:42,000
I think, uh, this, uh, Bob guy can do anything to help

1320
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,040
the security situation in town here in California.

1321
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:48,020
Well, now, you guys, you guys had claimed that, uh,

1322
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:51,080
supposedly part of the new Batman and Robin security service

1323
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,860
was everything is under control and you're sitting here drinking bat beer.

1324
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:54,860


1325
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,380
Your, your Batmobile has fallen apart.

1326
01:00:58,700 --> 01:00:59,420
We don't have to divulge this to the public.

1327
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:02,880
Hey, man, don't, they'll never clean my cage, Reverend Stans.

1328
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:04,040
Yeah.

1329
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,300
Robert, Robert, come up here.

1330
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,440
Now that Batman and Robin are, if you don't mind, boys,

1331
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:12,080
washed up drunks, they've become subgeniuses as well.

1332
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:15,620
That somehow seems to go hand in hand around this church,

1333
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,900
so-called church.

1334
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,480
Just, just let me have a little more of that frop,

1335
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,360
Reverend Stans, and I'll let you get away with that not batarang you.

1336
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,480
Okay, well.

1337
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:24,380
That's good.

1338
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:28,660
You have in your lifetime destroyed the weak among my flock.

1339
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:30,040
Have you destroyed the weak?

1340
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,760
Oh, it's time for our sign-off music,

1341
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:34,940
because Norm is coming in for his beautiful talk show.

1342
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:35,400
Wait a minute, wait a minute, I got something to say.

1343
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,840
A burglar in the yard wasn't on his guard.

1344
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,720
Through the batarang sucker really slapped him hard.

1345
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,400
Batarang, batarang.

1346
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:43,660
Oh, man.

1347
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,200
Batarang, batarang.

1348
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:47,380
I'm a batarang.

1349
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:50,580
Batarang, batarang.

1350
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,580
Batarang, batarang.

1351
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,800
Batarang, batarang.

1352
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,380
Batarang, batarang.

1353
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,760
Your record will speak for itself.

1354
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:01,780
Batarang, batarang.

1355
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:02,000
Go ahead.

1356
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:02,840
Right.

1357
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,180
It's sign-off time.

1358
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:08,440
Yeah, it's Pastor Buck naked with a square deal business proposition for you.

1359
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,940
Just go there, the Twilight Room, downstairs.

1360
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,280
You know where it is.

1361
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,960
Right at, uh, right downtown Dallas.

1362
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,040
Heck, the Twilight Room, more drunk cowboys.

1363
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,720
My band, Batman's in it.

1364
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,180
Come on down and party with us all night long.

1365
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:26,180
New Year's Eve, more drunk cowboys.

1366
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:28,660
That's Reverend Buck with more drunk cowboys.

1367
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,320
New Year's Eve at the Twilight Room.

1368
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:31,580
Yee-haw!

1369
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,740
Oh, yes.

1370
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,240
Well, look at those needles get handed, friends.

1371
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:40,760
This is the end of the Subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

1372
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:41,260
That's it.

1373
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,040
That's all you get.

1374
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,900
We're coming down on the end here.

1375
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:52,420
So, um, uh, and I would recommend that reading Prescripture 16, 14, 17, 18 of the Book of the Subgenius,

1376
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,160
which you can pick up at Better Bookstores everywhere.

1377
01:02:54,180 --> 01:03:02,500
And, folks, we need blankets and contraceptives for those boys and girls in the home for slackless children,

1378
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,020
like I say on every broadcast.

1379
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:08,560
Your contributions also keep those we hate starving to death.

1380
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:17,820
Uh, so I command you to spill your gift seed pledge of 100 pounds of dollar bills on my lap,

1381
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,040
as this will buy modeling, play, and transformer toys for those poor children in Haiti this Christmas.

1382
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,640
Ah, yes.

1383
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,040
Dobbs will bless you for planting this seed, Faith.

1384
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:33,460
And now the announcer will give our mailing address before Norm comes in to finish the broadcast.

1385
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:45,520
Friends, that's Church of the Subgenius at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1386
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,420
P.O. Box.
