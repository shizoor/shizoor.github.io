1
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,200
From PR News in Washington, I'm convicted of raping a cocktail waitress during PR News.

2
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:36,120
A damaged judge in Santa Maria, California, jumped again last week, a step that officials hope will quell PR News in Washington.

3
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,800
This is PR News.

4
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,620
You're all for sale.

5
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,300
This is PR News.

6
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,280
You're all for sale.

7
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,740
Okay.

8
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:23,600
Okay, boys.

9
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,020
Okay.

10
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,360
Okay.

11
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,920
That's right.

12
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,240
Yeah.

13
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:25,720
Yeah.

14
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,480
Careful now.

15
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,120
That's right.

16
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,180
Ah, there you go.

17
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:28,180


18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,320
you are. Beautiful day. His word is our command. We don't want to interrupt the late show. It's

19
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,320
usually pretty good. Don't tell me you have time to listen. Well, we sometimes tune in when things

20
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:48,540
are quiet. No one can tell when, where, or even how Plan B is operational. Some job that driver's

21
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,460
got, shipping atomic bombs around. It's not a bomb. It's a nuclear device for civil use.

22
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,420
What's the difference?

23
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:29,420
And I believe that I have Bob Dobbs, who is with the New York Transit Authority, with us.

24
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,580
Mr. Dobbs, can you hear me?

25
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,860
And I believe, and I believe Bob Dobbs.

26
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,140
Mr. Dobbs, can you hear me?

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,080
High in the sky, high in the sky.

28
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,700
Mr. Dobbs, I'm afraid I'm losing you, and I thank you very much, very much, very much.

29
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,480
Here's a man with a message.

30
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,340
Sneezing is a crime punishable by death.

31
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,360
Dumbfounding, disifying, diverse data.

32
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,520
And here he is in person, Bob.

33
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,780
A woman said she received a permanent wave free of charge.

34
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,660
Yes, mother.

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,120
Watching the rain.

36
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,300
Watching the rain?

37
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,460
The rain is Mother Nature's tears.

38
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,160
She's crying for all the little children that are dying all over the world.

39
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,500
Let her live in her dream world a while longer.

40
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:07,780
Dumb.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,480
God.

42
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,680
Dumb.

43
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,460
God.

44
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,640
Well, have you seen him?

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,480
Well, I'm sure I don't know.

46
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,280
I'll just let the Lord guide me.

47
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,220
Dumb.

48
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,000
God.

49
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,120
Dumb.

50
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:18,960
God.

51
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,140
Well, have you seen him?

52
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,020
According to Schopenhauer.

53
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,040
Dumb.

54
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,680
God.

55
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,880
Dumb.

56
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,660
God.

57
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,880
Well, have you seen him?

58
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,300
What would the Lord say?

59
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,200
Get up!

60
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,740
Give me liberty!

61
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,740
Oh, give me...

62
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,620
The boy scouts, the campfire girls, scourge of mankind.

63
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,840
What do you mean?

64
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,680
I don't follow you, Doc.

65
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,460
Intellect is invisible to the man who has none.

66
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,500
Well, I...

67
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,720
Don't follow you, Doc.

68
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,980
I'm sane and bored.

69
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,420
That's very interesting, Dr. Gillespie.

70
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,960
And who is Schopenhauer?

71
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,340
No, he went in for happy endings.

72
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,460
I'm bored.

73
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,420
Case of a missing mind.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,380
Murder by experts.

75
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,560
What am I doing in a nut house?

76
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,380
They look at me queer.

77
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,900
This strange-looking character walks into my life.

78
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,520
Good morning, friend.

79
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,560
Did you ever dream?

80
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,500
No, here's Mr. Gillespie.

81
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,900
Mr. Queer's sitting beside me.

82
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,800
Call me Aladdin.

83
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:23,400
Huh?

84
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,880
Hot shake, you.

85
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,060
Aladdin?

86
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,580
Yes.

87
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,380
Would you like to try my magic lamp?

88
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,060
What is it you dream when you dream?

89
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,820
Your heart's desire.

90
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,440
You're dealing strictly with a query.

91
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,880
And there it is.

92
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,740
You know, the highly-boily.

93
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,020
Let me go!

94
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,060
Let me go!

95
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,580
Is this your man, Doc?

96
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:45,960
Yes.

97
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,240
Such a thing shouldn't happen to a dog.

98
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,480
Such a thing shouldn't happen to a dog.

99
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,200
Such a thing shouldn't happen to a dog.

100
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,740
Such a thing shouldn't happen to a dog.

101
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,060
Such a thing shouldn't happen to a dog.

102
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,460
You can call in and fight evil.

103
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,320
UnadulteratedManhood.com

104
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,960
The King of Cool.

105
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,540
The Captain of Happening.

106
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,920
The Sultan of Slack.

107
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,100
I want to get into this whole subgenius slack thing,

108
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,620
It's called the Church of the Subgenius

109
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,900
An anti-cult, but it's some sort of cult

110
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,100
Cult or anti-cult

111
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,100
It's called the Church of the Subgenius

112
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,960
This guy

113
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,780
Called Bob

114
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,980
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

115
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,420
The Sultan of Slack

116
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,860
Slack, I don't know Slack

117
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,780
In the ASOS, so I listened to this Slack

118
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,840
And

119
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,420
They left me no clue as to what

120
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,700
What the fuck it is

121
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,540
Wow, look at her tits

122
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,560
They are enormous

123
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,140
How can they be showing so much tit

124
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,420
Without showing any nipple at all

125
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,440
I don't know man

126
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,460
I'm a little confused

127
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,520
Is it really for weirdos

128
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:02,840
Subgenius

129
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,980
Do they have

130
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,560
Sex

131
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,660
That sounds very culty to me

132
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,180
What is the conspiracy

133
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,340
Okay, what is the Slack

134
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,860
Tell me what the Slack is

135
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,320
The Sultan of Slack

136
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,000
So this is sort of

137
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,460
An anti-consumer

138
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,900
A consumerism

139
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,840
Institution

140
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,180
I don't get it

141
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,820
I've already found the truth

142
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,300
The Sultan of Slack

143
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,280
You're letting your subgenius

144
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,100
Your freak flag fly baby

145
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,020
You have subgenius right there

146
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,320
Wave it, wave it

147
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,580
You scare me, you scare me a little bit

148
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,880
Is there any cult activity

149
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,140
My IQ is under 100

150
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,140
Do you do any of this Slack

151
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,060
Ricky Retardo

152
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,820
The Sultan of Slack

153
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,220
This guy

154
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,140
Called Bob

155
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,420
Bob Dom's

156
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,280
The Sultan of Slack

157
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,540
Wow look at those tits

158
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,080
So anyway friends I'm a preacher of habit

159
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,220
So forgive me if I repeat some of the stuff

160
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,800
That I said yesterday

161
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,880
If any of you were here

162
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,180
But the thing is

163
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,000
The Church of the Subgenius isn't just stupid showbiz

164
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,520
It really is also a religion

165
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,760
And

166
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,040
Like the Bible

167
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,140
I mean look you don't add new stuff

168
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,860
To the Bible

169
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,520
And that's why we do not add new stuff

170
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,600
To Bob's work

171
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,080
Bob talked about Slack

172
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,860
Which none of us have enough of

173
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,280
And he never would say what it was

174
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,580
Because only we individually know what it is

175
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,080
He talked about the conspiracy

176
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,940
Which is everybody you hate

177
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,420
Simple as that

178
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,880
Really you know to get down to it

179
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,540
And the fact that the world ends July 5th 1998

180
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,100
At 7 o'clock in the morning

181
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,680
None of that has changed

182
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,120
Because you just don't

183
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,060
I mean it is a religion

184
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,640
We of course are still expecting

185
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,520
The men from Planet X

186
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,320
To arrive on Planet Earth

187
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,640
On July 5th 1998

188
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,900
It's just that

189
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,200
The conspiracy has obviously been

190
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,040
Manipulating calendars and so forth

191
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,780
For so long

192
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,800
Just to discredit Bob

193
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,740
And make us look stupid

194
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,800
Last 1998

195
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,740
And every succeeding year since then

196
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,980
At 7 o'clock in the morning on July 5th

197
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,420
I actually have stood there

198
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,520
At Brushwood

199
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,820
Every July 5th since 1998

200
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,200
Usually with about

201
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,680
Oh 20 to 30 people around

202
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,900
Waiting to see

203
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,300
How I'm going to handle it

204
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,800
And it's over the years

205
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,520
It has matured and evolved

206
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,080
I think the last time I ended up saying

207
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,480
That all reality was nothing

208
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,700
After the Exists again didn't arrive

209
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,960
And destroy the unbelievers

210
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,820
And lift up the subgeniuses

211
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,980
I went into some

212
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,900
Thing about how

213
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,880
The universe is nothing but a big mechanistic

214
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,800
Chemically driven

215
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,600
Set of

216
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,080
Computations

217
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,060
It's all just

218
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,440
Meaningless

219
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,300
Random evolution in the void

220
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,120
And so forth

221
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,700
I thought it was pretty funny myself

222
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,820
You know you gotta do something

223
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,480
Yes dear friends

224
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,940
A little bit of preaching there

225
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,500
From Winter Star

226
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,200
A symposium

227
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,180
To get more information about Winter Star

228
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,680
At Rosencomet.com

229
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,300
Before that

230
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,100
We heard a

231
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,340
Nor-El-Pref cut up

232
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,820
Of um well

233
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,700
We'll hear more of that show

234
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,720
It's kind of a

235
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,760
You'll see

236
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,600
Nor-El-Pref did I say

237
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,560
Is available at

238
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,660
Heavyconfetti.com

239
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,120
There will be a lot of Nor-El-Pref in this show

240
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,280
There already has been some

241
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,180
He's been doing tons of cut ups

242
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,940
And a Lee-Murr

243
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,220
As well

244
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,420
It's gonna be hard to tell sometimes

245
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,880
Which is Lee-Murr

246
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,700
And which is Nor-El-Pref

247
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,900
And friends also KPFA show

248
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,660
From Berkeley

249
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,140
The Puzzling Evidence show

250
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,580
With Dr. Howell

251
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,000
And in the old days Bob Nelson

252
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,740
And Gary DeBrogfran

253
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,760
And Paul Mavridis

254
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,940
All will be here

255
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,620
Oh Reverend Sudasana

256
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,380
Did one of the collages right after the titles there about the atomic

257
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,780
More Nor-El-Pref

258
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,400
We can have a little fun

259
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
We can have a little fun

260
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,380
Bob what do you think

261
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,940
Who should never be cloned

262
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,980
Good afternoon thank you for taking my call

263
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,120
There was talk recently of extracting DNA from the shroud

264
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,140
In hopes that they could clone

265
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,300
I think this is a good idea

266
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,400
Because if that was done

267
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,720
And was raised

268
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,040
In such a way

269
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,660
He could take over the world

270
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,040
With his mind control

271
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,320
And with his laser beams

272
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,180
That's amazing

273
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,960
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

274
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,720
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

275
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,420
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

276
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

277
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:57,580
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

278
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,060
Teaching from Bob

279
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,540
His practical first hand knowledge

280
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,220
Comes from more than 20 years

281
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,860
Of dealing with many puzzling

282
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,440
And perplexing issues

283
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,260
Whenever Bob takes time out to teach

284
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,620
His listeners hear tough topics

285
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,980
Taught from the heart

286
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,300
Listen to Bob

287
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,120
Bob

288
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,200
And I'd like to like

289
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,180
And I'd like to like

290
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,300
How do you get that

291
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,640
I love him a lot

292
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,260
Nightmare of you of death in the pool

293
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,700
Wakes me up at a quarter to 3

294
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,160
I'm lying on the floor the night before

295
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,680
With a stranger lying next to me

296
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,140
Hey I don't understand it either

297
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:30,660
Try this

298
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,440
Kiss of treachery the aching kiss

299
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,040
Before I feed the stench of love

300
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
For a younger meat

301
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:45,280
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

302
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,980
Stench of love for younger meat?

303
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,080
The younger meat.

304
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,160
You're taking the words out of context.

305
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,460
I represent Big Brother in the sky.

306
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,460
And I believe that God is my savior.

307
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,320
And that I was put on this earth to do his will.

308
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,920
Stench of love for younger meat.

309
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,300
He's got dark lipstick on.

310
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

311
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,960
Provoked nihilism, negativism, and nothingism.

312
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,140
Pelted the police.

313
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,960
You know, just all around being glad.

314
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,400
When he wants to stick a needle in your rear, yet the shot will make you well.

315
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,040
Rude and barbaric.

316
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,000
You're a character.

317
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,640
I'm not sure if I saw you right now if I'd want to turn you over my knee or give you a big hug.

318
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,740
But, but, but, but, um, Bob, I'm sorry for calling you rude.

319
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,220
So, Bob took some of us along to that giant sex toy store in Oklahoma,

320
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,760
intent on buying some naughty birthday apparel for Connie,

321
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,020
but, in usual, he was a little bit more of a sex toy.

322
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,060
In his usual Dobbsian fashion, he started giggling like a demented 12-year-old,

323
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,440
dry-humping the rubber butts, putting butt plugs on his head like devil horns,

324
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,380
and laughing like some mental case,

325
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,740
running around the place with crotchless panties over his suit,

326
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,580
spitting pasties at everyone,

327
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,120
and he finally drank half a bottle of Hotzi McGonigal's lavender love lube

328
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,900
and shot the rest on the floor behind him like James Bond's old Aston Martin,

329
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,480
making the staff who were chasing him slide all over the place.

330
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,120
But as we made our getaway,

331
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,540
he gave us all zebra pattern vibrators.

332
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,020
So it turned out okay,

333
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,280
or at least as okay as it gets when Bob is at the wheel.

334
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,140
My God!

345
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,460
a

346
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,720
a barOR

347
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,900
oh

348
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,160
uh I doesn't have one D

349
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,900
to do. Shake hands with my deputy, Barney Five.

350
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,480
Honey? Uh, Barney,

351
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,040
this is kind of Bob's case,

352
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,780
wouldn't you say, seeing as how he predicted

353
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,040
it and all. I think it'd be right

354
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,200
if he was the one that handled it.

355
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,680
Take care of it right away, Sheriff. Right, Bob.

356
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,700
Well, we'll see you, Bob.

357
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,360
Excuse me.

358
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,280
Bob, come on in. Look who it is, Andy.

359
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,060
I know it's Bob. Evening, Sheriff.

360
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,020
Good evening.

361
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,660
Again?

362
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,480
Come on and sit down, Bob.

363
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,380
Thank you, Ellie. What a hypochondriac.

364
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,880
But luteus maximus.

365
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,900
You have a wonderful sense of humor, Bob.

366
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,060
Yeah, boy.

367
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,880
Did anyone mention the Saturday night social to you, Bob?

368
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,400
Outstanding.

369
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,040
Oh, oh, um, divine.

370
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,260
Right, maybe I better leave.

371
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,020
Yes, I guess you could say that.

372
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,660
Bob's fiancé is arriving next week.

373
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,580
That's right.

374
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,240
Yeah, yeah.

375
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:09,780
Hiya, Bob.

376
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,220
Find anything, Bob?

377
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,320
Report on the arrival of strangers from outer space.

378
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,180
They were tense young men.

379
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,940
Yeah, and an odd one, too.

380
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,940
More than odd, Bob. Odd Bob, odd Bob.

381
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,480
A man who thinks for himself.

382
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,360
Beat. Beat it.

383
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,680
Beat me, Daddy.

384
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,440
That was a big kick.

385
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,240
That was a big...

386
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,380
Beat. Beat it.

387
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,700
Beat me, Daddy.

388
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,400
That was a big kick.

389
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,180
That was a big...

390
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,140
Come join the fun!

391
00:16:47,440 --> 00:17:06,480
That was a big kick.

392
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,180
That was a big...

393
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,640
Kicked withuk.

394
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,580
Beat me, daddy.

395
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:22,760
From PR News in Washington, I'm conscious and subordinate and infected and pessimistic and chicken and reserved and stable and attached to a respirator and open to the public and willing to work with PR News in Washington.

396
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,460
WCSB going on the air.

397
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,460
Probably, you know.

398
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,460
I'm afraid of those boxes that kind of fly in circles into your brain.

399
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,000
That's my main concern.

400
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,740
And you notice while you're staring at one of those, you lose all peripheral vision.

401
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,220
That's because the photon gun is pointed at your cerebral cortex, baby.

402
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,020
Really?

403
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,480
Yeah.

404
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,760
I mean, doesn't the term cathode ray tube sound ominous?

405
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,640
Hell yeah.

406
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,740
And that sounds dangerous.

407
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,400
It sounds like a cathode ray tube.

408
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,400
That just sounds like a weapon on a flying saucer.

409
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,960
Maybe it was a cathode ray.

410
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,200
Well, at one time it was.

411
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,800
That was one of the things the UFO people gave us.

412
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,880
In return for a certain number of experiments, subjects, and slaves.

413
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,440
We had to study fire and ice, though, as our philosophical values, as our nurturing system for our minds.

414
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,000
So does that mean that LCD screens are safe?

415
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,180
Hell no.

416
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,960
They have a photon gun.

417
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,640
They have gel.

418
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,760
You know how dangerous that is to your brain?

419
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,540
Yeah.

420
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,080
I find that I get a better buzz off of microwaves.

421
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,980
Or if you're at one of those.

422
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,660
Those microwave transboundary towers for radio stations.

423
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,220
Yeah.

424
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:39,940
Or cell towers.

425
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:40,860
Yeah.

426
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:49,800
Those are, I mean, if you camp out at the base of one of those, you can pick up a pretty good burn.

427
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,420
You don't even need to build a campfire, either.

428
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,760
I've heard that.

429
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,400
You can have my microwave set at crotch level.

430
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:03,640
When it's real cold, you can take Capri Sun things and tape them to your body and go up to that old microwave for about 20 seconds.

431
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,860
And walk.

432
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,240
And walk away warm for a long time.

433
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:07,900
That's weird.

434
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,200
But you're only warm on the inside.

435
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,360
You're on the outside.

436
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,100
Yeah, of course.

437
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,220
You don't read enough Whitman.

438
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,340
And there you are walking around in a vacuum-gem suit.

439
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,580
You know?

440
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,260
That's, you know, we're crippled.

441
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,800
We're emotionally and mentally and artistically crippled in this society.

442
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,420
Yeah.

443
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,080
And I don't think anyone's going to disagree with you there.

444
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,720
I feel pretty crippled myself, you know?

445
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,720
I mean, gosh, you know, when I was little, I wanted to write books.

446
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,860
And whatnot.

447
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,760
And where am I now?

448
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,440
I'm doing this show.

449
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,180
And other stuff.

450
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,740
Which just gives away that you've given up on it.

451
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,540
You know?

452
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,980
Instead, I'm doing this.

453
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,660
Man, this is like the death of creativity, what I'm doing here.

454
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,800
I play other people's music.

455
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,480
And other people call in and give me their thoughts.

456
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:58,400
And that's, you know, it appears on the surface to be some kind of creative endeavor.

457
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,400
But in fact, it's the opposite.

458
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,460
You appear like you're going to be some sort of star.

459
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,920
And basically, you're just an emcee for a bunch of jazz.

460
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,200
You're going to be the jack-offs.

461
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:05,720
Correct.

462
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:12,320
Well, but hey, then I take the recordings from it and remix it into my show,

463
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:18,240
making it even yet another step removed on that ladder of vampirism.

464
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,500
And who even knows whose blood's being sucked by the time it gets done?

465
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,140
Right.

466
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,460
The people that cut up Stang, they cut up Stang's cut-ups.

467
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,800
Ah, something bit me.

468
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,680
Oh, there it went.

469
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,520
You hear like three words, you know?

470
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,620
Three errant words about sociopaths running.

471
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:34,820
Oh.

472
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,160
You know, and then some errant words about Martians stealing our brains.

473
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,220
And you don't know who is who, and you don't care.

474
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,120
I'm pretty sure my brain's still there.

475
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,600
And that's all that matters when it comes down to it.

476
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,800
Yeah, but doesn't mean that Martians don't control it.

477
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,260
I've still got my half of the brain cell.

478
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,420
What?

479
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,380
I've still got my half of the brain cell, and Princess Wee has the other half.

480
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,040
Hey, you know, between the two halves, you can rub the two halves.

481
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,840
Hello, Princess Wee.

482
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,560
It's collateral.

483
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,260
You can rub the two halves together to generate heat.

484
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,840
You know, that's why, like, if you only have one brain cell,

485
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,240
you're better off cutting it in half.

486
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,300
So at least you can rub them together.

487
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,520
There's always refrigeration.

488
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,600
We have to rub ours a lot.

489
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,240
Well, you know, that's kind of fun.

490
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:14,900
I mean, I don't know.

491
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,840
That's none of our business, you know, how you rub your brain cells together.

492
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,220
I don't...

493
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,240
Feel the friction of your minds breathing together.

494
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,820
I think that's a private matter.

495
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:34,520
Princess Wee is using her half of the brain cell to label hour of slack CDs that get mailed out to the sister and brother stations.

496
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,720
And the Martian stations.

497
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,720
Well, that gives off an ozone smell that the pharmaceutical companies can use.

498
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,060
They can tell it's going to be a good show when it's labeled by her.

499
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:51,200
And they know it's going to be a bad, rushed, hurried piece of crap if it's got my labeling on it.

500
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,420
They put it in a bottle and strap it onto the urine sample, and there you go.

501
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:54,980
Right.

502
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,400
They walk into the radio station and say, here's another hour of sample.

503
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,700
What kind of child did it?

504
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,920
Now, if she labels them, you don't even have to listen to them.

505
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,080
You can just look at them.

506
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:06,980
Next time on向emaster.com

507
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,220
A synesthesia radio show there from WCSB in Cleveland.

508
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,280
It's on at 10 o'clock Sunday nights.

509
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,500
Follows the hour of slack on WCSB.org.

510
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:27,400
With Dr. Sinister and this-time callers LonesomeCowboyDave, Governor Rocknar, Sloth and yours truly.

511
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,800
Before that, Lee Merrs...PR News.

512
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:34,420
Before that, Norel Kreps...BeatMeDaddy and a bunch of collages.

513
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,340
by Norel Pref and collages by Lee Murr.

514
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,060
That song, Program, was by Stylex.

515
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,300
More from them at stylexohio.com.

516
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,920
The rant before that about the Dobbs sex trip

517
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,520
was hell-po-pooey.

518
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,100
And, of course, tons of Norel Pref was in there

519
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,160
and now follows.

520
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,220
Free markets, what does that mean?

521
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,420
Everything is commercialized.

522
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,480
Free markets, what does that mean?

523
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,400
We annihilate our enemies.

524
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,080
Free markets, what does that mean?

525
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,920
Con the serfs back into serfdom.

526
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,340
Free markets, what does that mean?

527
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,240
Corporate welfare.

528
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,980
Free markets, what does that mean?

529
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,220
In other words, the formula that has enabled them

530
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:24,480
to a certain extent,

531
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,080
the formula they're relying on won't change.

532
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,380
Free markets, what does that mean?

533
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,020
Corporate money.

534
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,380
We have, to date, never seen such cheating.

535
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,460
Free markets, what does that mean?

536
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,660
Money for power, power for money.

537
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,200
Free markets, what does that mean?

538
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,620
Cops and robbers. This is about the abuse of power.

539
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,960
Free markets, what does that mean?

540
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,080
Debt, debt, debt, debt.

541
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,780
Two to five trillion dollar deficit.

542
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,260
Good effort.

543
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,440
Yes, it's the Good Effort Show, where we recognize those citizens

544
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,120
who show good effort and citizenship.

545
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,680
Our first good effort is little Bobby Brundage

546
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,240
who was trod on by a cart horse while watching the Budweiser Clydesdale

547
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,200
smash in the Thanksgiving Day Parade.

548
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,080
Good effort, Bobby.

549
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,540
And here's Bobby's body being shown on display.

550
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,060
Oh, disgusting, isn't it?

551
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,340
Well, we'll wipe that away and show you the next Good Effort winner.

552
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,900
Yes, and our second award today goes to little Norman Darnini

553
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,020
who made the attempt at being a high school athlete

554
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,040
and ended up, well, in a funny little chair.

555
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:16,440
Well, she's thinner-sized.

556
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,920
But he can go anywhere.

557
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,740
That's not a pleasant sight.

558
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,920
Good effort, Norman.

559
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,940
Good effort, Norman. Thanks a lot for the slide.

560
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,460
Okay, here's our third winner.

561
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,660
And our final good effort is Palmer from Reader's.

562
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,920
Yes, Palmer attempted to couple with another human being

563
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,980
of an opposite species.

564
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,040
Armageddon!

565
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,380
But they let Strange and Jeremy

566
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,380


567
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,380


568
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,980
Never.

569
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,800
Or the same Chelsea.

570
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:44,820
Sure.

571
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,540
Stop it.

572
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,460
It's Siebel- decorations.

573
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:56,440
Yes.

574
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:02,460
Why don't you ask me?

575
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:02,460


576
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,420
with women all across this country.

577
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,840
Practice their love

578
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,220
with women all across this country.

579
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,160
You're free, and freedom is beautiful.

580
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,440
And, you know, it'll take time

581
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,780
to restore chaos and order,

582
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,820
but we will.

583
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,340
Practice their love

584
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,700
with practice their love

585
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,060
with practice their love

586
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,220
with their love

587
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,140
with their love

588
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,940
with their love.

589
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,240
Oh, freedom.

590
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,820
Oh, freedom.

591
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,200
Oh, freedom over me.

592
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,780
And before I'd be a slave,

593
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,400
I'd be buried in my grave

594
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,860
and go home to my Lord

595
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,380
and be free.

596
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,860
Armageddon!

597
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,100
Armageddon!

598
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,040
Armageddon!

599
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,500
Armageddon!

600
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,700
Armageddon!

601
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,880
Armageddon!

602
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,080
Armageddon!

603
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,100


604
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,280
Armageddon!

605
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,660
Armageddon!

606
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:20,940
Armageddon!

607
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,660
When knights were bold but still smelled like dookie,

608
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,680
I was a minor slovenly duke in Crap Shire Province

609
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,540
and a heller in pink tights,

610
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,760
despite my reputation for a sharp tongue,

611
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,720
a quick fart,

612
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,380
and a half-concealed dirk.

613
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,020
I once slugged it out in chain mail and swords

614
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,280
with a great bladder brain mine own size,

615
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,720
cursing right demonic over a wench

616
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,120
of dubious regard but great passion.

617
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,140
After a time, we stopped to catch our breaths,

618
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,420
and I ruined the crowd of giddy onlookers

619
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,900
with my sudden burst of enlightenment,

620
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,220
loudly braying,

621
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,640
Good sirrah, doth this not be Dame Not-That-Goodie,

622
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,520
who hath been recounted as banging the good men of the pub,

623
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,060
the king's guard entire, four milk goats,

624
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,700
a raw head, and a portly chum,

625
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,440
and a tinaman as well?

626
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,600
Uh, aye?

627
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,560
Then why dost we fight?

628
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,600
She be a wagon full of the pox,

629
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,960
and just waiting to attack our manly parts.

630
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,820
Let us spit on her doorway,

631
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,760
fight no more,

632
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,000
and have an ale on me.

633
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,940
And although I later learned that he had befouled a visiting cabin boy

634
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,900
whose legs were too bandied from sea life

635
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,620
to escape him as the local stable sweepers did,

636
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,060
we were stout friends from that day forward.

637
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,200
Yes, t'was a great fall fest.

638
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,740
I'm a dauber,

639
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,760
you're a dauber,

640
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,660
she's a dauber,

641
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,680
we're a dauber,

642
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,700
wouldn't you like to be a dauber too?

643
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,960
You're a dauber,

644
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,680
be a ba-dauber,

645
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,280
I'm a dauber,

646
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,100
be a bop-dauber,

647
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,780
we're a bauber,

648
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,720
be a ba-dauber,

649
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,320
I'm a dauber,

650
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,120
be a bop-dauber.

651
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,220
Yeah, you're, I think because of that song,

652
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:50,780
you're a pooter.

653
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,320
It's enough to make me feel squeamish with inclinations

654
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,400
to squander my

655
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,120
peakness and sudden spurts of

656
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,440
slings.

657
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,940
And I think it's time to

658
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,840
which we hereby testify in the name of J.R. Bob Dogg.

659
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,000
Oh my God.

660
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,280
What's the hollow pill?

661
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,300
Just blew the top of his head right off.

662
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,600
Hi.

663
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,460
How you doing?

664
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,120
Great.

665
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,720
How you doing?

666
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,100
Great.

667
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:19,940
How you doing?

668
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,600
Great.

669
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,600
Today we're going to be talking about...

670
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,260
How you doing?

671
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:23,960
Great.

672
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,160
I think it's kind of funny.

673
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,680
Lick, lick, lick, lick profitability.

674
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,380
Joint, joint, joint, joint.

675
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,040
Absolutely.

676
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,100
Setting targets.

677
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:30,680
Targets.

678
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,020
We can deconstruct.

679
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,140
That process is entirely disconnected.

680
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,200
Shoot first and ask questions later.

681
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,040
The status quo is this.

682
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,100
Customer migration.

683
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,620
People don't think product is wrong.

684
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,340
Then we can start thinking about

685
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,320
we never really have a dialogue.

686
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,160
These folks speak different languages.

687
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,200
How you doing?

688
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:48,840
Great.

689
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,400
English.

690
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,420
Pig dogs.

691
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,700
All right.

692
00:28:59,700 --> 00:28:59,700


693
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,120
Sing.

694
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,920
English.

695
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:03,700
Pig dogs.

696
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,840
Tar clients get excited after oneажу day.

697
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,140
Very funny.

698
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,880
And now a

699
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,800
reminder about

700
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,100
기자sheliyorius.de

701
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,100


702
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,100


703
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:28,960
the

704
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:34,280
If you have taken the advice we've been giving you recently, it will not give you much protection.

705
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,380
So, waste time. Start now.

706
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,540
A good place is a cupboard under the stairs. Start now.

707
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,100
Start right away making your family as safe as possible like this.

708
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,860
First, cover them with boards or doors or dense materials if possible.

709
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,940
To help you, we will remind you once again about dense containers of earth or sand.

710
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:03,300
Stop them slipping down the wall by nailing containers of dense sand to the floor like this.

711
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,220
Like this.

712
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,800
Well, looks like next week is questionable.

713
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,560
Week after that, though, is looking very pretty.

714
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,460
Things are getting sicker for the launch.

715
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:15,880
Worse and worse.

716
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,840
You know, there is another shuttle launch due.

717
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,940
And there's a hairline crack in the discovery they just discovered.

718
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,760
Well, why do we have people with physical deformities?

719
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,040
Running our airplanes anyway.

720
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,960
Can't we, you know, get the best of the cream of the, you know, what do they call those guys?

721
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,760
And put asparagus in there.

722
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,960
The creme de la creme.

723
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,140
You know, how can they work in that?

724
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,320
Okay, we're going to let somebody fly a plane who's got a hairlip?

725
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,260
Come on.

726
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:50,080
Now, during the air traffic controller strike, Dave, you were an air traffic controller briefly, right?

727
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,800
Because you'd had radio experience.

728
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,560
I know. I just had severe radiation therapy of the brain tumor.

729
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,640
But I could pick up.

730
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:57,820
I could pick up stations.

731
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,040
And so they thought, you know, I could probably work in traffic control.

732
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,760
That's the scariest thing I can imagine.

733
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,780
You worked in there for like a week and a half, didn't you?

734
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,980
I lasted a full week.

735
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,980
Well, it was ten days.

736
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,120
It was longer than most of the professionals last.

737
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:09,720
Yeah.

738
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,900
And he had fewer accidents than the triant guys.

739
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,240
Yeah.

740
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,480
But they never once sampled my urine.

741
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,880
And it is delicious.

742
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,620
No, they found that we were trying to put the humans in the space.

743
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,680
I think we should just take monkeys and put them back in space.

744
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,580
Air traffic controllers.

745
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,160
And urine samplers.

746
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,940
I've always wanted to, you know, like wine samplers got it easy.

747
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,160
I want to go for something that there's a little bit of a challenge.

748
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,720
Metamorphosis occurs.

749
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,720
What do we mean by metamorphosis?

750
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,700
Metamorphosis occurs.

751
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,420
What do we mean?

752
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,640
Don't make me angry.

753
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,920
You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.

754
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,360
Metamorphosis.

755
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,260
Metamorphosis.

756
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:54,880
Doctor.

757
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,580
Physician.

758
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,340
Scientist.

759
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,120
Embryo.

760
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,100
All humans have.

761
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,220
Radiation.

762
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,180
What do we mean?

763
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:00,960
Overdose.

764
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,920
What do we mean?

765
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:02,740
Overdose.

766
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,280
Overdose.

767
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,800
Overdose.

768
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,740
What do we mean?

769
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,560
The creature is driven by rage.

770
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:08,680
Metamorphosis.

771
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,820
The world is dead.

772
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:18,560
Anyway, friends, I don't, um, I actually, I sometimes wonder why I keep being invited to these.

773
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,280
Well, I wasn't invited to this one.

774
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,800
They had a, somebody else crapped out, so I ended up, but I don't.

775
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,860
I don't believe in very much.

776
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:33,860
I, uh, like many people, uh, did get really deep into, like, studying the paranormal and

777
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:36,220
different religions and philosophies and so forth.

778
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,600
And then I returned to my childhood religion, which I had rejected for so long, which was

779
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,520
science fiction and monster movies.

780
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,000
And I'm back onto that.

781
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,800
But I, I, not only do I not believe in much, I don't disbelieve in much either.

782
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,320
Uh, because I've been surprised too many times.

783
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,060
The one thing I do disbelieve in is atheism.

784
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,500
I don't believe in atheism.

785
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,920
Because I consider them to be fanatics.

786
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,640
They're so sure.

787
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,320
They know.

788
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:08,780
They know.

789
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,720
Oh, well, well, might as well be, I mean, really, that's, that's just nuts.

790
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:21,920
We don't know, you know, to a fish, to a fish in a fish bowl, I mean, you might feed that fish every day.

791
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,380
But it doesn't know who you are.

792
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,300
To the fish, you're not.

793
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:26,300


794
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,740
You're a cloud that flies by and drops mana into the waters.

795
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,660
And, you know, you're just this, it doesn't know that you're you.

796
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,700
It doesn't know you're, that it's in a fish bowl.

797
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,640
Whose fish bowl are we in?

798
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:45,840
You know, when Beavis and Butthead are mocking MTV and we're mocking Beavis and Butthead mocking MTV,

799
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,500
who's mocking us mocking Beavis and Butthead mocking MTV, huh?

800
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,460
Let's, uh, let's hope it's Bob.

801
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,320
Because he's got a sense of humor.

802
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,520
I'm from the church of Bob's scientists, my friend.

803
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,100
We're, well, Bob hobbyist laymen.

804
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,440
But Bob crackpot.

805
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,240
Church of Bob comma crackpot.

806
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,200
That's where I'm from.

807
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,980
And, uh, so we, you know, we're into science.

808
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:11,120
But it's, of course, the forbidden sciences, you know.

809
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:16,100
We prefer the contradictions that make sense to us.

810
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,580
From PR News in Washington, I'm Washington Peters tomorrow.

811
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,760
John Paul II has received death threats.

812
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,980
Did not take part in the Easter PR News at St. Washington.

813
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:41,180
You see, sometimes you'll watch those alien movies and the aliens, the creatures from another world will look hideous.

814
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,540
And yet they're the ones you sympathize with.

815
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,620
Why is that?

816
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,440
It's because you, the subgenius, are a Martian.

817
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,760
You are not of this earth.

818
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,200
You are not of this planet.

819
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,880
Now, some places on this planet,

820
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,520
Bug Ball Mars,

821
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,160
seem more right than others.

822
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,320
You just feel more comfortable, more at home.

823
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:10,180
Isn't that the case?

824
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:20,780
Well, it's because those places are that much more like the planet that you're supposed to be on.

825
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:33,780
It's like if you take a mountain and you cut it in half and you see the strata of the different time zones

826
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,860
and the different light years that are inside the mountain's consciousness.

827
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,240
If you open your third face and perceive that to be true,

828
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:52,600
then it's not a far leap at all to understand that some places on this planet

829
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,100
are more Martian than others.

830
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:02,460
Maybe for you, it's the forest.

831
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,480
Maybe for another person, it's the city.

832
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,380
There's no contradiction there.

833
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,980
It depends on how much Martian blood flows in your veins.

834
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:19,740
Yes, the Yeti of ancient history.

835
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,260
The Yetis that founded the United States of America.

836
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,160
And who, on whose dung droppings,

837
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,420
bloomed the flowers of Tibet.

838
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,400
Those self-sane Yetis come not of this world,

839
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,600
but from Mars.

840
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,960
The real Mars, not this fake Mars.

841
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,980
People for centuries have been talking about how the Earth is hollow.

842
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,900
But we've dug and dug and dug.

843
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,180
There's lots of dugs in this church,

844
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,060
and they've all confirmed that this planet that we're on is not hollow.

845
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,560
You can dig all you want, Doug, and it's not going to change things.

846
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,940
But that's because this planet is not hollow.

847
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,480
This planet isn't Earth.

848
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,780
This planet is Mars.

849
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,280
And if you go to the real Earth,

850
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,740
just go to the North Pole,

851
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,880
and Santa will show you

852
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,220
where the entrance is

853
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,680
that the Nazi supersonic hell creatures come out of.

854
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,460
Santa Claus conquers the Martians.

855
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,320
How can that be?

856
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,860
How can Santa have the power to conquer the Martians

857
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,920
when he doesn't live on the fourth planet?

858
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,160
Unless he does,

859
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:49,660
and that's how he delivers presents every year

860
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,540
to all the good subgeniuses on this planet,

861
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,900
which is Mars.

862
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,820
To the Earth.

863
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,640
To the Earth.

864
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,620
From PR News in Washington,

865
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,980
I'm using the Internet to access child PR.

866
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:13,280
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals grew at a rate of 3.8%

867
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:13,920
after the election.

868
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,740
After Saddam Hussein's feeding tube was removed from Cedar Rapids, Iowa today,

869
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:22,520
President Bush wants more than 17,000 nuclear feeding tubes in Washington.

870
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,140
The existence of the Bush administration was a secret until three years ago.

871
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,160
The U.N. Human Rights Commission hopes this is war.

872
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,720
On Wall Street 6, 1055, 131779.

873
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,800
This is PR's PR News.

874
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,440
My friends,

875
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,860
I want to speak to you today about the glory of Bob.

876
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,280
But many out here are afraid of Bob.

877
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,880
Many think Bob is helping the conspiracy.

878
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,960
Many think Bob wants to steal your slack.

879
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
These so-called subgenius,

880
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,080
I think the reason Bob has such an unlimited supply of slack

881
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,900
is because he's unknowingly taken it.

882
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,440
He's taken it away from the subgenius.

883
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,880
Well, my friend,

884
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,360
let's find out.

885
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,900
The Church of the Subgenius said,

886
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,160
Bob is fill in the blank.

887
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,860
Thus Bob is a conspiracy,

888
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,880
for Bob is a con man.

889
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,480
You don't think his wife's name is Connie for nothing, do you?

890
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,660
Bob is slack, my friend.

891
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,200
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

892
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,200
That's right.

893
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,300
Bob is slack and the con.

894
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,200
Bob is what you think he is

895
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,100
and you'll pay to know what you really think, won't you?

896
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,120
If you fear Bob,

897
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,760
then you will see.

898
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,960
Bob is the ultimate con man.

899
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,580
You will see Bob is a mastermind of the conspiracy.

900
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:11,380
Yes, Bob has his hand in the pockets of the conspiracy so deep,

901
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,720
they don't even remember when those hands got there.

902
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,440
Bob runs a conspiracy when he wants to

903
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,560
and that means he runs you too, my friend.

904
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,380
However, if you love Bob,

905
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:33,140
then you know that Bob is talking back slack directly from the conspiracy

906
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,120
to give it to deservants of geni.

907
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,780
Note, I said deserving.

908
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,540
Do you deserve Bob's lovin' slack?

909
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,780
Well, you've got to pay your dues.

910
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,260
Send $30 to the Subgenius Foundation, Inc.

911
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,240
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118

912
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,980
And find the Bob within you

913
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,960
before you can know that Bob loves you.

914
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,760
You can find Bob within you.

915
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,920
You are Bob.

916
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,560
That's right, we are all one with Bob, my friend.

917
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,960
The family of the subgenius is a very mixed bag.

918
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,260
But Bob is a selfish guy and Bob loves himself.

919
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:31,120
Bob gives himself to the newest, hippest, most pure slack.

920
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,940
That can be yours.

921
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,240
Do you want unlimited slack?

922
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,720
Now I know a lot of this may sound cliché,

923
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,020
but let me tell you, Bob is fill in the blank.

924
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,320
So what do you want?

925
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:56,200
Do you want to love Bob or do you want to fear him?

926
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:03,320
As long as you're afraid of Bob, then by dives he'll steal your slack

927
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,400
and give it to the conspiracy.

928
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,540
He'll take you for everything you've got

929
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:12,860
and leave you shuddering, a quivering husk.

930
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,200
Bob is the monster under the bed.

931
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:21,000
Bob is the dark forces inside your head.

932
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:26,780
Bob is the three-headed monster with eight limbs, one eyeball,

933
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:31,100
and a huge devouring mouth ready to eat you whole.

934
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:37,500
Until you see Bob in all his hideousness and accept him for what he is,

935
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:43,160
then and only then will Bob reveal the secrets of the church.

936
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,020
This is Subgnosis, my friends.

937
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,500
The knowledge of under things.

938
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:57,500
This is the revelation of Bob.

939
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,700
Look in the mirror.

940
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,320
Praise Bob.

941
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,660
Revelation of Bob, dear friends.

942
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,160
That was preaching by Reverend Paul Frederick

943
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,760
and music by E. Misenmeier.

944
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,820
Who is in the background?

945
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:29,560
Misenmeier's band Asmodeus is in the background of this

946
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:35,540
and you can get more information about that from LatexRecords.com.

947
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:41,840
Before that, we heard Leemur's PR news and Dr. Onan Kenobite on the road.

948
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,800
A little preaching from Winterstar.

949
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,780
Metamorphosis by Noor Elpref.

950
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,800
Before that, some radio synesthesia.

951
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:56,580
A whole bunch of Leemur and KPFA, old-timey show with callers and puzzling evidence and so forth.

952
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,100
And the Knights of Old Thing was by Helpo Pui.

953
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,520
And now, a little bit by Reverend Shane Steele.

954
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,300
And then, Smurker followed by Noor El.

955
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,880
And then, more Shane Smurker.

956
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,660
And then, the Detroit Revival.

957
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,840
And then, some Leemur.

958
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,400
And now for Shane Smurker.

959
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:24,020
When you say Bob, you've said a lot of things nobody else can say.

960
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:31,840
When you say Bob, you've gone as far as you can go to get the very best.

961
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,640
When you say Bob,

962
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:38,080
you've said the word that means he'd like to do it all.

963
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:43,660
When you say Bob, it means you want the number one.

964
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:49,780
When you say Bob, you tell the world you know what makes it all the way.

965
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,680
When you say Bob, you say you care enough to only want the kings.

966
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:01,120
There is no other one. There's only something less.

967
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,200
Because the king of-

968
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,040
Is leading all the rest, when you say Bob.

969
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,160
You've said it all.

970
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,080
Subject, this evening.

971
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,460
Subject, this evening.

972
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,560
So we see-

973
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,280
The Delta of Fornication.

974
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,200
First John, Filthy.

975
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,180
All the way down, that's where he's hanging over there.

976
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,100
he was wearing a robe, so I hid purple.

977
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,920
Speaking lies and hypocrisy.

978
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,060
That's what'll come across the television screen.

979
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:41,600
Verse one.

980
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,080
I've seen the Lord.

981
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,020
I can tell you how he was dressed.

982
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,620
I've seen the Lord.

983
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,520
I can tell you how he was dressed.

984
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,620
I can tell you how he was dressed.

985
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,340
I cannot dig.

986
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,780
What am I gonna do with my life?

987
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,840
I cannot dig.

988
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,280
What am I gonna do with my life?

989
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,860
I wanted some of those cookies,

990
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,220
and she gave me one cookie,

991
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,100
and I wasn't satisfied with one cookie.

992
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,640
And I wanted some of those cookies,

993
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,980
and she gave me one cookie,

994
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,780
and I wasn't satisfied with one cookie.

995
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,340
Adultery, fornication, or adultery, or fornication,

996
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:15,260
or adultery, or fornication, or adultery, or fornication.

997
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,340
And the children of Israel took all the women

998
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,420
of Midian captives and their little ones,

999
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,440
and they took the spoil of all their cattle

1000
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,220
and all their flocks and all their goods.

1001
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,080
And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt

1002
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,200
and all their goodly castles with fire.

1003
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,760
And they took all the spoil

1004
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,700
and all the prey both of men and of beasts.

1005
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,000
And they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil

1006
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,060
unto Moses and Eliezer the priest,

1007
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,340
and unto the congregation of the children of Israel,

1008
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,480
unto the camp at the plains of Moab,

1009
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,460
which are by Jordan near Jericho.

1010
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,880
And Moses said unto them,

1011
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,580
Have ye saved all the women alive?

1012
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,860
Behold, these caused the children of Israel

1013
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,120
through the counsel of Balaam to commit trespass

1014
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,680
against the Lord in the matter of Peor.

1015
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,220
And there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord.

1016
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,620
Now therefore, kill every male

1017
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,480
among the little ones,

1018
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:04,580
and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.

1019
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,480
But all the women children that have not known a man

1020
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,480
by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.

1021
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,520
And do ye abide without the camp seven days.

1022
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,600
Whosoever hath killed any person,

1023
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,400
and whosoever hath touched any slain,

1024
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,660
purify both yourselves and your captives

1025
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,700
on the third day and on the seventh day.

1026
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:24,240
And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins,

1027
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,680
and all work of goat's hair, and all things made of wood.

1028
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,580
From PR News in Washington, I'm Classified.

1029
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,200
But flawed.

1030
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,600
The Supreme Court has again rejected a brain-damaged PR News.

1031
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:39,180
Connecticut's House of Representatives has rejected an attempt to abolish the state's

1032
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,920
PR News penalty in Washington.

1033
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,140
And I haven't slept in five days.

1034
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,500
Do you notice I look fairly energetic, don't I?

1035
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,340
I may not be making any sense, but I've shown.

1036
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,880
Actually, believe it or not, I have slept.

1037
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,820
Yes, I do.

1038
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,360
There was a time I've been preaching slack for 25 years.

1039
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,660
For 20 of those years, I was preaching slack.

1040
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,640
Because I was asking for slack.

1041
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,260
I was trying to get slack.

1042
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,720
Five years ago, something finally sunk in.

1043
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,140
Slack is not something you go out and get.

1044
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,980
Slack is something you already have.

1045
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:19,540
You just have to recognize it.

1046
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:25,840
And not me, not Bob, not your boss, not your school teacher,

1047
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,520
your mom and dad, not your kids.

1048
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,040
None of them can tell you what slack is.

1049
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:39,440
Those magazine ads, those Playboy magazines, your drugs, all that fun stuff, will not tell

1050
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,840
you what slack is for you.

1051
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,220
You'll know it when you get it.

1052
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:48,040
Or, or you'll know it when you lose it.

1053
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,020
That's the sad thing.

1054
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:57,580
So many have slack until they, and then when they lose it, that's the first time they ever

1055
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:58,540
recognize it.

1056
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:05,140
They suddenly go, God damn, I've been griping and wimping, whining all this, all these years,

1057
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,640
because I didn't have slack.

1058
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:10,480
The whole time I had it, I had it and it was right in front of me.

1059
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,840
Until that thing happened.

1060
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,360
That bad luck.

1061
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,400
Or that mistake.

1062
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:22,960
For further information about Slack and how you can protect yourself against it, consult

1063
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,680
your local Self Genius.

1064
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,760
Slack is contagious.

1065
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:28,520
You can find it on the web.

1066
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:28,520


1067
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:28,520


1068
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,820
The most dangerous period is the first 24 hours after

1069
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,320
SWAT arrives.

1070
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,460
But you might have two weeks.

1071
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,860
Wavering sound.

1072
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:44,640
From PR News in Washington, I'm kept alive through feeding and hydration.

1073
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:50,200
A Presidential Commission's report says the Vatican was a violation of the sacred nature

1074
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:50,920
of PR.

1075
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:57,260
The essence of civilization is that the weak should be in the favor of life.

1076
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,520
Mr. Bush said, all the people who are in the middle of the world, they're the ones who

1077
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:58,660
are in the middle of the world.

1078
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:01,340
All Americans should live at the mercy of PR News, Washington.

1079
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:06,420
PR's Jewish, Muslim and Christian religious leaders are joining for an international gay

1080
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,200
festival in Jerusalem this summer.

1081
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:13,200
The festival, called World Pride, would damage the holiness of PR News, Washington.

1082
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,300
Hello, not.

1083
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,640
Somebody, hello?

1084
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,440
What?

1085
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:19,740
Mistake.

1086
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:21,260
Hello?

1087
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,000
Excuse me.

1088
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:22,660
Hello there?

1089
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,020
Somebody, somebody wanted to young today.

1090
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,060
The observation that nature.

1091
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:28,520
Yes.

1092
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:28,520


1093
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:28,520


1094
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:28,520


1095
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:28,520


1096
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:28,520


1097
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:28,520


1098
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:28,520


1099
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:28,520


1100
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:28,520


1101
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:28,520


1102
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,320
Somebody wanted too young today.

1103
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:36,440
Hello?

1104
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:36,860
What?

1105
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:37,880
55.

1106
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,520
We're seeing in the background the spud farmers and skull farmers have joined us once again.

1107
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,220
Liquid slack.

1108
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,220
Oh, here we go.

1109
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,700
Another cup for you, listener.

1110
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,140
Here you go.

1111
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,260
Let me hand it to the speaker here.

1112
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:49,880
Yeah.

1113
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:51,820
Careful, don't spill.

1114
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:53,620
Okay.

1115
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:56,840
I'm sorry your script didn't get here in time for the show.

1116
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,500
We didn't even know we were going to be on the show.

1117
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:58,500


1118
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:58,500


1119
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:58,500


1120
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:58,500


1121
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:58,500


1122
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:58,500


1123
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:58,500


1124
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:58,780
We're going to be on tonight.

1125
00:50:58,860 --> 00:50:59,780
Is there anything we can do?

1126
00:50:59,920 --> 00:50:59,920


1127
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:00,460
The way it goes.

1128
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,940
We're blasting the Westers.

1129
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,320
Oh, sir.

1130
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:11,760
Oh, God.

1131
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,060
West, white color meat.

1132
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:17,940
Same color paper.

1133
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,600
Yeah, if they just pour it up and put it somewhere I feel it'll safer.

1134
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,040
Oh, sir.

1135
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:25,760
Oh, God.

1136
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:26,600
Oh, God.

1137
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,280
Oh, God.

1138
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,140
Oh, God.

1139
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,020
Oh.

1140
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,600
Oh, you poster have died.

1141
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:37,980
Oh.

1142
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:38,440
Oh, my God.

1143
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:50,260
I lost my tape recorder.

1144
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:51,920
Whoa.

1145
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,780
I'm getting dizzy already.

1146
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:57,660
Yeah.

1147
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:01,380
I had said, if you don't help us, caller, we're going to start the show over again.

1148
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:04,980
That's right. We're going to go back to two o'clock in the morning.

1149
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,460
Time control.

1150
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:15,760
From PR News in Washington, I'm detonating two rock bombs and firing car propelled rocks at the worshippers and many more around the world.

1151
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:24,220
Saints are overlooking tens of thousands of Peters. Among them was PR's Peter.

1152
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:30,500
President Bush says the military staged a well-organized attack on the notorious PR News prison in Washington.

1153
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,600
We are T-Val.

1154
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,940
Are we not men?

1155
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,040
We are T-Val.

1156
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,800
So how can a person go about freebasing coffee, I guess would be the ultimate question.

1157
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:49,040
Well, there are various paper hangers you can call. They're in the yellow pages or the yellowing pages, as you like to call them in your urinary.

1158
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:53,340
No, because I'm not interested in methamphetamines or cocaine.

1159
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:53,940
No, I'm not.

1160
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:54,440
I'm interested in stuff.

1161
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,700
I just want coffee.

1162
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,700
Yeah, you know, I found...

1163
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:02,060
I don't think there are real nozzle trucks that will come out and excrete chocolate into your brain.

1164
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:07,480
Pharmaceutical coffee, possibly injectable, I suppose.

1165
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,260
Speaking as somebody who is...

1166
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:09,600
Or as a sublingual.

1167
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:18,420
Yeah, I've tried some various other stimulants before, and I find that there's really no point if you can just get your hands on some good Turkish coffee or something like that.

1168
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,840
You know, just something brewed really strong.

1169
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,040
Like, I don't understand why...

1170
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,200
And keep drinking it repeatedly rather than have more.

1171
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,640
I mean, one little Demitasse, you'd have to have it.

1172
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,440
Yeah, the little Demitasse. I drink that stuff, like, big, big.

1173
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,020
You know, I'll drink a pot of that.

1174
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:30,960
Until you have a stomachache.

1175
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,460
Yeah.

1176
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,360
And let's run to the bathroom and...

1177
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,700
Oh, that stuff will give you a headache that lasts all year. It's great.

1178
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,480
You know, why... I don't understand why people take meth when there's coffee.

1179
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:44,380
Well, why do they urinate drugs in our own body anyway?

1180
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,840
Why do we manufacturers who can't buy them from other manufacturers?

1181
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:49,980
You know what I'm saying?

1182
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,300
That's a good question. I wonder where that static is coming from.

1183
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,400
There we go.

1184
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,080
Little chocolate.

1185
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,740
Uh-oh. Who did we lose? Who did we lose?

1186
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:56,920
Hello?

1187
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:57,720
Hello?

1188
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,400
We lost Stan.

1189
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,960
Oh, we lost Stan.

1190
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:07,600
Well, let's see. Yeah, let's see who comes on in place.

1191
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,620
6-8-7-th out, north of our view.

1192
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:10,720
You're on the air.

1193
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,580
Oh, Dr. Sinister.

1194
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,040
There you are.

1195
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,720
Yeah, my... the battery in my mouth ran out, so I just hung up.

1196
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:18,640
Oh, yeah.

1197
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,680
And I changed him.

1198
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,400
Dude, you need to get a wind-up.

1199
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,200
I think Stan was communicating with you.

1200
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,040
His sources, quote-unquote.

1201
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,800
Well, quote, sources, unquote.

1202
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,200
Well, all that talk about the coffee was getting me kind of...

1203
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,820
I had a hankering.

1204
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:37,120
So I ran down and got some of the iced java and tried to smoke it,

1205
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,720
but it just... it's too wet and too cold.

1206
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:44,460
Have any of you panel truckers ever tried a chocolate coffee enema?

1207
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,800
No, but I know people who recommend it.

1208
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:48,820
No, but I know people who recommend it.

1209
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:51,300
No, some people do that as a form of splitting nature

1210
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,700
and becoming one with the, you know, thing.

1211
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:53,920
The cards.

1212
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:58,440
So that's... I thought that was kind of a sick joke or a crazy person activity.

1213
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,120
No, no, it's... you get quite buzzed, supposedly.

1214
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,480
All kinds of drugs can be absorbed through the mucous membranes in the rectum.

1215
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:10,560
So then we could even snort coffee if we wanted mucus in our membranes.

1216
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:17,400
Right, and if you could learn how to snort with your neither nostril, so to speak...

1217
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,440
Your neither nostril.

1218
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,160
You could do the essence of coffee.

1219
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:24,000
If you could inhale like the great Lepidomane was able to do,

1220
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:27,500
if you could suck in with your nether end,

1221
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:34,420
you could actually sort of drink the coffee syrup and absorb it that way.

1222
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,480
You could take it from five different orifices that you don't even have.

1223
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:40,820
You could just like, you know, take it on, so to speak.

1224
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,100
Just take the whole essence of coffee.

1225
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:44,880
You'd be drinking it and snorting it.

1226
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,120
We could just sit on the tube, I suppose, would be the other possibility.

1227
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,340
But, you know...

1228
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:51,660
That always involves an emergency room, though.

1229
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:52,460
Always.

1230
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,060
Have any of you...

1231
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,940
And telling the doctor,

1232
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,380
you're not going to believe this story.

1233
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,940
It was a one-in-a-million thing.

1234
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:00,180
The doctors always hear that.

1235
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,220
And someone comes in with something stuck up there.

1236
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,200
You know, it's like, oh, I can't believe this is a one-in-a-million accident.

1237
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,520
What do you think the weirdest thing that would be?

1238
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,000
I mean...

1239
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,660
Actually, I remember reading Howard Stern's book years ago,

1240
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:16,240
and he had a whole chapter dedicated to things that had been found in, you know,

1241
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,120
all people's asses.

1242
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:18,880
The dirty bomb.

1243
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,800
It was pretty wild.

1244
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:22,760
Yeah.

1245
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:25,380
Things found in A&I.

1246
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,600
I didn't know if I believed it or not.

1247
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,460
See, if we read more Walt Whitman

1248
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:33,320
and took on the surrogate brain food from the Martians,

1249
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:37,080
we would not be placing things in our directories.

1250
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:40,580
We'd have a clear conscience, and we'd have a clean canal.

1251
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:41,820
Of course.

1252
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,080
Well, now that...

1253
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,880
Just eat those leaves of grass, and that'll keep you regular.

1254
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,920
Even in days of old when nights were bold, there were...

1255
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,040
Outhouses weren't invented.

1256
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:53,880
...people who wanted to pack the bucket up their exit window.

1257
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:58,780
And for whatever cheap thrill that might afford them.

1258
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,280
Yeah.

1259
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:04,040
They didn't have television or special effects in those days.

1260
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:04,460
Pardon?

1261
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:06,480
What?

1262
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,900
They didn't have special effects in those days.

1263
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,580
Yeah, they didn't have TV or special effects,

1264
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:15,320
so they had to pack a lot more stuff up themselves just for entertainment.

1265
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,760
You were talking about... I couldn't hear you.

1266
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,280
I thought you were talking about pirate tactics again.

1267
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:20,920
Again.

1268
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:21,280
Again.

1269
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:23,700
Uh...

1270
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:24,440
Friends.

1271
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,240
Radio synesthesia there.

1272
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:32,060
You're listening, however, not to that show, but to the Hour of Slap.

1273
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,660
And that would be the voice of the Church of the Subgenius.

1274
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,720
Friends, you can get more at subgenius.com.

1275
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,540
In fact, the shows are archived there.

1276
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,580
We heard a lot of the other subgenius shows,

1277
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:50,720
such as KPFA Show in Berkeley with Puzzling Evidence and Dr. Howell.

1278
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,680
We heard some Detroit Revival randomness.

1279
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:54,180
We heard some of the movie-related events.

1280
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:56,560
Uh, from yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

1281
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:00,120
Oh, by the way, you can send tapes and things, if you want, to...

1282
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:11,040
Post Office Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1283
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,540
Praise Bob.

1284
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,940
And now, Lemur.

1285
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,660
From PR News in Washington,

1286
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:22,180
I'm deteriorating after a brief urinary corruption.

1287
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,680
The European Union...

1288
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,480
Union is praising PR as a poultry industry after a poultry infection.

1289
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,460
On Wall Street, many of them were in tears.

1290
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,000
But that hasn't happened.

1291
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:39,200
Former Connecticut Governor John Rowland abstained from killing a badly injured PR news in Washington.

1292
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:45,600
A former senior official with the Boy Scouts of America has pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography.

1293
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,820
Douglas Smith was charged with using the Internet to access the material.

1294
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:53,160
He was formally charged with the federal count last week.

1295
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,360
You must say these words.

1296
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:59,820
Klaatu, Barada, Nikto.

1297
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,680
Please repeat that.

1298
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,780
Tu, Barada, Nikto.

1299
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,680
You must remember those words.

1300
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,300
Tu, Barada, Nikto.

1301
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,480
Gort, doo-doo.

1302
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,320
Roba, doo-doo.

1303
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,260
He could doo-doo.

1304
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:17,380
Bobby?
