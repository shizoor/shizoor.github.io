Remember,
Remember,
Remember,
Remember,
We're sitting together listening to this...
Remember,
Remember,
Remember,
We're sitting together listening to this...
This was present.
Remember, remember, remember, we're sitting together listening to this.
And this was pleasing to God.
Oh, yes, dear friends.
Actually, we should start that one from the...
Let's just listen.
Ah, yes, dear friends.
And since I'm mixing all by myself, I'll have to...
Oh, no wonder that wasn't working.
I was mixing by myself the wrong mix pots down there.
We'll just bring that down and bring me...
I was never brought up right, you know.
But now I am upright.
I will be upright with you.
Good audience.
And this, of course, is in the background.
Frank Zappa's classic Peaches and Regalia.
Beautiful, beautiful piece of music that many of us old folks cut our teeth upon.
And, you know, we don't play much Frank Zappa on the Hour of Slack.
And it's because Frank Zappa...
May very well be what led you here if you're over 30.
And, you know, what we'd like to do for Bob is to lead you on to the next thing.
Help the next poor sucker down the line, as Frank himself said.
And recently, I was given to hear of a conversation.
Actually, something I picked up off the Internet.
In which someone had been griping on alt-fan Zappa or something.
About how...
Oh, you know, it's so sad.
Frank's dead.
And Captain Beefheart only does paintings now.
And they...
What is...
What is there left?
And Zug's Rift, our fellow minister and great musician, Zug's Rift, responded that...
Well, you know, buddy, it's not like there aren't other musicians floating around there.
I mean, are you just as conservative as that guy that can't...
Listen to anything but Led Zeppelin now that he's 45 years old?
You know, yep.
Frank's dead as a doornail.
And the captain has gone on to other things.
And he's not going to make any more music.
But, friends, have you bothered to seek out that Rudy Schwartz project CD?
Or that Zug's Rift CD?
That Kings of Feedback?
That Silica Gel, Reagan's Pollock?
Uh...
Or even Swinging Love Corpses?
Or Doctors for Bob?
Have you?
Have you?
Well, friends, I was thinking about that.
And this is going to be our nepotistic Friends of Stang music show.
But don't be afraid, because...
Old Reverend Stang has some very talented friends.
Um...
So, it will be a musical show.
A musical show, indeed.
Of just...
You know, people might complain that...





Well, I sent my tape to Reverend Stang.
And it's true that it was unlistenable.
And I did not put any label on it.
And I did mention in my handwritten note on the napkin that it probably sucked.
But he never played it on his show.
He only plays his friends.
Well, here's why.
Here's why.
Here's why.
Here's why.

Here's why.
Here's why.



Here's why.


Here's why.
Here's why.
Here's why.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.


Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, dog!
Pee dog!
Bob is lucky, not smart.
That's for puke from people like you.
Would you F-I-B to the FBI?
Would you tell to them a dirty lie?
Everything was internet alright.
Would you F-I-B to the FBI?
Would you tell to them a dirty lie?
I think I'll have some apple pie.
I think I'll have some apple pie.
I want to be a guy in a machine of high quality.
I'm a genius, I'm a genius, I'm a genius.
I'm a genius, I'm a genius, I'm a genius.
Slowly slipping, going by the waves.
Metaphorically speaking, that is.
Bob is lucky, not smart.
In fact, by the perverted conspiracy standards of intelligence,
he is gifted with incredible stupidity.
He lives in a perpetual state of contracted consciousness.
This enables him to act without thinking,
to surf effortlessly,
on the luck plane,
to float down the fabled path of least resistance.
In fact, to make a million dollars every time he screws up.
A catatonic stupid
Where do you think you're been?
A catatonic stupid
You know you'll never
again
Cole, what are you doing?
Cole, how are you doing?
Hey man.
Hey, how's it going?
I brought you some tape.
Oh, you brought me some tapes?
Yeah.
Oh.
From bearing gifts.
Oh, Jesus comes in bearing gifts.
From St. Andrews.
Oh, oh.
Oh, jeez.
What's that noise?
Feedback from my great presence.
I guess either that or my little headphones.
Tray full of lab mice.
Tray full of, now this is what it's like, friends.
We're on the air, by the way.
Uh-oh.
To see, I've been sitting here, I've been playing, this is a show of nepotistic friends of ours music.
Like Joe Newman, Zug's Riff, Negative Land, you know.
No, it's too late.
Oh, now is that my Bryce CD?
Oh, Bryce.
Oh, okay, good.
I was worried about that.
Okay, well what is this new CD?
Um, that's a, uh, Numersonic.
Frequencies of the Beast.
Oh, look at the titles on this.
Hippie Freakout.
The Mark of the Beast.
Creature Double Feature.
Martian Girlfriend.
Greetings Earth.
Hey, I wonder if these are X Day.
This some, some, you know what it might be.
Let's see what this letter is.
Tray full of lab mice.
Dear Ivan, I worship you.
I once contributed my little Jesus being crucified on telephone poles collage.
So he's the one who did that.
You must immediately play Numershonik on your show.
Practically the whole album is your cup of tea if you ever steeped a bag.
I also enclose Unbunny, which may not include, uh, appeal to your fine sensibilities.
Okay, here, Numorphonic.
Make Unbunny and Numershonik household names by tomorrow noon.
My telex operators await your instructions as we just hatched our label yesterday.
I'll make the press kit short.
Unbunny just put out his first album.
He drives a flower delivery truck.
I guess...
It says Goiter Boy is the one to use if I use any of them.
But now the second CD.
Numershonik is the band.
Frequencies of the Beast is the album.
The lead singer is a credit to dementia, having been certified homeless.
Get the, we got another one!
We got another, this is like a, um, the ultimate, quote, outsider artist and schizophrenic for the last 20 years.
Yet he's not just a novelty act.
He improvises wildly funny lyrics and sounds like Elvis with a sore throat.
The opening song, Hippie Freakout, will be the smash hit of the album.
Most of the profits go to Paul's coffee fund.
Well, I was just telling that we only played stuff by our friends.
But now, here's proof that if somebody sends us something wild enough...
We don't even know this guy.
We've never even heard this.
Friends, we, we have...
I hope it's, I hope it's clean.
You're hearing it for the first time just as we are.
Well, we are on tape, so...
You know, I'm lying, but...
I need to get my ass off too.
Okay.
Uh...
Here it is.
Hippie Freakout.
Thinking about a bunch of hippie in the parking lot.
All set out there ready for a bout.
I says, hey you fellas, you better be careful because someone's gonna holler.
And we're sure gonna start there.
And we're all gonna shout.
And there's no doubt about it.
Someone's gonna call the cops.
One guy said no.
And I said, hey, mind your business, friend.
This is none of yours.
I said, well, I'm aware of that.
But I'm trying to be concerned for you and what's gonna happen if you get caught.
So it doesn't really matter.
One way or another, they didn't seem to care.
I says, hey, listen, you guys.
Don't you realize that we all out here sitting out in the front chair.
So there was a bunch of hippies.
Yeah.
Hippie Freakout.
It's all set to go out there in the parking lot.





They didn't get ready to do themselves a part.
So there was this young lady.
I took a look at her.
I said, ho, ho, give me a drag or two.
She says, hey, get away from me.
I don't want nothing to do with you.
She took a shot in her arm and I could see.
I says, hey, you're getting rather kind of dizzy.
She says, hey, hey, you can kiss where the sun doesn't shine.
I says, hey, don't tell me that.
Get to work.






Get to work.
She says, hey, you can do the things on time.
She just starts shaking.
She starts wiggling, going from side to side.
She says, hey, come on over here.
You want to be my guy.
I says, hey, what makes you think that I'm any different from you?
Because I have a clean hair cut.
Well, friends.
And I just don't seem to know what to do.
She says, hey, man.
I don't know what to do either.
Lift that reefer.
Smoke it strong.
Pump that old needle up your arm.
I says, hey, man.








I says, oh, yeah.
I surely will.
She says, hey, brother, have a drink.
Have another or two.
This is one thing I want you to do.
Well, friends.
We have no idea whether this song goes on for another hour or two or what.
It is definitely a hippie freak out.
Do you believe that your mind, you are confused at this particular time?
Do you believe that you seek guidance, understanding?
Do you think of yourself as being somewhat mentally ill, physically ill?
Do you know that you could be a better person?





Do you think that your drinking problems were really, really the cause of the troubles after all?
Do you really think that your life was...
Now...
Yeah, go ahead, Paul.
My outer space machine
The woman with the eyes so big and bright
My outer space machine
The woman that has to come through in disguise
Is yours, my outer space machine
Oh, friend.
This show, thanks to Jesus, is a strange show.
We got a bit sidetracked there into some hippie freakouts
when Jesus suddenly, right in the middle of being nepotistic,
Jesus showed up with some tapes or CDs from strangers
and I went and played them anyway
just when I was trying not to be democratic.
I was trying to just stick to my buddies
and the graft and grifting of...
Oh.
Price Bob Joe Newman
and the Rudy Schwartz Project.
Oh, yes.

Red India At night, the moon täll пуne,



I'm having a heart attack!
Can't be the same till I get my baby back!
She's gone and left me broken hearted!
Came to stay but now we've parted!
Like a transcontinental island!
Burning, floating across the seven seas!
Causing the crust to form a set of delicate bacteria!
Shoot it in a mustard keg!
Her lemon made a beautiful sunset!
She's gone and left me, what shall I do?
She got back to her residence on Sunset Boulevard!
Where the residue of her lemon shined through!
Like a business stoned by a medfly!
Went thrown up into a baby!
And floated way up in outer space!
Like a Jules Verne hot air balloon!
Jacob Barney to the dollar!
He's bled to tiny town and all his little friends!
Visiting from Starsdale!
That's why I'm having a heart attack!

Dear friends, that heart attack there by the great Zug's Rift and his amazing poo-poo heads is one way to call that man.
And this is also Zug's in the background.
I'm about to give the address of Dr. Zug's Rift and also the address for Joe Newman, okay?
And so you know who to write to for the uncensored versions of these self-same tapes.
Zug's Rift, got that pencil ready, is at P.O. Box 18765.
That's Box 18765, Encino, California.
Encino, California.
9-1-4-1-6.
Yes, that's Box 18765, Encino, California.
9-1-4-1-6.
And to get information about the CDs and tapes of Joe Newman's Rudy Schwartz Project, that is P.O. Box 4542.
P.O. Box 4542 in Austin, Texas.
78765.
Yes, friends, it's P.O. Box 4542, Austin, Texas.
78765.
For Joe Newman and I, yes, while I'm at it with this great music in the background, I probably ought to also give the background post-award.

Office Box Number 4.
Bob, yes.
And if you haven't memorized it by now, you will.
It's P.O. Box.

When was the last time you had your hearing checked?
I would advise him to learn to lip read.

It's not what I'd like to listen to, but I don't think I should be able to tell the other
people what they can or can't listen to.
Deafness is not only uncool, it's endurable.
I'm short on hearing.
Call now and receive a coupon for a free hearing test.
Guaranteed, you won't hear any of this music on elevator.
It's rock and roll!
He's got you in love.
You suspect a hearing loss, so I thought nothing could be done about it.
Ask your family doctor.
Feel your ear drums explode!
This concludes this hearing test.
Thank you!
Thank you!
I'm not going to be locked for everything they've based their life on for life.
Dodgy, my freaking salvation!
According to your beautiful ideals, I'm supposed to crawl away somewhere and die, so that you
and Bob can be friends.
Ah, there you are.
Bob, we were afraid you wouldn't get here.
Got here as soon as I could.
Oh, Julie?
Say, what is this whole thing all about?
I'm glad you're dealt the other way now, Dodgy.
Yeah.
Now listen to me...
Dodgy!
What?
How lucky I am, how lucky I am!
What a wonderful day!


To have someone like you
Someone I know is gonna be my friend
From the beginning right to the end
How lucky, lucky, lucky I am

Don't you wanna be saved?
Don't you wanna be saved?
Fight the real enemy
We're all looking in the same direction
We're not seeing quite the same thing
Get lost!
Look at me and I'm looking at you
But we're all going insane
Don't talk to me!
I'm hiding the gun!
Fight the real enemy
Fight the real enemy
Fight the real enemy
I find it good about hiding
Fight!
Fight the real enemy
Fight the real enemy
We don't want to fight you
preach to people.
Oh, Bob.
Oh.
Turn on.
Tune in.
Why do you want to be normal?
The rupture is upon us, dear friends.
That fateful day,
July 5th,
1998.
Next days are coming.
And the peaks are coming.
Next days are coming.
And the peaks are coming.
When we were born
into this life,
we were destined
to make
it right.
And it's predetermined.
And this is our fate.
We're singing this song
so you can
relate.
We are going to save
the universe.
We are going to save the universe.
We are going to save the universe.
This time.
We are full grown.
We are grown up men.
We are all passionate.
We pay to reason it.
It is our mission.
It is our task.
It's obvious.
It is obvious.
Yes, you do that.
We are going to save the universe.
Save the universe.
We are going to save the universe.
We are going to save
the universe.
Yes,, I am.

Don't you worry
Don't have no fears
Don't get outside
We've got the atmosphere
We can let
So can you understand
We're in control
And we don't want to die
And we don't want to die
We are going to save the universe
We are going to save the universe
We are going to save the universe
This time
Well, maybe next time
Sure, when the rupture hits
We'll all be in our first class window seats
On the pleasure saucers
Watching the little pink boys fly
Turn on
Turn on
Come on, come on, come on
You certainly don't want to trick these people
Next days are coming
And the pigs are bumming
Ah!
There's a whole bunch of people coming after you
You better stop and try to listen to me
Cause they want to ram a little something up your buns
And they call it the conspiracy
Well, they'll make you think and act just the way they choose
And they'll make you overpay just to sing the blues
And they'll tell you what to say and they'll never go away
Cause they got you in your work and they'll never let you play
Cause they kind of just designed you to be a fool
And they kind of just designed it to work that way
Cause they kind of just designed it to work that way
And because of their design, well, it washes out your mind
And you think you're doing fine, but you're wasting all your time
Being very well behaved for the big machine
Being very well behaved for the big machine
And they'll tell you what to say, but they'll never go away
Cause they got you in your work and they'll never let you play
Here I am
Stuck in the blood by the man
Here I stay
Free will just drifting away
Smile and be happy
Here's the American dream
More noodles for you poodles
Means less coffee for your dream
And if you want to make more money
We'll take more of it for ourselves
With your caddies in the driveway
But nothing on your shelves
Let's wrap the confusion up
A destruction illusion
I get down on my knees and I pray
Cause Bob is my savior
Today
Today
Yes, I am Bob
The one high exalted master of slack
And I'm the one who's got the most money
I am the carburetor of the universe
The rubbery wheels on a child's toy truck
I am the pelvic warmth of intercourse
I am the force behind all foolishness and humor
The laughter of the raving lunatic
The wisdom of ignorance
The death rattle of the infant of seriousness
I am slack
I have come
And my organ still swells
To spread the legs of your mind
And I will thrust my holy rod
Into the boulders of your consciousness
I'll kindly bend over
I'll concede my default to a
To my horn
Ohhh
Ohh
Ohhh
I'll count my banging

If I said Chernobyl was so long ago.
Nothing to worry about.
And now I hear in the news these dumb guys in the Department of Energy and the Defense Department are gonna start
building a bunch of Chernobyls across the United States.
And then I hear on the news that Chernobyl is not really over, no.
All these people are dying.
It's all the pollution is getting into the waters, it's getting into the aquifers.
It's getting to the water.
Everything below me is all one thing

Is making it hard just to stay alive
But the iodine, a 1, 3, 1
The iodine, a 1, 3, 1
No more running through the metal lands
No more barefoot in the mud
Shake the bony hand of the poison man
Shake the bony hand of the chicken good
No more running through the metal lands
No more running through the metal lands

No more barefoot in the mud
Shake the bony hand of the poison man
Shake the bony hand of the chicken good
Shake the bony hand of the chicken good
Shake the bony hand of the poison man
