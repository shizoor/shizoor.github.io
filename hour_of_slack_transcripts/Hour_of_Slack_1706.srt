1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,600
How'd he turn you on?

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,160
We were talking about tea.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,000
How the kick wore off.

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,360
And he said there was something else.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,180
Something that had a real jolt.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,840
The Self-Genius Power of Swatch.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,520
Never got so sick in my life.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,660
Thought I was gonna die.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,620
You're a big talker, aren't you, son?

10
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,340
When you're just taking a little drop, kid.

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,160
They receive punishment as prescribed by law.

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:36,620
This is Hour of Slack number 1,706.

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,920
The Dr. Legume tribute special number 5.

14
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,820
It's real simple, too.

15
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,340
It starts with the last Dr. Legume recording that I made.

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,260
Him on a panel with Dr. Hal, Onan Canterbite, and myself.

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,320
Out 20x day into June.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,080
2017.

19
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:00,060
And then it cuts to one of the very oldest recordings of Dr. Legume.

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,340
From Hour of Slack number 467.

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,460
From 1993, I think.

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,380
And the first, the most recent.

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,000
He describes an event that happened in Starwood in 1993.

24
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,540
And in the older recording, we hear the actual tape of the event.

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,320
Plus a rant by Dr. Legume at that same time.

26
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,020
And finally, we return to the 2017 recording.

27
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:35,620
In which Dr. Legume vividly tells the story of a dire and surreal road trip.

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,580
During the time that he was first discovering Bob.

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,120
In his heart.

30
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,440
And in even worse places.

31
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,500
So, first, Legume.

32
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,840
At 20x day of 2017.

33
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,840
2017.

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:53,880
Wow.

35
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,180
I didn't buy that for a dollar.

36
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,020
Yeah.

37
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:06,580
I'm just sitting here trying to recollect any of the really weird shit that's happened to me since I joined the Church of the Subgenius.

38
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,480
But there's just a damn bunch of it that's happened.

39
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,920
It's not even that I've been away.

40
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,220
I mean, weird shit happens to me wherever I go.

41
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:13,920
Right.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,060
But just the weird shit that's happened to me dealing with Subgenius.

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,500
I think the weirdest thing was probably the Kevin Underwood thing.

44
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,120
Because.

45
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,780
Oh, Reverend Stank shaking his ass.

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,900
I'm not going to say anything else about that.

47
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,200
Yeah.

48
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,700
Oh, okay.

49
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,180
Yeah, there's this guy who used to hang out in all the slack.

50
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,560
He never sent his $35 in.

51
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,860
I like to preface this with that.

52
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:52,760
That way nobody is too keen on saying a member of the Subgenius Church might have murdered and cannibalized a little girl in the Midwest.

53
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,780
$35, you little talk member.

54
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,060
$35 media barrage number three.

55
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,100
Yeah.

56
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,220
So he actually did send some money to Bob.

57
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,180
But, yeah, he ended up kidnapping a little girl that lived next door to him.

58
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,140
And he killed her.

59
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,240
And then he tried to eat her.

60
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,000
And after she was dead.

61
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,740
I guess it ain't rape or anything after they're dead.

62
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,720
But he did whatever he was doing.

63
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,060
And the police came in and found her bicycle under his bed.

64
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,280
And she was in a plastic tub.

65
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,060
In the closet.

66
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:35,380
And the freaky thing is that he had written me several e-mails telling me how much he enjoyed my artwork.

67
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,220
So that was a really creepy Subgenius story.

68
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,240
We heard from him about four or five years ago from prison.

69
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:53,420
And he apologized if his mistake brought any dishonor on the church.

70
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,820
And he asked for some pamphlets.

71
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,220
I sent him the pamphlets, but I didn't otherwise respond.

72
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:07,260
The prison ministry of the Church of the Subgenius is long and storied.

73
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,620
Well, you know, they were all, like, weird, bad stories.

74
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,240
There was the Kid Gimsy story, Reverend Stang.

75
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,700
That was a nice, inspiring story of a subgenius the next day.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,280
Still weird, but inspiring.

77
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,580
This is going to be a long one.

78
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,620
I might even need a drink for this one.

79
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,460
This was when I first met Reverend Stang.

80
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,880
Not too long after.

81
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,820
A year or two.

82
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,360
This was even before the X-Day drills.

83
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,920
It had to be a Starwood, probably 1994 or 95.

84
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,020
And I had ridden my motorcycle all the way there to Brushwood.

85
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:52,620
From where?

86
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,800
From Philadelphia.

87
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,100
Yeah, 400 miles.

88
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:05,020
And Kid Gimsy, a young subgenius, and Pastor Craig, another young subgenius.

89
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,660
Well, he wasn't really that young.

90
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,240
They were in the car carrying all of my gear and basically just following me up there.

91
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:19,160
And these were young bobbies, basically.

92
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,400
I mean, there were a lot more bobbies then than there are now

93
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,220
because they had to do it by mailbag.

94
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:24,640
You had to do it by mailbag then.

95
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,080
If you really wanted to be a bobby in the church, you had to work for it.

96
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,140
Well, they followed me up there, and I went and pitched my camp.

97
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,360
And I was like, ah, Jesus, they're pitching a camp right next to me.

98
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,640
But it all worked out.

99
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,200
It was okay.

100
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:51,140
I had gone out and was hanging out with the pagans down at the drum circle.

101
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,080
Drum circle, yep.

102
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,320
Subgenius.

103
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,340
Subgenius walked up to me.

104
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,500
For all I know, it may have been Reverend Ferg.

105
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,740
Walked up and handed me a little time.

106
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,980
He showed me a picture.

107
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,460
It was a picture of Christ.

108
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,540
And he was like a baseball card.

109
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,260
And he was all nailed up on a crucifix, all covered in blood and gore and guts.

110
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,420
It was just really nasty.

111
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,640
And I'm like, ah, this is beautiful.

112
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,840
And he very carefully rips along the many perforations of that baseball card.

113
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:30,100
And hands me the right hand of Christ on a tiny little square.

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,260
You can probably guess what that tiny little square picture was.

115
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:35,900
Hooray!

116
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,080
Because I can tell you, it's not hanging in my house in a tiny little frame.

117
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,020
Nope.

118
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,960
It's hanging in my spinal fluid.

119
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,400
Exactly where it belongs.

120
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,160
Exactly where it belongs.

121
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,120
Well, I took this LSD, and I went back there.

122
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,140
And I'm going to chill out in my tent for a while and wait for the ride to come on.

123
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,180
And it was pretty good.

124
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,820
And I got to where I had gotten past the peak.

125
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,940
And I was starting to feel my, starting to get my Irish up a bit.

126
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,600
Wanted to go out and have a little fun.

127
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,180
And so I get out of my tent.

128
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:19,180
And just as I do, here comes this little subgenius kid, Kid Ginsu, out of his tent.

129
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,460
Looking for all the world like an underfed Buddy Holly.

130
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,240
Hood.

131
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,400
Hood.

132
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,220
Also taking some of that same LSD.

133
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,440
Mind you, this was just a young kid.

134
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,800
He was 18 or 19.

135
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,620
Had LSD.

136
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,300
Instant balls.

137
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,720
College student at NYU studying, majoring in philosophy.

138
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,540
Yeah, that was a great idea.

139
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,000
I can spout about anything.

140
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,800
Well, I had been planning something for weeks to do at X Day.

141
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,640
And it was called the Test of Faith.

142
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,320
And the Test of Faith was fairly simple.

143
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,960
You put your hand on a stump.

144
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:05,240
And I drive this giant iron spike into the stump without hitting your hand.

145
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,140
If I hit your hand, then you have no faith in Bob.

146
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,380
But if I don't hit your hand, then that means that Bob loves you.

147
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,780
Bob loves you.

148
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:21,100
Oh, and I forgot to mention the word blindfolded in there.

149
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:21,620
Blindfolded.

150
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,260
Blindfolded.

151
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,560
Yes.

152
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,860
I was blindfolded while I was driving the spike into the stump.

153
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,620
So I took it as a sign.

154
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,660
I had already taken the LSD, which was, of course, a hand with a big spike through the palm.

155
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,580
Befitting.

156
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,960
I'm real big on portents.

157
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,640
And that just seemed like this is a sign that it's time to bust the spike out.

158
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,980
So I'm like, I have to find Reverend Stang.

159
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,620
And the first thing I do is I say,

160
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,320
Say to Kid Gensu, come with me, boy.

161
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,820
Laid on the full redneck.

162
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,660
And I walked him back through the dark roads in Brushwood.

163
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,700
And I said, stop right here and wait.

164
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,080
And he did what he was told because he was terrified.

165
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,320
That was a good word for it.

166
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,440
Terrified and tripping.

167
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,340
Don't hurt me.

168
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,940
And I crept through the bushes.

169
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,080
And Reverend Stang was sitting around a campfire with some of his pagan friends, you know, just having a chat.

170
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,400
And I ninja'd up real quiet.

171
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,320
And I tapped.

172
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,580
Reverend Stang on the shoulder and said, you want to see somebody shit themselves?

173
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,040
And Reverend Stang turned to me and said, shit, you just did.

174
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,840
And I said, come on, man.

175
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,060
We're going to go do the test of faith.

176
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,400
I got a pilgrim out in the road.

177
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,420
And he said, all right.

178
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,560
And he grabs his little pocket recorder.

179
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,200
And he follows me out into the road.

180
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,200
And there's this young subgenius kid meeting his subgenius heroes for the first time.

181
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,460
And one of them is taking a personal interest in him.

182
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,600
And then out of the woods, here I come with Reverend Stang.

183
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,460
Reverend Ivan Stang.

184
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,620
That was the day you earned the sobriquet Reverend Ivan Stang himself.

185
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,340
Himself.

186
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:07,940
Which is the last name that they tend to tag on to Reverend Ivan Stang when they talk amongst themselves with their new subgeniuses.

187
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,520
It's Reverend Ivan Stang himself.

188
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,240
He was very impressed.

189
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,800
And Reverend Stang and I, we were like, come on, boy, we're going to go out.

190
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,280
And he knew what I had planned.

191
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,840
Because he was like, we're going to take you out there.

192
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,280
We're going to introduce you to Bob.

193
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,060
And we were laying it on him real hard.

194
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,340
And we're looking for some place to go and do this.

195
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,520
Because I had taken acid and hadn't planned anything in advance.

196
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,360
So we're wandering through a thick, dense fog.

197
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,560
And we can't see shit.

198
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,520
And we come out in the field.

199
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:45,580
And there was this structure that they had built that was going to be the basis for the Starwood Bonfire.

200
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,600
But I didn't know that at the time.

201
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,660
Reverend Stang might have.

202
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,420
But I didn't know.

203
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,500
It was a giant.

204
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,460
It was a pyramid made out of wood.

205
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,800
Like a pyramid frame.

206
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,760
Like a skeleton.

207
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,340
And it was a big fucking pyramid.

208
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,620
I remember that from Brushwood.

209
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:02,900
Right.

210
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,760
Big pyramid out in the field.

211
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,580
Surrounded by logs, you know, big enough to sit on.

212
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:17,440
And right in the middle of it, dead center, is a tree stump that was just perfect for what we had planned.

213
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,180
It was exactly chest high.

214
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,960
It was the perfect size.

215
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,660
And then Reverend Stang and I started in on this poor kid.

216
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,160
And we were like, yeah, you're nuts.

217
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,480
Reverend Stang, you're nuts are going to drop after this boy.

218
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,500
There was thunder and lightning.

219
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,160
Yes, there was thunder and lightning going on.

220
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,640
There was a storm rolling in with this fog.

221
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,340
Directly over the...

222
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,820
Reverend Stang will tell you, this is no bullshit.

223
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,260
This is...

224
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,660
This is 100% true.

225
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:00,460
There was a perfect circle above the pyramid where you could look up and see the full moon.

226
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,720
But only directly above us in this perfect circle of clear sky.

227
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:10,060
There was lightning crashing all around us and the pagan drums were out there.

228
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,860
They were getting fired up because of the thunder and lightning.

229
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,540
Right.

230
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,800
We're talking a whole...

231
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,740
We're talking hundreds of pagans on acid beating on drums while...

232
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,260
And getting fired up.

233
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,460
Fired up by this thunderstorm that's coming in.

234
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:23,840
Speech towel.

235
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,880
And they're going...

236
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,780
And they're pounding me, Reverend Stang, or laying it on real thick.

237
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,260
And I'm like, boy, you are your father's secret shame.

238
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,400
Put your hand on the stump.

239
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,720
He's like...

240
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,080
I don't know about...

241
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,320
He's talking like that...

242
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,600
One of those little cartoon characters.

243
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,180
Stammering.

244
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,100
There's a little rabbit that follows Bugs Bunny around that requires subtitles.

245
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,180
This dude was losing his...

246
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,220
Shit bad.

247
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,220
And...

248
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,160
You could smell it in the air.

249
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:56,880
And...

250
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,180
I had to misguide him.

251
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,380
Reverend Stang is holding this guy by the wrist and holding his hand down on the stump.

252
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,500
And I'm like, I'm just going to drive it into the stump.

253
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,160
And if Bob loves you, you won't get hurt.

254
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,420
But if Bob thinks you're pink, you're a fuck boy.

255
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:15,900
And...

256
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,280
Not yet.

257
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,040
And I'm just talking.

258
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,240
So I take that spike and I...

259
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:21,780
I pick it up.

260
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,040
And I reach in my pocket and I pull out this blindfold.

261
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,000
Uh, sir.

262
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,140
Sir, you didn't say anything about a blindfold, sir.

263
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,100
I was like, shut up, boy.

264
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,060
It's time.

265
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,000
It's time.

266
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,760
And I take this big metal spike.

267
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,740
And I raise it up high.

268
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,180
And I go...

269
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,100
And just then lightning strikes overhead and flashes.

270
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,900
And this kid just about...

271
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,840
And I drive that spike down into the stump.

272
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,140
And I completely miss his hand.

273
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,720
Well, he didn't take into account the stump was about this fucking wide.

274
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,620
And he only had little tiny hands.

275
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,720
God's let me hit and his hands were astronomical.

276
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:07,860
It was his own fear that made him pass himself there and lose his faith in Bob.

277
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,260
And then Reverend Stang turned to him and said...

278
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,040
Do not go pale and pink in the face of Bob.

279
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,640
Reverend Stang turned to him at that moment and said,

280
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,900
Welcome to the hour of sleep.

281
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:21,980
Kid Ginsu.

282
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,280
And he took out his little tape recorder and said,

283
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,920
You're going to be on the radio.

284
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,520
And I turned to Reverend Stang and I said,

285
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,220
We got one last thing to do.

286
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,820
Kid Ginsu, you stand right here and count to a hundred and don't you fucking move.

287
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,240
And I turned to Reverend Stang and I said,

288
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,340
Come on, we have to get out of here before it goes off.

289
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,000
And we ran off into the woods laughing like two teenage goons.

290
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,520
And we had...

291
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,940
Now I said the story had a happy ending.

292
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,560
And I think breaking somebody's entire psyche is probably not the happy ending you were expecting.

293
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,140
Cautionary tales.

294
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:03,920
Now...

295
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,400
Sometimes, but you just got to.

296
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,400
As it goes on, a lot of people were like,

297
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,100
I can't believe he did that to Kid Ginsu, that bully Dr. Lagoon.

298
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,680
And, well, I'm getting a little ahead of myself.

299
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:21,720
We went...

300
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,740
I was going back with Reverend Stang.

301
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,620
I waited for a while and Stang went back to his conversations.

302
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,580
And I thought to myself, I'm going to wander out there and see what became of this kid.

303
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,180
So I wandered back to the little pyramid where he was sitting.

304
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:44,980
There he was, face in hands, collapsed in the logs.

305
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,540
I said, You okay, boy?

306
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,160
I feel like I've been raped.

307
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,600
Well...

308
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,480
Well, he kind of had.

309
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,340
And I sat down with him.

310
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,100
And I chatted with him a spell, head still rolling on acid.

311
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,060
And he told me a story that he is in love with this girl who had come there with him and his friend.

312
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,920
This cute little blonde blue-eyed girl.

313
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,220
And as he's telling me this story,

314
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,900
out of the fog,

315
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,240
comes strong,

316
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,040
strolling in a long white wedding dress.

317
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,880
This girl that he had a crush on.

318
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,600
And I was like,

319
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,100
How you doing, darling?

320
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,520
And I laid a little bit of the legume mojo on her.

321
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,600
And next thing you know, I'm walking away with her back to my tent.

322
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:47,360
And we get about 30 paces away from the little pyramid.

323
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,620
And I said, Hey, wait a minute.

324
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,380
I've changed my mind.

325
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,100
Take a hike.

326
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:51,840
Sister.

327
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,600
And I went and I sat back down next to Gintu.

328
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,560
I said, You wanted that so bad and you could never have it.

329
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,680
And I just picked it right up off the ground and...

330
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,500
I blew it away before I could even figure out what I wanted to do with it.

331
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:09,880
And...

332
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,860
He was kind of...

333
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,960
He was kind of...

334
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,980
He was kind of shot down by that.

335
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,960
I said, Man, all you need to do what I just did...

336
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,220
Is the balls to pick up the...

337
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,600
Is the balls to pick up the ball.

338
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:21,600


339
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:21,600


340
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:21,600


341
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:21,600


342
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:21,940
You're going to spike yourself.

343
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,040
I said, Come here, boy.

344
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,900
And we went back to that spike again.

345
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,960
He was like, Oh, fuck.

346
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,440
Here we go again.

347
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,980
And we went up to that spike.

348
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,760
And I sat that spike down on that stump.

349
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,100
I said, Give me your hand, boy.

350
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,440
Give me his hand.

351
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,920
I picked that spike up and I put it in his hand and I put mine down on the stump.

352
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,320
I said, Raise that spike up.

353
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,080
He raised it up real high over my hand.

354
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,840
And I looked at him.

355
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,860
I said, How's that feel?

356
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,100
And he said, How's that feel?

357
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,200
I said, Good.

358
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,140
It feels really good.

359
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,200
He said, That's all you ever needed to do, boy, was pick up the spike.

360
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,280
After that, his life completely changed.

361
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,420
He would come to me all the time for advice.

362
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,200
He was like, I don't know what I'm going to do when I get out of college.

363
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,560
I said, Well, what are you majoring in?

364
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,280
I said, Philosophy.

365
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,140
I picked up the yellow pages.

366
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,780
I threw it down on the table and I said to him, Hire me a philosopher.

367
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,080
He said, I'm going to be a philosopher.

368
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,080


369
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,080


370
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,080


371
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,080


372
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,280
I said, I'm going to be a philosopher, boy.

373
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,060
So he changed his major to philosophy, science.

374
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,060
He changed to library science.

375
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,000
He ended up getting a really good job with the city of Philadelphia.

376
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,280
Because he had the balls to pick up the spike, he eventually found a girl who he liked even

377
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:40,680
more.

378
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,640
They've been married ever since.

379
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,600
He had contacted me at one point.

380
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,520
He said, Dr. Lagune, my girlfriend really likes to raise horses and she's thinking of

381
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,060
dropping out of school to become a doctor.

382
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,260
I'm a horse groomer.

383
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,240
I said, Tell her to stay in law school.

384
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,780
In a few years, she'll own her own horse.

385
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,200
She took my advice, stayed in law school, works for the prosecutor's office of the state

386
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,860
of New Jersey and owns her own horse.

387
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,100
And the two of them have been happily together ever since.

388
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,140
So there's a happy subgenius story with lots of terror and fear in it.

389
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,300
Cautionary tales of the subgenius.

390
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,080
Praise Dobbs upon that.

391
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,760
And then there was that guy that Reverend Stang stabbed in the throat.

392
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,060
And the two of us had to load into that van during the Slack Crusade and had to throw

393
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,560
him on that railroad trestle just to make it look like an accident.

394
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,420
I'm so glad the statute of limitations on murder is only seven years.

395
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,040
Only seven years.

396
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,500
Wait a minute.

397
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,640
There is no statute of limitations on that.

398
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,480
No, there isn't.

399
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,860
Man, it's a good thing this is all just one big joke, isn't it?

400
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:00,520
Huge.

401
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,340
He is a master of the royal mind rape of the normals.

402
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,220
He truly is.

403
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:16,440
And to prove that, I'm going to take a plunge and play you a tape, which I will have to

404
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,400
severely and probably most clumsily ever.

405
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,400


406
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,520
Edit for profanity and boring stretches.

407
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:32,420
A tape of Dr. Legume initiating a young would-be subgenius.

408
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:38,980
He was a dues-paying subgenius, but well, until we got through with him, you might call

409
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,880
him sort of a praise Bob, gimme slack spouting Bobby.

410
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,460
He's just a young feller.

411
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,960
Young Reverend Josh.

412
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,360
I can understand that.

413
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,120
I was the same.

414
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,400
I was the same.

415
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,700
I was the first of the Bobbies myself.

416
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,320
I was initiated just, well, in rather a different way.

417
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,720
It took longer in those days.

418
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:03,600
Dr. Legume, over a period of a year, developed this initiation.

419
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,800
And I cannot give you the final punchline and I cannot play the end of the tape because

420
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,500
that would ruin it for everyone else.

421
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,920
But the buildup to it is quite nice, hopefully.

422
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,000
This is assuming I edit it well.

423
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,740
To set the scene.

424
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:27,700
This happened at a place that those anti-cultists, if they could see it for half a second, would

425
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:33,880
flip their lids, drop their drawers, and bend over giving up forever because the power of

426
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,920
the cults would look so attractive to them.

427
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:45,300
I'm talking about the Starwood Festival in rural New York, held in the woods at a big

428
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,660
sort of campground in rural New York.

429
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,260
Every year.

430
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:56,720
The Starwood Festival actually is more like Mondo 2000 come to life, with a smattering

431
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:03,200
of witches and druids doing their corny thing here and there, and sort of cyber weirdos

432
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,380
doing their spectacular things here and there.

433
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,260
There are always subgenius revivals.

434
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,600
It's one of my favorite events.

435
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,360
I love it.

436
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,320
It's good, clean fun.

437
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,800
Especially since they have hot showers and so forth there.

438
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:17,880
Anyway.

439
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:26,320
Friday night, I believe it was, at the festival, very, very late, Dr. Legume rattled my tent

440
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:33,360
door, woke me up, said, Reverend Stang, I got young Reverend Joshua primed.

441
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,760
He's going to go through the initiation.

442
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,440
Grab your tape recorder and let's do it.

443
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:45,920
So I come hobbling out of the tent with my little handheld deck stuck in my pocket with

444
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,780
a mic clipped to my belt buckle.

445
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,360
And we meet Reverend Josh in the woods and stride off across this field in the dead of

446
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:54,560
night.

447
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,120
Now, while you're listening to the tape, keep in mind that it is a stormy night.

448
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,040
It's not raining, but there's thunder and lightning and the wind is whipping pretty

449
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,380
hard.

450
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,600
You may hear that on the mic.

451
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,220
And on top of that, I mean, this is a pagan sort of festival.

452
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,440
There is drumming going on all the time.

453
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,240
Primitive.

454
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,220
Protos.

455
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:17,860
I don't know.

456
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,580
There's a lot of zermatic drumming.

457
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,820
The drumming of Ahor.

458
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,680
Like something to summon the demons from below hell.

459
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,440
Actually, there's not a Satanist around.

460
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,160
A lot of subgeniuses.

461
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:34,440
And well, let's just go to that tape before I take up any more time.

462
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:40,160
And then after that, we will hear just some more, much more slickly recorded material

463
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,180
from Radio Shorts, the Apocalypse Now Opera.

464
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,380
But for now, let's go into the show.

465
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:47,960
And I hope you'll join me in a moment of silence.

466
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,560
I'm going to take a moment to just listen to that horrible replay of the disgusting

467
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,920
and terrifying for this young man.

468
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,820
Because you know, he didn't know Dr. Legume and he didn't know me.

469
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:06,260
And he's like this college kid from up north who has come to see his subgenius heroes preach.

470
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,640
They probably weren't his heroes when all was said and done.

471
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
But knowing this, of course, Dr. Legume and I cranked up our fierce redneck.

472
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:16,980
Uh.

473
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,180
I don't know if you've heard of the movie, uh, Accents to the Max.

474
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:20,360
Uh.

475
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,880
Legume's appearance I have described.

476
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:29,780
I nowadays kind of look like David Koresh crossed with Charlie Manson crossed with Howard

477
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,240
Stern.

478
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,220
And uh.

479
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:39,000
It just the sorts of things, you know, these sort of tattooed covered rednecks, the kind

480
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:45,740
who would most easily intimidate a trusting young Yankee.

481
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:46,960


482
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,540
So, we go now to those tapes.

483
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,500
Thank you.

484
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,340
Which kid is this?

485
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,080
Do I know him?

486
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
His name is Joshua.

487
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,700
Oh yeah.

488
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,460
Okay.

489
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,580
Joshua is standing over here.

490
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,460
Oh right.

491
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,100
He's ready for his test of faith.

492
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,200
Yeah, I want to see this.

493
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,320
Reverend, I'm Stank.

494
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:08,760
Yes.

495
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,480
Yeah, we're going to go before you touch the face.

496
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:10,480


497
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:10,700
Howdy.

498
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,800
I am Joshua.

499
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,680
Yeah.

500
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,860
Have we met before?

501
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,760
Uh.

502
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,220
I bought a tape from you.

503
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:16,940
Showed it to you.

504
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:16,940


505
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:16,940


506
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:16,940


507
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:16,940


508
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,080
I bought it from you.

509
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,560
You know, I was talking to some friends.

510
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,740
They really, they haven't been able to sit down for a week.

511
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,120
Oh.

512
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,820
Uh huh.

513
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,880
Had a party.

514
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,080
I won't be able to do all kinds of things for a week after this.

515
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:28,760
Yeah.

516
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,120
The old subgenius test of faith.

517
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,780
So, you really like Bob.

518
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,020
You talk about Bob an awful lot, don't you?

519
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,760
It's time to go have your chat with Bob ourselves.

520
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,160
Why not?

521
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,480
What do you say?

522
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,340
It's not illegal to, to talk with this man, Bob.

523
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:46,920
I'm not saying that Bob is a bad guy.

524
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:46,920


525
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:46,920


526
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:46,920


527
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:46,920


528
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:46,920


529
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:46,920


530
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,080
Yeah.

531
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,780
His, his.

532
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,840
You might be seeing him face to face if you're not careful.

533
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,160
They always want to get close to Bob.

534
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,600
As long as it's face to face and not some other.

535
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,800
They always got the spike to Orcus.

536
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,300
Oh no.

537
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:00,640
To Orcus.

538
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,280
Oh no, no.

539
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,640
Nothing like that.

540
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,680
Young Joshua pulls out a toy plastic knife.

541
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,380
Come, let's take a walk over to where I can find a place where the screams run around

542
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:10,600
us.

543
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,840
The boys now walk to a, uh.

544
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,920
We need like a tape.

545
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:16,920


546
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,800
A table or a altar or something.

547
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,360
There's a little area right over here with a whole bunch of.

548
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,580
You don't want to use a car code.

549
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,880
Yeah, let me stop here.

550
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:30,320
Um, Dr. Legume is leading us over to an, what basically looks like an altar in the middle

551
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,980
of a field far, far away from where anybody could hear the screams of pain.

552
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,960
And so, therefore it's rather spookier, you know.

553
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,680
The, the kid, there, there really isn't anybody around to help him.

554
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,660
It's very, very dark.

555
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:46,920
And very, very dark.

556
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,260
And very stormy and spooky.

557
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,460
And in the middle of this field is like a teepee frame.

558
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:59,760
It was later used to fill up with logs, uh, and where, so that the gigantic bonfire could

559
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,200
be created on that spot.

560
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:11,200
But this, um, Friday night, it was just this mysterious looking, uh, bunch of long logs,

561
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,460
uh, set, lashed together in sort of a teepee shape.

562
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,940
And in the center were.

563
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:20,610
Well, was one very large stump.

564
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,330
A chopped off stump forming sort of a table.

565
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,610
Kind of a mysterious altar thing.

566
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:27,430
So let's.

567
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:30,210
It's got this cute little plastic plate to visit it out.

568
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,110
I have a stake that is irretractable.

569
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,530
Oh man.

570
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,330
Dr. Legume is displaying.

571
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,810
Yes, it is the original test of faith spike.

572
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:40,790
The spike.

573
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:41,170
Whoa.

574
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,570
That's what you used on the last guy?

575
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,110
Yup.

576
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:43,790
This.

577
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,050
It's a good thing I only had to do the gong job.

578
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,050


579
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,050


580
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,050


581
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,210
I was just going to say, this is a bar.

582
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:51,110
This spike, dear friends, is like a railroad spike.

583
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:55,250
A stainless steel, very sharp spike.

584
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,030
About, oh, nine inches long.

585
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:58,990
I've got a lighter.

586
00:27:59,390 --> 00:27:59,810
That's okay.

587
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:00,510
I've got a blindfold.

588
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:01,750
Oh, that's right.

589
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,350
That's right.

590
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,470
I forgot about the blindfold.

591
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:06,230
Here's a suitable piece of wood.

592
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,850
What is this thing?

593
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,590
Is this like, oh, this is the, where they, uh.

594
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,990
This is where we're going to sacrifice.

595
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:12,850
That's right.

596
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,870
We can't sacrifice my friend.

597
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:16,030
Yeah.

598
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,030


599
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,030


600
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,030


601
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,030


602
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,030


603
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,710
I'm going to sacrifice my friend.

604
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:17,810
I'm not going to sacrifice you.

605
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:17,810


606
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,430
I told you, I told you a thousand times.

607
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,070
Whoa.

608
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,030
Yeah, this is good.

609
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:23,470
Yeah.

610
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,230
This is just right.

611
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:24,930
Man.

612
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,150
Man, it's pre-made.

613
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:32,190
A little bit of blood will bring them forth.

614
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:36,650
A lot of blood will, whoa.

615
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,510
This is, they've been doing some maypole.

616
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,850
Look at this, look at this stump.

617
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:43,810
Come on.

618
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:44,430
The sacrifice.

619
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:44,830
The sacrifice.

620
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,890
The sacrifice, yeah.

621
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,410
The sacrifice.

622
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,430
Check your soul at the door, boy.

623
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:52,430
Okay, so you want to know what the test of faith is all about.

624
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:53,850
Okay?

625
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:59,170
I'm going to take your hand and I'm going to hold it down here on this table.

626
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,510
Okay?

627
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,850
And I'm going to do it.

628
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,390
I'm going to do this left-handed because I'm right-handed.

629
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,530
I can't even legally drink yet.

630
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,950
You'll need to after I get through with you here.

631
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,510
Your nuts will drop after this.

632
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:15,510
Yeah, I have to do this left-handed.

633
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,450
Okay, give me your hand.

634
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,510
Put it down here on the table.

635
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,770
Okay, here's what I'm going to do.

636
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:35,790
I'm going to take this spike and I'm going to drive it into this tree stump without touching your hand with a head full of LSD.

637
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,430
A dangerous witness right here who will collaborate to anything that I say.

638
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,970
And a blindfold.

639
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,290
I swear.

640
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,610
And all you have to do.

641
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:51,050
To the altar of Almighty God that if any mention of blood.

642
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,670
Oh, man, you're in the wrong place for that.

643
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,490
You think you're safe here?

644
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,390
Oh, man, you're going to.

645
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,250
Well, it just wasn't me talking.

646
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,150
Look at this.

647
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,410
Here's this guy who loves Bob so much.

648
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:09,910
This guy loves Bob so much and here he is talking to God.

649
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,490
Is he talking to Bob now?

650
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:15,650
Now when he's facing having this spike driven right through his hand Jesus style?

651
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,290
Well, prayers ain't going to do much good no matter who it is.

652
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,250
You don't even know who I am, do you?

653
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,490
You probably only heard horror stories from all the other preachers about me.

654
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,750
I come hopping into your life like a fluffy little bunny of love.

655
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,030
Yeah, do it, do it.

656
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:28,490
It's okay.

657
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,930
You saw that movie Aliens?

658
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,750
Did you see Aliens?

659
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:34,190
Yeah.

660
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:38,110
Where the android can go ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba like that?

661
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,310
It's sort of like that.

662
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,470
But it's not.

663
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:45,610
It's, you know, not, he didn't try to get in between each finger or anything like that.

664
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,450
He only has to do it once.

665
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,690
I only have to do it once.

666
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,310
That's right.

667
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:56,390
Now, it could be that I just really, really get off on inflicting all of these big Jesus holes in people's hands.

668
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:03,870
That would be a common characteristic among men who wander around the pagan festivals with church, Catholic priest collars on.

669
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,610
They have a thing for stigmata.

670
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:06,950
Okay?

671
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,910
So I may just get off on doing this.

672
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,630
And I may do it just for shits and giggles.

673
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:15,110
And it doesn't matter because he's got the shovel and I got the trash bags.

674
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,330
So nothing bad is going to happen on us one way or another.

675
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,030
No one will ever know.

676
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,730
All you got to do, man, is have faith and put your hand out here on this wall.

677
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,190
Yeah, you're trusting in God.

678
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,890
This is, this will pretty much determine whether you get on the escape vessels or not.

679
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:34,970
And they are real.

680
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,570
This is going to make or break.

681
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:42,070
Your seating category.

682
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:51,590
Can this event itself actually determine the foreshadow of the future?

683
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,490
Well, we assume you got your membership pack, right?

684
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,210
Was once future untold.

685
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,210
Did you get your membership pack?

686
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,190
Did you ever order the $20 membership pack?

687
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,010
Yes, I have my ordained membership card in the church of the subgenius.

688
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,410
Oh, well, you've got nothing to worry about.

689
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,230
You've got nothing to worry about.

690
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,990
Except for right now.

691
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,810
Oh, not if he has faith.

692
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,770
That's the whole thing.

693
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:26,350
Look, the only ones who are going to get ruptured up on X day are the ones who can watch the other subgeniuses bursting into flame and screaming and hold their membership card and say, I'm not going to tear it up.

694
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,350
I have faith.

695
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,070
I'm just abandoning the shell.

696
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,130
It's like taking your shoes off.

697
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,450
It's as easy as that.

698
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:34,350
It'll be just like taking off a glove.

699
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,930
You'll have a new body aboard the escape vessel.

700
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,310
You'll even have a new hand.

701
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,170
Is that how it was said to you originally?

702
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:48,310
Or, well, you don't think all these dark storm clouds and the wind around here are just for dramatic purpose, do you?

703
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,350
Just coincidence.

704
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,370
The drums don't mean anything.

705
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,290
No, they don't mean anything.

706
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:58,450
Just whatever you do, don't say yog safa three times during the ceremony.

707
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,330
What's the matter, man?

708
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,930
You keep pulling your hand off of the stump.

709
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,070
Are you nervous?

710
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:06,530
Consider it.

711
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,290
I'd be damn nervous if I were you.

712
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,550
I'd be going, God damn it, Bob, I know you're there.

713
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:12,550
I know you're there.

714
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,790
Find out.

715
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,310
Find out if Bob's there.

716
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:18,910
Hey, you wanted to talk?

717
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,510
I know he's there.

718
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,390
You know he's there.

719
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:20,530
We all have the scar.

720
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,210
Somewhere, wherever he is.

721
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:22,950
Oh, man.

722
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,190
Wait a minute.

723
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,270
You have a layer on you?

724
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:25,950
That much I don't know.

725
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,870
All I know is it was very similar to this.

726
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,610
It was a long time ago.

727
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,470
Look.

728
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:31,470


729
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,090
About, uh, uh, uh.

730
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,090
Where is it?

731
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:35,590
I was.

732
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,190
It's right in the middle of the back of my hand.

733
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:38,270


734
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:38,270


735
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,410
Oh, yeah, sure enough.

736
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:40,550
Yeah.

737
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:41,970
Your shows.

738
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,710
Mine doesn't show.

739
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:43,690
Yeah.

740
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,570
Eventually it heals.

741
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,190
Well, actually, it's, you can't tell because of all the other ones.

742
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:49,750
Sort of.

743
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,830
Well, you know, the Yeti biology, we can absorb these things pretty well.

744
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,430
Hey, man, I just started.

745
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,890
Somebody was not Yeti by some strange coincidence.

746
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:56,130
Bring it along.

747
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:01,990
If this guy had no Yeti blood in him, then, oh, man, I'd hate to think Alf'd up

748
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,190
with me if I stuck this spike in him.

749
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,350
At this point, I have no friend in the universe.

750
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,350
It's Yeti blood.

751
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,670
You have no friend in the universe?

752
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,090
Bob is your friend.

753
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:08,250
Bob is your friend.

754
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:08,250


755
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:08,250


756
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:08,250


757
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:08,250


758
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,350
You paid him 20 bucks to be your pal.

759
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:16,190
But will he be the pal of young Reverend Joshua?

760
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:19,330
We'll find out on side two of show.

761
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,530
What do you mean?

762
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:30,650
Friends, we now return to the initiation of young Reverend Joshua at the hands of Dr.

763
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,550
Legume at Reverend Stan.

764
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,190
It's like a halfway faith.

765
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,910
It's a halfway knife.

766
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,730
You know, it's like being halfway pregnant.

767
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,230
There's no way.

768
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:38,650
There's no such thing.

769
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,030
It's all or nothing.

770
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,410
It's all or nothing, man.

771
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:42,150
All or nothing, man.

772
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,070
You gotta be willing to spill your blood on the stump for Bob.

773
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,330
Twenty dollars plus all.

774
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,590
Or nothing at all.

775
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:52,850
I mean, hey, man, the blood that soaks into this stump could be your own.

776
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:53,610
Go for it.

777
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,290
He's gonna prove this guy's got balls.

778
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,990
What blood type are you?

779
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:58,770
Jeff, by the way.

780
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:03,010
Well, see, that's the one thing, you know, when I was in New York and he was facing me

781
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,870
with that gun, I didn't bother to ask.

782
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:08,230
You would face a man with a gun, but not a knife.

783
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,270
Not a priest with a spike.

784
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,330
That's been said.

785
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:14,010
A cop in Baltimore actually said the same thing about tentatively inconvenience.

786
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:18,230
He said, I'd rather face a man with a gun than what I saw in that tunnel.

787
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:21,610
And it was just artwork, is all the guy was doing.

788
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,470
It was just artwork.

789
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,030
It was the worst smelling.

790
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:24,570
It's all performance art, man.

791
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,610
Yeah, it's just performance art.

792
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,270
It's just a gag.

793
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:26,830
You're part.

794
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,050
Like Penn and Teller, you know.

795
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,670
It's just a.

796
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:32,090
And you, young Joshua, your part is the bleeding man.

797
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:33,730
Yeah.

798
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,110
Yeah, you drew the wrong card, man.

799
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,770
When you pulled the wild card, you got.

800
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,030
You were.

801
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,530
You came up a joker.

802
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,310
Some are aces, some are jokers.

803
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:41,570
Yeah.

804
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:46,190
Does that mean that I'm going to be like impaled on this piece of wood just for your

805
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,170
sick amusement?

806
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,610
Bob's a joker too.

807
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:49,810
Bob is a joker.

808
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,050
People think he's an ace, but he's really a joker.

809
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:52,470
Yeah.

810
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,270
So, you know, he's your friend.

811
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,910
So, is Bob going to be your friend, man?

812
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:58,850
You paid him.

813
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:02,490
Yeah, or is Bob going to go, man, he came so close.

814
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:02,870
Keep it up.

815
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,050
He came so close.

816
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:04,670
Keep it up.

817
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,630
Keep it up.

818
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,850
He's talking to Bob again.

819
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:07,550
Keep what up, Bob?

820
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,390
Bob's not listening to you, man.

821
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:09,830
Keep what up, Bob?

822
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,050
You ain't put your hand on the stuff.

823
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,390
Bob's got Connie.

824
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:16,370
Bob's going down on Connie somewhere back in those trees over there.

825
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,090
I don't know why he does this to me.

826
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,770
He just circles buzzwords around my head and leaves me alone.

827
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:24,370
Yeah, that's, well, you won't do that anymore after this.

828
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,030
Oh, no.

829
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,510
That's what I'm hoping.

830
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,090
That's right.

831
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:27,630
Or kill me.

832
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:27,770
Or carry me.

833
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:28,270
There you go.

834
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,130
He's getting there.

835
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:29,970
He's getting there.

836
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:30,730
There's hope.

837
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:31,410
There's hope?

838
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,310
Okay, let's get this over with.

839
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,530
Come on, get tired of this.

840
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,790
Yeah, this is getting kind of old, man.

841
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,310
Well, I figured you guys probably wouldn't be ready to interpret the word dogs the way

842
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:40,310


843
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,530
He may not have that special spark.

844
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,270
He might have to go into it.

845
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,930
You are never going to get another chance like this.

846
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:56,130
He might have to go hard when he became this smiling face above my head while I was looking

847
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:56,610
at him.

848
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:57,590
He's babbling.

849
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,890
He's scared to death now.

850
00:36:58,890 --> 00:36:59,230
There's laughter.

851
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,350
Come on, stick your hand on there.

852
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,230
Stick your hand on there.

853
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:01,290


854
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,230
Okay, there you go.

855
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:02,690
There.

856
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,750
I'm going to hold him in place.

857
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,750
I'm going to hold him in place.

858
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:04,850
Wait a minute.

859
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:05,350
Wait a minute.

860
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:05,910
Okay.

861
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,190
I got to put on the blinds.

862
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:07,730
Put on the blinds.

863
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:07,730


864
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:07,750
Put on the blinds.

865
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,250
Put on the blindfold.

866
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:13,610
J.R. Bob Dobbs and the flowers were sort of like spinning, grinning Dobbs heads while

867
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,090
they were looking around.

868
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,550
The final instruction.

869
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:16,750
The flowers were sort of like spinning, grinning Dobbs heads while they were looking around.

870
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:16,750


871
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,150
Looking down at me, this grinning figure.

872
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:20,450
Oh, okay.

873
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,630
Very important.

874
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,870
What was that?

875
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,230
What was that?

876
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:24,490


877
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,050
Okay, go ahead.

878
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,530
Dr. LeGames told him to keep his hands clear.

879
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:28,530


880
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:28,530


881
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:28,590
Keep it up, Bob.

882
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,290
Keep it up.

883
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,570
Because I didn't want to accidentally impale him while I was trying to impale you.

884
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,030
Keep it up.

885
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:34,870
Yeah, that's okay.

886
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:35,190
Okay.

887
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,630
The trembling is perfectly normal.

888
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:37,730
Okay.

889
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,750
I've trembled all my life.

890
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:39,190
No, okay.

891
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:40,250
See what I mean?

892
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:40,490
Yeah.

893
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:40,930
All right.

894
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,650
Dr. LeGames is lining up for the...

895
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,450
Your hand isn't on the stump anymore.

896
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:44,850
Your hand...

897
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,030
Look, his hand left the stump.

898
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,650
Is Bob keep pulling your hand off of the stump?

899
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:47,970
Why are you pulling your hand off of the stump?

900
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,650
It is not Bob that pulls your hand off...

901
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,810
Bob is drawing your hand to the stump.

902
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,610
Nege is pulling your hand from the stump.

903
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,530
Bob, good one.

904
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,710
Go towards the light.

905
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,170
There you go.

906
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,250
Okay, now put it there.

907
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,170
Now don't move it.

908
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:00,710
Don't move it.

909
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,430
All right.

910
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,490
Dr. LeGames is lining up.

911
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,270
Okay.

912
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,710
He's pulling the blindfold down.

913
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,250
I told you not to watch your fingers.

914
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,010
Captain Zegematic.

915
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,590
He's down into...

916
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,310
All right.

917
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,390
Okay.

918
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,270
Standing by.

919
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,090
Wait a minute.

920
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:18,490
Wait a minute.

921
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:18,650
You want a countdown?

922
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,270
Your blindfold?

923
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,110
I didn't see you put that blindfold on.

924
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:21,930
Excuse me, sir.

925
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,290
Don't move your hand.

926
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:23,550
Excuse me, sir.

927
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:23,990
Don't move your hand.

928
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,610
Excuse me, sir.

929
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,110
All right.

930
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:26,610
That blindfold...

931
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:26,910
Test of faith.

932
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,390
Test of faith?

933
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:29,850
Where's your faith at?

934
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,490
What do you mean, excuse me, sir?

935
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,410
Excuse me who?

936
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,370
Are you talking to me?

937
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:34,710
Are you talking to Bob?

938
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,790
I felt a moment of doubt in this situation.

939
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:37,230
I'm sorry.

940
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:37,230


941
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:37,230


942
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:37,230


943
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:37,230


944
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,210
Your faith in Bob is shaken, isn't it?

945
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:39,650
As such, the faith was shaken.

946
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,790
Don't ask for forgiveness whatever you do, man.

947
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:42,750
Don't pray.

948
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,290
Don't pray.

949
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,710
That's the worst thing you can do.

950
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:49,330
They will draw down just the ones you don't want to be hearing you pray.

951
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:49,550
That's it, man.

952
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:54,070
They'll juice out of you like a stump will when I get done.

953
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:54,830
Okay.

954
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,850
I felt a moment of doubt.

955
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:58,210
No, no.

956
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:58,730
That's okay.

957
00:38:58,970 --> 00:38:59,930
They always do.

958
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,230
They always feel the moment of doubt.

959
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:01,650
He did.

960
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,450
You can barely see that scar.

961
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:05,790
Yeah, this is true.

962
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,150
Reverend Stang.

963
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:06,430
Reverend Stang.

964
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:07,530
Okay.

965
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,250
I just want to make sure that you don't move.

966
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:09,990
Is this really necessary?

967
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,650
Yes, this is.

968
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:12,250
This is vital.

969
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,010
This is the most necessary thing that has ever happened to you in your life.

970
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,450
It's a beautiful thing, man.

971
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:20,570
No, no.

972
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,170
Go ahead.

973
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:21,590
Go ahead.

974
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,550
Now he's getting horrible stomach cramps of doubt.

975
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,350
No, you have to put him right back there.

976
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,530
We're getting big stangs of doubt and pain.

977
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,170
Yeah.

978
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:30,990
That's it.

979
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,310
He's got thousands.

980
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,090
Here you go.

981
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,790
All right.

982
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,130
Now don't move your fingers.

983
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,070
Don't clench your fingers.

984
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:37,650
No, man.

985
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:38,130
All right.

986
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,490
On your mark.

987
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:40,190
No way.

988
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:40,450
Get set.

989
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,290
In the name of J.R.

990
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:46,210
Bob Dobbs, Connie Dobbs, and the X's fighting team of Tova One.

991
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:57,870
And at that point, dear friends, in deference to the delicate sensibilities of the listener,

992
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:04,290
we tastefully must cut away and move on to other things.

993
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,050
I will say that Reverend Stang.

994
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:13,970
Joshua did not only survive, he passed the initiation with flying colors and in fact

995
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:23,010
went on to accompany Dr. Legume at that selfsame anti-cult festival where he comported himself

996
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:33,050
in accordance with the dignity and terrifyingness that is the birthright, yes, of the true subgenius,

997
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,030
the son or daughter of the Yeti.

998
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:43,810
So hail the good Reverend Joshua and certainly the great Dr. Legume.

999
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:50,170
As for what tape we will be hearing next, I have no idea.

1000
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,250
Thank you.

1001
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:58,130
Now, Reverend Stang's radio show got canceled recently down in Texas.

1002
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,410
Acid is groovy.

1003
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,350
Kill the pigs.

1004
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:06,010
Well, it got canceled down in Texas by some nice man named Dr. Legume.

1005
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,330
He was a man named Bobby who said that his show did not empower the common man.

1006
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,050
Oh, no.

1007
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,710
It doesn't empower the common man.

1008
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:23,530
Well, I'm standing right here to tell you that this man's wrong because, hell, if it wasn't

1009
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,790
for Reverend Stang's Church of the Subgenius, I'd have climbed that damn tower long ago

1010
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:28,370
with a rifle.

1011
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,090
Some of us already did.

1012
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:34,330
Yeah.

1013
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:35,290
And...

1014
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:42,130
The church has come in on a lot of hard times recently and they need money.

1015
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:44,630
Lots of money.

1016
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:45,550
Lots of money.

1017
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,070
Lots and lots of money.

1018
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,690
And you all could think that...

1019
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:47,850
We all need money.

1020
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:53,090
You all could sit back and think, oh, it's another sales pitch for Reverend Stang.

1021
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:59,630
But, hey, the longer Reverend Stang can put out the word, Bob, the longer there's going

1022
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:03,670
to be people like me who are ready to climb the damn tower who are going to look around

1023
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,270
and they're going to say to themselves, hey, we're going to do this.

1024
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:09,110
Hey, it's time to take back what's mine.

1025
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,890
It's time to take back my slack.

1026
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,290
Does anybody here want to take back their slack?

1027
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:18,610
Because you ain't going to just have it handed to you.

1028
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,530
You got to take that slack.

1029
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,750
You got to take that slack back.

1030
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,150
Oh, yeah.

1031
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,630
Oh, yeah, little man.

1032
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,410
We will see you with the spike later.

1033
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:34,070
And you will see how well Bob will protect you.

1034
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:37,630
See, I have my happy Bob shirt on today, don't I?

1035
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,930
Oh, oh, I love Bob just as much as you.

1036
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:47,750
Come into the darkness with me and my spike and I will show you how much Bob loves you,

1037
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:48,290
little man.

1038
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:51,010
He'll deprogram you Bob style.

1039
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,610
You can laugh.

1040
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:59,630
You can point your finger and you can talk about good old Bob and how happy it is that

1041
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,950
you're out here with Bob.

1042
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:07,650
And you can sit there and sing your happy little songs about Bob and the bleeding head

1043
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:08,570
of Arnold Palmer.

1044
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:14,390
But when that spike is sinking through your palm and you're whistling in the wind like

1045
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:18,990
Jesus or finding some new way to jump off like this through your stigmata hole.

1046
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,310
I like that.

1047
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:27,290
And we'll see where Bob's going to take you.

1048
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:29,790
And we'll see if Bob's going to protect you.

1049
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:33,850
And we're going to see if you want your $60.

1050
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,330
You want your triple your money back?

1051
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:39,970
I tell you, if I had a bag full of 20s, I'd go through this crowd right now and I'd give

1052
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:42,050
half of you your damn $60 back right now.

1053
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:42,930
By the harvest.

1054
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:43,730
Oh.

1055
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:49,210
I'll be carrying my garbage out in a bag made of all of your skins tonight.

1056
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:52,530
Oh.

1057
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:55,990
Oh yes, Bob will have a use for you.

1058
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,670
He'll make you into a corn on the cob hole.

1059
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,410
He'll make you into a corn on the cob holder, little man.

1060
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,650
He may make you into a corn on the cob holder.

1061
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:09,410
You guys have to believe me, that was old history.

1062
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,930
He'll make you the back end of his rotisserie.

1063
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:20,190
Okay, this one's another one that takes a little bit of time to tell, but it is by far

1064
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:27,290
the weirdest fucking thing that has happened to me since I joined the church of the subgenius.

1065
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:28,890
Weird me out.

1066
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:36,370
And it happened one Christmas when I had to beat up a man with no legs.

1067
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:45,310
It was, had to have been 1990 or so.

1068
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:51,730
I had a friend, Reverend Spider, who had introduced me to the church of the subgenius.

1069
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:59,230
He gave me a copy of Hour of Slack number 51, the long awaited subgenius anti-drug special.

1070
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:06,830
Nobody had internet back then, so it was a tape of a tape off a radio that was sent

1071
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:10,890
from somebody to somebody else and then copied and sent to his brother and sent to me.

1072
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,830
And that was how he had gotten me into the church.

1073
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:17,770
And there's a long story behind that that I'll tell at another time.

1074
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:26,850
But, Reverend Spider had joined the army and the first Gulf War was about to start and

1075
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,210
Reverend Spider was a pretty cool guy.

1076
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:32,230
I liked him, but he wasn't very bright and he wasn't very sturdy.

1077
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:38,690
And so, Short Frank, my friend, and I decided to drive out to California and to Fort Ord

1078
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:44,530
from New Jersey and break both of Reverend Spider's legs so that he wouldn't be able

1079
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:45,930
to be sent off to war.

1080
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,450
That was our Christmas present to him.

1081
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:51,950
Short Frank was mean.

1082
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:56,190
Short Frank was a mean, pissy, angry young man.

1083
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:59,190
We called him Short Frank because when he was 12 years old, he was a little boy.

1084
00:45:59,190 --> 00:45:59,510
He was five years old.

1085
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:03,070
He got hit by a train and both of his legs were cut off at the knee.

1086
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:09,870
He was about 5'7", without legs.

1087
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:21,650
With legs, he would have been probably about 6'6", 6'7", and probably about 325 pounds.

1088
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:25,650
He was like a pro wrestler that needed to be continued.

1089
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:29,170
And we are doing this.

1090
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:32,950
We're driving across country, having a good old time, me and Frank are tight pals and

1091
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:33,130
all.

1092
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:37,670
And we made it as far as Flagstaff, Arizona.

1093
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:44,910
And, never having been to Arizona, our picture of Arizona was pretty much what we saw in

1094
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:45,870
Roadrunner cartoons.

1095
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:50,130
We didn't think of snow in Arizona at all.

1096
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:53,210
But here it was, Christmas in Flagstaff.

1097
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,390
We stopped there for the night.

1098
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:59,150
And that night, a storm came and dumped three feet of snow.

1099
00:46:59,150 --> 00:46:59,150


1100
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:06,170
And the next morning, when I watched the weather report, there was another three feet

1101
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:08,310
of snow that was going to arrive that night.

1102
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:18,610
Well, in order to not be stuck in Flagstaff, Arizona for the entire winter, I decided,

1103
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:22,950
I would, we decided to dig the car out and make a run for it before the other storm hit.

1104
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:26,150
So I went out and I started to dig the car out.

1105
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:27,910
And this motel door opened.

1106
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:29,130
And four or five roads were closed.

1107
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:29,210
And I was in the middle of the road.

1108
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:34,630
And I saw a really nice Amish or Mennonite, I'm not sure which, men came out with shovels

1109
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:38,730
and helped me dig that car out and push it out to the end of the parking lot where I

1110
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,450
could take off.

1111
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,150
And so I went back and I knocked on the door.

1112
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:45,310
I was like, come on, Frank, I'm ready to roll.

1113
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:47,770
And he came out and snapped.

1114
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,550
I don't know where it came from.

1115
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:52,150
He just started screaming at me.

1116
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:53,810
Ew, what the fuck, man?

1117
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:54,690
What's your problem?

1118
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,470
If we get trapped somewhere, I'm going to die in this car.

1119
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,110
I was like, we're not going back.

1120
00:47:59,110 --> 00:47:59,110


1121
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:03,790
I was like, Frank, I am not staying in this fucking town with you until springtime.

1122
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,670
I was like, if you want to stay here, fine.

1123
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:07,990
But I'm taking a fucking car to the airport.

1124
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:11,090
And he said, fuck you, man.

1125
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:11,670
It's on.

1126
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:12,810
And he shoved me.

1127
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:16,110
And I said, there's no way I want to do this.

1128
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,470
I don't want to sit here wrangling with this guy.

1129
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:20,870
What do I do when Short Frank wants to fight?

1130
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:24,470
Well, Short Frank didn't really give me much choice.

1131
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:28,410
And so faster than Short Frank could even think,

1132
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:32,230
I hit him twice so goddamn hard in the head

1133
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:36,330
that the first shot took a chunk out of his forehead right at the eyebrow

1134
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,350
about the size of a quarter that he still has missing.

1135
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:44,090
The other one hit him right here in the cheekbone next to the eye

1136
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:46,750
and blackened it and knocked him cold.

1137
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,910
And I looked up from where I was hitting him,

1138
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:54,170
and I was right in front of a giant plate glass window.

1139
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,490
And on the other side of it,

1140
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:58,050
all of the Amish women and children

1141
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:59,910
were pressed up against the glass

1142
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:03,410
with looks of utter aghast horror on their face.

1143
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:07,490
I'd just beaten up a man with no legs on Christmas in front of them

1144
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:10,890
after their dads helped me dig out the car.

1145
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:12,910
And I grabbed Short Frank,

1146
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,250
and I dragged him by the wrist to the car,

1147
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,330
and I loaded him in there.

1148
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,070
I just kidnapped the son of a bitch

1149
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:19,670
right in front of all these people,

1150
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:21,750
got in the car, and drove off.

1151
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:24,410
We got onto the freeway,

1152
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:26,590
and it was treacherous as fuck.

1153
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:28,350
There was snow everywhere.

1154
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,350
There were cars off the embankments.

1155
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:32,730
There were gasoline trucks jackknifed.

1156
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:34,710
All kinds of dangerous shit out there.

1157
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:37,110
And I'm creeping through these cars

1158
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:39,290
going down out of the Rocky Mountains.

1159
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,590
And when I'd get to a low enough elevation

1160
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:42,590
where there was no snow,

1161
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:44,590
I'd stomp it up to 100 miles an hour

1162
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,930
and gun it down that mountain.

1163
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:49,650
And then it hit the snow 25, 10 miles an hour

1164
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:51,390
and back down 100 miles an hour.

1165
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:53,710
Did this for about 10 hours.

1166
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,570
Got to the bottom of the mountain,

1167
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:59,670
and I guess the part I had forgotten to mention

1168
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:01,570
was when Frank woke up, he said,

1169
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:04,050
I just want to let you know that if we crash anywhere,

1170
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:05,310
I'm going to murder you.

1171
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:06,710
I said, deal.

1172
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:08,770
It's a deal.

1173
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:09,450
It's good.

1174
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:10,410
I'll get us out of here.

1175
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:11,910
Well, we made it to California,

1176
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,750
so I was like, well, I promised I'd get you out of there

1177
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,970
without getting the car wrecked.

1178
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:19,490
Well, getting to California,

1179
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:21,290
I looked around, and there was nothing.

1180
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:22,530
Nothing but flat.

1181
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:25,110
And I was pretty sure that if I got beyond that,

1182
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:26,410
there was even more flat.

1183
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:29,570
And I looked down, and the gas gauge was on E.

1184
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:32,710
And I start thinking to myself, hmm, what do I do now?

1185
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:35,810
I mean, I promised him I'd get him down the mountain,

1186
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:37,670
but so my deal's good.

1187
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,290
What do I do if I run out of gas here

1188
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:42,590
now that we're in California

1189
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:44,670
before we can get where we're going?

1190
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:46,690
I go, I know.

1191
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,950
I'll just say, well, let's pull over to take a piss,

1192
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:51,790
and when Frank gets out, I'll just take off.

1193
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:54,210
I get 300, 400 yards, he'll never catch me.

1194
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:58,870
So I'm thinking about this,

1195
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,150
and suddenly on the horizon, a light blinks up.

1196
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:03,290
And I'm like, huh.

1197
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:05,530
I wonder what the hell that is.

1198
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:08,270
Drive down toward it, I'm hoping, I'm hoping,

1199
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:11,110
and there in the middle of nowhere is a crossroads.

1200
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:14,430
There's nothing to be seen for as far as you can see

1201
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:16,350
except for one gas station.

1202
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:21,050
And I'm like, oh, damn, Bob, thank you.

1203
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:24,550
We had been, as an aside,

1204
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:27,430
we had been driving across country, staying at motels,

1205
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,390
and at every motel, I would take the mirror

1206
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:30,730
off the bathroom wall

1207
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:34,350
and spray paint a Dobbs head on the wall behind it

1208
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,790
and then put the mirror back.

1209
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:39,470
We pulled up carpets and sprayed them on the floors.

1210
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:41,770
We painted them on the underside of mattresses.

1211
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,170
We took the ceiling tiles out

1212
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,490
and painted on the inside of the acoustical tiles.

1213
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:49,450
Well, Frank goes in to take a piss.

1214
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:51,150
He comes out of the bathroom, and he says,

1215
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,890
man, you gotta see what is in that fucking bathroom.

1216
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:55,550
I was like, well, what is it?

1217
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:57,610
He's like, just, you just gotta look.

1218
00:51:58,270 --> 00:51:59,830
And I went into the bathroom,

1219
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,990
and I walked up to the stall to take a piss,

1220
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:04,830
and there about six and a half feet up the wall

1221
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:09,630
is a picture drawn in Sharpie marker of a little dog.

1222
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,130
And hanging out of that dog's ass

1223
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,330
is the back end of another little dog.

1224
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:17,010
And underneath of it, it said,

1225
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:19,970
written in little black Sharpie scrawl,

1226
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,590
sometimes life is just like that.

1227
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:25,150
Praise Bob.

1228
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:29,610
So I certainly was aghast, you know.

1229
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:32,650
I mean, what are the odds of being in that situation,

1230
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:35,170
escaping just by the sheerest of luck,

1231
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:37,370
and at the bottom of it, in a pisser,

1232
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:40,550
far too high on the wall to have been done by a short Frank

1233
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:42,210
in the ten seconds he was in there,

1234
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:44,590
trying to arc up into the urinal.

1235
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,050
So, uh...

1236
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:53,870
That was probably one of the defining things

1237
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:56,330
that made me stick with the church throughout the years,

1238
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:57,810
is knowing that somewhere,

1239
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:00,750
there's some kind of weird magnet

1240
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:04,490
that keeps sticking to me whenever I get near Bob.

1241
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:11,730
Praise Bob.

1242
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:16,270
Thank you for your testimony, Dr. LeGim.

1243
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:20,330
That was a wonderful chance to get a recording

1244
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:23,390
of the short Frank.

1245
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:25,610
The Frank story, and those other ones.

1246
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:27,670
The hidden magnet.

1247
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:30,110
That's your secret to subgenius success.

1248
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:34,310
In case you're wondering about whether we actually made it to California,

1249
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:36,790
we made it to California.

1250
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:40,790
We pulled into Monterey, where my friend was stationed at Fort Ord,

1251
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:43,570
and we didn't end up breaking his legs.

1252
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:46,410
But from that trip, I learned that

1253
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:50,410
you can scream loud enough in a motel to attract the police,

1254
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:52,330
and a human shinbone

1255
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:57,130
will actually flex really, really far without breaking.

1256
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,430
But when you do that,

1257
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:01,370
the screams just get louder.

1258
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:03,470
So we decided to hell with it.

1259
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:05,430
He could take his chances with Uncle Sam.

1260
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:07,110
Uh...

1261
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:11,230
One of the other weird things that happened is, uh...

1262
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:13,450
As soon as we got into town,

1263
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,290
and this is Monterey, California, mind you,

1264
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:20,990
all the...everything froze, and the crops all died.

1265
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:23,270
The orange crop was destroyed.

1266
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:25,990
Everybody in town's pipes burst and exploded.

1267
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:30,150
Coincidentally, about the time that this guy,

1268
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:35,650
this giant, tattooed, shaved-headed biker with no eyebrows

1269
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:38,430
rolled into town with his strange,

1270
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:41,990
sawed-off little legless friend with the facial wounds.

1271
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:48,050
So we got a lot of really strange looks from the locals,

1272
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:50,950
and we tried to keep as low profile as possible.

1273
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:55,910
I saw them building the giant, you know, straw man with no legs

1274
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:57,530
that they were gonna burn in the middle of town.

1275
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:00,570
I decided that we'd better cut our visit short.

1276
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:04,710
But on the way back, we went through El Paso

1277
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:06,450
and ate at Burger God Hunger Fucker.

1278
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:09,330
Oh, right! Yeah, there were hardly any of those.

1279
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:11,510
That is an amazing piece of luck,

1280
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:14,870
because those were only open for, like, a couple of months

1281
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:17,590
in, uh, three states, I think.

1282
00:55:17,810 --> 00:55:20,930
Oh, Burger God the Hunger Fucker was a...a fun place.

1283
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:24,910
It was a fast-food restaurant owned by Dobbs back in the late 80s.

1284
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,770
Yeah, they...they, uh...

1285
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:30,850
He also, uh, manufactured a beer

1286
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:33,650
called Beer God the Thirst Fucker.

1287
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:36,090
And the thing was, of course,

1288
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:39,950
you couldn't call things that in the late 50s.

1289
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:42,750
That was just totally insane.

1290
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:46,330
And all his lawyers and the trademark people, everybody said,

1291
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:48,170
you know, what, what, don't do it.

1292
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:50,310
But he...he said, no, it's the wave of the future.

1293
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:52,090
The wave of the future. Wave of the future.

1294
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,330
It's the way it's gonna be.

1295
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:54,990
And, uh...

1296
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:55,890
He was 100% right.

1297
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:58,590
Yeah, he was ahead of his time.

1298
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:03,870
Uh, and, of course, the business failed terribly

1299
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:08,190
because of the weird peculiarities of insurance

1300
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:12,990
and some other completely unrelated lawsuits

1301
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,030
involving all of the investors.

1302
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:19,030
He ended up making a lot

1303
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:23,290
of, uh...a lot more than he lost.

1304
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:28,110
Uh, it's...it's hard to describe how these things work out.

1305
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:31,470
You know, rich people understand these things,

1306
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:35,690
or they hire people who...who can work all that stuff out.

1307
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:38,430
I've noticed that the Church of the Subgenius

1308
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:40,910
doesn't have many of those.

1309
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:45,310
All that aside, though, it was a hell of a fucking burger,

1310
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:46,390
let me tell you.

1311
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:47,730
This thing...

1312
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:49,890
I couldn't believe the size of it.

1313
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:52,890
It was like a meat Frisbee between two pancakes.

1314
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:55,730
I ordered, like, two double cheeseburgers,

1315
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,010
me and a great big-ass biker.

1316
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:59,130
We ended up having...

1317
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:00,990
I put one of them under the car seat

1318
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,310
and ate it in Louisiana.

1319
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:06,070
And it was still good.

1320
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:07,970
Actually, it was still warm,

1321
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:11,470
which is strange to leave a hamburger under your car seat

1322
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,910
for two days in the dead of winter

1323
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:14,410
and have it come out piping hot.

1324
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:16,070
But I guess that's just the...

1325
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:17,450
How much were...how much were they?

1326
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:19,350
It was a dollar seventy-five.

1327
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:21,770
I think each one of those sandwiches

1328
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,750
had to have weighed at least four pounds.

1329
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:27,170
It's like he had gotten a recipe for a quarter pounder

1330
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:29,530
and he, like, torn one of the numbers off of...

1331
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,590
Does that shit all the time, doesn't he?

1332
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:35,610
Tears one number off everything, fucks everything up.

1333
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:36,410
That probably shouldn't...

1334
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:37,550
It shouldn't have been a four pounder,

1335
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:38,830
it should have been a quarter pounder.

1336
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:40,590
It should have been...

1337
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:43,710
I'm surprised it wasn't a 40 pounder for 15 cents.

1338
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:45,590
The heart fucker.

1339
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:47,430
I heard they had a real special, though.

1340
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:52,830
For $35, you could get 1,998 of those hamburgers.

1341
00:57:55,990 --> 00:58:00,750
Coincidence or conspiracy?

1342
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:02,370
The thing is, though, that was true.

1343
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:07,390
And three times 666 is 1,998.

1344
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:09,510
Or two times 999.

1345
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,450
Or six times 333.

1346
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:14,510
All those add up to 1,998.

1347
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:16,030
You're confusing peas.

1348
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:19,490
You denounced numerology as entirely bogus.

1349
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:20,330
It's all coincidence.

1350
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:21,290
Yes.

1351
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:25,430
This was set in motion by God at the Big Bang

1352
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:28,770
so he could sit back and experience all of it.

1353
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:34,230
Including the bad trips when people figure it out

1354
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:37,010
and go, oh, Jesus, fuck, what have I done?

1355
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:41,230
But you probably already knew that.

1356
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:43,710
Praise the late Dr. Legume,

1357
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:46,230
the subgeniuses he saved,

1358
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:47,490
and Bob.

1359
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:49,490
And you can, too,

1360
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:54,770
friends, at subgenius.com.

1361
00:58:56,090 --> 00:58:58,930
See you on the sauces.

1362
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:07,970
Okay, friends on the internet,

1363
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:10,910
where I can flog or swag legally,

1364
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:13,670
if you want to help yourself

1365
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:16,050
and the Church of the Subgenius

1366
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:18,150
and get a pretty cool package

1367
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:21,150
with like 25 different nifty things in it,

1368
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:22,910
like pins and bumper stickers

1369
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:24,470
and a real preacher card,

1370
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:28,010
you need to go to subgenius.com

1371
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:30,610
and click to become a minister.

1372
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:34,610
You'll see photos and a list of all the stuff you get.

1373
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:39,090
And you really do get to go to the Scrub Genius Forum,

1374
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:40,430
which is members only.

1375
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:42,250
And where we talk in ways

1376
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:44,010
that people don't talk on Facebook.

1377
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,950
Much, much smarter ways, ironically enough.

1378
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:48,750
Isn't that funny?

1379
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,150
We also have things like T-shirts

1380
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:53,030
and damn near everything you can think of

1381
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:54,390
with Bob's face on it.

1382
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:57,550
That and a huge selection of other subgenius graphics.

1383
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:01,690
And we sell several very weird DVDs and CDs

1384
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:02,850
of the Bob songs

1385
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:06,510
and old MP3 stashes of this show.

1386
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:08,230
And best of all,

1387
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,850
from our main online store,

1388
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:12,310
you can buy the book of the subgenius,

1389
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:14,950
which is by far the greatest thing we've ever done.

1390
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:17,530
It's an actual Simon & Schuster book,

1391
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:20,350
22 bucks in print for over 30 years.

1392
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:22,570
And every copy that we send out

1393
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:24,610
is signed by yours truly.

1394
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:25,930
For that matter,

1395
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:27,710
your address on the puffy envelope

1396
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:29,450
is handwritten by me also.

1397
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:30,810
Keep my fingers nimble.

1398
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:32,770
That's subgenius.com

1399
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:33,310
and remember,

1400
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:34,970
it's only money.
