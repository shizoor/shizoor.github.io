1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
Are you too stupid to see what's going to happen? I know what's coming. Have I got to beat you to make you understand?

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,880
It's the Super Genius Powerball Squadron!

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,060
It's going to end more horribly than anything in all history.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,580
That much I know.

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,860
Hello, you're on the air.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,760
The show is low.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,880
How low can you go?

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,660
You're about to find out because you're here on the Puzzling Evidence Program and this is your moment of challenge.

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,540
Zero! We've got one billion! You've got zero!

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,220
Number one!

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,540
The show rules!

12
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,600
The show rocks!

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,940
We're going to whip your butt real good!

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,400
Okay, so we'll do that guy.

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,460
Yes, the show rocks.

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,520
Indeed.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:53,840
Hello.

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,480
And now it's time to relax to the cabana for the cocktail hour.

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,960
We're in Washington, D.C. and remain calm, everybody.

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,620
All these crazy kids out on the street today, they'll protest anything.

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,560
They'll be anthrax.

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,920
And you know, I'm kind of behind them. I love those crazy, beautiful bastards.

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,940
Yeah, all those people out there trying to fight cancer, I don't get it.

24
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,720
Why do they protest against cancer?

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,340
What's wrong with cancer?

26
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:17,800
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,740
Because it's unfair.

28
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,540
You're deluded, Mike.

29
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,560
The American spirit revolts against anything.

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,800
You've got what we call Michael Pepe.

31
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:23,960
Michael Pepe is.

32
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,440
Not a square deal.

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,800
Where you think that everything is fair and beautiful and nice.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,980
And it is.

35
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,400
But it isn't designed for you.

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,000
This is how much you get.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,060
Designed for unknowable purposes.

38
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,320
The little numbers assign the value for your life.

39
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,680
Think of the king cobra, for example.

40
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,580
And the order squamata.

41
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,360
It's a different map of the U.S.

42
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,300
With more little numbers.

43
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,280
Family elapidae of the genus and species Ophiophagus homa.

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,360
It's a Bob Nelson.

45
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,440
It is without question.

46
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:53,600
It's the original.

47
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:53,780
It's the original.

48
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:53,780


49
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:53,780


50
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,500
It's a boing like a snake.

51
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,740
The largest venomous snake in the world.

52
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,460
Growing length of almost 16 feet 5 inches.

53
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:10,400
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob is the man.

54
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:19,440
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob is the man.

55
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,080
Now everybody.

56
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,120
Bob, Bob.

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,680
Bob, Bob Bob, Bob

58
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,540
Bob Bob Bob, Bob

59
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,580
Bob Bob Bob Bob

60
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,140
Bob Bob Bob Bob

61
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,140


62
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,420
Blah

63
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:30,720
Blah

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:30,980

00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,200

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:34,680


73
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:34,860
Blah

74
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,700

Blah

77
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,100
Blah

78
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,980

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,280
Blah

81
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,280


82
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,280


83
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,280


84
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,280


85
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,880
Blah

86
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:41,880


87
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,600
Blah

88
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,260
Blah

89
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:45,920
Blah

90
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,640
Blah

91
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,260
Blah

92
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,060
Now everybody

93
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,220
rockin' that beat

94
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,460
Now everybody

95
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,160
rockin' that beat

96
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,060
What does the book say about that?

97
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,020
Well, follow in your book and repeat after me

98
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,460
as we study our subgenius doctrine and dialogue.

99
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,660
Well, it says,

100
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,840
the pipe in the face forever.

101
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,660
That's all you need to know is that the pipe will remain in the face.

102
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,160
Was that by John Philip Sousa?

103
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,120
And to keep,

104
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,080
smoking. The pipe must keep smoking.

105
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,080
We, the subgenii,

106
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,080
are Bob's tools for keeping the

107
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,560
plan in sync between

108
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,840
the totally fated future events

109
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,000
and events that happen accidentally

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,880
in the present.

111
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,080
If one follows the implication of this to its

112
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,220
core, it can, by its non-existence,

113
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,180
teach to those able to

114
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,160
discern it, the true secret of

115
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,200
Dobbs. Only by taking

116
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,180
the most circuitous possible route

117
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,180
can we increase the probability

118
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,180
of the impossible.

119
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,320
Only from the step above can the present

120
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,140
step be seen and understood

121
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,440
in context. At least we know

122
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,040
that much.

123
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,600
Sounds like a little doctrinal purer

124
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,680
than thou, if you ask me.

125
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,180
Well, it's the church, after all.

126
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,260
I'm sorry, that's the way we have to be

127
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,200
when you're going back to the pamphlet.

128
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,640
You know, this is a little bit of a

129
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,280
swing to the right for subgeniuses.

130
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,320
They're not used to it because they spend most of their

131
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,200
time in a state of total slack.

132
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,980
Ah, yes,

133
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,100
that total stream of slack.

134
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:48,580
I'm off.

135
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

136
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,300
If you say it really fast, it doesn't really matter.

137
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,000
To the interpretation of the word, you've got to get the word.

138
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,540
Okay, so you've got to straighten that out.

139
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,860
So let's straighten that out right now, right here, tonight.

140
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,360
Okay.

141
00:04:59,500 --> 00:04:59,800
Okay.

142
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,540
Which they contained in a magnetic bottle.

143
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,800
Had this containment failed,

144
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,480
a possible

145
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,620
catastrophic explosion

146
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,940
might have occurred.

147
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,940
Though this is denied by sweaty scientists.

148
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,260
Yeah, don't worry about it, come on.

149
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,160
It says that he could see like it in no way,

150
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,040
not do anything about it.

151
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,080
Like the end of all time, who cares?

152
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,940
The evil side.

153
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,660
Okay, that's where we're going now.

154
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,260
There we go.

155
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,280
Oh, that's an old hag's tail.

156
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,100
They don't actually do that.

157
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,040
What are they doing, Star Trek?

158
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,280
All last week across the media landscape,

159
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,520
in pod,

160
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,380
blog,

161
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,820
flat screen,

162
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,060
and crunkly old newsprint columns,

163
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,240
fatuous professional observers complained that the occupants,

164
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,860
the high wall street marchers,

165
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,280
have no clear agenda,

166
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,080
or can't articulate their positions.

167
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,820
What impertinent horse shit.

168
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,580
I saw a statement on one wall street occupiers sign that said it all.

169
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,800
$70,000 college debt.

170
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,560
$12,000 medical bills.

171
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,620
I'm 22.

172
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,440
Where's my bailout?

173
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,240
What part of that is under the law?

174
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,240


175
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,240


176
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,820
My daughter is 14 years old.

177
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,180
What part of that does that even mean?

178
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:30,280
Oh, kom butler what am I even doing here?

179
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,020
I shouldn't be here, I want to,

180
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,020


181
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,020


182
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,080
If I'm unaccompanied,

183
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,280
I feel very ambushed.

184
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,460
I would enjoy spending my time.

185
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,300
Here I come.

186
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,680
This is not the nation I was born in.

187
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:37,680


188
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,960
I had to cover up for being a girl in with promos.

189
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,500
Excuse my tongueن

190
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,220
I suppose the ad forının

191
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:48,220


192
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:48,220


193
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:56,600
governed, Reverend Martin Luther King, bumped off, and even won U.S. Attorney General, Ramsey

194
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:05,280
Clark. Today, the entire establishment, is a clueless, hopeless, blob of self-interested,

195
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:13,120
craven opportunism. Even the arty fringe, the people who pretend to be an avant-garde,

196
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:22,600
are nothing but narcissistic, self-branding operations, masquerading as culture leaders.

197
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,400
There's so much influence over our government, they will never be held accountable until

198
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,480
the people stand up and beg for justice.

199
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,060
Justice! Justice! Justice!

200
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,940
We can televise, you know, the, um, all of the protests in the Middle East, but we can't,

201
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,540
this is happening in our own backyard, you know, and why is this on TV? Why?

202
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,460
There are a bunch of people basically gambling with all of our futures, and I don't agree

203
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,920
with that. I don't consent to that.

204
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,100
Our politicians no longer represent the people of our country.

205
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,700
They represent us, the people. The voice of the people has not been heard.

206
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,140
These people are out here talking about things that affect everybody. Problems with the banking

207
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:25,580
system, problems with politics, um, my 401k plan, your 401k plan, problems with how that

208
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,060
all works.

209
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,620
I lost my job, and I lost my health insurance. Um, I'm, I sort of have a social safety net

210
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,000
from the unemployment insurance, which citizens pay for. This is a difficult story to tell.

211
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,120
And that is still an unfolding story. And I think until there's a compelling narrative

212
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,260
of why people have decided to peacefully occupy Zuccotti Park, I think it's very hard

213
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,900
to communicate that story to everyone else.

214
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,300
Eric and Ferrari got that for us. Thank you, Eric.

215
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,620
Continuing now with Michael Moore. I asked Will Bunch this question last time. We have

216
00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:01,580
diversion to you tonight. That's 2,000 or 550 tea partiers there protesting taxes or

217
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,480
protesting stimulus or anything else they don't like on Wall Street. It's on the evening

218
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,180
news, isn't it?

219
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,100
Oh, absolutely. Um, you wouldn't need that many tea partiers there. They're not going

220
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,100


221
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,660
to be there. It would be a top story. Um, and, and same thing a couple of weeks ago

222
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:23,420
when a thousand environmentalists were arrested at the White House. Uh, imagine a thousand

223
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:31,200
tea partiers arrested. This, um, I don't, I can't speak for why the networks, uh, have

224
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,040
not covered this. This is really the very first down on Wall Street in the financial

225
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:42,080
district, the very first attempt since the crash of 08 to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to,

226
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,120
to, to, uh, take a real stand. And, um, it's been powerful. And, and I gotta, I gotta

227
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,740
believe that even though it may only number in the hundreds right now, this is going to

228
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,180
grow not only on Wall Street, but in communities all over America. And I would encourage people

229
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,200
watching the show to think about, okay, you can't make it to New York city, but there's

230
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,300
a branch of Chase Bank in your town. There's a branch of Bank of America and there's nothing

231
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:12,060
preventing you from organizing a demonstration outside that branch with your bank.

232
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:17,160
signs, with possibly even civil disobedience, to make your voices heard.

233
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,040
They think they're going to get away with this.

234
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,840
These people who stole the pension funds of the American public, who stole their money,

235
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,260
who stole the future of our kids and grandkids, they think they're kleptomaniacs, and they

236
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,340
think they're going to get away with it.

237
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,160
They have taken our democracy and formed it into a kleptocracy.

238
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:40,540
And if we don't stand up, if we don't have our voices heard, believe me, they're not

239
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,040
done yet.

240
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,860
There's a reason why corporate America, and I think you've pointed this out before, they're

241
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,040
holding $2 trillion of cash in their bank accounts.

242
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,140
They've never done this before.

243
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,780
Never held on to that much.

244
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,460
They've taken that money out of circulation, and they're waiting.

245
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,920
They know the other shoe's going to drop.

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,740
And as Mayor Bloomberg said last week, he said there's going to be riots in the street.

247
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,360
If we don't provide jobs right away, there are going to be riots.

248
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,040
Now, this is Mayor Bloomberg, the billionaire, talking.

249
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,000
This isn't Michael Moore saying this.

250
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,980
This is Mayor Bloomberg.

251
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,080
This is Mayor Bloomberg saying this.

252
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,880
They know, and the smart rich know, they can only build the gates so high.

253
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,340
And sooner or later, history proves that people, when they've had enough, aren't going to take

254
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:22,700
it anymore.

255
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,980
And it's much better to deal with it nonviolently now, through the political system, than what

256
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,100
could possibly happen in the future.

257
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,560
Well, what's left of America's democratic system if this is the process that has been

258
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,240
cemented in place?

259
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,100
If you think you're a big man.

260
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,520
America will punch you if you're just a little girl.

261
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,140
America will punch you if you like rocks on the beach.

262
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,880
America will punch you.

263
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,300
America will freaking punch you.

264
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,600
If you think you're a big man.

265
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,920
America will punch you if you're just a little girl.

266
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,600
America will punch you if you like rocks on the beach.

267
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,380
America will punch you.

268
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,700
America will freaking punch you!

269
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,880
So punch, America punch!

270
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,480
Punch, America punch!

271
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,520
Paul Revere will punch you!

272
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,780
Jesse James will punch you!

273
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,240
America will freaking punch you!

274
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,320
If you look her in the eye

275
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,000
America will punch you

276
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,080
If you forget to wear a tie

277
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,680
America will punch you

278
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,640
When you're on your way to school

279
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,320
America will punch you

280
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,780
America will freaking punch you!

281
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,820
So punch, America punch!

282
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,440
Punch, America punch!

283
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,580
Kennedy will punch you!

284
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,760
Calvin Klein will punch you!

285
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,280
America will freaking punch you!

286
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:24,080
Dr. Spock, Carole King, Jerry Lewis, Martin Sheen, Jimmy Stewart, Tiger Woods, Mr. T, Mary Worth, John Wayne, Isaac Hayes, Willard Fillmore, Willie Mays

287
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,760
They're all gonna freaking punch you!

288
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,600
So punch, America punch!

289
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,240
Punch, America punch!

290
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,400
Terry Ford will punch you!

291
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Richard Drew will punch you!

292
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,960
I hope you're ready to get punched!

293
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,800
Ugh!

294
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,700
The first issue I want to speak with you about is the recent clashes that have taken place on Wall Street

295
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,800
between Americans who are turning out to demonstrate and police officers.

296
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:06,220
From what I read, you recently sent a message to support the campaign

297
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,800
and the activists of this group called Occupy Wall Street.

298
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,280
You've called them courageous and honorable.

299
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,300
Can you talk to me about your take on Occupy Wall Street?

300
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,100
Well, Wall Street was just a shorthand for the financial institutions.

301
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,560
The banks are bigger and richer than before.

302
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,240
Corporate profits are reaching record levels.

303
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,080
And unemployment is about the level of the Great Depression.

304
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,180
Real unemployment.

305
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,920
These people are saying, oh, let's blame the corporate.

306
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,800
And the institutions behind them.

307
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:43,560
So fiscal policies like taxation, rules of corporate governance, deregulation and so on.

308
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,100
It does set in motion a vicious cycle which is getting worse and worse in New York.

309
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,040
So walk down the streets and you can see it.

310
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,260
Very serious poverty.

311
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,060
On the other hand, phenomenal wealth.

312
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,700
Right side by side.

313
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,100
Very much like a third world country.

314
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,080
It's what you see if you go to sub-Saharan Africa.

315
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,900
Meanwhile, infrastructure is down.

316
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,460
Architecture is collapsing.

317
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,440
Schools are collapsing.

318
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:14,600
And all of that increases the, keeps the cycle going and in fact rising.

319
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,000
Well, it's about time for some protest.

320
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:25,420
What may be new in the coming year for the 2012 election is that many, including yourself,

321
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:32,000
have speculated and assumed that the campaign spending for the U.S. election in 2012

322
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,500
will exceed $1 billion.

323
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,360
For each candidate.

324
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:36,880
For each candidate.

325
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,960
That is a massive amount.

326
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,520
It will probably be much bigger than that.

327
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,980
And where does that come from?

328
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,020
Well, you know, basically a lot of it comes from financial institutions.

329
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:53,340
In fact, if you look at the 2008 election, what swung Obama, what gave him the election,

330
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,340
was primarily financial institution contributions.

331
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,940
They preferred him to McCain.

332
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,140
They expected to be paid back.

333
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,900
And they were.

334
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,260
And the next one will be even worse.

335
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,640
It's not that they're rich.

336
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,680
It's that they're influencing the system.

337
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,700
They're gaming the system.

338
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,300
That they're fighting against the bigger corporations because they've gamed the regulatory process.

339
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,520
They've gamed the politicians.

340
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,560
They've gamed the system so badly that you can't have competition anymore.

341
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,720
And that's what this is about.

342
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,800
This is not an anti-capitalist movement, per se.

343
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,160
You know?

344
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:30,940
This is...

345
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:37,820
This is a movement about equality and democracy and liberty and justice and the rule of law.

346
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:43,860
Those are deep democratic principles that have been completely forgotten.

347
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,140
I have my problems with the whole system.

348
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,560
I mean, the whole way it's set up.

349
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,780
You have to get the money out of the system.

350
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:56,260
The message of this group is actually a populist movement.

351
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,340
And it isn't being funded by...

352
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,200
The Koch brothers or Dick Armey.

353
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,340
It doesn't have that kind of political agenda.

354
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,920
This is not the Democrats, okay?

355
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,400
This is not the Republicans.

356
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,080
And so, they don't know what to do with that.

357
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,960
And so, the Democrats are not going to be in power.

358
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,660
They're going to be in power.

359
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:52,320
And so, the Democrats are going to be in power.

360
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:59,400
And so, the Democrats are going to be in power.

361
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:09,800
I'm along monitored, it works, it works.

362
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,680
I am onarnish of learning.

363
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,480
I am on-"

364
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,960
If you have to take things to temperature,

365
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:14,960


366
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,400
The only way to answer is to keep the rest of the everyone list as best as possible.

367
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,820
So, next time I stay at the party, we'll have Dan—

368
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,420
Jeremy Russell, I'll call her.

369
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:19,420


370
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,820
T temple…

371
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:20,820


372
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,740
No, that provides...

373
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:23,740


374
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:23,740


375
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,260
To keep you free from the franchise.

376
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,740
still in spin

377
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,540
and there's

378
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,820
no telling

379
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,020
who that it's

380
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,680
naming

381
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,700
for the loser

382
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,260
now will be

383
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,220
later to win

384
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,320
cause the times

385
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,920
they are

386
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,060
changing

387
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,200
changing

388
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,820
come senators

389
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,100
congressmen

390
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,240
please heed the call

391
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,200
don't stand in

392
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,280
the doorway

393
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,060
don't block up the hall

394
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,220
for he that

395
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,300
gets hurt will be

396
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,720
he who has

397
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,620
stalled

398
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,700
cause the battle

399
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,980
outside

400
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,180
raging

401
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,620
will soon

402
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,520
shake your windows

403
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,080
and rattle

404
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,500
your walls

405
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,560
for the times

406
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,280
they are

407
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:34,420
changing

408
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,040
, and we're

409
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,300
out here at the edge

410
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,000
of Bernie Manor

411
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,920
and we are

412
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,800
we are

413
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,720
we are

414
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,080
in the

415
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,160
middle

416
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,780
of nowhere

417
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,360
of nowhere

418
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,640
of nowhere

419
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,380
I've seen

420
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:12,880
nothing

421
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,340
but nothing

422
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,180
at all

423
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,120
we've got

424
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,140
nothing but

425
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,480
the

426
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,980
do is

427
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,460
no

428
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,860
one

429
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,280
more

430
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,180
talent

431
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,180


432
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:39,880
we

433
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


434
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:39,880


435
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,360
take

436
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:40,440
it

437
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:40,920
over

438
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,280
sudden

439
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,980
combat

440
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,500
was

441
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,160
not

442
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,260
a t valores

443
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,080
we did not save

444
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,440
Tim spoke you! Let Bob know you!

445
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,440
He regularly grooms his eyebrows.

446
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,820
Please!

447
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,580
I'll be loud!

448
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,640
When it's not up to the individual, it's up to the chap.

449
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,420
Please!

450
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,180
He's a god.

451
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,820
He is a god.

452
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,100
He's really not a god.

453
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,260
Bob, he regularly grooms his eyebrows.

454
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,700
Slack! Slack! Slack!

455
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,280
Let's talk about Slack.

456
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,900
What about Slack?

457
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:28,880
Slack is a group of people who love to talk about their problems.

458
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:28,880


459
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:28,880


460
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,800
I'm glad to hear it.

461
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:35,240
I'm glad to hear it.

462
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,040
That's what I'm talking about.

463
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,040


464
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,040


465
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,320
I love it.

466
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:37,800
I love it.

467
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:37,960
I love it.

468
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,320
I love it.

469
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,960
I love it.

470
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,980
I love it.

471
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,620
I love it.

472
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,700
Thank you.

473
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,320
Thank you.

474
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:57,620
Thank you.

475
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,400
Thank you.

476
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,280
Yes, dear friends.

477
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,100
This version of Brazil in the background

478
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,540
is a rather unusual piece

479
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,680
considering that it's by the same name

480
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,940
as Psychoskeletons.

481
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,460
They don't usually sound this way.

482
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,360
I was going to do credits over this.

483
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,680
Dave is waiting to get on the line here.

484
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
And I still do have credits to go.

485
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,980
In fact, I think what I'll do

486
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,800
is bring that one down.

487
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,800
And that means now we can get to the man Dave.

488
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,740
But you did do the credits, didn't you?

489
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,040
No, actually, I didn't.

490
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,300
That version of Brazil sounded

491
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,280
so good that I decided

492
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,780
to just let it play.

493
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,220
The Psychoskeletons did that.

494
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,660
Here, I'll do the credits real quick, Dave.

495
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,320
Friends, this is our Slack number,

496
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,540
1,331.

497
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,900
There have actually been at least,

498
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,060
well, no, we had some reruns.

499
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,360
But we've had some X-rated ones

500
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,520
that some of you can't hear.

501
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,960
You'd have to go to subgenius.com

502
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,480
for that.

503
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,980
The long collages there

504
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,040
were by

505
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,080
Reverend Phineas Narco,

506
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,220
of National Cynical Radio

507
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,040
podcast, which is,

508
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,520
he does at least weekly, I think.

509
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,180
Usually there's one

510
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,000
right after the hour of Slack.

511
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,040
Live.

512
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,180
And this was from his

513
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,120
one on the

514
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,300
Occupy thing.

515
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,160
Although it had, that's a song

516
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,380
by Bob Dylan and Noam Chomsky

517
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,620
talking. Noam Chomsky?

518
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,740
He sounded like a robot.

519
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:13,860
Noam Chomsky?

520
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,740
Noam Chomsky?

521
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,220
Noam Chomsky?

522
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,440
Noam Chomsky?

523
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:18,700
Noam.

524
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,680
Noam Chomsky and other

525
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,920
people on there. What else?

526
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,060
Oh, did you hear, Dave,

527
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,700
that song by the Little Girls,

528
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,380
America Will Punch You?

529
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,660
Well, the Little Girls are, you know,

530
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,420
yes, I did.

531
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,040
I was saddened by it. I almost

532
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,080
wept, but that was because I had

533
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,700
my hand caught in the toaster. But yes,

534
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,020
it's a true,

535
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,000
it's a true, true perception of the

536
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,960
world we live in.

537
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,260
Well, we saw those

538
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,200
two little girls perform.

539
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,840
They're not as little as they were when they

540
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,900
recorded that song, although they did that song.

541
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,660
We saw them at the Northeast Ohio

542
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,760
Witches Ball. Yes, we witnessed

543
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,160
it. Last weekend.

544
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,660
And or known as Con

545
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,420
on the Cob in Hudson,

546
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,920
Ohio. There were some great bands

547
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,620
at that, and I haven't had time to

548
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,840
sort through all the CDs I was

549
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,680
given. Those girls don't have a CD.

550
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,580
They're called Shy Show.

551
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,800
I got that off their website.

552
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,020
The name is spelled S-H-I

553
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,780
S-H-O

554
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,060
Sci Show.

555
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,440
Or Shy Show.

556
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,260
And they're now 14

557
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,340
and 11, respectively.

558
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,500
And they've been playing together for

559
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,640
seven years, and they opened

560
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,600
for them. For seven years!

561
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,760
And they opened for

562
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,920
They Might Be Giants. Can you believe

563
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,220
that? And they're not

564
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,800
micro or macrocephalic like so many

565
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,780
of the indigenous people that we've been using

566
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,720
lately for the, you know, slavery and

567
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,240
especially in Hudson, Ohio.

568
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,040
Yeah. Where they used to mill the rocks

569
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,740
and carry them uphill with one donkey

570
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,880
and about 500 slaves. No, they

571
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,920
didn't have slaves in Hudson. It was abolitionist

572
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,920
all the way. It is.

573
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,420
It was. Oh. Well,

574
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,700
before, we also

575
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,860
heard, well, there was a

576
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,860
lot of National Cynical radio, which

577
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,240
you can catch at NationalCynical.com.

578
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,680
Thanks to Phineas.

579
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,820
Yay, Phineas Narco.

580
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,340
Puzzling Evidence Show was

581
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,640
represented. Thanks to

582
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,700
somebody finally cutting up those two-hour

583
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,800
shows, besides the

584
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,680
large. Bob Nelson,

585
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,640
the guy who actually had that show

586
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,860
first before it was a subgenius show.

587
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,780
And then it got taken over

588
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,680
by Puzzling Evidence, and

589
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,700
Nelson left, and now he just

590
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,780
calls in and listens and cuts in the

591
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,580
parts that he is on.

592
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,660
And that's how I ended up with those.

593
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,700
It's a

594
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,680
drastically valuable resource

595
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,700
for practically everyone in the Bay Area.

596
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,720
If you listen to...

597
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,900
Yeah, if you're up at four or five in the morning.

598
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,700
Exactly. After about

599
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,780
20 beers. And there was a

600
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,300
song at the very beginning,

601
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,800
Bob is the Man, a kind of a

602
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,600
queasy

603
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,400
song. That was by

604
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,300
someone called the

605
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,540
Cryogenic Strawberries.

606
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,800
And I don't... You'd have to look

607
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,380
them up. The Cryogenic Strawberries.

608
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,760
They apparently are a

609
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,880
subgenius band. They sound like

610
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,480
one. And

611
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,940
the intro was one of...

612
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,300
the earliest by

613
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,560
Lemur. So

614
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,820
here we sit, broken-hearted.

615
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,880
Oh, the other band.

616
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,580
I love the name of this band.

617
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,840
Pleasure Leftists.

618
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,120
Yeah, man.

619
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,580
Pleasure Leftists.

620
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,860
And that's kind of our theme

621
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,540
for tonight.

622
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,320
Obviously, we decided

623
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,900
let's make Mr. Sister tear his

624
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,240
hair out. He's our

625
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,860
conservative friend. Our beloved

626
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,800
conservative friend. Yes. We have many...

627
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,840
We love our conservative friends. And in

628
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,680
many ways, I'm just about as square

629
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,980
as you can get compared to

630
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,980
some

631
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,860
Baptists I know.

632
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,540
Right-wing Baptists. But

633
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,240
actually, the... Huh?

634
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,360
But you still don't believe in the

635
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,920
creditable financial rape of every person

636
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,780
in the United States at the behest of a few

637
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,300
crazy people at the very top.

638
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,040
Perhaps 4,000 now.

639
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,740
A clinical study from Switzerland revealed.

640
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,600
Oh, there's 4,000 rich,

641
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,860
super-rich people that run the world?

642
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,680
Well, they're way beyond our idea

643
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,420
of rich. They're... Right. Right.

644
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,160
Beyond imagining.

645
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,700
Beyond imagining. And we're

646
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,960
the 99%? Is that it?

647
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,620
Actually, some somebody's...

648
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,500
Some subgenius... I may be confused

649
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,600
about this. Some subgenius said,

650
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,600
we subgeniuses are the 615%

651
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,180
of the 99%.

652
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,240
And then somebody else said, no, we're the

653
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,860
666%. But that's

654
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,780
kind of corny, because everybody

655
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,420
makes fun of, you know, the

656
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,760
Antichrist and Jesus. But not that many

657
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,240
people make fun of Bob,

658
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,980
whose number is

659
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,100
999.

660
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,900
He's the anti-Antichrist

661
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,660
or Herman

662
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,560
Cain. Yeah.

663
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,680
Who wants to...

664
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,440
You know, since conservatives are so

665
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,500
into the government staying

666
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,800
out of people's business and fewer laws

667
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,860
and states' rights, he wants

668
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,760
abortion to be illegal

669
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,500
as a federal law under

670
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,880
all circumstances.

671
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,840
Circumstances. Rape, incest, danger

672
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,920
to the mom, all circumstances

673
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,780
in all states.

674
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,320
And of course,

675
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,760
he condones the actual use

676
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,560
of, like, from the song Brazil,

677
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,660
which was played earlier, having

678
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,700
helicopter troops invade your house and

679
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,580
serving you a notice and then leaving and saying

680
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,760
you owe them $45.

681
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,580
And if they

682
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,720
execute you, your family has to pay for

683
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
the bullet, just like in China.

684
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,480
Slash stroke.

685
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,760
Now, our friend, Reverend Sue,

686
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,080
Susie the Floozy, who

687
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,580
runs Bob's Slack Time

688
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,720
Funhouse, which will be following this

689
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,780
show in Atlanta on

690
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,600
WREK.

691
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:56,940
Susie

692
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,560
posted a long, sort of

693
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,200
convincing rant on

694
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,740
Scrub Genius Forum, which is

695
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,180
subgenius members only,

696
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,540
saying that she

697
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,500
intended to vote for Herman Cain

698
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,760
and here's why. And she said, well, I heard him on a lot

699
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,360
of talk shows and he's made

700
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,560
more sense than

701
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,760
other right-wing hosts, which is the only

702
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,700
kind of talk shows there are for the most

703
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,760
part. And that's not saying

704
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,720
very much, considering that this guy

705
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,080
doesn't really make any sense.

706
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,520
But her point was

707
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,480
if Herman Cain

708
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,600
was a president, or

709
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,880
for that matter, really any of those guys,

710
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,740
but especially him,

711
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,580
it would essentially

712
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,520
push things so far.

713
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:41,900
Most

714
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,760
of us would end up living in shoeboxes

715
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,620
and it would lead to armed revolution.

716
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,400
And eventually a

717
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,920
serious overturning

718
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,200
of the status quo.

719
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,680
And people tend to think,

720
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,380
things don't change that much.

721
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,940
But you know, China was a lot different

722
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,940
before Mao, and Russia

723
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,640
was a lot different before

724
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,140
the Bolsheviks,

725
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,760
and America was a lot different

726
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,380
before the industrial military

727
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,400
complex. And it could become

728
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,860
different again in a way that we can't

729
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,400
even imagine.

730
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,500
Now, my dad

731
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,400
says he's worried about

732
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,280
America because

733
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,480
of that guy

734
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,720
in the White House.

735
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,960
Worried about America, whether they're dead or alive.

736
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,480
I'm worried about America because of my

737
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,560
dad, Pappy. He alone

738
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,540
could destroy America just with

739
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,480
his jokes.

740
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,460
But as

741
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,360
usual in the end, they usually just

742
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,980
America destroys Pappy.

743
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,620
And when we're Pappy

744
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,460
with a capital P, we'll understand what

745
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,120
that means when we go, I just

746
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,700
can't believe now that

747
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,540
the people got them 3D hologram

748
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,460
things implanted in their foreheads,

749
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,720
but everybody knows what everyone's

750
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,980
doing. And furthermore,

751
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,620
what did I just say?

752
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,700
They're competing for Big Brother's

753
00:32:59,700 --> 00:32:59,940
attention.

754
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,500
They want Big Brother to read

755
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,440
their every tweet,

756
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,360
their every Facebook post.

757
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,440
Oh God, what was the theory? I decided,

758
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,620
okay, use that in newsgroup

759
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,920
forums like Scrub Genius

760
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,460
and the

761
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,180
long-lost sad alt-slack, which

762
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,240
by the way, wandered out of its hotel

763
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,180
room and got lost and died of exposure.

764
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,040
Or not its hotel room, it's

765
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,620
old folks' home. It was in

766
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,460
assisted care.

767
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,100
This is the old subgenius newsgroup.

768
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,260
Anyway, newsgroups are for people who

769
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,320
think in multiple

770
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,020
paragraphs.

771
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,260
Okay, Facebook is for

772
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,160
people who can think in a sentence

773
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,220
or two, or maybe a

774
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,980
paragraph. They don't allow you,

775
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,940
much more than a paragraph. About three to four lines.

776
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,320
Right, three or four lines.

777
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,600
Twitter...

778
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,040
Twitter is for people who just can handle

779
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,520
one sentence at a time.

780
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,700
And the next big social

781
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,040
miracle will be

782
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,140
er, which will be for people

783
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,140
only, you know, three words

784
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,140
will be allowed, but that's bad form.

785
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,200
And a typical

786
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,160
round of

787
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,800
conversation would be

788
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,660
user A would type in,

789
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,380
hot.

790
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,740
She, her hot.

791
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,860
User B would say,

792
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,120
ooh, stooped.

793
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,820
Stupid, with an E.

794
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,660
Then

795
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,080
person C would say,

796
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,060
ooh, both

797
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,080
stupid. And

798
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,180
then user A and B would

799
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,120
both say, grammar Nazi,

800
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,280
only they'd spell, it'd be

801
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,900
grammar Nazi

802
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,420
and grammar

803
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,280
Nazi.

804
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,060
Or something, you know.

805
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:46,680
Exactly.

806
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:49,680
So it's slowly getting closer

807
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,120
and closer to the point where

808
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,200
people can get their idea across

809
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,900
with one type of grunt.

810
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,620
Because there'll be so few ideas

811
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,380
to get across.

812
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,660
So few crotchety widows and orphans

813
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,400
to bother the mainstream flow.

814
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,260
It's going to be quite a world when

815
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,480
your every thought is pre-programmed by another

816
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,620
source and plugged directly back into the

817
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,580
source. What the hell good will that be?

818
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,320
And you have to pay for it.

819
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,840
Yeah. Top dollar.

820
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,200
An amount that you can't afford.

821
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,560
Yeah, but if you win enough points,

822
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,420
you can type an extra word on

823
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:21,720
er.

824
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,560
And what purpose

825
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,500
would that serve? Just make everybody mad

826
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,660
at you and call you a grammar not-so

827
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,300
or not-Nazi.

828
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,220
Or a troll with one L.

829
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,040
Yeah, right. A troll.

830
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,300
Well, but Dave,

831
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,100
isn't the Church of the Subgenius

832
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,140
both the world's biggest

833
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,580
troll and

834
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,860
most honest?

835
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,080
Most direct mode of

836
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,840
communication? Both

837
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,280
at the same time?

838
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,040
Definitely.

839
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,120
We understand what it means

840
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,340
to have every

841
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,740
aspect of our bodies controlled

842
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,880
and our minds controlled.

843
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,760
There's like nipple rings and earrings

844
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,960
and different kinds of products you can buy to get the

845
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,060
same results. But once you

846
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,800
listen to the Church of the Subgenius for

847
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,260
25 seconds or whatever

848
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,920
time you can afford, I know it's

849
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,940
very hard for some people

850
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,720
to afford even 25 seconds to

851
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,860
improve their brain. We're going to, we're working

852
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,540
on that. We're actually going to cost,

853
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,660
make the hour of slack cost

854
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,880
accelerate to download. It'll be

855
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,820
free streaming. We'll still, we pity

856
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,640
the poor.

857
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,340
Because we know.

858
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,840
But if we can

859
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,860
get 99 cents a download someday,

860
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,700
that would be fun.

861
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,880
There might be on-site mutilations too. I think that

862
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,740
would be an interesting...

863
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,920
At least if we can afford them for as long

864
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,400
as we can.

865
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,600
WCSB listeners

866
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,400
will be able to get their online mutilation

867
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,620
right at the studio when we have

868
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,280
the open house on November

869
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,340
20th.

870
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,560
By the way, the

871
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,240
Radiothon pledge drive is November

872
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,140
6th. That doesn't

873
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,420
affect other stations unless

874
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,020
they have pledge drives too.

875
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,580
And it'll go for, it goes for

876
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,960
them, although they will have different premiums

877
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,320
offered.

878
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,560
They may not give you the online mutilation

879
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,420
that we can offer in person.

880
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,300
If we're still here November

881
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,220
20th.

882
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,420
According to, it said, one news thing

883
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,500
I read today was that global warming could

884
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,460
exceed safe limits

885
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,440
in our lifetime.

886
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,620
And what they really meant was my grandkids

887
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,800
or my kids' lifetime.

888
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,680
And what they mean by safe, I'm not

889
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,660
sure it, Pappy

890
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,780
doesn't, you know

891
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,680
it's, I can't even repeat

892
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,520
what he said.

893
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,580
He lives in, on a ranch,

894
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,760
the Stang Ranch is in the middle of Stang,

895
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,440
County, which has been suffering

896
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,100
a drought for 10 years

897
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,540
and probably will for 10 years

898
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,500
more. I think it's because of an Indian

899
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,160
curse, personally. But

900
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,200
I said,

901
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,640
just to irritate

902
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,660
Pappy, I said, well now Pappy

903
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,380
why don't you have your governor, Rick Perry

904
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,600
pray for some more rain. That worked real

905
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,880
good last time. And I can't

906
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,940
repeat the four letter expletive

907
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,680
the Nixonian expletive

908
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,000
that he emitted.

909
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,840
And not at me,

910
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,600
the whole thing. At the fact that

911
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,720
I was able to say such a

912
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,620
thing. Because my, Pappy

913
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,660
is not what you'd call a friend

914
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,600
of the super religious. Although

915
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,140
he is a preacher, just like me.

916
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,740
Being an atheist has never stopped

917
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,800
any Stang male from preaching.

918
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,180
It didn't stop Jesus.

919
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,540
No. It didn't stop Moses.

920
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,740
It didn't stop Mohammed.

921
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,760
It didn't stop any of those guys. They were all

922
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,520
atheists as we all know now.

923
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,200
After current studies

924
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,340
released, I think it was in last

925
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,320
April. Jesus wasn't atheist

926
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,320
my friend. He was the son

927
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,680
of God. The son of God.

928
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,320
But he didn't believe in him.

929
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,780
Don't you think that ain't that typical of a teenager?

930
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,960
Well he just made fun of them all the time.

931
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,380
Youth. They just gotta rebel, don't they?

932
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,860
He's the son of God!

933
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,720
And yet he didn't believe in him.

934
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,960
He smoked Chesterfields too, by the way.

935
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,240
Who, Dad?

936
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,640
Jesus. Oh, of course he didn't.

937
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,540
But see, they cut that part. The Council of Nicaea

938
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,040
removed things like that and

939
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,660
women.

940
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,620
Women are equal to men and stuff like that.

941
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,100
They took that out of Christianity

942
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,420
because, well, for obvious reasons.

943
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,700
Well, they weren't using the same

944
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,540
anatomical maps as Leonardo.

945
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,660
That's one thing for sure because when they cut out

946
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,720
those important parts, they left

947
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,520
the worst parts intact and that's what we're

948
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,040
living under. Near

949
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,620
and, well, under.

950
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,780
But those parts taste best if they're

951
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,860
they can taste pretty good if they're all ground up

952
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,440
and mixed together.

953
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,740
We had some, a pan pudding

954
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,540
that you've heard of

955
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,440
scrapple, right? It's made from the parts

956
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,440
of the pig that they won't even...

957
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,520
I used to use it as a consummate dressing for my hair and my body.

958
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,660
Right. But now I know

959
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,120
that Reverend Stank

960
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,120
actually likes liver.

961
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,360
He does not think he likes

962
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,420
liver. Well, I only like liver

963
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,440
if it's in the form

964
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,320
of pan pudding is

965
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,800
liver mixed with

966
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,640
other parts of the pig.

967
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,600
Anus, penis,

968
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,860
the intestines,

969
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,160
jowls.

970
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,380
Now, that's some goody.

971
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,660
Like scrapple, but instead of being mixed

972
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,840
with cornmeal, it's mixed with rice.

973
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,760
And it doesn't have that burnt

974
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,700
hair smell that good scrapple

975
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,840
does. Well, I get all my pork products

976
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,740
from the Borgia plant right

977
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,820
down the street and there's nipples

978
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,860
and oaks and

979
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,920
snouts aplenty. Women don't

980
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,880
like that word nipples. They think that's

981
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,920
anti-woman. They like

982
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,880
the word tilts.

983
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,820
Yeah, curly tails.

984
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,500
Some kind of weird spiritual

985
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,320
or religious artifact. Mr. Sister,

986
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,960
delivered our pork products.

987
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,020
I even have a t-shirt that says,

988
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,240
in Polish, it says, Mr. Sister,

989
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,880
pork products.

990
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,380
In Polish? Yeah, and an

991
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,300
English pervert, Embager,

992
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,420
made that shirt. You see them around

993
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,540
Cleveland every now and then. Several of us

994
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,040
wear them. Although

995
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,480
the famous Mr. Sister

996
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,580
himself doesn't look anything like this shirt

997
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,300
anymore. He's lost

998
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,500
like 4,000 pounds or

999
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,140
something. Yes. And he

1000
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,980
used to look like Godzilla.

1001
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,000
Now he looks like a little Struthiomimus

1002
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,240
or a

1003
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,180
smaller, much smaller dinosaur.

1004
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,420
Stan, why would you

1005
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,740
compare your friends to various dinosaurs?

1006
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,860
I love dinosaurs.

1007
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,220
You know, Dr. Howell is a

1008
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,480
reptococculus of the...

1009
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,240
I love dinosaurs.

1010
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,720
I never understood that.

1011
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,040
Dinosaurs are the next...

1012
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,320
Dinosaurs are the next coolest

1013
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,060
thing to naked girls.

1014
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,220
They might come back the way we're

1015
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,940
going if we extinctify ourselves.

1016
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,860
Maybe some...

1017
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,580
Never mind.

1018
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,280
Last night, Princess Weah and I watched

1019
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,280
all of Planet

1020
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,220
of the Dinosaurs, 1978.

1021
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,440
Which is known...

1022
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,440
Famous for... It's a pretty good dinosaur

1023
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,520
stop motion, and it's

1024
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,360
incredibly terrible acting

1025
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,820
and costumes.

1026
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,360
What a fine, fine specimen

1027
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,280
of Bulldada. Yeah, it was.

1028
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,400
It's great. And then we

1029
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,700
watched Tarzan and the Amazons.

1030
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,380
Which, uh... We haven't finished

1031
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,180
yet, but I know how it's gonna end.

1032
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,280
He'll call the elephants and they'll

1033
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,240
come and save the Amazons

1034
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,400
from the white men.

1035
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,040
I've been sitting around listening to...

1036
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,960
Tarzan know like men. Men

1037
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,920
bring guns, cause trouble.

1038
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,280
Men go away. Tarzan know lead you.

1039
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,360
I just had a...

1040
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,340
I just had a vision in my mind of

1041
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,480
Peter Sellers as Dr. Strangelove

1042
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,320
coming in in a wheelchair as

1043
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,140
the, you know, the guys with the pith helmets

1044
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,220
attack Tarzan, and he's like giving

1045
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,400
orders, but I didn't want to...

1046
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,420
But I thought I had to share it with you because...

1047
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,180
Uh, Steven Spielberg essentially

1048
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,300
beat you to that. He didn't

1049
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,100
use the word Tarzan, but he... It was

1050
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,600
Indiana Jones instead, but...

1051
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,940
I was watching that Tarzan movie and thinking,

1052
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,880
I think Steven Spielberg owes these guys

1053
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,000
an explanation. Especially

1054
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,660
in the set design, art design,

1055
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,600
glass paintings and stuff.

1056
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,780
But we're getting lost in

1057
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,740
the dogma of inside

1058
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,060
bad film, which I'm sure

1059
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,080
some of our listeners really appreciate,

1060
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,220
but probably not most

1061
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,260
because they're not old.

1062
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,880
Well, not... Some of them are

1063
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,240
too archivist

1064
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,180
and you can be that at a very early

1065
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,200
age. In fact, the ones who turn out to be

1066
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,340
too archivist at a later age

1067
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,340
began at an earlier age

1068
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,040
somewhat close to the Cambrian

1069
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,560
period, where everybody flossed.

1070
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,600
And that was the

1071
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,300
obsessive dynamic, cultural dynamic

1072
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,000
of the whole society. People

1073
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,220
flossed all the time. They were constantly

1074
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,040
worried about things being stuck in their

1075
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,700
teeth. And it still is with us.

1076
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,160
It still is with us

1077
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,000
today. Well, and

1078
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,080
not only the Cambrian, but the

1079
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,840
Devonian, especially

1080
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,880
here in Ohio. Yeah, most

1081
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,460
importantly.

1082
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,860
More artifacts. Never mind. Are we not

1083
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,180
ancestors of men?

1084
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,000
Barely.

1085
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,840
We are not

1086
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,180
vying for position

1087
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,960
in the cloud for Big

1088
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,820
Brothers' attention.

1089
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,360
Exactly.

1090
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:12,980
Others.

1091
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,740
I'm actually...

1092
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,600
Well, I mean, I have to make a living

1093
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,480
to some extent, but...

1094
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,220
You love Big Brother.

1095
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,760
You're saying you

1096
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,240
must admit that you do

1097
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,300
love Big Brother and you don't like Big

1098
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,440
Slimy... Yes, you're right. I must admit

1099
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:30,860
that.

1100
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,920
You're right. I must admit that.

1101
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,440
And I know exactly how

1102
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,440
Winston Smith feels. I know

1103
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,660
him and he's a cousin

1104
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,600
of mine. And he smokes

1105
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,940
like a football.

1106
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,700
I'm not a football player. I've got quite a bit of...

1107
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,540
I've got some collage artwork, original

1108
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,660
Winston Smiths on my bedroom

1109
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,000
wall.

1110
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,640
He's a subgenius. He's a

1111
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,400
friend of ours, Winston Smith.

1112
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,720
That's so wild to be a cousin of a cultural icon

1113
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,680
rather than one yourself, I suppose.

1114
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,660
Well, he not only... This is the

1115
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,660
Winston Smith who not only was featured

1116
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,800
in Orwell's book,

1117
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,700
but he also did all those Dead Kennedy

1118
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,640
album covers.

1119
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,480
I think I'm going to turn off

1120
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,640
Philip Glass there. I'm sure some people

1121
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,600
will go, oh, thank God.

1122
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,860
Well, it's too...

1123
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,880
Turn on the Flying Ryan Brothers.

1124
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,140
The Fly-In Ryan Brothers,

1125
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,360
I should say. The Flying Ryan

1126
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,000
Brothers are subgen...

1127
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,960
Reverend Jimmy Ryan is like the

1128
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,620
Joe Satriani of subgenius.

1129
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,300
He's too... Their music

1130
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,400
is almost too normal for us to use

1131
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,400
most of the time. It's too good.

1132
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,100
It's like, you know, it's

1133
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:36,700
professional.

1134
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,180
We use it in our vacation movies.

1135
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:41,260
Yeah.

1136
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,180
It looks good in the...

1137
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,140
If you look at Google

1138
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,900
subgenius family vacation,

1139
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,520
you'll see that Princess Wee and I

1140
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,360
are not as old as we sound.

1141
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,700
We look as old

1142
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,720
as we are. Well, you sound much worse

1143
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,660
than you seem. Yeah. We're still

1144
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,080
able to walk, and there's photographic

1145
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,600
proof of that. The point is,

1146
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,420
walk where? I mean, where

1147
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,580
does any one of your vast wealth

1148
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,680
want to go when you don't need to?

1149
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,660
All you have to do is flip your

1150
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,760
limp wrist in the direction of

1151
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,460
some servant.

1152
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,620
It comes trotting up immediately and

1153
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:17,340
brings you a dog bowl full of champagne,

1154
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,040
I suppose. We had to let

1155
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,700
several of the maids and butlers

1156
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,740
go. Oh, speaking of walking

1157
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,540
and old age, I read

1158
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,660
today that somebody's making

1159
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,580
GPS shoes for

1160
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,520
people with Alzheimer's. Yes.

1161
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,260
Yes. And how...

1162
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,480
I don't know if we still will

1163
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,380
need them. We'll need them ourselves.

1164
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,740
I've got a GPS now.

1165
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,620
Well, I think we should be

1166
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,720
appraised of that, definitely.

1167
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,480
We should. You should get one.

1168
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,420
Because you've been known to walk around

1169
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,320
in the neighborhood and, you know, forget

1170
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,220
who you are, where your

1171
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,580
address. Well, it occurred to me,

1172
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,540
I thought, well, the next obvious

1173
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,620
step is, you know how a lot

1174
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,000
of certain

1175
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,480
subgenius types lose their

1176
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,480
glasses, their cell phone, and

1177
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,600
their car keys on a daily basis, right?

1178
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,340
Now, if certain

1179
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,900
objects had GPS

1180
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,120
locators in them,

1181
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,080
then you could have this little

1182
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,140
handheld locator where you push one

1183
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,940
and it tells you where you're, you know,

1184
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,800
it points you in the direction of your

1185
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,200
cell phone. You push two

1186
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,300
and it shows you where your car keys are and so forth.

1187
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,760
The problem with it is,

1188
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,220
by definition, the people who need

1189
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,420
a machine like that would lose that machine.

1190
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,320
Exactly.

1191
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,100
So you'd have to have another, you'd have to have

1192
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,220
a GPS locator, locator,

1193
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,100
locator.

1194
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,960
The pile of technology

1195
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,900
needed to complete a human function,

1196
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:41,920
would just become enormous.

1197
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,000
I'm patenting that right now.

1198
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,640
Trademark, 2011

1199
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:48,540
Reverend

1200
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,860
Ivan Stang. But think of the

1201
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,380
social consequences, Stang.

1202
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,920
Think of what if, you know, this is

1203
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,040
allowed to proliferate throughout the land and stuff

1204
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,960
and people can't remember what they're doing

1205
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,080
to begin with. I forgot

1206
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,800
what I was even talking about. Good!

1207
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,160
And it really made a lot of sense to me.

1208
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,880
It was kind of funny. No wonder you forgot.

1209
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,820
The potential use by

1210
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,480
zombies, that's what it was. I forgot.

1211
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,920
What if, you know,

1212
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,940
people go around and all of a sudden it comes up

1213
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:16,280
on the screen that your keys

1214
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,020
are at some field somewhere near a

1215
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,920
ditch and you didn't even know you'd been there

1216
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,780
the night before. And you go out there

1217
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,040
and you realize that you are actually

1218
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,640
a zombie or perhaps

1219
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,880
the zombie might attack you

1220
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,020
or at least, you know,

1221
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,300
say dirty words to your, you know,

1222
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,360
stuff like...

1223
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,080
Dave. What?

1224
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,680
I have a song that I'm going to play.

1225
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,440
Well, I hope it's a

1226
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,180
really good and nice song.

1227
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,740
I'm going to pull the Flying Ryan Brothers

1228
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:46,900
down for a second. It is a real good

1229
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,340
and real nice song.

1230
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,920
And it has...

1231
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,700
We've been talking about the economic

1232
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,880
depression and on

1233
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,960
previous shows we've talked about our

1234
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,020
own personal

1235
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,140
economy and

1236
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,900
depressions in our

1237
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,260
foreheads.

1238
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,700
Someone has used the term occupy

1239
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,600
space. Occupy time.

1240
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,080
It's about too many.

1241
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,100
Craziest place.

1242
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:15,880
Reverend

1243
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,340
or rather Popess

1244
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,480
Pontiara Ivakovich

1245
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,460
made a little

1246
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,540
song. She just

1247
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,000
sang it acapella

1248
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,540
but Reverend Frodus

1249
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,020
Suds Pasha

1250
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,180
doctored it.

1251
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,980
And I'm going to play this song

1252
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:36,140
tonight, right now.

1253
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,300
And I'm going to play it again during

1254
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,060
Radiothon Pledge Drive.

1255
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,540
Okay? Because

1256
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,880
well, it's appropriate.

1257
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,980
Because you're a rabble-rousing guy.

1258
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,460
Yeah. I'm going to

1259
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,040
pot us down as we

1260
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,400
pot holders say.

1261
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,720
Okay, here goes.

1262
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:55,880
Early

1263
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,000
each day to

1264
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,180
a mysterious stage

1265
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:01,900
the little

1266
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,360
old Ivan Stang

1267
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:04,940
drives

1268
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,440
in his

1269
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,380
own special way.

1270
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,560
To the yeti

1271
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,620
he calls

1272
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,560
come

1273
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,780
by my table

1274
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,060
of swag

1275
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,200
Come feed my

1276
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,320
little wife

1277
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,000
show her you care

1278
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,240
and you'll

1279
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,320
be glad if you

1280
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:32,760
do

1281
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,000
My

1282
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,280
grandkids are hungry

1283
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:40,300
our house is

1284
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,260
so bare

1285
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,940
all it takes is money

1286
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:47,720
from you

1287
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,660
Feed the Stangs

1288
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,780
money for swag

1289
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,180
money, money

1290
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,380
money for swag

1291
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,480
Feed the Stangs

1292
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,620
that's what he cries

1293
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,220
Come overhead

1294
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,620
space ships fill the skies

1295
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,720
In Wisteria

1296
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,480
campground Bob Dobbs

1297
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,180
and his minions

1298
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,360
look down at the

1299
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,180
yeti hive

1300
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,560
and though you can't see it

1301
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,120
you know that he's smiling

1302
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,460
each day.

1303
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,400
They all look like

1304
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,100
Paolo from stress

1305
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,920
he's not

1306
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,100
looking for

1307
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:02,500
likes

1308
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:02,500


1309
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:02,520
someone

1310
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:02,560
he'll

1311
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,540
say

1312
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:06,080
love

1313
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:07,720
again

1314
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,180
by boys

1315
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:09,200
captain

1316
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,480
Money for swag.

1317
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:19,620
Money, money, money for swag.

1318
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,720
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1319
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,500
Dragging your butt through the day?

1320
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,500
Time for the hit and all of the guilt?

1321
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,900
But none of the sex?

1322
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,320
There is a simple answer, dear friend.

1323
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:40,980
And a glowing beacon of slack amidst the turmoil that does.

1324
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:49,340
It's J.R. Bob Donne and his mighty Church of the Subgenius.

1325
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:55,740
Though his words are simple and few,

1326
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:03,400
Listen, listen, he's calling to you.

1327
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:05,520
Be.

1328
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,520
The stains.

1329
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,480
Money for swag.

1330
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:24,300
Money, money, money for swag.

1331
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:32,840
Repent! Quit your job! Slack off! And praise Bob!

1332
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:34,660
Yeah!

1333
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:40,240
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

1334
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,700
How about that?

1335
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:44,980
Isn't that wonderful?

1336
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,700
That was like Les Mis meets Bob.

1337
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,140
Um, yeah.

1338
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,520
I could hear Woody Guthrie in the background.

1339
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,440
Oh, man.

1340
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:59,900
And when she says money for slack, it doesn't just describe your ridiculous church.

1341
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,260
It describes what everyone needs.

1342
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,880
No, it actually describes your local.

1343
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,560
Radio station that plays the hour of slack.

1344
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,440
Come pledge drive time.

1345
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:16,900
And by the way, she's saying money for swag, not money for slack.

1346
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,360
Well, it's a good thing I misunderstood that.

1347
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:19,940
Yeah.

1348
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:36,240
Or, um, but, but, but, but that's what you, if when, when we do the pledge drive in two weeks, um, if we're the earth still exists in two weeks, we will, uh, be having, we'll be asking people for money for the state.

1349
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:42,160
And they will get swag in return station swag and a subgenius premium, but that will.

1350
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:43,460
Whoa.

1351
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:47,580
Well, we've got, we've got, we're going to be a rocking party friends.

1352
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:51,360
It's going to be a, the Halloween masquerade party for WCSB will be rocking.

1353
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:55,080
We'll be there, but you won't know who we are because we'll have masks on.

1354
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:58,520
Of course, if I wear the Bob mask, then you might know who who's wearing.

1355
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,540
There's only three of them in Cleveland that I know of left.

1356
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,260
So, and I've got all four.

1357
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:05,820
So, um.

1358
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:11,140
And if you see a person in the gorilla suit and the Bob mask, you'll know who it is.

1359
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,100
Oh, yeah.

1360
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:12,900
Yeah.

1361
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:13,280
Oh.

1362
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:28,220
Um, so, uh, yes, uh, that was a feed the stangs by, uh, Popes Ponteary Vakovich with, uh, mixed by, uh, Reverend Frodo Suds Pasha.

1363
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,680
What an exquisite piece of music.

1364
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,340
Really?

1365
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,080
Well, I think it owes an explanation to Mary.

1366
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,840
We do a lot of.

1367
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:39,160
I'm crying about everything, especially money for swag.

1368
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:39,500
Fine.

1369
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:40,240
Yes.

1370
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:40,860
But still.

1371
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:44,420
Mary Poppins was involved too, I think.

1372
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:50,280
Speaking of swag, I've been nursing an ill tooth by using my old Bob cup.

1373
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:54,400
They do have value beyond coffee and beating people up.

1374
00:55:54,740 --> 00:56:01,080
And, uh, I'm wearing my shirt now one day before it becomes miserably cold in this area.

1375
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,180
Poor Dave.

1376
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,720
So the Dobbs cup.

1377
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,660
Dave has nothing.

1378
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:06,040


1379
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:13,120
That's all Dave has left is a Bob, a Bob coffee mug and a Bob t-shirt that's very, very threadbare.

1380
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:13,640
Oh.

1381
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:16,940
Well, the nipples I did.

1382
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:19,100
I know women hate that word.

1383
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:19,420
How come?

1384
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,180
I would like to ask we directly.

1385
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,120
Why do women hate the word nipples?

1386
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:23,760
Do they?

1387
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:29,500
I dare not speak for all women.

1388
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,180
So I shan't answer.

1389
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:32,920
It was.

1390
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:34,300
We had a little argument.

1391
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:39,260
I had a little argument earlier about, uh, a different word that involves nipples.

1392
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:44,800
Nipples are a subset of the word she didn't want me to say, even though I was saying it

1393
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,260
in an admiring fashion.

1394
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,120
Buttocks?

1395
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:47,900
Could it have been?

1396
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:48,920
No, no, no.

1397
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,440
It's when you can't say on the radio still to this day, believe it or not until until

1398
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,180
11, like at midnight, you can't at midnight.

1399
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,420
You can say the word, the four letter word.

1400
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,160
You can say.

1401
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,460
It has nipples on it.

1402
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:03,100
Yes.

1403
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:04,020
And disagree.

1404
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:07,900
Disagreement or perhaps even civil war or neutrino death.

1405
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,200
But you can't say, you know, right.

1406
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:11,680
Yeah.

1407
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:12,360
Oh, don't.

1408
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:12,620
Yeah.

1409
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:12,840
Whatever.

1410
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,580
Don't say it.

1411
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,480
Don't get slack religious.

1412
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,180
Let's not be slack religious.

1413
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,060
That was Prince of when Princess.

1414
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,760
We first heard that song money for stangs or whatever.

1415
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:22,780
Free the stank.

1416
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:23,760
Feed the stank.

1417
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,380
The stank.

1418
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,980
Her first comment was that is so slack religious.

1419
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,960
Followed by my comment.

1420
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,120
Where has that word been for the last 33 years?

1421
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:33,980
Really?

1422
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,320
Jeez, oh man.

1423
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,380
Slack religious?

1424
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:38,380
Who couldn't have sunk that and none but did.

1425
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,280
We right now and then.

1426
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:45,860
What I'm afraid of, we both said, Oh, Nan's gonna call us up and go, uh, that's on page

1427
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,440
66 of Revelation X.

1428
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,960
And I came up with it four, 10 years ago.

1429
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,460
But you don't remember because you know.

1430
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:54,600
You're right.

1431
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,140
Because you did all that, you know.

1432
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,460
Oh by the way, WE now has a week.

1433
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:01,380
Yes, I have a week.

1434
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,660
We're, we're, we're members of the modern world.

1435
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:04,000
We have a foundation.

1436
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:04,000


1437
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,680
We have a video game set in our home, a console.

1438
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,460
Play on it and we go, whee!

1439
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:12,380
You bowl and so forth and then play lawn tennis.

1440
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:16,420
This is the only one I know of that comes with like a foot pad.

1441
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:19,820
So you have to, you can't do it sitting down.

1442
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,440
You have to be running and jumping and jogging and sword fighting.

1443
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:27,500
And you actually work up a sweat playing these games.

1444
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,080
God forbid you don't plug a ridiculous machine into a wall

1445
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:34,820
or have to go outside and actually walk around and act like that.

1446
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,560
That's why they want you to stay at home and do that

1447
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,640
so you don't behave that way in public.

1448
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:44,840
And another way you can't behave in public is to let your show go on too long.

1449
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,440
And I must say this is the end of this show, Hour of Slack.

1450
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,960
The Church of the Subgenius show.

1451
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,520
Future shows may be more explanatory of Church of the Subgenius.

1452
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:01,060
Wait until we get to the German, the English computer translation.

1453
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:04,760
The translation of the German article about subgenius.

1454
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,440
It will not be difficult, my dear.

1455
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,960
Maybe next week.

1456
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,620
And if you need more information about this show

1457
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:14,640
and any of the artistes that we play,

1458
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,440
like the Flying Ryan Brothers in the background,

1459
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:23,000
in a couple of days, look at subgenius.com if you want.

1460
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,420
And there's a radio button.

1461
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:29,360
And if you click on the title of Hour of Slack,

1462
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,900
$1,300.

1463
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:31,520
$1,331.

1464
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,600
Live.

1465
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,400
October whatever, 20-something it is.

1466
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:37,220
23rd.

1467
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,460
Hail Eris.

1468
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:47,080
You can find links to like Shy Show and Puzzling Evidence

1469
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,740
and the Cryogenic Strawberries.

1470
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,100
But not Lonesome Cowboy Dave because he's not on Facebook.

1471
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:57,860
No, I refuse to be because I was told by you that it's a bane of normal existence.

1472
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,200
Someone's always pestering who you don't know.

1473
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,040
Well.

1474
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,140
Well, I only have three.

1475
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,060
I've kept my friends down to like, you know, there's six now.

1476
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:05,520
I might make Wee.

1477
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:06,740
He's not even my friend.

1478
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,160
Yeah, I'm not even Wee's friend.

1479
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:15,160
But there's a subgenius slack hole that anybody can look at.

1480
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,680
And it's actually pretty funny.

1481
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,580
But you have to be a Facebook member to see it, I guess.

1482
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:23,460
So you can't win for losing now, can you?

1483
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,300
I should officially end this show right now.

1484
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,480
Yes, with a fish.

1485
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:30,360
For Sire, there is no more money.

1486
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,780
We gotta get some money.

1487
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,020
That dirty, purgish, hark-a-back, flackin' whartin'

1488
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,300
Philip Buckaburton, purgaluma-burton,

1489
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,600
doesn't wash tonight at all.

1490
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:44,540
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1491
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:48,060
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough

1492
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,860
to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1493
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:55,920
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1494
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:59,420
But if you truly love Bob

1495
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,060
and want some of that slackness,

1496
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,980
slack back to rebound to you,

1497
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:07,000
you should go to subgenius.com front page,

1498
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,500
or especially the radio page,

1499
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,480
or the catalog store pages,

1500
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,800
and help out financially as best you can.

1501
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:18,180
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

1502
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:21,820
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1503
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,740
But some of you still have jobs.

1504
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,100
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1505
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:30,140
even if it's only once a month.

1506
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:31,680
From enough of you.

1507
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,080
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1508
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,380
All we're saying is that

1509
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,800
blowjobs could go the way of Steve Jobs

1510
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,840
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1511
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:46,440
We also take checks and money orders to

1512
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,320
Subgenius Foundation.

1513
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:53,760

1517
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:06,000
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1554
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:51,180
attractive

1555
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:52,140
Don't brode

1556
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:52,660
Bo boo

1557
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,400
Bo bo wow

1558
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,000
Bo bo wow

1559
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,060
Bo bo wow

1560
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:00,120
Bo bo wow

1561
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,180
learning the different parts of the alphabet,

1562
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:04,740
rolling their tongues and arguing with each other

1563
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,460
on into the hours of the night.

1564
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:08,960
Well, before any more further ado,

1565
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,580
let's all give them a big round pat on the forehead

1566
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:15,120
and slap them into the ground and beat them to a merciless pub.

1567
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:19,260
And friends, that's what you can do every Sunday night at 9

1568
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:25,040
on the Hour of Slack, heard only on WCSB in Cleveland.

1569
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,880
But don't get in it too hard.

1570
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:31,700
WCSB, Cleveland.

1571
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:35,080
Okay, are we done now?

1572
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,200
Dave, you know what we just did?

1573
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,540
Something I've needed to do for the station for a long time.

1574
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:42,680
One of the things when you're a DJ here,

1575
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:46,960
you have to provide ads for your show.

1576
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:52,000
And although our show is ended as far as the others

1577
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,860
outside of Cleveland will ever hear,

1578
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:57,320
you just did that ad.

1579
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,900
You didn't know you were doing it,

1580
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:02,440
but when I put the tail end on it

1581
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:05,300
and did the legal ID at the same time.

1582
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:06,360
Oh.

1583
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:09,720
So then it makes no sense to me whatsoever still.

1584
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,620
So now we're free.

1585
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:15,040
It's like the part of the show that will be on the Internet is done.

1586
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,920
Radio synesthesia normally would be starting right now,

1587
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,540
but I foolishly told Dr. Sinister at the station meeting yesterday

1588
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:26,740
that we were going to be here tonight

1589
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:29,240
so he didn't have to hurry in to spell,

1590
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,100
African Abstract God,

1591
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,160
because when we're not here,

1592
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,780
African Abstract has to stay until Dr. Sinister gets here

1593
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:37,940
while the pre-recorded hour of Slack plays.

1594
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,160
So we're kind of a hassle to our fellow,

1595
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,860
to the DJs before and after us,

1596
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,380
unless we come in and do live shows.

1597
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:53,600
And we will be doing that until we have to switch to reruns

1598
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,760
for about two months or three soon.

1599
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,800
And now Dave can tread water.

1600
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,040
He's going to be better with us in free form

1601
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,580
because Rob's not here yet.

1602
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:04,720
Who's Rob?

1603
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:06,680
Oh, Dr. Sinister I meant.

1604
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:07,220
Yeah.

1605
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:08,280
Praise Rob anyway.

1606
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,040
Praise Rob, whoever he is.

1607
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,520
It's Dr. Sinister who is not here yet.

1608
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:15,720
Oh, here he is.

1609
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:17,140
He's just come running in.

1610
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,660
Now we tread water.

1611
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:19,420
I'm sorry.

1612
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:27,980
Friends, welcome to Dr. Sinister's Radio Synesthesia.

1613
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:27,980


1614
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:30,680
Ah, ah, ah.

1615
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:34,900
The radio has never smelled so good.

1616
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:37,200
No pilfering allowed.

1617
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,160
Remember, boys and girls.

1618
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,600
It's the only radio show that you can see.

1619
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,860
That you can eat like candy.

1620
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,860
It's the only radio show in color.

1621
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,940
That you can protect like a friend.

1622
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,920
And tastes like pan pudding.

1623
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:54,260
And it's the only radio station that wears a mustache.

1624
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,980
And as a gastronomical extra,

1625
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,640
it's the only show that provides a handy wipe.

1626
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:00,660
For after use.

1627
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,820
And you'll need it, friends.

1628
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,760
Get your deep pens, handy wipes,

1629
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:08,220
and other household cleansers ready.

1630
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:12,120
For Radio Synesthesia.

1631
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:17,620
Which actually I think can be spelled two different ways.

1632
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,640
Coming right up right after this brief massage.

1633
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,100
It's more for Radio Synesthesia.

1634
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:29,760
Here, I'll just, I'm going to turn the music.

1635
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:30,100
Up.

1636
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:31,540
This is the Flying Ryan Brothers.

1637
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:33,480
Oh, well, of course, their timing is perfect.

1638
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:34,600
I'm out of here.

1639
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:36,900
Well.

1640
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:37,580
All yours.

1641
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:38,660
Why, thank you.

1642
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:39,860
See you, Dave.

1643
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:40,880
There's some music on right now.

1644
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:41,560
See you, girls.

1645
01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:43,100
As well as the microphone.

1646
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,540
As well as Dave.

1647
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,160
Well, hello, Robin.

1648
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:47,860
How are you?

1649
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,160
I'll see you soon, perhaps.

1650
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:52,240
Friends, I always bring my own headphones.

1651
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:55,620
It's because they're louder than any of the station ones.

1652
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:59,620
And also because you stole them from the station.

1653
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,880
Originally and put your signature on the back.

1654
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:08,660
So, yes, welcome to Synesthesia or Slank Overtime, as it might be.

1655
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:13,440
What I'm going to do here is queue up a couple of PSAs.

1656
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:18,540
And what is this music?

1657
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:22,380
The Flying Ryan Brothers are subgeniuses.

1658
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:26,340
It's to propagate the weird nanovegetables.

1659
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:28,400
Yeah, this doesn't really...

1660
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,520
Ryan Nattek.

1661
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:31,940
It's a man who often confused diuretic with diabetic.

1662
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,340
It makes the nanotech go.

1663
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:34,420
It's Ryan.

1664
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:36,320
R-Y-A-N.

1665
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,020
Ryan Nattek.

1666
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:39,800
A man who often confused diuretic with diabetic.

1667
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,060
You know what's really funny?

1668
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:47,500
Back when I was a snake oil salesman, I noticed that there was a lot of herbal supplements

1669
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:53,340
on the market that had names like Nature's Way and Nature's Herbs and Nature's Secret

1670
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,100
and stuff like that.

1671
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:57,920
And I thought it would be really cool to make a combination herbal supplement, combination

1672
01:07:58,580 --> 01:07:59,500
diuretic and lactic acid.

1673
01:07:59,500 --> 01:07:59,500


1674
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:03,080
And I thought that would be a great seller.

1675
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,860
I knew it would never.

1676
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:11,920
So, yeah, that having been said, thank you for filling in these last couple of minutes.

1677
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:12,780
And...

1678
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:15,440
Thanks for the escargot.

1679
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:17,540
Yeah, look at that escargot.

1680
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:19,660
That escar is pretty fast.

1681
01:08:19,940 --> 01:08:20,640
It was delicious.

1682
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,580
Just zipped right by, like...

1683
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:23,920
Man.

1684
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,260
I can't believe this is made by a subgenius.

1685
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:28,760
This is...

1686
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:29,760
Yeah, I know.

1687
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:30,160
It's really good.

1688
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,120
This is not subgenius music.

1689
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:33,020
This is genius music.

1690
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,600
This is stuff that ought to be played on the Friday Fusion show.

1691
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:35,820
Right.

1692
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:37,440
That's why I don't play it very often.

1693
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:37,780
Yeah.

1694
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:38,840
I'm not insulting that.

1695
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:42,380
I do enjoy some wonky music.

1696
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:43,280
But...

1697
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,180
That's not the word for it.

1698
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,240
It's virtuosity.

1699
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:47,540
Virtuosity.

1700
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:50,940
Not in every aspect, perhaps, but it is certainly virtuosity.

1701
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:52,040
And very virtuous.

1702
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,480
To some, perhaps.

1703
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:55,660
I mean...

1704
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:58,740
This makes me want to go on a crusade and storm the world.

1705
01:08:58,740 --> 01:08:58,740


1706
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:01,620
I'm not going to storm the castle of the evil villain.

1707
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:02,820
Actually, wait a second.

1708
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:06,820
I'm the evil villain usually, though, so I guess I want to storm my own castle.

1709
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:07,580
Yeah.

1710
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:09,220
But this just...

1711
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:15,180
Like, I just feel this righteousness and this passion for, oh, do it, do it, do it,

1712
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:15,340
right.

1713
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:17,620
Well, what did you just eat recently?

1714
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,840
Could it be a gastric, you know, a digestive problem?

1715
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:21,160
Oh, man.

1716
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,340
I had some Cambodian food for dinner tonight.

1717
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,180
Well, you want to go out and shoot everybody.

1718
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:26,460
There you go.

1719
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:27,480
I'm subgenius.

1720
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:28,340
I'm a subgenius.

1721
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:29,780
Or at least, you know, enough...

1722
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:30,220
No, you didn't.

1723
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:31,960
...teachers and firemen to...

1724
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:32,740
Oh.

1725
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:34,100
...accessuate the problem.

1726
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:35,760
Stick Lars.

1727
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:38,600
I'll remember that going forward, just like the quotation marks around the name Bob.

1728
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:40,920
You always capitalize the G in subgenius.

1729
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,320
The old professor himself.

1730
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:46,640
You know, quotation marks are kind of actually right about what's going on on Wall Street

1731
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,000
yesterday.

1732
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:47,840
Yeah.

1733
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:52,100
Well, Dave, I want to thank you very much for hanging out with me here for a second,

1734
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:55,080
but I'm going to cue up some music, and that is not this.

1735
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:57,240
And, boy, I would love to hear from you sometime.

1736
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:04,540
If you'd call in during synesthesia, I know foreign service is not cheap, but gosh, it

1737
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:05,420
would be great to hear from you sometime.

1738
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:06,840
Well, thanks, man.

1739
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:08,420
I'll make sure I don't do that.

1740
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:08,820
No, I will.

1741
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:09,340
I will.

1742
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:09,840
No, you should.

1743
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:10,740
All right.

1744
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:11,440
I certainly will.

1745
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:15,880
Well, thank you for hanging out tonight, and hope you'll stay tuned.

1746
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,080
Thanks.

1747
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,220
All righty.

1748
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:20,100
This is WCSB Cleveland.

1749
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,560
The name of the program is Synesthesia.

1750
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,740
I'm Dr. Sinister, and I'll be here till midnight.

1751
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:27,220
All right.

1752
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:27,220


1753
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:27,220


1754
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:27,220


1755
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:27,220


1756
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:27,220


1757
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:31,600
Here are some announcements to service the public.

1758
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,820
Or not, as the case may be.

1759
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,660
Just a second here.

1760
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,380
Got to get this cued up.

1761
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:40,940
You know what's really funny?

1762
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:43,940
I'm so used to Charleston leaving the wave cart on all the time.

1763
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:46,640
Usually when I come in, it's on.

1764
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,260
So I'm so used to it being on that I actually...

1765
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:50,660
Did I actually turn it off?

1766
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,020
You did.

1767
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:52,100
You did what you're supposed to do.

1768
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:53,740
Well done, sir.

1769
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:55,880
Believe me, it was an accident.

1770
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:57,220
WCSB Cleveland.

1771
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:57,220


1772
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,180
Come by another tonight.

1773
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:06,480
I will be there again.

1774
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,300
No...

1775
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:25,140
Into this room, you little hoşu, regal.
