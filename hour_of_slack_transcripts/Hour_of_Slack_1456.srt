1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Our slack is coming up.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,020
Princess Wee is here.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,280
Where's my script? Where's my script?

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,980
I better push this button.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,360
We're holding this public meeting in the Civic Auditorium tonight because of the story.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,100
Good afternoon.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,740
So genius.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,980
Our call is for juvenile delinquents?

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,420
I'm happy to hear that.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,320
Well, that's very interesting.

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,560
From PR News in Washington, I'm released today.

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,320
However, more testing is being conducted.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,840
There were no results this time because of PR News walking in its own funeral procession.

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,280
The FBI says the suspicious foot gas that was near the site of Sunday's Super Bowl does not appear to be dangerous.

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,600
PR tells us the foot gas is controversial because...

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,140
The State Department is crude.

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:08,400
The State Department is 17% more crude and as much as 10% more crude than PR News Washington.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,500
The European Central number is four-tenths of seven-tenths next Thursday.

19
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,140
Dow is 50-15-699.

20
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,680
The Commerce Department has released a report.

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,360
It shows this is PR.

22
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,900
Hey, Bob.

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,500
You ready to cut loose?

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,760
Wake and shake, buddy.

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,100
Let's do this thing.

26
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,080
Slam a cow.

27
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,700
That fool looks rumped.

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,380
What do you mean?

29
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,880
Look at him.

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,720
He's all limp and weird.

31
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,900
Uh, I bet he just needs some breakfast after a night of extraordinary...

32
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,440
Slack.

33
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,880
Let's combine everything we can find in the kitchen and have...

34
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,100
Bob?

35
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:50,680
Drink it.

36
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,800
That'll wake him up.

37
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,120
And then we can...

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,160
Get down!

39
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,060
He doesn't want to drink that goop, man.

40
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,740
Ben?

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's just give him some, uh, purple whatevers.

42
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:02,760
You mean the...

43
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,240
Pills?

44
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,980
Yeah, whatever.

45
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:07,860
Hey!

46
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,560
I think he's diggin' it!

47
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,680
That doesn't sound...

48
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:14,860
Uh...

49
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,080
Uh, you think we...

50
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,680
You think we fed the wrong hole?

51
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,720
Nah.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,360
Bob?

53
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,860
Just doesn't like purple whatevers.

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,620
What we need to do is figure out what he does like to eat.

55
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,000
Here.

56
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,360
Bob?

57
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,040
What do you like?

58
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,520
Me?

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,700
Some banana?

60
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,700
This looks like corn...

61
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,260
I think, uh...

62
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:35,780
Hot...

63
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,320
Slack.

64
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,520
Look!

65
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:38,980
Bob?

66
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,660
Likes it!

67
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,420
Wow!

68
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,540
No way!

69
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,040
His favorite food is...

70
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,660
Slack.

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,680
Awesome!

72
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,940
Holy fig, that's awesome!

73
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,000
Eat him up!

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,340
Bob?

75
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,560
No!

76
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,580
Ah!

77
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,140
Ah!

78
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,060
Keep it away!

79
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:56,720
Shoo!

80
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,300
Shoo!

81
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:57,880
Ah!

82
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,340
Ha ha!

83
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,080
No!

84
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,080


85
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,700
Ah!

86
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,220


87
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,540
All right, all right, I got Bob.

88
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,620
Calm down.

89
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,440
Ah!

90
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:05,420
Ah!

91
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,060
Ha ha!

92
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,160
Dude, you eating me is just as bad as Bob eating me.

93
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,680
Well, you gonna eat Bob, tough guy?

94
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,420
Yes, if that is what must be done.

95
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,080
Bob tastes awesome!

96
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,880
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

97
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,340
Okay, all right.

98
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,800
Now, let's get back to some Slack.

99
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,940
I'll get...

100
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,500
Pills.

101
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:29,900
Ah!

102
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,740
Like this!

103
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,460
Yeah!

104
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:32,840
Ha ha!

105
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,280
Woo!

106
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:33,780
Yeah!

107
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,160
Bob?

108
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:34,740
Go nuts!

109
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,980
Go nuts like there's bugs on your nuts!

110
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:37,920
Grr!

111
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,140
Ah!

112
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,540
Oh!

113
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,540
Whoa!

114
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:44,440
Ah!

115
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,180
Ugh!

116
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,280
What the heck?

117
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,620
What's wrong with...

118
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:47,800
Bob?

119
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,820
Uh, there's nothing wrong with...

120
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,080
Bob?

121
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,400
We just gotta plug up his holes.

122
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,000
See?

123
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,940
That worked.

124
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,920
Ready to...

125
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,520
Slack.

126
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,200
Little guy?

127
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,220
Whoa!

128
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,260
Oh, man!

129
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,640
Quick!

130
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,060
We gotta plug those holes!

131
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,800
Hurry!

132
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,400
All I can find is your glass eye collection!

133
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,920
What about your eye patch collection?

134
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,020
Aw, man, they're in mint condition.

135
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,700
Mama, mama, mama, mama, mama, mama!

136
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,800
One more patch!

137
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:15,900
Finished!

138
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,460
Ugh, Bob, you look terrible.

139
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,220
Now, I know you don't want to hear this, but I think we should cut our losses and bring

140
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,880
this fella back to where we found him.

141
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,100
We can't just abandon him.

142
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,020
Look at him, Jake.

143
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,620
He needs us now more than ever.

144
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,060
We just need to take better care of him.

145
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,060


146
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,060


147
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,060


148
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,060


149
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,060


150
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,060


151
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,060


152
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,060


153
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,060


154
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,060


155
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,060


156
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,060


157
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,060


158
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,020
Maybe from now on, right, Bob?

159
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,080
Oh, what?

160
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,200
Okay, Bob.

161
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:38,840
Exploded!

162
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,320
Maybe we can scrape him up and...

163
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,720
Ugh.

164
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,440
Oh!

165
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,540
Holy moly!

166
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,520
Don't worry, Bob.

167
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,400
We'll fix you.

168
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,440
Let's gather him up, Jake.

169
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,120
He's all over the place.

170
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,060
Even more.

171
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,060


172
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,060


173
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,060


174
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,060


175
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,060


176
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,060


177
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,060


178
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,060


179
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,060


180
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,060


181
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,060


182
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,060


183
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,060


184
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,060


185
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,060


186
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,060


187
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,160
We're in between the floorboards!

188
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,340
And the cupboards!

189
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,320
Hey!

190
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,400
Stop that!

191
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,200
I don't understand.

192
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,520
That crazy mama almost killed Bob.

193
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,840
He feels cold.

194
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,280
Dang it!

195
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,880
Why doesn't she love Bob?

196
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,900
I love him.

197
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,720
You love him.

198
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,740
It's not fair!

199
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,260


200
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:19,720
Finn!

201
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,280
Wait!

202
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,180
Mama's supposed to love Bob.

203
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,000
She's supposed to love Bob.

204
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,320
I figured it out, dude.

205
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,040
It's not fair!

206
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,040


207
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,040


208
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,040


209
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,040


210
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,040


211
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,040


212
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,060
Bob is a black mob.

213
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,080
Pizza smell like black.

214
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,920
That's how wild animals know what's going on.

215
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,960
And this guy right here is all drained out!

216
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,860
We gotta toss it in the black soup, brother.

217
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,220
Alright, okay.

218
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,600
I loved you, mob.

219
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,840
I hope you know that.

220
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,000
Word to your mother!

221
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,820
Ah!

222
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,740
Ah!

223
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:52,920
Ah!

224
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,180


225
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,340
Ah!

226
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,600
Ah!

227
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,040
Ah!

228
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,040


229
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,040


230
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,040


231
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,040


232
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,040


233
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,040


234
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,040


235
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,040


236
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,180
I'll never kidnap Bob again.

237
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,520
You said it.

238
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,840
That was a nightmare.

239
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,880
That's what they all say every time.

240
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,720
That collage there was by our friend, Reverend Exister.

241
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,760
It was probably originally aired on Minute of Slack, which was a podcast.

242
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:23,280
We discovered a new way to think.

243
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,160
What?

244
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,040
It had to do with piecing together new thoughts and new ideas.

245
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,040


246
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,040


247
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,540
Why is it that people think so?

248
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,440
What is it about?

249
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,360
Well, you think they have problems.

250
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,080
Think about the passengers of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

251
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
I had a vision about that.

252
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,420
I'm kind of intrigued by that whole thing.

253
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,860
Because it's spooky, you know?

254
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,520
Spooky stuff is good.

255
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,820
Here's my theory.

256
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,920
With...

257
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,980
The pilot's dead.

258
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:07,100
Responsible passengers, Dr. Jack Shepard, Sheriff Seth Bullock, and the real Reverend

259
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,840
Ivan Stang, not me, are trying to keep some semblance of law and order so everything doesn't

260
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,980
go completely Lord of the Flies.

261
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,100
There's a potentially dangerous power struggle between those more idealistic fellows and

262
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:25,300
the uncomfortable alliance of gang leaders Sawyer, Al Swearengen, and Philo Drummond.

263
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,040
And their various muscle men, minions, Saeed, and the others.

264
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:38,480
The power trio is balanced out by several strangely menacing bald-headed loners.

265
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,520
John Locke, Katahdin Legume, and Walter White.

266
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,420
White, Doc Fropp, Doc Cochran, and Mr. Wu, who is actually Stang in a poor disguise,

267
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,900
have managed with the help of forbidden scientist Daniel Faraday to provide and or manufacture

268
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,020
morphine, raw heroin, super meth amphetamine, and Fropp, a kind of drug that is used to kill

269
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,020


270
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,820
the

271
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:24,140
And so forth, friends.

272
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,540
Mysteries have been piling up.

273
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,540
The island is dotted with ruins.

274
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,920
Statues of giant pipe-smoking heads.

275
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,020
And strange beasts that have no place on an island somewhere off the coast of Malaysia.

276
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,500
Polar bears, rape bears, and jaggies.

277
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:45,440
Moreover, some kind of malignant spirit or monsters haunt the woods and may all be aspects

278
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,560
of the same evil.

279
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:55,020
They or it variously appear as a smoke monster, a huge reptile called the Lagiacrus, or a

280
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,680
prehistoric turtle named Olsiqua.

281
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,420
These creatures, the temples of the ancestral Mogians, and other mysteries are somehow related

282
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:09,460
to an entity or entities, Bob or Jacob, depending on which tribe of strange jungle-dwelling

283
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,800
worshippers one asks, the Others or the Others.

284
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:20,620
Jacob or Bob are arch enemies of the darker forces which gradually gather their own priests,

285
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,380
such as Loclegume and hired gun Silas Adams.

286
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:33,880
There are fiendishly intelligent but secretive entities even more dangerous to the passengers.

287
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,380
Ben Linus, George Hurst, and Gus Fring, arch criminal capitalists who have temporarily

288
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:46,020
aligned themselves in an attempt to take over or as they term it, save the island and quote,

289
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,780
send it back to Dobstown.

290
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:55,360
Of unknown allegiance are two non-threatening but ageless men who clues suggest may be the

291
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,820
hundreds of years old, Richard Alpert and Enoch Root.

292
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,840
Likewise, two men who are supposed to be long dead are repeatedly half glimpsed almost always

293
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:13,680
in formal attire, Dr. Christian Shepherd and a television writer named Rod Serling.

294
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,600
Prostitution.

295
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:25,020
The world's oldest profession has now become a dangerous kick for the teenager.

296
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,960
The

297
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:32,960


298
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,160
Maybe I'm making a mistake, but I don't think so.

299
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,260
I'm hurting no one but myself.

300
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,460
If life is to be lived and freedom to be enjoyed, that's for me.

301
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,800
I'm young.

302
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,240
I want to enjoy life while I can.

303
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,700
This young girl poses as a student to avoid detection.

304
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,340
Yet her one fear is getting caught by the police.

305
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:01,820
Though she lives at home, she is not happy since her family found out what she is doing.

306
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,000
She knows she has to either give it up or leave home.

307
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,000
A big decision for a young girl.

308
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,180
Hey pussycat, where the hell are you?

309
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,520
Hey pussycat, I'm looking for you.

310
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,900
Hey pussycat, now, now, now.

311
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,460
Hey pussycat, hey pussycat.

312
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,960
Hey pussycat, where you hiding, fool?

313
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,340
Hey pussycat, I'm looking for you.

314
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,180
Hey pussycat, who's behind you?

315
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,380
Hey pussycat, where the hell are you?

316
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,060
Hey pussycat, where the hell are you?

317
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,200
Hey pussycat, where are you?

318
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,220
Hey pussycat, where the hell are you?

319
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,400
Hey pussycat, I got you in the back seat.

320
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,740
Hey pussycat, I want to see you dance now.

321
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,680
Game, Pussycat

322
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,900
Gonna catch the loo

323
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,020
Game, Pussycat

324
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,400
You gotta come up your self

325
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:40,580
Oh

326
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,540
From hells

327
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,140
Hot

328
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,140
I zap at thee

329
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,100
For hate's sake

330
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,560
I'll

331
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,560


332
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,320
I spit

333
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,820
My last

334
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,440
Breath at thee

335
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,580
Oh

336
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,960
Dammit

337
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,400
Well

338
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,080
You are entering a door

339
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,660
A scary door

340
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,880
That signpost up ahead

341
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,540
In the hallway

342
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,760
It's

343
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,360
The parody zone

344
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,840
The noise

345
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,360
The miserable noise

346
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,160
Yah

347
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,160


348
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:41,840
BeBe

349
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,740
I swear

350
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,100
e

351
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,500
We keeping

352
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,120
You don't know

353
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,120


354
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,120


355
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,120


356
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,120


357
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,120


358
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,120


359
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,120


360
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,120


361
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,120


362
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,120


363
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,120


364
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,700
I

365
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,960
You

366
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:49,960


367
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:49,960


368
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,040
Down

369
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,040


370
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,380
Don't

371
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:53,420
I

372
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:53,440
Wanna

373
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:53,500
Try

374
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,040
To

375
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,920
Show

376
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,000
The

377
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,000


378
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,100
The

379
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,220
Best

380
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,380
It

381
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:02,640
Is

382
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:02,640


383
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:02,720
Man

384
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,520
To

385
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:04,520


386
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,240
Something

387
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,820
Inside

388
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,180
Of

389
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,100
Us

390
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:08,660
I

391
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:08,660


392
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:08,980
I

393
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:10,500


394
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,340
Have

395
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:09,720
Been

396
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,340
aç

397
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,180
People, people, people, people.

398
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,640
Is there no respite? Is there no relief?

399
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,220
Herds, groves, hosts, and bevvies of people.

400
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,680
Will you people stop muttering back there? I'm trying to work.

401
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,700
If you'd really like to know precisely why I am so dead tired,

402
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,640
you ought to try coming to work on the subway at 7.30 every morning,

403
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,820
then jamming into an elevator like part of a herd of cattle,

404
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,540
then working in that cacophonous dim that you call an office.

405
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,900
Always get jostled, always get shoved, always get pushed around.

406
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,240
Take hold of yourself, Beechcroft. Oh, goodness sakes, man, take hold.

407
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,500
I'll take hold, Mr. Rogers. I'll take hold when I can achieve that.

408
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,360
Millennium. That absolute perfection that comes with solitude.

409
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,580
You read me, Mr. Rogers?

410
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,440
If I had my way, here's how I'd fix the universe.

411
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,280
I'd eliminate the people. I mean cross them off.

412
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,760
Get rid of them, destroy them, decimate them.

413
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,280
And there'd only be one man left. Me.

414
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,080
Archer Beechbald S. Croftbald Archer Beechcroft Esquire.

415
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,500
Quite mad, Beechcroft. Do you know that?

416
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,380
Peep.

417
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,220
Meanwhile...

418
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,980
A friend of mine works in a bookstore around the corner.

419
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,620
I went there for the first part of the lunch break.

420
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,100
I got you this.

421
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,880
From Mind and Bob?

422
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,340
How you can achieve the ultimate power of Bob?

423
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,760
A little on the occult side, isn't it, Henry?

424
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,380
Maybe so, Mr. Beechcroft, but this friend of mine is...

425
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,940
Well, you might say he's a student of Bob.

426
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,740
He swears by that book.

427
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,680
He says, to the best of his knowledge, it's a book.

428
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,600
It's the only one in existence.

429
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,980
Would you believe it, Mr. Beechcroft?

430
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,020
I've seen...

431
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,920
I've seen my friend cause a woman to pick up Bob.

432
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:20,960
How's that?

433
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,560
That's right, Mr. Beechcroft.

434
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,900
He saw some woman, and he concentrated real hard on the chartreuse and orange one.

435
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:34,320
And, Mr. Beechcroft, as sure as I'm sitting here in the cafeteria of the Park Central Insurance Company,

436
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,520
that woman picked up Bob.

437
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,680
Well, it's the absolute unvarnished truth.

438
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,480
Oh, Mr. Beechcroft, Mr. Beechcroft.

439
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh, Mr. Beechcroft, please.

440
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,020
Oh.

441
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,900
Mr. Beechcroft.

442
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,800
Oh, Mr. Beechcroft, please.

443
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,040
Thank you so much, Henry, I...

444
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,980
I am indebted.

445
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,480
Well...

446
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,120
I...

447
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,460
Mr. Beechcroft.

448
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,180
Chapter 3.

449
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,640
That's the one on Bob.

450
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,160
Chapter 3.

451
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:10,940
Chapter 3.

452
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,160
Chapter 3.

453
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,840
Chapter 3.

454
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,860
Chapter 3.

455
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:17,440
Chapter 3.

456
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:17,440


457
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:17,440


458
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,620
Chapter 3.

459
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:19,680
Chapter 3.

460
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:19,680


461
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,100
Be while.

462
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,940
They're right.

463
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,380
They're absolutely, unequivocally right.

464
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,960
Bob is the most underrated, unknown power in the universe.

465
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,100
Well, a person could...

466
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,160
A person could...

467
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,660
Move mountains.

468
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:38,840


469
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,300
Move mountains.

470
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,400
Really no limit to what a man could do using the power of Bob.

471
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,700
No limit at all.

472
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,220
Well, I could just concentrate hard enough to get rid of the people.

473
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,100
That's what it takes.

474
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,480
Concentrate hard.

475
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,260
Getting rid of the people.

476
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,560
Getting rid of the people.

477
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:05,820
Getting rid of the people.

478
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:13,480
Go away. Disappear. Be extinct. Go away. Be extinct. Disappear.

479
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,500
Concentration. Mob over matter.

480
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,080
Today the landlady. Tomorrow the world.

481
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,300
Go away. Be extinct. Disappear.

482
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,140
Go away. Be extinct. Disappear.

483
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,640
Mob over matter.

484
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,960
Be extinct. Disappear.

485
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:59,100
Be extinct. Disappear.

486
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,280
Praying on you now, isn't it?

487
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,520
I mean the quiet. The emptiness.

488
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:23,900
Well, the thing of it is, it's just that while I don't care much for people, it's difficult not having anyone.

489
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,760
Why not get someone?

490
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,080
That's the point. Someone is everyone.

491
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,160
And I can't stand everyone. Or anyone for that matter.

492
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,220
There frankly isn't a...

493
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,720
Breed or a species of human being that I can stomach.

494
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,800
Ever thought of...

495
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,280
Mob?

496
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,160
Of course.

497
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,680
Of course. Why didn't I think of it before?

498
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,460
People.

499
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,740
People who I can stand. People like...

500
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,000
Mob?

501
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,820
That's what I'll do. I'll...

502
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,940
Create people.

503
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,280
But they'll... they'll be like...

504
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:00,820
Mob people.

505
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,500
A world full of...

506
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,100
Mob people.

507
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,320
That's a thought.

508
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,760
You bet your life.

509
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,720
That's a thought. You bet your sweet life.

510
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,280
That's what I'll do. I'll... I will it.

511
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,200
I'll concentrate and I will that from now on...

512
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,260
Everyone I see will be like...

513
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:16,960
Mob people.

514
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,000
Mob people.

515
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,340
Had it?

516
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,680
Undeniably.

517
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,140
Coming through, do you have?

518
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,080
Without a doubt.

519
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,140
A lot of mob people is just as bad as a lot of them.

520
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,040
It's interesting, but totally unbelievable.

521
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,180
I believe I've had it for the day.

522
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,960
I believe whatever I need to believe.

523
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,260
And I believe that was by that collage.

524
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,300
Well, that was an old Twilight Zone episode.

525
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,040
In fact, that was one that Dr. Hal and I had a little argument about at X Day once.

526
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,240
So everybody in this one Twilight Zone all looked like Shelley Berman or whoever the main actor was anyway.

527
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,660
I think that was the one that was chopped up by Reverend Exister, who exists in California.

528
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,920
And used to do the Minute of Slack podcast.

529
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,360
Some nice chop in there.

530
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:48,640
There was a little clip of a Devo demo or a Devo demo one, whatever.

531
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,780
And another collage by Exister.

532
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,320
And the very beginning titles in PR News are, of course, by the great Fernanda Nende, Lee Murr.

533
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,600
And...

534
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,300
Yes, yes.

535
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,000
Yes.

536
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,200
Princess Wee.

537
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,960
Yes, Reverend Stang.

538
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:17,000
Remember when I mentioned to you that I was getting kind of tired of my career since it's been going on for about 35 years now?

539
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,480
Yes, I do remember that.

540
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,320
And certain aspects of it.

541
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,720
And how I can't think about anything but my beloved video games.

542
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,360
Yes.

543
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,700
Mostly Monster Hunter.

544
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,160
Yes, it was quite disconcerting, yes.

545
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,560
And how my main video game character, the character that I put together for these Monster Hunters,

546
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,700
her name's Stangor.

547
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,200
Mm-hmm.

548
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,040
Stangor's been feeling overworked.

549
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,240
And he's just made...

550
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:41,780
I can well imagine that.

551
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,720
He's just made a pixel.

552
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,460
Well, you've seen.

553
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:43,860
Yeah.

554
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,420
I don't talk to you.

555
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,800
I just help him kill monsters.

556
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,180
Right.

557
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,260
Monster Hunter land.

558
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,600
Well, what if he and I change places?

559
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,440
You know, I would...

560
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,660
I'm really interested in monster hunting, and he's tired of it.

561
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,340
I don't know whether he's interested in Bob or...

562
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,620
I don't know whether he's interested in Bob or...

563
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:05,660
I don't know whether he's interested in Bob or...

564
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:05,660


565
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:05,660


566
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:10,440
or doing a radio show, but it would certainly be a change from running around the woods

567
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,880
trapping and bombing and stabbing at monsters.

568
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,500
Yeah.

569
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:25,960
It's just that I'm not made of pixels, and he is, and he can't handle a lot of the work

570
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,540
that I do since he's just made of pixels.

571
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:28,780
Yeah.

572
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,520
He can probably edit audio inside the computer.

573
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,020
But he wouldn't be able to come down to the station to put the audio on the air.

574
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,520
Right.

575
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:49,080
Likewise, I would be willing, in theory, to strap on a bunch of armor and go out and stab

576
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,760
monsters, especially if I had the kind of drugs that Stangor has.

577
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,320
But the monsters are made of pixels.

578
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,020
Or maybe it's the other way around.

579
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,360
Maybe that's the real world, and we're made.

580
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:02,780
We're made of pixels.

581
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,760
But what difference does it make?

582
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,760
Know what I'm saying?

583
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,140
Notch.

584
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,060
But this kind of merging between worlds has really been happening a lot.

585
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,440
Yeah, it has.

586
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,480
It happens in my...

587
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,120
In fact, I've been thinking David Cronenberg would probably pay good money to see my dreams

588
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,080
and rip them off.

589
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,140
I bet he would.

590
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,580
I think he would.

591
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:28,320
Because they're a mashup of the three TV shows that we've ever watched, modern shows, which

592
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,720
is Lost, Breaking Bad, and Deadwood.

593
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,960
Those are the only shows we've...

594
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,740
That aren't animated that we've watched.

595
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:40,920
And we did watch all of the Twilight Zones a few years ago.

596
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,360
Yes.

597
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,280
And, of course, the conspiracy spends all of its time watching Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

598
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,320
Yes.

599
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,960
Who should, but isn't.

600
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,520
That's interesting.

601
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,000
I wonder what happened there.

602
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,600
And, uh, can you...

603
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
I'll have to drop that Dave-man.

604
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,960
Yes.

605
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,420
Don't drop Dave.

606
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,080
That mayor...

607
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,580
That mayor...

608
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,040
We had to drop Dave.

609
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,480
Well, he dropped us.

610
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,280
I don't blame him.

611
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,440
I don't blame him.

612
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,260
You know, I've been dumped before.

613
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,220
How do you know he dumped us?

614
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,760
He hung up.

615
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,860
I didn't hang up on him.

616
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,780
I pushed the button.

617
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,200
The button...

618
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,640
Actually, I should turn this button off.

619
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,800
I think it was a ghost in the machine, and I don't think it had anything to do with Dave.

620
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:29,920
We had a call earlier in the evening at the station, which doesn't happen very often because

621
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,560
people who listen to the Hour of Slack...

622
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:37,220
know that we don't take calls from anyone except lonesome cowboy Dave, because nobody

623
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,400
else is that lonesome.

624
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,800
But it was our old friend Chuck Wurstrom, who has... did some really great audio stuff on

625
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,020
the old subgenius tapes.

626
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,360
But hopefully, now we would see Dave.

627
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,140
Hello?

628
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,300
Dave?

629
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,620
Can you hear me over this incredibly hellacious buzz?

630
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,240
Yeah, your buzz is quite bad, Dave.

631
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,060
It's extremely bad.

632
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,500
Did you understand?

633
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,140
It just happened that I didn't do it on purpose.

634
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,280
I don't know what's going on with this now.

635
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,080
Well, I told you the conspiracy was watching you.

636
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,220
And they're obviously recording us both, because I can hear an echo of myself.

637
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,620
Yeah, me too.

638
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,800
You can hear an echo of yourself?

639
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,300
Yes.

640
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,760
And I can hear the ocean on your terrible line.

641
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,260
Did you remember to...

642
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:22,440
Yeah, it's not only buzzing, it's cropping.

643
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,780
I wasn't doing that before.

644
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,000
Did you remember to unplug your message machine?

645
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,260
It's unplugged.

646
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:29,780
Dang.

647
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,480
Well, maybe you better plug it back in.

648
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,220
And then unplug it.

649
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,640
I don't know.

650
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:45,880
Friends, listeners, just to explain earlier tonight, Dave was talking to us by the miracle of the telephone at our office.

651
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,480
And he was worried about the buzz, which wasn't nearly as bad as it is now.

652
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,160
Not at all.

653
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,340
And he reached down and for some reason unplugged his answer machine, and the buzz disappeared.

654
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,480
Well, just a minute ago, I was flashing...

655
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:06,900
So I had to go in the other room for a little while and just sit quietly until things passed over.

656
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,060
And then, yeah, I came back and I redialed and then I forgot.

657
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,240
It became flatulent again.

658
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,660
And, no, I could hear the sound of wind rustling.

659
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,040
Well, it's really terrible.

660
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,660
I know.

661
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:26,400
I mean, I wonder if you ought to try, like, hang up, wiggle everything around and try one more time.

662
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,940
All right.

663
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,000
Okay, man.

664
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,300
Try it again.

665
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,260
All right.

666
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:31,380


667
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


668
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


669
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


670
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


671
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


672
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


673
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


674
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


675
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


676
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


677
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


678
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


679
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


680
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


681
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


682
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


683
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,480


684
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,140
We'll crank the music up a little bit.

685
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,760
I don't have any idea who did this music.

686
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,520
It's called Drug Songs.

687
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,000
And this one is called Hashish.

688
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,520
And the next one's called Mescaline.

689
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,560
And it's what our friends who didn't know the term techno said.

690
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,780
What's that Amsterdam music, man?

691
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,060
I happen to like that kind of computer music.

692
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,300
Because it's the only kind.

693
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,780
It's the only kind that I can make with my level of talent and skill.

694
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
Loop music.

695
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,020
And the rhythm is just so, I don't know, military or something for me.

696
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,840
Princess Wee is a folk singer.

697
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,220
I bet you all didn't know that.

698
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:26,580
But she actually is in a folk singing band that we don't talk about on this show because, frankly, we're afraid of you listeners.

699
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,280
And I mean, not all.

700
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,040
Not all of you, but most of you.

701
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,760
Yes, I would say that would be accurate.

702
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,940
So we're careful.

703
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,180
Although, you know, if somebody wanted to kill me, I'm easy to find.

704
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:47,140
But there's no sense in making it easy for you to find Princess Wee and her band.

705
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,160
No.

706
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,840
Because mostly they sing nice songs.

707
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,580
They're not like subgeniuses.

708
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,120
Actually, they are subgeniuses.

709
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,560
Technically, they are all subgeniuses.

710
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,240
But it's a folk band.

711
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,740
We even have original.

712
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:06,040
It's Dobbs songs written by Sister Melodious Jobs, the leader of the band.

713
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah, the marriage of Bob and Connie and several other.

714
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,440
There were like three Bob songs.

715
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:11,840
Yes.

716
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,320
Which I would love to play right now, but I can't.

717
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,360
And I wonder what happened today.

718
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,280
You know, we've gotten calls from people we can't put on.

719
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,120
And the one guy we could put on, I think he's putting us on.

720
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:30,000
I think he just adds those sound effects and he does this just to make it.

721
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,940
Do you see why I want to live in video game world?

722
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,180
These things don't happen.

723
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,080
Yes, I see, dear.

724
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,640
When you die, you come back to life there.

725
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,820
That's the biggest difference of all.

726
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,760
And you can be outdoors and it's never really hot or cold.

727
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,580
Even if you're in the tundra, you're still comfortable.

728
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,040
Even if you're in your desert, you're still comfortable.

729
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,940
What happened today?

730
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,240
Friends, can you help explain?

731
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:12,440
Or fix our callers and our listeners and the producers and vocal people on this show who are talking now like this?

732
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,500
Help us solve the mystery of the missing day.

733
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:14,720
That's a lot.

734
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,060
Miserable.

735
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,700
It's not as bad.

736
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,180
It's not as bad?

737
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:18,580
No.

738
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,100
No.

739
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:19,960
No.

740
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,360
It's a nice low level of kind of a rug of a hum.

741
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,240
The kind of hum we can riff off of where we imaginative enough.

742
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,280
Kind of like an electro rub in the back of your.

743
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:31,700
Skull.

744
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:32,980
Yeah.

745
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,720
Yeah.

746
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,020
Well, I'll try to look at it that way.

747
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,180
But pleasant.

748
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:45,080
You know, the problem is it kind of, it becomes louder between words.

749
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,620
Can you hear that?

750
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,120
Between each individual word.

751
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,600
There's a limiter somewhere filtering that thing.

752
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,440
A brain, an artificial brain, which lowers the.

753
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,320
Wow.

754
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:00,860
Wow.

755
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,180
That felt great.

756
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:02,940
Yeah.

757
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,900
How do we do that?

758
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,380
You're there?

759
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,300
Come on, man.

760
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,620
You guys are freaking me out now.

761
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,980
The buzz totally dropped.

762
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,700
It's gone.

763
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,060
I know.

764
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,080
It totally dropped.

765
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,060
I lost my buzz.

766
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,260
Do you have any idea of what you did or did you do anything?

767
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,280
I didn't really do anything.

768
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,520
I moved the phone a little teeny bit, but I'm afraid to move it again.

769
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,220
Don't touch her.

770
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,080
Don't touch.

771
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,700
That's like, I told you, that's like my phone.

772
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,760
I have, as long as, on my office phone.

773
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,220
But remember, Stang, it happened in phases.

774
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:36,860
Because I can subliminally redirect my thoughts to pick up each moment in time as it passes

775
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,340
and it recurs and stuff like that.

776
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,380
And so it kind of got a little bit quieter.

777
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,400
And then I moved the phone just a little teeny bit and it completely went off.

778
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,640
The limiter was in your head.

779
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,980
That's what my theory is.

780
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,320
Well, I'm sure it is.

781
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:58,360
That implant is probably putting out kind of an overworked 60 cycle hum.

782
00:30:59,140 --> 00:30:59,920
Any she.

783
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,700
Any 90.

784
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,440
Any 90.

785
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:01,460
Any 90.

786
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,460


787
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,460


788
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,460


789
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,460


790
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,460


791
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,460


792
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,460


793
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,460


794
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,460


795
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,460


796
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,460


797
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,460


798
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,460


799
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,460


800
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,460


801
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:08,840
97, 1959 inspired idiotic church or cult like the church of the subgenius

802
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,700
would think all actions are self-directed to begin with.

803
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,500
It's more like 1953.

804
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,220
And you got us confused.

805
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,560
No, you got us confused with the church of Scientology.

806
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,160
Our actions are defined only by Bob and he's paying no attention.

807
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,220
So it might as well all be random.

808
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,140
And once again, you.

809
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,840
Well, everyone except you.

810
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,180
Has free will.

811
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,600
You have a buzz.

812
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,640
You had free will, but now you have this hum or buzz.

813
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,620
A fuzzy cloud following you around, man.

814
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,540
Did you make the fuzzy cloud?

815
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,500
You know what I mean.

816
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,460
Did you create it with your mind or?

817
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,380
No, I ate too many.

818
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,140
I ate beans for breakfast.

819
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,680
That's where the fuzzy cloud came from.

820
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,220
The mighty cloud.

821
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,440
I ate the beans.

822
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,480
I forgot the bean.

823
00:31:59,520 --> 00:31:59,740
Oh.

824
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,460
So I'm living under a cloud.

825
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:01,800
I'm living under a cloud.

826
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,840
No one wants to be near me.

827
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:09,340
I would come and wash all of my troubles away in one swell swoop.

828
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,680
That's why we have to do radio shows.

829
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:17,120
We smell too bad to do television shows or God forbid, theater, comedy clubs.

830
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:23,280
And to tell the truth, you know, we don't have to smell the audience this way either or look at them.

831
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,380
Nor do they have to smell us for any particular reason other than they want to, you know.

832
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,620
Or if they're working for the national security.

833
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:30,780
Yeah.

834
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:34,200
Or if they're working for the national security agency, then they have to sniff us out.

835
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,420
Just in case.

836
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:43,960
Most of the New Orleans of Dr. Moreau are dog people who can sniff your underpants from a half a mile away and know if you contain any vessels of destruction.

837
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,280
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

838
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,240
No, but there seem to be a lot of mutant animals going around.

839
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,380
I remember you always talking about that back in the old days.

840
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,440
It was so sublime, so misconstrued.

841
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,320
I used to cry.

842
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:00,600
I was like, oh, my God.

843
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:00,600


844
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:06,700
Sometimes, real late at night, I'd drink a half a jug of spiked lemonade and go crawl up in a corner and suck my thumb.

845
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,220
But that's not the good part.

846
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,920
That explains our older shows.

847
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,000
The wisdom you imparted.

848
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,560
The wisdom you imparted.

849
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:25,400
Well, the problem is there were a lot of mutant animals around, but some of them managed to reproduce.

850
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,300
And now you can't call them mutants.

851
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,580
They're just a new species.

852
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,380
Hence the word subgenius.

853
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,460
They are very, very, very weird.

854
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,540
I think I have seen one one time in my own neighborhood.

855
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,380
It just looked like a cross between a bald weasel.

856
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,960
You know, if somebody said, hey, have you ever heard of the chupacabras?

857
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,380
You know, in Mexico and like that.

858
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,920
And of course, everyone knows about it.

859
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,820
What's that sound?

860
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,440
Well, Dave, it is.

861
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:06,140
It's sad because late at night lately, I've been looking out in my yard or the moat rather around the slacker mansion.

862
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:11,800
And they're out there trying to eat bark off of bushes.

863
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:18,700
You know, the leaves are long gone and they're trying to eat the bark because that's all they have.

864
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,300
And they're all bruised up and banged up.

865
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,360
You can be limp because they've all been hit by cars trying to cross roads.

866
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,560
And I just feel terrible about this.

867
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,500
The strife subgenius is.

868
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,700
But there's what can you do?

869
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,240
Well, first of all, you have to let them smoke.

870
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,820
I don't mean that in a devil idolatry way.

871
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,760
Let them go to hell and burn or nothing like that.

872
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,460
But you have to cook them a little bit.

873
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,520
You have to raise a gentle fire under the buttocks until the brain gets warm.

874
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,380
And it takes a long time if you do it at the right temperature.

875
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,220
Just kind of roll them over in the oil.

876
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,460
And plus, cigarettes are so expensive now.

877
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,020
So smoking them costs and it takes a long time.

878
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,460
And it's a hell of a task.

879
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,220
Right.

880
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,100
And am I responsible?

881
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,460
Subgenius up into a cigarette and with, you know, a couple thousand papers.

882
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,520
It usually takes a couple packs anyway.

883
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,200
Right.

884
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,800
And they're usually wet and they won't light.

885
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,020
Yeah.

886
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,200
Their hair doesn't catch fire the way it's supposed to.

887
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,260
And they never smell like they're, you know, like they're advertised.

888
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,540
Yeah.

889
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,140
A Turkish blend turns out to be a Turkish delight, you know.

890
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,440
It's not funny.

891
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,120
I don't know why you're laughing, Princess League.

892
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,160
And we're going to be like no subgeniuses ourselves.

893
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,600
Well, you know, it's the kind of thing when you see your grandmother fall down the steps and you break out in laughter.

894
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,740
And you go, oh, it's because it wasn't me, I guess.

895
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,040
They roll, they roll you up and they smoke you.

896
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,720
That's what they would do if they could.

897
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,620
Them, I mean.

898
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,000
You know, not the others, but the others.

899
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:54,720
So in cooking terminology, that would be a subgenius unpapeot, right?

900
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,220
Unpapeot.

901
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:56,860
Unpapeot, yeah.

902
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,540
Subgenius unpapeot.

903
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:58,800
Unpapeot.

904
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,620
You could have with a little bit of brioche, we could just put on your forehead.

905
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,260
Right.

906
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,880
Just a little, just a dab.

907
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,240
A dab will do you.

908
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,960
You could wear a little pink on each ear like a deer mouth.

909
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:23,020
Princess Wee is laughing at me because once again, I find myself in between two people who are talking about food.

910
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,960
And that causes those of us who are not.

911
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:28,940
And that causes those of us who are not.

912
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:37,360
Connoisseurs of fine foods wait for them to quit talking about food by waving our heads slowly back and forth.

913
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,760
Patiently.

914
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:46,160
Yeah, one might wonder, might ask, you know, what the hell, what the heck does Bob have to do with cuisine?

915
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,440
Well, see, we've changed the subject.

916
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,380
So now it's our question.

917
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,180
Of course, our next day.

918
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,500
Almost every Friday night, we have dinner with our friend, Mr. Sister.

919
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,540
And at some point, he and Princess...

920
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,300
Princess Wee start talking about food.

921
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:11,420
And that's when his son and I just kind of wave our heads back and forth waiting for the subject matter to change to something interesting like a drink.

922
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,200
I don't know.

923
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,980
Maybe you shouldn't wear the huge Viking helmets that weigh 120 pounds.

924
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,880
And you guys wouldn't be waving your heads all the time.

925
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,220
It's a silly way to spend Friday evening if you ask me.

926
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,740
When you dress up like Vikings and stuff.

927
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,480
I don't do that.

928
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,940
Yeah, this Princess Wee does that.

929
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,820
She's the one with the Viking, the Brunhilde helmet.

930
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,160
I don't...

931
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,000
You might have seen me do that once for a joke.

932
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,240
Like in drag.

933
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,640
Oh, I'm Princess Wee.

934
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,340
I'm from outer space.

935
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,700
And look, I'm Viking from outer space.

936
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,740
I'm so beautiful.

937
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,260
Eee!

938
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,560
But I don't wear that crown anywhere out.

939
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,580
Like, especially to the fish fry.

940
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,340
My goodness.

941
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,560
Well, but to X Day, maybe.

942
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,140
Yes, to X Day, I would.

943
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:57,820
Yes.

944
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,340
Well, maybe.

945
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,720
Someday, the light on that other horn will start flashing.

946
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,640
And on that moment, that will be the signal to the men from Planet X

947
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,240
to come down and rupture up us subgeniuses

948
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,900
and save us from this planet of the clocks.

949
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,540
The shadow people.

950
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,620
The hollow, empty people.

951
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,780
Yeah, people, sure.

952
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,660
What I always wish to ask you, Reverend Stang,

953
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,500
and all the times we've spoken on the air

954
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,000
or besides that the truck stopped a few times

955
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,320
that you did leave,

956
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,140
let me talk to you.

957
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,340
I always remember you mentioning

958
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:38,120
one very important fact about the Church of the Subgenius,

959
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,320
which was completely,

960
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,240
I completely forgot what the...

961
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,640
That blunt, huh?

962
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:51,000
It was in direct response to what Reverend Ivan Stang was saying.

963
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,440
Well, it's drug-related, basically.

964
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,220
You're familiar with that story,

965
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,140
the strange case of Dr.

966
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,640
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?

967
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,180
I know of Dr.

968
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,400
Strangelove and Dr.

969
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:02,960
Moreau.

970
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,180
Those are the only doctors that I want to play in the band with.

971
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,320
Now, that was by Robert Louis Stevenson,

972
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,700
but his grandson, Neil Stevenson,

973
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,700
wrote a more accurate version that kind of fits me.

974
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,740
You know, the idea behind Dr.

975
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,400
Jekyll and Mr.

976
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,740
Hyde is that man has two sides,

977
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,300
you know, a good side and a bad.

978
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,780
Which is kind of silly,

979
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:33,960
because only people differentiate between good and bad in that way.

980
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,060
And Dr. Jekyll,

981
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,920
wanting to know how the other half lives,

982
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,080
or perhaps wanting,

983
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,300
out of the most pure ideals,

984
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:47,360
just creates a drug that will separate the two sides.

985
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,220
And he finds himself turning into Mr. Hyde,

986
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,800
who is, instead of being a simpering prude who's all good,

987
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,480
is the opposite.

988
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,120
He's a real badass.

989
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,920
Well, I'm not like Dr.

990
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:01,560
Jekyll.

991
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,480
I don't have that good side.

992
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,120
Well, you don't necessarily have a bad side.

993
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,900
But I'm not just a Mr.

994
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,640
Hyde.

995
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,220
I like to think that in my case,

996
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,520
it's more like Mr.

997
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,940
Hyde and Reverend Seek.

998
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:21,240
Or perhaps there is a Jekyll in there and there's three Stooges altogether.

999
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,800
But that would require more drugs to separate.

1000
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,820
Because I don't want to be Dr.

1001
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,280
Jekyll and I don't want to be Mr.

1002
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:27,980
Hyde.

1003
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,680
I'd rather be Reverend Seek, you know?

1004
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,460
Yeah.

1005
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,560
And you could spell it S-I-K-H and you'd have to wear a beard.

1006
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,140
Right.

1007
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,060
You wouldn't just choose to wear it.

1008
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,900
Like, that's why when I chose Dr.

1009
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,440
Jekyll and Mr.

1010
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,740
Hyde, Jekyll and Mr.

1011
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:51,840
Hyde and stuff, I realized I was going to have quite a moral dilemma viewing any kind of conflict between Jekyll and Hyde,

1012
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,360
who seemed to agree to be the Mr.

1013
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,140
Hyde of the Dr.

1014
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,300
Jekyll and Hyde character.

1015
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,640
Well, they were both Hyde-like.

1016
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,260
Right.

1017
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,620
They were both black crows, weren't they?

1018
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,380
I guess that's the only kind of crow there is.

1019
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,600
Like an encyclopedia.

1020
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,420
Were they British?

1021
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:15,600
They had kind of a 1930s wise guy kind of parlance.

1022
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,320
That's what I thought.

1023
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:23,120
It was like, to my youthful ears, hearing the heckle and Jekyll on the TV shows.

1024
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,060
Or was one of them like a wise guy?

1025
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:28,280
Yeah.

1026
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,120
A Bronx wise guy.

1027
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,880
And one of them was almost British.

1028
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,320
Perhaps that's it.

1029
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,540
But then maybe you're also getting Daffy Duck's card playing and gambling buddies.

1030
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,640
Well, then there's the goofy gophers, which were the, you know, oh, after you.

1031
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,400
No, no, no.

1032
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:42,860
You first.

1033
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,140
Oh, indubitably.

1034
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,020
Inevitably.

1035
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,680
You know which ones I'm talking about.

1036
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,040
Right.

1037
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,460
Exactly.

1038
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:54,000
The ones with the bubble drums and little tiny hats that go inside the brain instead of outside the head.

1039
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,420
Right.

1040
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,900
So the question is, which is real?

1041
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,800
The cartoon people or us?

1042
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:57,940
Us.

1043
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,760
The video game people or us?

1044
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,460
Probably it's us.

1045
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:09,680
But how do we know we're not some tune or game or thing of some other player?

1046
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,540
Which, of course, is where people get the idea of God.

1047
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:19,920
Certainly we know that if Bob is playing us, he's bad.

1048
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,500
He's just not a very good player.

1049
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:22,660
Yeah.

1050
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,360
He's a cultural.

1051
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,780
What do you want?

1052
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,180
I don't know.

1053
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:25,760
What's the word?

1054
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,460
He left.

1055
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,400
He walked away from.

1056
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,200
He's losing sore.

1057
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,280
Pardon?

1058
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,340
He walked away from the PlayStation and just left us hanging.

1059
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,720
Yeah.

1060
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,880
And he was wearing diapers too.

1061
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,340
And they were well soiled.

1062
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,000
And he was talking to himself.

1063
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,760
But we don't know.

1064
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:48,640
I mean, I honestly, I get the impression that, you know, I've done animated films and I've

1065
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,760
done, I've played video games and I've never had the impression.

1066
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,680
I've illuminated his head with a little teeny light bulb.

1067
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,380
Well, I never got the impression that the characters, you know, they're not real.

1068
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:57,380


1069
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:57,380


1070
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:57,380


1071
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,720
That they were anything but characters.

1072
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,100
I never, they never talked back to me, you know?

1073
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:07,560
Well, how do we know we're not in the same boat with some other Uber player or designer?

1074
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:12,100
That drags into the whole, that whole religion business.

1075
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:16,860
You know, we try to say no Bob, no aim, no race.

1076
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,940
We're out of the race, but because of a flat tire.

1077
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,680
But how do we know?

1078
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,380
Yeah.

1079
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,240
Anyway.

1080
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,040
You know, when, when Princess, we.

1081
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:36,080
Well, the new knows, I think, but if we had goldfish, you know, they don't know that

1082
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,480
we're, that they're in our goldfish bowl.

1083
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,840
That's the whole world.

1084
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,700
To the, to the rat in the cheese.

1085
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,340
The cheese is the universe.

1086
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,800
Every once in a while we do look out of our bowl, don't we?

1087
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,380
And not just look up at the food and stuff, but we look up at who's dispensing the food.

1088
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,600
Well, we think we do.

1089
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,080
And people get all kinds of ideas.

1090
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:05,980
Oh, well, it's the Catholic God or the Jewish God or the Muslim God or some kind of, or God forbid, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1091
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,420
Although he doesn't really fit into that bracket.

1092
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,040
He's not nearly as well connected as those others.

1093
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,000
Like old school Ph.A.T., you know.

1094
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:15,700
Right.

1095
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,440
He wasn't styled too much, especially after he got his ears trimmed down.

1096
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,580
Speaking of ears trimmed, I think your, your buzz came back.

1097
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,580
No, I thought that was.

1098
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,300
I thought that was your buzz, but I guess we can call it mine if you want.

1099
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,600
You know what?

1100
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,240
I think you're right.

1101
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,200
I think this is the station ocean.

1102
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,660
I thought it was a snowstorm that was.

1103
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,260
It has a certain.

1104
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,180
Had moved in.

1105
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,220
And you know, it's not the station.

1106
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,300
It's not.

1107
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,580
No, it's not the station.

1108
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,460
It wasn't the station that crucified Jesus.

1109
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,260
It was the, and it wasn't the Romans.

1110
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,540
It was the cops.

1111
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,500
The cops.

1112
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,740
The cops nailed Jesus.

1113
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,400
It was the cops all along.

1114
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,800
But Bob is the God that didn't get nailed.

1115
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,560
Because nobody cared enough.

1116
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,420
He wasn't that much of a threat.

1117
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,400
And let's keep it that way.

1118
00:44:59,500 --> 00:44:59,980
Friends.

1119
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,340
They tried to drive a couple of balled up pieces of paper into his hands.

1120
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,240
They tried to sponge his forehead, but it was filled with the wrong stuff.

1121
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,240
And so he ejaculated the wrong way.

1122
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:14,120
And then they had to take them down again a couple of times because he didn't, you know,

1123
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,440
he just wouldn't stick anyway.

1124
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:22,700
Now, Dave, I hate to bring up something embarrassing, but this noise we keep hearing this interference.

1125
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,460
Could it be?

1126
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,140
Could it be your bad habits?

1127
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:32,340
Maybe you should take your hand out of that deep, deep pocket of yours.

1128
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:39,000
We all know you have deep pockets and we know where they go because there's a little opening at the end of them, isn't there?

1129
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:39,780
Yeah.

1130
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,500
Uh-huh.

1131
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,180
I never sewed that up because I, of course not.

1132
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,560
Why would anybody sew up a pocket and hurt yourself?

1133
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:55,260
Boy, you know, now I can almost hear each cruddy scrape.

1134
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:05,000
I can almost hear each scrape of electronic noise as if it was some kind of a chisel against my ears, against my tympanic membrane.

1135
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,020
Or just my manic membrane.

1136
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:08,880
I don't know.

1137
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,040
Tim may have nothing to do with it.

1138
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,860
But it does come and go.

1139
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,480
And it's hard to tell from the background music.

1140
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,240
Here, watch me pull this out.

1141
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,760
See, you still hear noise.

1142
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,180
Do you hear the crumbling there?

1143
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,260
It's a giant snowstorm of crumble.

1144
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,740
There was a vicious, and I thought that was the background.

1145
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,500
It's kind of like snow thunder.

1146
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:36,000
No, your buzz, you know, it started out as a hum when you first called.

1147
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,900
Then it turned into kind of a buzz and then a buzz crumpled.

1148
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,500
Then it went away.

1149
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,220
And now it's gone back to the sort of crumply.

1150
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,820
It's become palpable.

1151
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,220
Palpatable, in fact.

1152
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:48,920
Palpatable.

1153
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,840
It's not only palpable.

1154
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,820
It's not only palpable, but one may palpate it.

1155
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:53,680
The sound.

1156
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:54,900
It's like a cushion.

1157
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:01,640
But it's cushion shaped, but its consistency is more like shredded wheat.

1158
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,260
It's thick, soft, and crunchy.

1159
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:04,440
And what's the time?

1160
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,880
What's the waveform for shredded wheat?

1161
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,800
What's the frequency, Kenneth?

1162
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,440
You know, I'll be looking at that waveform later tonight or tomorrow.

1163
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,220
You will?

1164
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:16,820
Yes.

1165
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,840
Yeah, I look at a lot of waveforms.

1166
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:20,820
And I'm not going to tell you.

1167
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,020
I'm not going to tell you.

1168
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:27,660
Susie the floozy and I both have gotten to where we can recognize the waveform for the word sish.

1169
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,740
I just did that one backwards.

1170
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,360
I just reversed it.

1171
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:32,640
And cough.

1172
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,060
If you reverse those, they become dirty words.

1173
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:46,780
And you can recognize them in the waveform on your monitor as you're editing your show trying to make it clean, which won't happen to this one.

1174
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,400
We can't clean it.

1175
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,240
This is a dirty, dirty show.

1176
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:51,920
Listen to that.

1177
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:59,100
It sounds like you can almost imagine the mice nibbling on the wires in Dave's basement.

1178
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,300
See, to me, it's a pure, clean, white snow sound.

1179
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:03,640
No, no.

1180
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,340
No, that would be just snow crash.

1181
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,860
Why did it go off so suddenly?

1182
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:17,020
Speaking of snow crash, I read the most hilarious description of eating Captain Crunch cereal.

1183
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:26,760
Today, I was reading this Robert Lewis Neal Stevenson book called Cryptonomicon and Mr. Hyde.

1184
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,880
The strange case of Dr. Cryptonomicon and Mr. Hyde in it.

1185
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,660
Out of the blue, suddenly I found myself reading.

1186
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,480
It was such a great.

1187
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,520
I don't have it with me.

1188
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,640
I would be tempted to read it on the air.

1189
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,320
It was such a great description of Captain Crunch.

1190
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,760
Can you paraphrase at least?

1191
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,000
Well, this particular character was the odd one.

1192
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:47,820
He was the opposite of me.

1193
00:48:47,960 --> 00:49:05,200
He liked to eat his Captain Crunch instantly when the milk met it so that the milk didn't have a chance to soften the lacerating nature of that hard sugar that coats each Captain Crunch pillow-shaped nodule.

1194
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,560
This is a reckoning of value?

1195
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,280
Yeah.

1196
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:14,780
I personally liked back when I was into this sort of cereal before bedtime.

1197
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,000
I would fill a bowl full of cereal.

1198
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,520
I would fill a bowl to the top of Captain Crunch or even higher.

1199
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,120
Then I'd put my hand on it and mush it down.

1200
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,200
Then I'd hold my hand on it while I poured milk in so that it couldn't float away.

1201
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,160
So that it would all turn into a kind of a bowl of sugar mush.

1202
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:38,400
Sugar corn milk mush that didn't lacerate my tongue as much as fresh Captain Crunch.

1203
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,260
Oh, and how he adored his Captain Crunch mush.

1204
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,200
Yeah, my doctor told me not to.

1205
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,860
So what you're saying is essentially this is more interesting than the sound of a buzzing

1206
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,740
popping crackling fizzling sound.

1207
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,060
I was trying to get, yeah.

1208
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:55,180
You're talking about Captain Crunch now lacerating the insides of your mouth and your gums and stuff.

1209
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,400
Because you liked that as a child.

1210
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,740
Isn't this some kind of product liability lawsuit waiting to happen?

1211
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,280
But what a digression though.

1212
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,800
Think of it in legal terms when you're trying to prove your case, man.

1213
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,820
Well, you know how they're able to get away with it is it's a product of the Quaker Oats company.

1214
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,400
And they have that Quaker guy on there and it's like, aw, how could anybody be mad at him?

1215
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:16,220
Yeah.

1216
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:20,520
And then you think of what the hell is he sitting on to make him smile like that?

1217
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,540
You don't want to know.

1218
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,660
Neil Stephenson's description of Captain Crunch.

1219
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,020
Which is forbidden.

1220
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:41,160
I didn't recognize that he was talking about a cereal box, but he said this brick-shaped box had a naval officer on it who looked happy and yet strangely hauntingly sad.

1221
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:46,200
And you know what's even worse is the markings on his uniform would indicate that he was a soldier.

1222
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:46,200


1223
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:46,960
And it would indicate that he's not a captain.

1224
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:48,300
Right.

1225
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,160
Oh, really?

1226
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:52,100
Yeah, it's like some lesser rank.

1227
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,280
I don't read Braille.

1228
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,400
So I don't know.

1229
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,280
I didn't know what his rank was.

1230
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,060
I just heard this in the news a few years ago.

1231
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,840
I should ask my dad.

1232
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,700
He's a Navy.

1233
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:02,460
Well, there is a morph.

1234
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,500
He is a captain.

1235
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,440
Yes, he would know.

1236
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,780
Captain Crunch and the Quaker Oats guy.

1237
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,800
And that's kind of like crept into everyone's subconscious.

1238
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:14,020
Well, and then there was Captain Crunch the phone hacker, the famous hacker.

1239
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:15,380
Who?

1240
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,760
Oh, my God, can you believe it?

1241
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:19,560
Figured out how to make phone calls, long-distance phone calls for free.

1242
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,520
Oh, what a hacker.

1243
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,940
Oh, he's going to destroy the world with the, he'll set off all the nuclear weapons.

1244
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,320
Once upon a time, that was something.

1245
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,340
Yeah.

1246
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,000
Right, exactly.

1247
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:31,520
At that time, that was, oh, God, the world's going to end.

1248
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:39,100
Some guy was able to, he could whistle, put a certain whistle tone that would make the call free, I think.

1249
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:39,940
It was that simple.

1250
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:44,660
It's not just as simple as whistling because the tones on the touch tone thing are not simple.

1251
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,760
They're single tones.

1252
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:46,700
They're chords.

1253
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,840
Very dissonant chords, but chords.

1254
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:49,360
Right.

1255
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:53,860
So you have to be able to hum at one frequency and whistle at a different frequency at the same time.

1256
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,340
Ah, that's tricky.

1257
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,800
You have to make your mouth really, really weird.

1258
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,480
My daughter, Civet, was able to do that.

1259
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,360
She was able to send fax.

1260
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:07,340
She couldn't receive a fax, obviously, but she could send a fax using her mouth.

1261
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,000
She could call a fax machine.

1262
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:09,560
They go .

1263
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,040
You ever figured that out?

1264
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,220
It would spell out her name or something.

1265
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:14,640
Yeah.

1266
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:17,260
It would be an image or something you could recognize.

1267
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,340
That was her superpower.

1268
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,660
I have a hard time believing that, and yet I believe it.

1269
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:29,200
Well, you know, when I was a kid, I figured out how to play all kinds of different songs on the phone keypad.

1270
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,500
Oh, there are CDs, yeah.

1271
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,780
Until my parents opened their phone bill one month and had a little talk with me.

1272
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:39,980
You know, honest to God, the best version of Jocko Homo I've ever heard is one that was done on a telephone.

1273
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:47,140
It just sounded perfect that way.

1274
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,560
I can well imagine.

1275
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:48,980
It was so Devo.

1276
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,520
It was more Devo than Devo.

1277
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,320
It was more Devo than little Theodore.

1278
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,240
That's way more Devo than Devo.

1279
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:57,700
That is.

1280
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,460
Rebels against 1980s technology.

1281
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,680
And now, look at them now.

1282
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,640
Where are they now?

1283
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,660
They're kings of science and modern anatomy.

1284
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,740
Some of them don't even have any physical body parts right now.

1285
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,420
Or I mean that they're sharing with others, if they could.

1286
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,080
How about a little necrophilia?

1287
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:16,740
That's the only one I remember.

1288
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,360
Yeah, that reminded me.

1289
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,500
Necrophilia reminded me of what I was going to ask Stan in the first part.

1290
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,360
My lovers don't complain.

1291
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:30,340
What happens to the ones who aren't dead on X day, aren't in the vessels, and who furthermore are just wounded?

1292
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:38,840
Well, they get to stay behind on the devastated earth or what's left of it as long as they can hang in there.

1293
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:39,720
Right.

1294
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:43,320
What if their wounds are mostly emotional and spiritual rather than physical?

1295
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:50,840
We don't care what happens to anybody who didn't buy a subgenius membership.

1296
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:55,480
Not that I can go into any detail about that on a public supported station.

1297
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,680
Thank you, taxpayers.

1298
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,340
It's not taxpayer funding.

1299
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,300
It's not.

1300
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,080
Yeah, that's true.

1301
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:01,520
Right.

1302
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:02,060
That's true.

1303
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,020
The nature of our reasons.

1304
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,520
You have to remember to say that three times.

1305
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:05,060
Right.

1306
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,000
It's not taxpayer.

1307
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,840
So nobody's paying us.

1308
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:10,100
Nobody cares.

1309
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,000
That's the truth.

1310
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:11,800
That's right.

1311
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,340
You know, I was working for free before it was cool.

1312
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:17,000
Where?

1313
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,840
That's not very cool, man.

1314
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:19,020
Right here.

1315
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:19,220
Here.

1316
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,840
Oh, yeah, of course.

1317
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,060
There.

1318
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,500
Dave and I were working here for free before you were even born, Dr. Sinister.

1319
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,280
I know.

1320
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,380
That's not when he was born.

1321
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,920
It was when he was a mere toddler.

1322
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,260
And he had his own vegetable garden.

1323
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,820
You remember, don't you, Dr. Sinister?

1324
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:37,820


1325
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:37,820


1326
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:37,820


1327
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:37,820


1328
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:37,820


1329
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:37,820


1330
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:37,820


1331
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:37,820


1332
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:37,820


1333
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:37,820


1334
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:37,820


1335
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:37,820


1336
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:37,820


1337
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:43,360
Actually, I was told that my parents found me underneath a leaf in their cabbage patch.

1338
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,940
Did they really?

1339
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:45,920
Yeah, that's when I was going after.

1340
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,380
No, not really.

1341
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:52,800
They actually told me because, like, my little sister came along when I was, like, shortly

1342
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,020
after my third birthday.

1343
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,460
And my parents explained the sperm and the egg to me.

1344
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,780
They just didn't explain how they got in touch with each other.

1345
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:01,780
Right.

1346
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,480
Yeah, they always leave the really good part out.

1347
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,700
Maybe there's something like that.

1348
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,800
It's left your imagination, and you come up with a new idea.

1349
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:07,800


1350
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:07,800


1351
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:07,800


1352
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:07,800


1353
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:07,800


1354
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:07,800


1355
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:07,800


1356
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:07,800


1357
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:14,520
I was kind of afraid that maybe bees were stinging my parents in their sleep because

1358
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,280
bees will pollinate flowers.

1359
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:17,620
Bees and birds.

1360
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:18,740
Maybe they'll put one in mine.

1361
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:24,740
You know, a lot of people don't, younger kids, don't know that you have to be a female to

1362
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,440
have a child.

1363
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,640
They don't teach that.

1364
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,200
It's against the law to teach that kind of thing now.

1365
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:34,540
At least in Kansas, Texas, Florida, a bunch of those places.

1366
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,400
Yeah, the same place where they get alligators.

1367
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:36,780
Southern Ohio.

1368
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:37,220
Yeah.

1369
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:37,940
They get alligators.

1370
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:38,080
They're in the alligator meet.

1371
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:42,100
And they're in all that weird, you know, the spontaneous dances and everything.

1372
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,920
And some of them wear like those goofy headbands.

1373
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:53,400
Well, Dr. Sinister, I guess you'll find out when you do your show later on whether

1374
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:58,640
this roughage we hear on the phone is from Dave or from us.

1375
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,660
Speaking of which, we have to take out of here.

1376
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:02,980
Goodness gracious.

1377
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:07,440
It's only about three minutes left, and I have a three-minute Devo song called

1378
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:07,780
Fountain.

1379
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,840
Fountain of Filth.

1380
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,000
That can't be a coincidence.

1381
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:10,880
Right.

1382
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,520
It's not.

1383
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,300
Of course it's not.

1384
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,300
Are you kidding?

1385
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:18,640
I actually, unlike you, Dr. Sinister, I actually plan these shows.

1386
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,860
Every word uttered has to pass a board of censors.

1387
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,700
And boy, are they bored.

1388
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,320
They are bored as hell.

1389
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,440
So Dave, I'm going to have to sign you off.

1390
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:35,900
And then you'll know if your spasm is still working.

1391
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,780
Because then you'll have the, you know, the...

1392
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,160
You'll know the right material to work with.

1393
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:39,840
That's true.

1394
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,300
Why don't I just drop you right now, and we'll see what happens.

1395
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,080
Don't drop Dave.

1396
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,300
Usually I fade him out like this.

1397
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,400
Yeah, that's so sad.

1398
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,100
But then I drop...

1399
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,440
He won't drop if he doesn't look down.

1400
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,080
I don't hear anything.

1401
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:51,360
Listen.

1402
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:57,380
Well, we still don't know whether it was Dave or Line 1.

1403
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,960
It could be Line 1.

1404
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:01,320
It could be.

1405
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,720
It could just be a bunch of line.

1406
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,500
Now, oh, shucks, said Stan.

1407
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,680
Oh, no.

1408
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,000
I take that back.

1409
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,060
I don't mean shucks.

1410
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,920
I mean this.

1411
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,600
There it was.

1412
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,060
Just like old faithful.

1413
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:25,720
The eternal fountain of filth.

1414
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:36,140
And like old faithful, I'm going to have to say it again.

1415
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:37,320
Oh, no.

1416
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:37,460
I take that back.

1417
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:37,460


1418
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:37,460


1419
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:37,460


1420
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:37,460


1421
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:37,460


1422
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:37,460


1423
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,840
I took a walk straight out of town

1424
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,560
With hands up and took my time for pleasure

1425
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,280
I was alone, I looked around

1426
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,080
I heard a voice so I buckled up for safety

1427
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,060
I saw myself there on the ground

1428
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:05,680
A pool of sound that showed my own reflection

1429
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,840
In a fountain of filth

1430
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,520
It was a fountain of filth

1431
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,160
Eternal fountain of filth

1432
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,260
I tried to run, I couldn't move

1433
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:23,160
Throated stiff while the thoughts of men fed me

1434
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,820
Out of my head, the fountain shot

1435
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:29,740
Drowned me in a serum that I couldn't put a stop to

1436
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,520
It was me, myself and I

1437
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,520
Locked in a struggle with the talking

1438
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:36,440
And below me

1439
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:40,500
I had a hunger to make me do things

1440
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,160
I had a hunger to make me say things

1441
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,840
I had a hunger to make me want things

1442
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,600
I'm just a victim of filth

1443
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,360
Eternal fountain of filth

1444
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,240
And now I'll be safe

1445
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,200
From the power of

1446
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,940
From the reach of

1447
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,500
From the appeal of

1448
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,580
Eternal fountain of filth

1449
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:05,500
From the reach of

1450
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,140
From the appeal of

00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:08,840
Eternal fountain of filth

1452
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,080
I got a hunger to make me do things

1453
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,600
I got a hunger to make me say things

1454
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,300
I got a hunger to make me want things

1455
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,120
I'm just a victim of filth

1456
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:20,820
Eternal fountain of filth

1457
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:22,600
And now I'll be safe

1458
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,700
From the power of

1459
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,400
From the reach of

1460
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,080
From the appeal of

00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,040
Eternal fountain of filth

1462
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:35,500
From the reach of

1463

From the reach of

1464
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:38,180
The very zit of

1465
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:38,180


1466
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:38,180


1467
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:38,180


1468
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:39,220
Eternal fountain of filth

1469
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,540
I had a hunger to make me do things

1470
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,140
I had a hunger to make me say things

1471
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,780
I had a hunger to make me want things

1472
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,540
I'm just a victim of filth

1473
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,260
Eternal fountain of filth

1474
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,780
Eternal fountain of filth

00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:53,940
Eternal fountain of filth

00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:54,580
Eternal fountain of filth

1477
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,100
Eternal fountain of filth

1478
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,480
Eternal fountain of filth

1479
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,340
I'm just a victim of guilt

1480
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:10,660
I got a hunger that makes me do things

1481
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:13,300
I got a hunger to make me say things

1482
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,980
I got a hunger to make me want things

1483
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,720
I'm just a victim of guilt

1484
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:21,300
Hey!

1485
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:24,220
Hey!

1486
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,400
Hey!

1488
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,920
Praise Bob!

1489
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,700
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show

1490
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:21,220
and we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough

1491
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:24,040
to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1492
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:29,060
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1493
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,580
But if you truly love Bob

1494
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:35,160
and want some of that slack back to rebound

1495
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:35,460
and want some of that slack back to rebound

1496
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:38,460
to you, you should go to subgenius.com

1497
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,600
front page or especially the radio page

1498
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,640
or the catalog store pages

1499
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,960
and help out financially as best you can.

1500
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:51,320
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty

1501
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:54,980
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1502
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,900
But some of you still have jobs.

1503
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:01,260
Even five bucks makes a big difference

1504
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,240
even if it's only once a month

1505
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,840
from enough of you.

1506
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,180
50 bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1507
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:10,540
All we're saying is that

1508
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:13,920
blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs

1509
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:16,000
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1510
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,600
We also take checks and money orders to

1511
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:21,480

1512
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:33,980
