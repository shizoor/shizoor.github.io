From PR News in Washington, I'm scratched at a U.S. military lab in Rancho Mirage
and one side of the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
Governor Pat is urging caution.
President Obama has left snowbound drought-stricken California.
The president's visit will demonstrate his concern about California,
the worst states.
During a meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah,
he'll announce $160 in federal livestock in Southern California.
White House spokesman Jay Carney and Mr. Obama are at a stalemate.
The two met separately with a mediator today
and hurled insults at each other in press conferences afterwards.
The worst presidents in over 100 years.
But the meetings increasingly seem fruitless.
Russian foreign officials condemned the U.S. for seeking PR news in Geneva.
An independent investigator says
the U.S. is the only country in the world that has a U.S. state.
This is PR News in Washington.
From here on out, it's up to you, Mac.
All right, Mac.
You got it?
Yeah.
Okay, now, it's coming at you, too.
Handle it gentle now.
All right.
I've got it.
Here.
All right.
One, two, four, three.
The subgenius.
Power of the subgenius.
I'll call in first.
Good, though.
Yeah.
Good.
Okay, now, let's get to work.
Here.
Here are the time bombs you rigged up.
Six grenades.
Yeah, that ought to do it.
Shalakandala nebastoya!

Bob?

Bob?

Concentrate, Dagger.
There it is.
All right.
I forgive your would-be otras.


ل
I'm getting you the only thing there is to eat in this here swamp.
Right here! You've arrived!
Right here! You've arrived!
Right here! You've arrived!
Right here! Here! Here! Here!
Uh, excuse me, just a country sing.
I'm the new farm caretaker!
Ha ha ha!
Gah ha!
I hit that moth one of my...
...early in the night.
Aaaaaah!
Aaaaaah!
Fwennnnafman! Fwennnnafman!
Okay, the geniuses will see us now.
Now remember, when you speak to the geniuses, keep your questions short and to the point.
The geniuses do not like those who waste their time.
Genius, we have a problem and we seek your wisdom.
Hm, I might need to bring another genius in on this.
We're gonna have to bring more geniuses in on this.
Yeah, I think we should have a quickening with all the geniuses.
I'll summon the council.
Okay, if you guys just wait here a sec,
we're gonna have a quickening with the council of the...
...council of geniuses.
See what we can do for you.
Alright, now!
We've taken out most of the synagogues, destroyed San Francisco,
sent my friends into a dark oblivion,
and so our next order of business will be Burning Man!
Burning Man is the biggest hippie festival in the world,
and tomorrow, we're gonna wipe them all out!
May I ask where you attend church?
Oh, I... I ain't got no time for no church.
No time for God's people?
We all need accountability and encouragement from each other.
Yes, this is important.
We should all strive to be good people towards our fellow man.
But if one separates oneself from a local fellowship of believers,
it makes it difficult to live.
What are you, man? Some kind of preacher?
Perhaps the two of us could attend a service together.
Hey, look, I already told you, I ain't got time for no church.
Besides, I gotta work here tomorrow.
Tomorrow? On Sunday?
Well, this should be a day of rest,
where we enjoy fellowship with family, friends, and...
Shh! Quiet!
The Self Genius Hour of Squash!
Now she looks like a different girl.
We've given her a fashionable choppy bob,
and she's got a nice little hat.
Oh, look who's talking.
Yeah, Bob, you used to be on this show.
Your basic plan was pure genius.
But it takes a very special type of genius to...
All right, Bob, it's over. Come out with your hands up.
A good way to understand quantum...
A good way to understand quantum...
A good way to understand quantum...
A good way to understand quantum cryptography
is to think of three people.
Alice, Bob, and Eve.
Alice wants to send secret information to Bob,
and Eve wants to listen in...
Alice takes her information,
a string of zeros and ones, or bits,
and encodes them on photons, particles of light.
Now, the encoding is done in such a way
that Eve, if she looks at these photons,
will inevitably mess them up.
She'll change them in a way
that Alice and Bob can figure out.
So, after Alice has sent the photons to Bob,
she and Bob can confer
to find out which photons have been tampered with.
The photons that haven't been tampered with,
the pristine photons,
now constitute a secret key
shared only by Alice and Bob,
whose security is guaranteed by the laws of physics.
So, essentially, what someone would do
is sit down at a computer and start performing it.
And what the computer does is takes that data
and it will look at their performance on the train sequence
versus novel sequences they've never performed before.
And you can use that information to say,
this participant knows that particular data
or knows that particular information,
therefore it's Bob.
You don't have to know nothing else about them.
It's simply their performance and their motor abilities
that can tell you who they are based on what they know.
I'll sue the church!
We can't sue the church.
They'll poke fun at us in the church bulletin.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Please don't sue the church.
I'm asking you as your friend and neighbor.
Back to you, Bob.
Your Honor, we don't have that kind of money.
We're not a synagogue.
In that case, I award the deed to the church.
You're giving him the church?
Last time, please give the church back.
That is gonna drive me nuts.
Look, this church is our only option.
Don't you kids want to live here?
Anything's better than that dump we came from.
Anything's better than that dump we came from.
I'm so sorry for all your horrible problems.
Wherever shall we go?
You can come to my church.
And what church might that be?
The church of the subgenius.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Let's do something else.
There's always an exhale involved.
I know, I noticed.
This is adorable.
This is adorable.
This is adorable.
Shut up. Are you pink?
It's just so funny since we showed you a pink and you were like, poo.
What happened?
Yeah.
Um, I said, Ashlyn, I really liked it.
Oh, okay, so somebody must get on n***a thing and then you can change your mind?
Yes.
Oh!
Got my first bobble.
Kinda looks like me.
Most bobble see don't even look like guys, but this actually looks like myself.
What happened?
Yeah.
Poo.
He killed Bob.
Maybe Bob asked for it.
I know he did.
But you didn't know his other side.
He could be real sweet.
He wasn't just any boy.
Bob had something that made him different.
Made people follow him.
Maybe a little better than the crowd.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, well, that's okay, because I don't want you to go see him anyways.
We don't need your damn charity.
I wasn't trying to give you charity.
I only wanted to help.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.












Just kidding, you don't need to go see me.
I have to go, I just got off the moon.

Counting down, you said time was holding you back.
Why not?
However, you know what happened to Bob's heart?






It's Bob I told you about earlier.
He knows he's lost his house, and doesn't have any friends now?
I don't care, God forbid!

Why hold it against us, Mort's dead, and Bob there, who's also gone napping.
This stinking punch's getting good too.
Yeah?
What's that about?
Okay.
It was my brother who��
He learned how to fight and fight so,

Bob!
Bob!
There goes Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Bye bye Bob!
Bob!
The way that this is gonna come down...
Would you let me speak? You guys ain't gonna like this.
I don't care what any of you got to say about it.
This is not your show.
This is the Bob Show. And that's the way it's gonna be from now on.
We only have a couple days to get this in order.
So when Bob changes the entire plan
which is basically sabotaging what we're here to do
it's really upsetting.
We just need to back off for a while
and take things a little more slowly.
We cannot run the show.
Our goal has never changed.
We want to make sure that you can walk freely,
roll freely.
So are you gonna work with us?
After being banished from the property
Bob and I had our come to Jesus moment.
Everything's back on track.
I think he's in his room.
I'm gonna call him.

Hi.
I'm just wondering if you'd be willing to come back.
I'm not gonna come back there
and get him out of that...
I'm done with Bob.
I work with Bob somewhat.
This stuff wasn't in that box.
I know.
If he ain't gonna like me, he's gonna put up with me.
What is that?
You can part with this.
I don't know if I can.
Yes you can.
I'm gonna call him.
I'm gonna call him.
I'm gonna call him.
Please leave a message.
We will call you back.
Thank you. Have a good day. Bye.
There's a rainbow heading your house.
To your house.
It's a rainbow and it's pink.
It's a rainbow and it's pink.
Um, you have...
I think you have the
Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.
So when you get home
call me back. Bye.
Bye.
From PR News in Washington,
I'm in New York where PR's

I really like it sometimes.
General Zod.
Even though I do make a fool of myself.
Today begins a new order.
Superman!
But you know, if it weren't for him...
In return for your obedience...
I never would have met you.
You will be allowed to live.
But...
He is you.
I am General Zod.
It's... it's kind of confusing.
General Zod.
Not to me, it isn't.
But consider...
For the first time in my life, everything's clear.
For your如

lên
You are the
You are .
Ah, yes, dear friends.
We're here, and apparently Lowsome Cowboy Dave is here, too.
Two minutes.
He is.
Two minutes have passed.
He is.
He was flashing us.
And here I am fondling my spleen.
Sorry.
We're glad to have you with us fondling your spleeny.
What, you say you're a couple of minutes late?
What is time to the subgenius?
What is time to the ascended man or woman?
But it's just another thing to mock.
Is it relative as indeed we might assume?
Have I ranted about how much I hate now?
The now thing.
Have you heard of the movement to end now?
I vaguely heard of it.
I heard it had something to do with exacerbating wounds that were already very, very scarred.
I don't like now because people who live in the now pay no attention to the then.
They're all like, I don't want to do that now.
But the problem is it's always now.
I am a thenist, not a dentist, a thenist.
I prefer to think about the then and there.
The now is too fleeting.
I can't get my hands on it, you know.
That's the way, that's, I have spent some moments pondering it in the novel known as Neighborworld,
which is formerly known as the English camp.
And the idea of the then and the now.
There is no time in the way that we know it except for it's placed on our shoulders
by these huge metamorphic beings we can't understand yet.
But basically the idea of the then is always so warm and squishy.
Right.
The now is so much more relatively cold now.
Then it was so warm.
And it will soon be warm again.
And then we will be toasty.
But you see, I'm a nowist.
Yes, Princess Wee is a nowist.
But I didn't want to interrupt you, dear.
We're making comment on something else.
The nowy.
The nowy.
Was that an ancient people of the North American continent
that worshipped going backwards and forwards?
Yes.

Much in the way that H.G. Wells predicted only without the strangers.
Are you talking about the Native American tribe known as the Fookowies?
Yeah.
And they always ask where they are.
I know.
Nah, nah.
I still laugh whenever I heard someone say that.
Oh, speaking of saying that, which I just said,
I need to give some credits where credits are due.
When you called in, Dave,
it was the perfect time.
Actually, it was right on my piece of paper,
my log of the future of this show.
It said 15 minutes.
But we started two minutes late, you see.
Anyway, the last thing we heard,
Superman and all of the PR news and the titles
were by the great Fernandin and a lemur.
And a little bit of a cut up by the purple Johnson blimp situation.
The music we heard was, of course,
the Psychoskeletons, a tune called Chumalhoni Transplant,
which you can find all of their stuff on SoundClick,
the Psychoskeletons.
And the long collage was by The Large.
All of those cut ups from a million sources,
people talking about Bob, talking to Bob, Bob talking.
That was actually The Large imitating all those TV shows
and radio shows and old movies that he cut up.
For goodness sakes.
How about that?
And you know, I just like to say, Reverend Ivanstang,
it's an incredible job you do,
bringing all these different eclectic forms of artistic expression
right into your own vacuum cleaner and into your own backyard
where you can put it up on Front Street.
And at least some people will be able to hear this if they ever listen,
because it is certainly unique in the now.
You know, even worse than...
There were competing things.
There used to be more than one and they were all brilliant.
And it was a hell of a struggle, man.
Almost worse than the nowists are the movement to end now, now.
Which kind of defeats the purpose.
But you know, this here is the church of the subgenius.
We are the church of the subgenius.
We are the antidote.
We are the antidote.
To all placebos.
We are the antidote pudding.
We are the long legs and the stocking, stocking gams
and the French made uniforms.
Sorry.
No bob, no aim, no race.
We were disqualified from the race for doping.
I'm sorry I laugh, but the tour words were never spoken
and they still never are.
No, they never...
Well, they occasionally are.
Truer words may yet be spoken.
They're not being spoken now.
But screw now.
I don't care about now.
I don't care.
Don't care, don't care, don't care.
Well, what about the then that we all remember
that we're supposed to forget?
You can ask Princess Wee about this.
We're here.
You can...
A church time on Santa Monica Boulevard.
Boulevard in your not too recent, not too long ago past.
Visiting friends and family and stuff and having a good time.
Having a jolly old time.
Looking at L.A. from an outsider's viewpoint now.
And a little disagreement with a science...
I don't want to say the word because I don't know you.
You don't even like the word.
A proponent of a certain religion that you consider very, very...
Are you whining about the Scientologists now?
About the guy you beat up, yeah.
And how you wound up on the LAPD blotter and stuff like that
for trying to strangle them in there.
It didn't have anything to do with him being a Scientologist.
I just didn't like the last Mission Impossible movie.
I thought he said he didn't like the cut of his jib.
Is that your excuse for throttling a guy who's...
I'm sorry.
They interrupted Wee, didn't they?
His jib was not cut correctly, as she said.
But that's okay.
That's all right.
You know, speaking of, again, speaking and L.A.,
it's Oscar night and that's why no one's listening to our show tonight,
in this recording, this recording period.
It's this Sunday night as we record this.
The Pink's are watching the Oscars.
And Princess Wee and I have gathered Yahoo! commentary again.
I hate to tell you, Dave.
I was looking at the newspaper online
and there was a little article about the Oscars happening,
the Academy Awards tonight.
No, but they've had this terrible rain and mudslides
and houses are sliding down hills in Los Angeles.
So they had the red carpet got wet.
Well, it was a cute little article,
but what was much cuter were the following,
the Yahoo! comments,
which, as befits that august news assemblage,
Well, please.
You know, if you say anything about the Academy Awards,
well, that calls for a dissertation on the evils of President Obama.
Naturally.
You know, if you mention the Oscars and it rains,
then that means it's time for a lecture about the falsitude of global warming
and how evil Michelle is.
They yell and get very angry about the idea of global warming.
See, I had to go to school there for a while,
and every once in a while they make you write a paper about this kind of stuff.
And I'm just telling you,
Well, you're a Marxist college professor, Steve.
From a firsthand basis and stuff,
you go and you look at the research and stuff
and you have to go to that Google Scholar Scooch
and whatever it is, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
But, you know, you go to the Scholar Search
and where they have peer-reviewed documents and stuff like that.
And the global warming stuff is like, there's tons of stuff going on,
and there ain't no global warming.
There's no global warming.
There's like about, you know, 36 things there.
As opposed to like 36,000 where you have to keep on waiting,
the engines going through.
Man, that's a lot of names that sound the same, you know.
Well, here's what Truthseeker had to say about the Academy Awards.
Wah! I feel so sorry for the elitist, obozo-loving hypocrites in Hollywood,
a bunch of self-aggrandizing, phony PCA-holes.
The funny thing is happening in the land of the libertards.
L.A. has such high taxes on business, period.
The movie business included, comma,
that a vast majority of big screen productions are filmed elsewhere.
Canada and even New York are getting increasingly larger numbers of productions.
L.A. lost the Tonight Show in the revenue and 150 jobs.
Way to go, L.A.!
You stupid left-wing fools!
The whole state of California is run by stupid left-wing fools!
And no long-term vision other than voting base and power.
The unions run the politicians and the minorities get all the benefits.
The Golden State is forever tarnished.
That was the first comment on...
Oh, my god.
...Rain at the Academy Awards.
Can I just thank you, though, for actually doing that?
In a way that fits the medium, and I certainly appreciate that.
And those of a certain barbecue of a land, maybe their forceps are shaped a little different,
will get the middle part of what you just said and the way you addressed it...
And nothing else.
And the way that you started screaming and everything,
and we all started picking our heads...
Now, Princess Wee has a comment that we read from someone.
Yes, but I had to put punctuation marks in it to read it because there are none.
No, you're going to have to read it without punctuation marks.
I have to try to read it that way? Okay, here it goes.
Oh, no, no. How can the far-lefty elite fawn over each other and denounce the 1% while driving their expensive cars in the rain?
Whoa, why do people pay attention to these people who cares what they do?
They play make-believe in front of a camera and people pay the millions for it.
It's pure stupidity. One sentence. No periods.
Well, that's the way.
It's the wave of the future.
Has anyone figured out that the red carpet is really the communist carpet?
That's right. That was a serious one-liner comment.
The red carpet. Obviously, they're just dangling the truth right in front of us.
Now, there's one very prolific Yahoo commenter who goes by the name of Hard Man,
which I assume is a promise to the ladies.
And you know what kind of guys are making those.
Yeah, that's.
That's why they have to brag that way.
Anyway, what this guy had to say was,
All the rich 100% Obama libs in Hooliwood, period.
Flying from Europe and elsewhere in polluting jets, period.
Then get in their gas-guzzling limos.
Parade under electricity-gobbling high wattage lights.
Wasting more of Earth's resources per minute.
And a hundred other Earthlings good.
So they can kill each other how wonderful they are.
So they can tell each other how wonderful they are.
If we are lucky!
Exclamation point.
One of them will give us a little speech about global warming and evils of you using fossil foals.
How they have joined other polluting rich 1% Obama celeb friends to do the same.
Wink, smiley face.
But that wasn't enough.
For Hardman, 12 minutes later, he was still angry.
And he came on and he said,
Will the beautiful, talented, strong, smart, fit, hardworking, funny, caring,
spender of millions of tax dollars and extreme user of fossil foals
riding in polluting private jets and limos with 10 servants by her side everywhere she goes be there too?
Moo shell.
Is part of the cool celebrity crowd now.
Will the ugly one be there to take the stage and tell us what we should eat again?
Unbelievable.
You know what I always want to type in after things like that is the phrase,
Ooh, mad bro.
I'd like to do something from early Charlie Brown episodes.
Like, mm-mm-mm.
Your brain is falling out of your...
Ears.
And then have, you know, going to that Vince Giraldi music.
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
You know what I mean?
No.
Because that would be more like stupid.
No.
I'm sorry.
As far as stupid goes, listen to this music in the background.
That's Dave playing the guitar.
right now.
Actually, it's two Daves.
This is the two Daves
X Day concert
from 9X Day,
which I think was about
seven years ago.
No, yeah,
seven years ago or so.
And there was Dave
of the Lonesomes
on guitar
and Princess Wee
on flute
and Reverend Angry Larry
on bass
this particular time.
We stumbled upon
this music yesterday
and broke our ankles.
But the music
sounded pretty cool.
Well, it did at the time.
That's why I'm a thenist.
Now, Princess Wee...
In today's modern languages,
one thing you must be
certainly aware of
that the thenists
charge a lot of money
to have your roots come out.
That means sent
all the way back
to the original inhabitants
of Mars.
Of course you know that,
don't you?
Of course, of course.
It's not like it's a secret,
of course.
Hey,
somebody sent me an email
today that said
that we're at war with Russia.
And this is day four
of America in crisis.
And that all of our freedoms
are gone already.
Well, they might be right
about that part.
And he also said
that
that
that
that



that




















The Candle in the Shell
What did he say?
He said
the political buffoons
will come out
and worship Obozo
and Michelle Obozo
will present something
a huge libertar gathering.
I want to see
a gay divorce
like the gay wedding
at the Rose Bowl Parade.
Did you ever think
that was another
another comment
from our many listeners?
Princess Wee,
you had...
Are generated
by the
by the
Gross National Product.
I mean, the RNC.
Some of them
are probably
just generated
because they use
all use the same
catchphrase.
like Libertard and what's the Obama one?
Obama and...
Obozo.
Obozo and Moose Shell.
You know, in our upbringing as staunch Americans,
Obozos were on the bus.
And, you know, you don't do something like that.
You can't.
You just can't hold it.
I don't have anything against the Bozos.
They're, you know, I've squeezed the wheeze.
They want you to.
They like it.
They'd like you to put them down and kick them around and make fun of them
because they know what their position will be in the future.
The Bozos won't be on the back of the bus in the future.
And by Bozos, I mean literally Bozos.
I'm not using that as a metaphor for anything else.
I mean people dressed like clowns or surgically made to look like clowns
because they're pink.
They're proud to be pink.
Go ahead.
Squeeze the wheeze.
That doesn't hurt me.
I'm pink.
You can do anything to me.
But they're lying.
They're making a list.
And they're going to kill us all in our sleep while they grin,
wielding their evil Bozo knives,
sharpened on your tongue like a razor strop.
Now, how about this comment?
Princess Weave, what is this comment?
If there are any suicidal pilots of large aircraft,
i.e. passenger jetliner aircraft,
Air Force bomber, etc.,
please consider ramming your ship into this building
during peak television viewership.
The building coordinates are 34.101996
and minus 11.3407.
And the best time would be 7.45 p.m. California time.
You will go down in history as having taken out
the entire Hollywood communist homosexual society
in a single blow.
You will be a hero for the ages.
I just didn't show up.
I just didn't show up for work for about 36 days in a row.
Yeah.
And I got married to a guy.
Yeah.
And I'm collecting nine bazillion dollars
in social welfarism from Joe Stalin.
He's given it to me personally.
He even sent me like one of those autographed pictures
and stuff like that.
I think Joe Stalin got a bad rap.
Oh, wait, no, I mean Joe McCarthy.
No, wait, what's the difference?
Joe.
Oh, what's the difference?
Yeah.
They used to stand for a person
who stood above the arguments of time.
Now it stands for somebody who's a feminist
or a nowist or one of these other ridiculous cults
springing up having to do with time control.
Hey, hey, let's not get personal, man.
What?
I wasn't personalized.
I was evacuated many, many centuries ago.
I have no political leanings.
I'm a leftist, I think.
You're just wobbling.
You're in the middle of the road, aren't you?
You old wobbly.
That's what it is.
Wobbly old days.
I remember last week you talked about my slurring speech
and we even screamed out,
no, he's not, he's a nice old man, stuff like that.
I just, you know, I hadn't been drinking or something.
We were trying to defend you from all the many people
who were out to get you, Dave,
which is almost, it is all your neighbors, you know.
They form a gang.
You said that Dave was slurring his speech?
Well, that's the way it is in these urban,
urban vessels.
I mean, these little squalid conditions.
It's like Dickens' days, you know.
It's like me and the Victorian poorhouse thing,
thing where I got going, you know,
and the androids on top of it.
You know, bill collectors call you up
and they, you know, start a real friendly conversation about,
oh, you know, the last time you bought foot powder
or the fact that you're a staunch,
you're an independent or something like that.
And then the next thing you know,
you know, I talk about your kids and so forth.
And, but they don't stop.
And that's how you can tell they're automated.
They're not real.
And then they come up with responses that make sense.
Right.
It's that AI stuff,
that artificial intelligence stuff, man.
You can still get them.
It's a robot.
It's a robot.
You're talking to a robot.
Well, now, come on.
We've, admit it, you guys,
we've done shows that were completely automated
where we just turned on that voice replicator
and let it kind of fed about five,
eight pages of the Scrub Genius Forum into a computer
and gave it the we voice and the Stang voice
and the Dave voice
and some really horrible background music
that the computer made badly.
And that was, in fact,
that's the way we did the show before last, I think.
Was it that?
Once again.
Once again, the pointy head of science
can be pointed like a finger up or down.
It can be used for good or evil.
Yes.
So, which is it you're going to choose,
Reverend Adam Stang,
high E-pop or Troubadour?
Okay, let's see.
The evil wire will,
if I snip the evil wire,
it'll shut down the bomb
and the world will be safe.
But how do I know that's not the good wire?
If I snip the good wire,
then all goodness vanishes
and no one will ever be able to have sex again
and the pinks will win
and the Yahoo commenters
will be the only ones on the red carpet.
Maybe jiggle a little bit.
No, no, no.
Better not jiggle.
Jiggle it a little, little, little open.
Jiggle it a little, little, little open.
You remember Reverend Jiggle It a Little Open?
I remember Jiggle It a Little Open very well.
Yeah, he's a real nice guy.
He was one of the Queegee Boat Cartel.
Uh-huh.
Used to come to X-Day all the time.
Then I guess he grew out of the subgenius.
Yeah.
Or something.
I guess that's what they do.
I guess they just grow out of the one true baloney religion
of all times, except for now.
Not now.
You don't be so harsh on yourself.
You're crazy, Lord, you know.
Don't be so harsh.
Hey, man, you have to...
Tell him, Dave, tell him.
...up a little bit, you know.
Tell him, tell him.
You know, you're going to have a stroke thinking like that.
You know, I'm walking around like you're screaming
and the people don't understand, dude.
Or they don't understand that you're a subgenius,
you know, and stuff like that.
No, they don't understand.
They don't understand.
Hey, I've got...
I have to play a public service announcement,
but I'm not going to take anyone off the air, okay?
Okay.
I'm not even going to turn the music down.
Here it goes.
This is a real public PSA.
I can't hear the music track.
But it's...
You see why?
It's you, Dave.
Yeah.
If loneliness drives some girls to prostitution,
it drives some men in another direction.
Yeah.
The history of homosexuality is as long as the history of man.
From the glory that once was Greece
to the decadence that destroyed Rome,
homosexuality has been both despised and idolized.
Alexander the Great,
Julius Caesar,
Frederick the Great,
Leonardo da Vinci,
and Michelangelo.
How about some of the names that any homosexual
will point to as examples
of virility and the defense of his way of life?
Just step over here.
Though nothing new,
homosexuality is having an upsurge since the war.
Yeah, it's not the only thing happening.
Whether it is an actual...

It's not the only thing happening.

Whether it is an actual increase
or merely an increased public acceptance
is a point to be argued.
The Mattachine Society,
an organization for homosexuals.
The Church of the Subgenius is on the air now.
Well, anyway,
I found another thing about homosexuals
that I was reading an article
in the Christian Science Monitor, of all things,
an article called
Why Gays Scare Conservatives.
And although I didn't really read the article,
I read the comments,
which is about the best way to do the news,
you know, these days.
Is there anything about why gays like convertibles
or anything like that?
Or is this strictly a political tract?
This is a guy who has it all figured out.
In one paragraph,
he's going to say what the problem is.
Ah.
And here it is.
The problem is,
people have no clue about what makes life work.
So let's go with this liberal agenda.
Let's test it.
The world embraces homosexuality.
Everyone in the country can marry their own gender now.
There spelled just wrongly.
Everyone who feels they're born the wrong gender
can have a sex change operation.
Compliments of the Affordable Health Care Act.
Lesbian women can buy a car.






Buy trade with men for purchase of their sperm.
Their.
Homosexual men can buy trade with women
for the use of their,
with two E's,
eggs and wombs.
And the Affordable Health Care will help them pay for it.
Everyone is now equal.
Every state wants to legalize pot as Colorado
so they can be equal.
Now every state has legalized pot,
so they're equal there.
Both spelled wrong.
So far we have homosexuals and potheads all equal
with everybody else.
Now money.
Every state has minimum wage.
All states are equal.
Everyone makes 10, 10 an hour.
Is that the end of it now?
Have we made the whole country equal with one another?
Who mad, bro?
Who mad, bro?
I think that many of these people need to be
put in special institutions
where they can look at their brains
and see what is troubling them.
I think there may be some confusion about the facts,
but I also think that some of their brains are miswired.
You know what I think it comes down to?
There are a couple kinds of right wing lunatics in this world.
There are the people who say,
Anybody that was like startled by electroshock,
you know, like you get,
like you're hiding in the closet during,
nevermind.
I was just going to say real quick,
there are those out there who have an attitude of,
I got mine, go get your own.
And then there are others out there who,
and then there are others out there who have an attitude of,
I ain't got mine and screw you,
you ain't getting yours either.
Disemboweled again.
I think some of these people are just jealous.
I think they're jealous of the Hollywood elites
and their limos.
And I think they're jealous of the gay homosexuals
who are having a great time.
Well, I know that this, uh,
person who calls himself Obama sucks,
that's O-B-A-M-A capital S-U-X,
has made it all real clear by saying,
Yahoo is censoring hard tonight.
Poor guy.
They didn't though.
Hard man posted every 10 minutes.
Bunch of yahoos.
He's probably, you know,
a sponsor generated thing that just comes out by the,
they wrote that up.
Some, probably a person didn't even write it.
Anymore.
They only, you know,
I mean, not even a suggestion.
That program's all, you know,
let's see, it's the Hollywood night of the year,
the Academy Awards.
Well, all the liberals live out there.
It's a good time to.
Yeah, like Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood,
those liber turds,
you good, homosexuals like Clint Eastwood and Mel Gibson.
Don't forget John Wayne.
His real name was Marion.
I heard like homosexuals.
John Wayne was a queer.
Mr. Nixon or whatever his name was.
What?
What'd you say?
John Wayne was a queer.
You mean Marion?
I installed mirrors in his house.
They were two-way mirrors.
That's from Repo Man.
That's a character.
Well, I just remember the end where the car took off.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, he was the guy that everybody thought was a kook.
He rode away in the alien time machine in the end.
Yeah, he was the one.
Well, he wasn't really the one.
I think it was the car was the one, wasn't it?
Repo Man, not to be confused with a more recent movie
called Repo Men, which was really messed up.
Why was it messed up?
I didn't see that when I saw the originator.
It looked like this had no relation
to the original Repo Man.
It was directed by some newish guy.
You know how those news are.
He came up with the idea of using Repo Man
as a vehicle for some-
No, it was guys who repo body parts.
And it was one of those schizophrenic movies
that seemed like two people directed it,
and one thought it was a comedy,
and one thought it was a horror movie.
And they really didn't integrate the two very well.
But if you did like it,
or you were getting paid to like it,
you would say it was a dark comedy.
No.
You would not say, for instance,
that it was failed on two sides or two fronts
of both comedy and also-
Darkness. Darkness.
Darkness.
And suspense.
And satanic evil.
And film noir things.
Are we letting Satan down, Dave?
Are we, Dr. Sinister, Princess,
are we letting our lord and master Satan down
by trivializing these important issues?
Satan is an unforgiving master.
You will always disappoint him.
No, we're not letting him down.
He's got a lot in common with his buddy, God.
Yep, Joe Hoover.
They used to call him Joe Hoover and Zet Zeron,
hanging out in the same bars,
got hit by the same truck,
come and stumble and drunk out of a bar once,
but did anything really happen to him?
No.
They just laughed and went back
and had a few more transubstantiated beers.
We were talking to Pappy earlier today.
That's my father.
She's a wonderful woman.
And Pappy said that he's a preacher,
or teaches Bible, he's not,
well, yeah, he's a preacher.
He teaches Bible studies.
Well, he's also an alchemist on the side.
Yeah, he is.
He's actually, he's a Masonic alchemist,
a complete skeptic and disbeliever,
and yet he teaches Bible studies.
He likes to point out the really weird stuff.
But anyway, he said today,
he instructed Princess Wee and I
that the devil was equal to God.
Yes.
He said, my father said that.
He said, the devil, he's another God.
He's the other God.
That's what he said.
I'm not sure.


I know, I can hear your discomfort in even saying that,
although you proudly admit your father's a satanic person.
No, no, he's not at all.
He's a good, well, he's turned over a new leaf.
Let's put it that way.
He's a Bible scholar that plants seeds of doubts
in his little Sunday school class.
Because he's a Bible scholar,
he doesn't believe a word of it is accurate, historically.
Well, there's actually a code.
Not one word.
I think that's why they resisted translating the Bible
into native languages for so long.
That's why they what?
I think that's why the Catholic Church
resisted translating the Bible into vernacular languages for so long.
Well, wasn't it Michelle Bachmann who said the Bible was,
Jesus wrote the Bible in English?
You know, like...
No, no, that was the guy in Texas during the Civil War
who said that we shouldn't go to Vietnam
because if the Bible was good enough for, if the Bible was good enough,

the way it's written for Jesus is good enough for me.
Jesus spoke English and some people didn't even laugh at what he didn't.
Walking straight, thinking straight.
That's an old one, man.
Think crooked, walk crooked, and crooked.
I'm sorry I said that, I guess.
Because now I'm completely and totally cut off.
I think this is day, this, well, this is the subject of the Bible.



This song I labeled Bob Raping Jam with the two Daves.
It's got Reverend Angry Dave on bass, maybe guitar too.
And this is Dave, Dave Lonesome.
Yes.
I can't hear it.
You can't?
No.
Well, turn your phone up.
Turn your radio up.
Turn your hearing aid up.
Turn, run over to the radio and turn it up and hold your phone right next to the speaker.
Oh wait, no, that's what we always tell them not to do.
No, I usually get, I usually can hear the background well enough to respond.
I know.
That's why I'm puzzled.
But you know, the phone lines here have changed.
It's, I'm sorry you can't hear it, Dave, because I wanted to have kind of a tribute to our guitar player buddies.
Like you and Reverend Angry Dave.
Well, I'm Larry, Larry, Larry.
And of course there's a lot more guitar player buddies.
Reverend Suds wasn't on this one.
And the Flyin' Ryan Brothers were never there, although they play out in Chicago now.
Yeah.
And in fact, I even have a song to close the show that's about, it's a guitar player apologizing to all the girls for all the musicians.
Well, there were only a few that one night.
And I even had, I even have Iodine 131 queued up right now.
You do?
Yeah, you want me to play it?
If you shut up, I'll play it.
Oh, don't tell Dave to shut up.
Well, I'm not going to let him play over it.
And he can't hear it anyway, he says.
That's right.
How come I can't hear it?
Well, here, let's try it.
Yeah!

Yeah!

Yeah!


Yeah!
When I said Chernobyl was so long ago.
Nothing to worry about.
And now I hear in the news these dumb guys in the Department of Energy and the Defense Department are going to start build a bunch of Chernobyl's across the United States.
And then I hear in the news that Chernobyl's not really over, no.
All these people are dying.
It's all.
The pollution's getting into the water.
It's getting into the aquifers.
All this whole.
Everything.
I think we'll see it all once I'm one
But the distance between here and Cleveland
No, man, we're getting it too
Too late, Gary
You know, and then I started thinking
How come my moods are getting so
Drank
The iodine, the 131
Has got my thyroid on the run
And the krypton, the 85
Is making it hard just to stay alive
With the iodine, the 131
The iodine, the 131
No more running to the metal man
No more bending the hand
Power, power, send the power, save the man
Shake the bony hand, shake it good
The barium, a 248
This baby's sterile, I can't procreate
And plutonium, a 207
So long, folks, I'll see you in heaven
But the iodine, the 131
The iodine, the 131
No more running to the metal man
No more bending the hand
Shake the bony hand of the poison man
Shake the bony hand, shake it good
So there's over 2 million known pollutants
That can cause cancer, pancreatitis
Bad juice, gingivitis
Bad breath, acne
What's the use?
The iodine, the 131
Has got my thyroid on the run
And the Krypton, a 85
He's making it hard just to stay alive
With the iodine, the 131
The iodine, the 131
No more running to the metal man
No more bending the hand
Shake the bony hand of the poison man
Shake the bony hand, shake it good
No more running to the metal man
Shake the phony hand.
The poison man.
Shake the phony hand.
Shake it.
Shake it.
Shake it.
Shake it.
Shake the phony hand.
The poison man.
The heart man.
Was the author of Neighbor World, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
Singing with Einstein's Secret Orchestra.
Off the album Sex in Another Dimension.
And I'd just like to say that I think Mr. Abel Nerds, what's his name again?
I'm sorry.
Mr. Colonel Dave.
Colonel Lintard Dave.
Of the protagonist there for us.
Did a wonderful job also in the, do you remember the, I can't remember.
Colonel Sphinx Lonesome.
Oh, I said that I was going to play a song about guitar players saying an apology on the part of all guitar players to all girls.
And it's a song by the Rainmakers.
And it's live and I'm going to play it.
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, which often is about theological things.
But sometimes that includes guitar players.
Like Dave.
I think, I think what it has to do is with the deep delay system.
Not, you know, like on a guitar switch where you can just like, you know, see if your sphincter muscles start to vibrate too hard.
That means that your calcium balance is real low.
I don't know if you ever read that because I think it was a magazine.
I think it was some drug they were giving me when they were giving me electroshock therapy at the same time.
And if you need more information, folks, that's subgenius.com.
What's up, UMNI?
I'm Dave.

Thanks for having me.

If you've ever had the misfortune or the fortune to date a musician or have a relationship with a musician or, God help you, have you ever married a musician, we're sorry.
One, two, three, four.
Well, I met her in a bar.
Naturally.
And naturally she wanted to dance.
I politely declined.
Naturally.
I said, I really hate this band.
We went for coffee at a little cafe.
I had more picks in my pocket than I had spare change.
She said, hold it right there.
Just stop where you are.
Not another guy.
Not another guitar.
Not another guitar.
Not another guitar.
Not another guitar.
Not another guitar.
To get her off of my mind.
Naturally.
And so naturally I gave her a call.
Someone else answered the phone.
Naturally.
Then I recall that she lived with her mom.

I said, you have a daughter.
That's the fairest by far.
She said, who shall I say's calling?
Who shall I say's calling?
You know me better than you are.
You're a lover boy here.
And could I borrow her car?
Oh, not another guy.
Not another guitar.
No.
Not another guy.
Not another guitar.
Not another guitar.
Not another guitar.
Say, you boys of song.
You're all the same.
Chasing a dream that you cannot name.
They showed her to cry, a sofa to crash A meal and a mama with no strings attached
She said, you sang a song, oh no better I should But you know how to make it all sound so good
Well, to make a long story short We fell in love and she done me wrong
She'll say the same about me, naturally But to my face and not in a song
We're both gonna make that same old mistake again someday
Gonna happen to her, it'll sure not happen to me
There's just something to now and then
That music that makes us do that dance
In that special brew of tears and fear and fear and romance
It's losers night in teen town bring your fake ID
You know you're never too young to be too old for me
And I'm never too bad to be more trouble than I'm worth
Just another sad angel sang unto the sad earth
Oh, it's another long night, it's another low moon
It's another long night
To hear another old song

To hear another old tune
Another long glance across another long far
Another girl, another guy
Another guitar
Another girl
Another guy
Another guitar
Well, I'm just another guy
With another guitar
Just another guy
With another guitar
Hey, Hey, hey hey shut up

and help out financially as best you can.
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty,

But some of you still have jobs.
Even five bucks makes a big difference,
