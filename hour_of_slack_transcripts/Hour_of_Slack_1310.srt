1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
That's the end of the pretty music, folks.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,620
Now all the horrible ugliness starts.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,280
Praise Bob.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,540
Mockery of everything that's decent and wholesome.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:18,260
I challenge you to point out national talk shows that do not belittle sexual fidelity, purity.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,620
That they do not belittle the marriage union and the family lifestyle.

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,760
That they don't literally flaunt illicit lifestyles.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,600
I mean, I challenge you to show me a talk show that doesn't make light of God.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:38,500
The Subgenius Foundation, the Reverend Ivan Stang and Dr. Philo Drummond.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,220
Men with violent nostrils.

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,540
The Subgenius Power of the Word.

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,240
What's the matter with you guys?

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,720
Watch them and pray for someday you may become one of them.

14
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,180
And at the very door of the day of the wrath of God,

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:57,540
he said,

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,040
And that if you plan to get saved, you'd better do it now.

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,900
In this temple lodge of the Church of the Subgenius of Little Rock.

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,780
And before we begin this sacred spouting,

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,660
I think that we should all bow our heads and let's all have a minute of noise.

20
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,500
Annyeong with

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:17,500


22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:17,980
Annyeong with

23
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,220
the

24
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:20,600
×•×›

25
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,340
.

26
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:41,480
. . She'll jump right in.

27
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,840
We were getting in high-cuff.

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,740
We had the number one show.

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,080
Then Bob showed up.

30
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,140
Network pulled the plug on our show.

31
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,060
Yeah!

32
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,200
They forgot all about us.

33
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,460
Hell, they left us out there to die.

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,780
I want you to tell me about the Bob.

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,980
The Bob will lead us all through heaven's chimney

36
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,540
in a giant cigar-shaped UFO-brand flying saucer.

37
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:05,980
Really?

38
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,460
So Bob is a special person.

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,260
The Bob is not a person.

40
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,020
The Bob is pure light and energy.

41
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,040
Do I have to raise Bob?

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,300
Raise Bob!

43
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,480
Raise Bob!

44
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,260
The Bob is not a person.

45
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,940
The Bob is pure light and energy.

46
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,280
Will you give me a raise Bob?

47
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,720
Raise Bob!

48
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,440
Raise Bob!

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,580
You!

50
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,220
You!

51
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,360
In a giant cigar-shaped UFO-brand

52
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,600
flying saucer.

53
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,340
I repeat, this is not a drill.

54
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,420
This is the apocalypse.

55
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,380
In a giant cigar-shaped UFO-brand

56
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,540
flying saucer.

57
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,040
Do I have to raise Bob?

58
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,240
Raise Bob!

59
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,580
Raise Bob!

60
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,300
The Bob has no reason.

61
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,820
I repeat, this is not a drill.

62
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,600
You're a bit of God.

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,680
Do I have to raise Bob?

64
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,880
In a giant cigar-shaped UFO-brand

65
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,780
Do I have to raise Bob?

66
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,960
Raise Bob!

67
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,980
Raise Bob indeed!

68
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,300
Raise Bob!

69
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,980
Raise Bob!

70
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,280
Raise Bob!

71
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,120


72
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,140
Raise Bob!

73
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,020
Raise Bob!

74
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,340
Raise Bob!

75
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,000
Raise Bob!

76
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,420
Raise Bob!

77
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,060
Raise Bob!

78
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,700
Will you give me a raise Bob?

79
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,720
Do I hear a raise Bob?

80
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,240
Raise Bob!

81
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,220
Raise Bob indeed!

82
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,420
Let's try this again.

83
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,740
I want you to tell me about the Bob.

84
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,880
The Bob will lead us all through Heaven's chimney

85
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,320
in a giant cigar-shaped UFO-brand

86
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,500
flying saucer.

87
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:39,860
Really?

88
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,520
So Bob is a special person.

89
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,040
Raise Bob!

90
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,220
Raise Bob!

91
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,220


92
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,220


93
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,260
The Bob is not a person.

94
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,000
The Bob is pure light and energy.

95
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,300
Raise Bob!

96
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,380
Raise Bob!

97
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,160
Raise Bob!

98
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,160


99
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,160


100
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,200
The Bob is not a person.

101
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,920
The Bob is pure light and energy.

102
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,840
Raise Bob!

103
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,920
Raise Bob!

104
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,600
You're a fucker!

105
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:02,820
You!

106
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,480
In a giant cigar-shaped UFO-brand flying saucer.

107
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,300
I repeat, this is not a drill.

108
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,420
This is the apocalypse.

109
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,560
In a giant cigar-shaped UFO brand flying saucer.

110
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,020
Do I hear a praise bomb?

111
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,240
Praise bomb!

112
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,500
Praise bomb!

113
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,460
The bomb has no answer.

114
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,800
I repeat, this is not a world.

115
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,660
Get rid of dog.

116
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,620
Do I hear a praise bomb?

117
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,400
In a giant cigar-shaped UFO.

118
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,640
Do I hear a praise bomb?

119
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,960
Praise bomb!

120
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,000
Praise bomb indeed!

121
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,240
Alright boys, that's good.

122
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,020
Well, last night, and this is the third night in a row, isn't it?

123
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,580
I tell you, I've enjoyed every minute of it.

124
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,920
I tell you, I'd like to just kind of close out my day every day down here.

125
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,880
But it'd be such a temptation to spend the night,

126
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,300
and then, it's not good banking terminology to go in the hole.

127
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,320
But that's where I've been going.

128
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,280
You know what I'm talking about.

129
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,800
And over at the EW, he said, yeah, I said, have you seen them tailing?

130
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,860
I said, have you been in the hole?

131
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,040
Yes, sir.

132
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,140
You know, they go down.

133
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,440
They go down and start feeding, and that old tail comes up.

134
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,480
And I tell you what, that's my, the tail just does me like this.

135
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:13,940
Say, come on.

136
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,800
I mean, that's what you call a tail wave, boy.

137
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,260
And I go over there and talk about...

138
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,680
I know about the hole, Brother Roloff.

139
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,620
The hole took me in, the hole, Brother Roloff.

140
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,300
I've seen the hole that's right between them long white columns.

141
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,860
He stuck me in that hole.

142
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,180
I disappeared into that hole.

143
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,060
Brother Roloff, I disappeared into it.

144
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,580
He took me in, and I didn't come out for 19 and nine score years, Brother Roloff.

145
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,680
A hole that's dark.

146
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,200
It's slick.

147
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,580
It's slicker than you can ever imagine in your wildest dreams.

148
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,660
And you slide, you get in that hole, and you can't get your foot, and you fall down.

149
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,940
You get upright, and you just slip right out from under you.

150
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,320
You try to get back to the exit.

151
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,920
You say, I'm in this hole.

152
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,100
I got to get out.

153
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,060
I got to get out.

154
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,240
I got to get out.

155
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,000
This ain't what...

156
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,200
They said it was going to be.

157
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,960
I remember when I was 16, the back seat.

158
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,260
That's where I learned about it.

159
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,780
I learned about the hole.

160
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,580
It took me out.

161
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,080
I took that hole, and I said, I can't.

162
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,040
I got to get out of this hole.

163
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,680
All my friends been trying to get into this hole.

164
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,000
They like this hole.

165
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,380
I can't take this hole.

166
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,720
I got to get out of this hole, and I couldn't get out.

167
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,720
I was locked into that hole there in that back seat.

168
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,620
Do you understand what I'm saying?

169
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,740
Just like a dog.

170
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,440
Just like a little dog.

171
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,700
Just like two little dogs.

172
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,700
And I...

173
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,160
I mean, it was like we were just...

174
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,800
And that hole wouldn't let go.

175
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,000
It was just tightening, tightening up on me.

176
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,500
Locked up.

177
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,060
All my muscles locked up.

178
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,640
And the fear came over me, you know?

179
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,740
I mean, I was bucking.

180
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,920
I was bucking like mad.

181
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,740
I couldn't get out.

182
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,060
I couldn't get out of that hole.

183
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,720
I was just tearing at it.

184
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,680
And I finally...

185
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,780
I said, there's only one way to get out of the hole.

186
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,000
I was telling myself this.

187
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,560
I said, there's only one way to get out of the hole.

188
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,680
You got to unlock it.

189
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,940
You got to unlock that hole.

190
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,040
And the only way to unlock that hole is to shut off.

191
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,980
The source, you know?

192
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,440
So I just started...

193
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,100
Rolling that car.

194
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,520
And I was just chasing it.

195
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,240
And it finally went away.

196
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,260
That hole unlocked.

197
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,220
I pulled out of there.

198
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,680
And I chucked it right there.

199
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,780
And I drove away from it just as fast as I could.

200
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,980
I drove away from there.

201
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,120
And of course, you know, that was after that.

202
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,540
They picked me up and they said, you're crazy.

203
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,380
You're crazy, Jimmy.

204
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,560
You got to go in and relax and just settle down.

205
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,980
And they said, there's something wrong with the chemicals in your brain.

206
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,540
That's what they said.

207
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,820
I said, it ain't chemicals.

208
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,220
You understand?

209
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,180
It ain't chemicals.

210
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,640
It's the minute.

211
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,020
It's...

212
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,700
It's the minute.

213
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,440
It's the minute.

214
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,200
It's the minute.

215
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,140
It's the minute.

216
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,300
It's the minute.

217
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:42,300


218
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:42,300


219
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:42,300


220
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:42,300


221
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:42,300


222
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:42,300


223
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:42,760
God damn it.

224
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,760
It's the minute.

225
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,980
Mr. Pigeon?

226
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:47,860
Yes.

227
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,680
Let me say this.

228
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,860
Can I say something for just about a half a minute?

229
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,440
You bet.

230
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,160
Go right ahead.

231
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,260
It's a free country for a little while.

232
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:06,560
As high a regard as I have had for KFJZ, and even when Otis was on...

233
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,220
Yeah.

234
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,440
Yes, sir.

235
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,200
All that stuff.

236
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,980
I think this is about the sickest, sickest, sickest thing I've ever heard on KFJZ,

237
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,640
and since I've been listening to it.

238
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,540
I'm just...

239
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,500
I am thoroughly ashamed of KFJZ right now.

240
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,760
You know, I'm getting strong trance indications from this man

241
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,160
that he was the high liar of Baghdad at one time.

242
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,300
I'm not interested in you.

243
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,500
In your past life?

244
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,960
I don't know what I think about this sick, sick, sick,

245
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,540
program that you're putting on here.

246
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,600
What? That's...

247
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:39,960
Well...

248
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,860
KFJZ as of now, this is terrible.

249
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,080
You don't believe people should start their own cult if they want to?

250
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:48,660
People.

251
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,040
I mean, yeah, people, you know.

252
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,240
But not this is the damndest thing I've ever heard of.

253
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,420
Okay, well, thank you for your opinion.

254
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,260
Thanks a lot.

255
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,840
Well, apparently there's somebody out there who was not a subgenius.

256
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,460
He wasn't able to figure this whole thing out.

257
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,980
Well, no, I think he recognizes that we're beyond human.

258
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,100
That's right.

259
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:08,780
I see.

260
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:09,660
We...

261
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,500
Above or below, it matters not.

262
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,040
I am an American.

263
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,080
Listen to my words.

264
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,380
Listen well.

265
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,260
For my country is a strong country,

266
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,380
and my message is a strong message.

267
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,400
Okay, this is the television.

268
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,620
Tomorrow morning, let's see.

269
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,480
Well, I have to get up early.

270
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,860
Okay, I'll get up early.

271
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,060
Okay, six o'clock on Channel 2, White Heritage.

Six o'clock.

275

I'm going to have to put peppers in my socks to get up that early,

292
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,400
but I want to see those shows.

293
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,520

00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,300

That's two hours.

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,540
Yeah, right, right.

308
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,140
Their house burned down, by the way.

309
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,100
Did you know that this week?

310
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,780
No, that's true.

311
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,280
Blondie and Doug Wood's house burned down on the old lot over at Columbia.

312
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:53,920
Oh, that's true.

313
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,940
I saw the fire in real life and it looked just like it does on television.

314
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,840
Oh, wonderful, absolutely wonderful.

315
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,500
And then there's Saint Beepo, Children,

00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,940

Oh, don't ask why.

327
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:34,990
All the way.

328
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,190
Don't ask why.

329
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,670
Wow, and look at this.

330
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,010
It says here the mud tribes are gonna fight the Nazis in the stadium.

331
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,530
Wow, I hope we don't miss out on that.

332
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,750
That could be a really good show.

333
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,690
Our true size is the size of our God.

334
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:55,550
Do you still insist, Exeter, that we can allow any of these Earth creatures to have free minds?

335
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,670
Perhaps the answer has eluded us because it is so simple.

336
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,830
To be human is to choose.

337
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:03,730
Oh, yes.

338
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,290
And he ain't got super powers.

339
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,230
He ain't from another planet.

340
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:14,450
He ain't something that we have to bow down and kiss to.

341
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:20,490
You can pull Bob's leg and Bob will chuckle right along with you.

342
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,230
Because Bob's been a fool just like you or me.

343
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,850
He's been a pathetic fool.

344
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,350
And I tell you, friends, JR Bob Dobbs will be a fool again.

345
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:32,970
He's a fool today.

346
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,530
He's a fool tomorrow.

347
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,430
He's the same Bob.

348
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,770
The same Bob.

349
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,450
He's always the same Bob.

350
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,170
And he's working for you and me.

351
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,070
The triple X salute.

352
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:52,150
Princess We Are Doe, queen of all the UFOs, presents the triple X salute for triple X day.

353
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:58,490
Notice it's like cross your fingers and hope to die, I guess.

354
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,690
There's the great W.

355
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,410
And the great W.

356
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,770
Who waits for triple X day.

357
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:10,290
And friends, y'all, that's when we get to prove that we're the descendants of the Yeti

358
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,170
and not of the simple Jews.

359
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:17,070
Where we get to prove that the Yetis we're descended from were the bonobo type of Yetis.

360
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,690
In fact, we were thinking of holding triple X day in Amsterdam instead of Brushwood.

361
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,890
But that wouldn't be fair to the little bopbies.

362
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:30,410
So we'll just have to come back here waiting for the world to end.

363
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,810
God, it's so boring.

364
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,350
Year after year waiting for total destruction of the planet.

365
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:41,230
Or some terrible slow eco-disaster meltdown.

366
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:48,850
Squid ink tribulations, tornadoes, hurricanes, melting icebergs.

367
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,150
Will you smoke up that pipe?

368
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,610
Will you hit the ice cold light?

369
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,310
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?

370
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,350
Yee-haw!

371
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,230
Will you climb the mountain?

372
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,410
Top and top, and jump right off into the frond.

373
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,870
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?

374
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:14,290
I know the moon is coming.

375
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,550
That's right.

376
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,350
I know the moon is coming.

377
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,030
Astro intercourse.

378
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,430
And universal force.

379
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,050
And galaxies that number in the billions.

380
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,690
They're all there.

381
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,030
They're there for you.

382
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,130
That's right.

383
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,250
All them stars are all there.

384
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,110
You need the balls to see.

385
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,550
Yeah.

386
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,370
Don't let 100 billion years of evolution go to waste now.

387
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,010
And light the pilot light.

388
00:14:59,010 --> 00:14:59,610
Light the pilot.

389
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:00,650
Oh, true.

390
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,410
All right.

391
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,870
Well on, Dave.

392
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,190
Oh, yes.

393
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:08,770
Yes.

394
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:09,870
Yes.

395
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:10,910
Yes.

396
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:19,190
That was Einstein's Secret Orchestra, our late great friend, Professor Chaz Smith, with

397
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:26,910
lonesome cowboy Dave, and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, and princess Wee, all at Starwood

398
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:31,390
In 1999, the Starwood Festival, recorded in the Puffer Dome.

399
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,530
That's from our Puffer Dome CD.

400
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:44,390
Starwood is coming up again this year, right after the world ends on July 5th.

401
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:51,290
It'll be on my escape vessel if things work out.

402
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,910
But otherwise, it'll be at Wisteria, which happens to be where X-Day will also be.

403
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:03,610
And this flyer here says that you can look it all up at starwoodfestival.com if you want to.

404
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,350
Not just Starwood, there's a hotel chain called that.

405
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,050
Starwoodfestival.com.

406
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,790
Chicago Afrobeat Project will be playing there.

407
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:20,030
And actually, for that matter, a lot of the members of Einstein's Secret Orchestra will be there, under the name Pyrosonic.

408
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,970
We had Starwood at Wisteria last year, and it was great.

409
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,730
And, um...

410
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:26,850
Anyway.

411
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,690
What have we been listening to?

412
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:35,090
Before that, friends, we've heard a lot of stuff from ancient, ancient subgenius albums from the 1980s.

413
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:49,570
We heard Baby Stang, Baby Puzzling Evidence, Baby Firesign Theater from their reissue of all their radio shows, Duke of Madness Motors, Baby Philo on the Baby Mr. Opinion show.

414
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:54,030
The guy, believe it or not, that person going, I've been down that hole.

415
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,650
I know about that hole, brother.

416
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,510
That's me.

417
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,350
That's when I was about 26.

418
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:05,030
The song, called The Bob, was by James Watson from Bob's Songs No. 6.

419
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,330
We heard Baby Sterno do the moment of noise for the very first time.

420
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,630
That was probably in 1980.

421
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,490
And Lee Murr did the titles.

422
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:18,590
And the music in the background now is by Two Beans.

423
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:23,110
Reverend Two Beans, who will be at X Day.

424
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,310
And now I'm going to read...

425
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:35,550
Part 5 of The Agent and Mr. Dobbs, which was brought to us by Reverend Teeters LaVerge, although it's actually written by this unnamed agent.

426
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,110
Okay, is everything...

427
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,230
Everything's running right?

428
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:40,710
Good.

429
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,630
After all the monkey business, as Bob called it, he was in a much better mood.

430
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:55,330
I suppose all that man needs is to take a number three and fling a bit of feces around to, quote,

431
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,870
even his keel.

432
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,410
His grin was radiant as we walked out into that hot, humid night.

433
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,210
We tarried around his car for a few minutes.

434
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,530
They were the most relaxed moments that I'd had with Mr. Dobbs up to this point.

435
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:15,210
I offhandedly asked him for a cigarette, and though I'd never seen him smoke anything but his infernal pipe,

436
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:21,590
he pulled a pack of my favorite brand of smokes, Old Tar Lung, from his jacket pocket.

437
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,450
It was a needed smoke, one that I had not had since I got...

438
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,870
Tired of his

439
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,630
Dirt

440
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:37,770
Dirt

441
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:44,670
human pain toast every morning. Bob then hopped like a drunken rabbit into the driver's side of

442
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:50,370
the vehicle and shouted to me that now we're gonna have some real good fun boy. Get in now.

443
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:58,310
He then let out the most outrageously poor simulation of a rebel yell that I have ever heard.

444
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:04,150
It sounded more like the mating calls of those great apes that reside in the deepest darkest

445
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:10,750
Congo. It reverberated through the thick night air. I think I may have heard a call in response

446
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:18,090
but it could just have been a drunken redneck. We sped off down a semi-hidden dirt road that

447
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:25,670
ran behind his toy and tuna factory genetic aerospace research center. The vines and leaves

448
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:31,670
hung low as we whipped down this lane so low and sharp that my face quickly became a mass of

449
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:40,470
blood. I was so scared that I could barely breathe. I was so scared that I could barely breathe.

450
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,350
My heart was in my throat not only because of the insane driving but I also feared that

451
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:51,750
Bob might have other more perverted plans for me. This seemed too painfully real of a possibility

452
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:58,470
for me for to me for Bob started to sniff the air lustfully and play pocket pool again

453
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,770
vigorously. After a few tense moments for me

454
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:09,710
Mr. Dobbs was cool as a perverted cucumber the whole time we finally slid to a halt in front of

455
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:15,310
what I can only describe as the most stinking run-down decrepit roadhouse that ever sat in

456
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:21,410
the middle of nowhere. It was a truly ramshackle affair. Half of the neon signs only had a letter

457
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:28,450
or two lit up. There was a huge pile of smelly trash out front. I discerned humanoid skulls in

458
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:34,050
the pile and the peeling paint said it all with the structures sign dangling.

459
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:45,170
off to one side ye olde exist bar and grilly. If the outside was a shambles then the inside

460
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:49,950
was worse. It smelled like a cheap brewery that had been forgotten in an open sewer since

461
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:56,630
the reign of Ashurnasalpal II. I wondered why the hell Bob a man of such wealth who could

462
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:02,370
easily afford to go to any of the finest clubs in Florida would take me here. It then occurred

463
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,130
to me that this may just be a mistake.

464
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:04,130


465
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:09,650
I was in the corner of the hall and I saw the place erupting with drunken shouts of

466
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:18,130
Bob and for some reason JAR. I stood amazed for the clientele was astounding by anybody's

467
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:26,470
standard. I saw John Birch passionately kissing Mousy Tongue in one corner, our Vice President

468
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:32,450
rubbing the crotch of the preserved corpse of Stalin while drunkenly shouting about damn

469
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,830
pinko faggots.

470
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,130
I was surprised to see the whole place was full of people. I was surprised to see the

471
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:34,810
whole place was full of people. I was surprised to see the whole place was full of people.

472
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:43,650
Emma Goldman's disembodied head screaming the Internationale. M blanked out M blanked out.

473
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:49,690
Stabbing, I was later to learn, our actual non-clone president in the right eye with

474
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:54,870
a fork while Frank Sinatra groveled at her feet. There were also, and the rest of the

475
00:21:54,870 --> 00:22:01,550
pages blanked out, and the young folk singer Bob Dylan. Richard Attenborough was filming

476
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:01,970
it all.

477
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,110
The worst part, however, was that the whole place was full of people. I was surprised

478
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,110
to spot Mr. Beale hanging around playing comes from the joinkies.

479
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,070
I was surprised to find out much of a crowd were making decisions so I decided to worry

480
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,070


481
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,470
So while I was JOHN birch hanging out at the Hehelex

482
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,210
Porquell and be quiet, I found theĞ¸Ñ€ back seam ê¼­ afllen luck

00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:16,350

We are sure that Mr. Hoare's neof protestosende, your st mieli

dwier

488
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,070
telling me that he would soon be back.

489
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,890
He took a dozen of the whores up with him,

490
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,970
winking sickeningly at me.

491
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,310
I swallowed the pills dry.

492
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,490
When Bob eventually made it back down to the bar

493
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,050
where I'd seated myself, sipping a cheap beer,

494
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,710
his face was all aglow.

495
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,970
Literally, it shone green, then red.

496
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,710
One of those gray creatures was behind the bar

497
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:04,330
pouring a jelly jar full of vodka for Premier Khrushchev.

498
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,930
Bob sat down between us.

499
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,370
He still had a satisfied grin on his face

500
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,730
that smacked of unknowable pleasures.

501
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,950
Bob suggested that we have a drinking contest.

502
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,990
The pills were really kicking in at this point,

503
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,590
so I found it hard to believe my eyes,

504
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,210
but even harder to deny what I was actually seeing.

505
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,530
This is our place, the real place where things get done.

506
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,850
Then, he whispered to me.

507
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,330
Then, speaking directly to the Premier of the Soviet Union,

508
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:33,830
he said,

509
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:37,590
So, Nicky, think you can drink me under the table tonight, eh?

510
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,470
Khrushchev looked at Bob straight in the eye,

511
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,250
something I've seen very few attempt.

512
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:47,250
Yes, Mr. Noobs, I drink until you, how you say,

513
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,150
blow O-ring.

514
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,850
The gray then passed Bob, Khrushchev, and I

515
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,870
a full jelly jar each of vodka.

516
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,690
Both Khrushchev and Bob,

517
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,170
Bob down there, I was halfway through mine,

518
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,230
had to run outside to vomit.

519
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,050
I swear it was paint thinner.

520
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,970
The label on the bottle had paint thinner crossed out

521
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,370
and vodka written underneath.

522
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,390
My original guess of it being moonshine was awfully wrong.

523
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,870
When I stumbled back in, bleary-eyed,

524
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,850
I bumped into no less than Richard M. Nixon.

525
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,530
Even if my eyes were blurred, I could not mistake his voice.

526
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,410
He cursed me as he chased a small dog around.

527
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,690
I made the move.

528
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,750
I made my weaving way back up to the bar

529
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,150
where Bob and Nikki were now glaring and laughing

530
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,490
manically at each other while pounding their shoes

531
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,470
on the bar top.

532
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,990
It would seem that Bob had won the paint thinner

533
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,150
drinking contest.

534
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,850
For as I sat down on my stool, Khrushchev's eyes

535
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,050
rolled to the back of his head and he fell off his

536
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,390
bar stool onto the sodden floor and into oblivion.

537
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,570
I was horrified and asked Bob if he were all right,

538
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,510
for this could be a potentially world destructive event.

539
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,350
Mr.

540
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,250
Dobbs told me,

541
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,090
he's fine, the little dyke.

542
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,910
He'll be ready for another one in the morning.

543
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,390
But first, young agent, let us have a snack.

544
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:10,890
I feared that suggestion of food for my stomach was still in knots from being sick.

545
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:15,830
But Bob nonetheless led me to a long table covered with all manner of edibles,

546
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,250
if you dare call them that.

547
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:21,390
There was a bucket of small red colored balls of a gelatinous material

548
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:24,650
that Bob told me were prairie squid caviar.

549
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:27,170
I had to run back outside to get sick.

550
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,490
I had to eat it again.

551
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,650
It smelled like rotten fish bait.

552
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:34,650
Bob seemed to relish them for he ate a whole large bucket full with his grimy hands.

553
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,730
He let out a belch and for some reason rubbed his backside.

554
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,910
I vomited harder at that stench.

555
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,670
When I made it back inside, worse for wear,

556
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:50,790
Bob told me he wanted to try my luck out at one of the many card tables.

557
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:56,270
The rest of the evening was a horrible blur for not only did he force feed me pills,

558
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,330
but he kept buying round-the-clock pills.

559
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:01,050
Round after round of the local actual moonshine, thank God.

560
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:08,030
Mr. Dobbs could hold his liquor well, though he did seem to flicker bodily on and off like a broken television,

561
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,170
especially when he did poorly at the games of chance.

562
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:17,710
At one point, we, Bob, Mao, Churchill, a beatnik type, Ed Sullivan,

563
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:23,030
a strange alien-looking creature with the face of a cuttlefish and I,

564
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,890
were playing some sort of complicated card game

565
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:31,490
where the cards themselves represented different currencies, worlds, and immortal souls.

566
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,950
Bob lost the big hand of the night.

567
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:40,310
In a rare fit of anger, he grabbed the cards from the alien and threw them on the floor, cursing,

568
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,410
Well, I do believe that I've been cheated!

569
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:47,730
He then grabbed, wrong side up it seemed to me, an IOU written on a bar napkin

570
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,230
and squinted his drunken eyes at it, saying,

571
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,330
I guess I'll see you in 1998.

572
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,190
He slurred under his breath,

573
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,610
Ah, screw you, you damn cheating squid.

574
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,970
Though it was Bob, I knew who had been the one that was cheating,

575
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:14,030
for he kept, not very slickly, mind you, grabbing cards out of my hand when he claimed he needed them.

576
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:17,170
The whole event, from what I can remember, was pathetic,

577
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:22,450
but what disturbed me the most was one of the cards had a picture of our planet on it,

578
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,530
and the alien-looking creature seemed to relish the fact,

579
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,810
that he had won it.

580
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,550
Bob, in a panicked state that I've never seen before,

581
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,090
hustled me so violently toward the door that we knocked over Mr. Nixon,

582
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:39,470
who was sitting cross-legged on the floor, grilling skewers of meat over an open fire.

583
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,310
He cursed us, mumbling that he got the taste for dog,

584
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:47,410
while doing some brain massaging during a trip to North Korea,

585
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:53,130
and how we ruined his meal, though we'd all soon be dancing to his tune.

586
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,490
Nixon did, however, hand us a cheaply mimeographed booklet entitled,

587
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,870
How to Serve Man.

588
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,250
With that, Mr. Dobbs' face relaxed a little.

589
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,970
He nudged me with his elbow, grinning, and saying in a bit of an oily voice,

590
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,530
Good recipes in this one.

591
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,970
He chuckled to himself as we walked out into the misty morning light.

592
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:21,230
I can still hear the dreadful sound and import of his index finger tapping hard

593
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,110
against that thin, thin leaf.

594
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,150
Manual of Evil.

595
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,290
And that was

596
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,490
the... Oh, it looks like we have

597
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,070
a voice here on the

598
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,070
nether line.

599
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,230
Is that the Dave?

600
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,230
Or is it? The Dave?

601
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,610
It is the Daveth.

602
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,710
It is the Daveth.

603
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,250
And that means I can turn

604
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,550
Princess Weezmike on.

605
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,410
The Daveth have arrived us.

606
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,430
Yes, Dave, I just finished

607
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,350
reading from the agent and

608
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,350
Mr. Dobbs Part 5 by

609
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,990
Reverend Teeters LaVerge.

610
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,350
I was going to ask you about the outcome.

611
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,270
Not that it's not the day

612
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,850
new mine, but

613
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,150
what happened?

614
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,310
Well, it ended with

615
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,330
Nixon chasing a little dog

616
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,330
around the room and then barbecuing

617
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,230
it. That's all?

618
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,210
Is there a fan in here?

619
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,290
There is a major league fan

620
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,970
over here. It's like

621
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,650
big, big, big fan.

622
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,270
I could hear it all the way over here.

623
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,370
In the Lucivia.

624
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,090
I could hear all the sounds like there's nails

625
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,790
being dragged across. It's vibrating my

626
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,590
skeleton.

627
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,770
You know, when I

628
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,050
normally when I'm reading these

629
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,970
things in my home studio, I turn

630
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,510
off all the fans. I know.

631
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,110
I didn't really hear it until we got

632
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,910
going. We were in conversation

633
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,330
with the... With Kabir.

634
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,490
With Kabir. Yes.

635
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:48,150
And I didn't think to

636
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,170
say, do you want me to turn this

637
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:50,770
off, dear?

638
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,090
I was...

639
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,310
That reminds me. We were wondering whether

640
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,070
Kabir drinks beer, but

641
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,370
that's probably... We'll have to ask

642
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,190
him next time. Probably.

643
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:02,410
I think it's a question of, you know,

644
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,290
atmospherics and color and stuff.

645
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,710
I think, well, it conveys a

646
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,510
sultry kind of evening.

647
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,190
Late spring evening.

648
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,210
Not that sultry, I guess.

649
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,230
Boy, it's pretty sultry.

650
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,110
And then you're, you know, reading

651
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,210
Two-Fisted Tales of what... What's his name?

652
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:19,730
Of the Agers.

653
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,690
No, it's another tale. Mr. Dobbs.

654
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,410
Third Nostril Depiction.

655
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:25,910
But...

656
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,330
Actually, Dave, you'll be

657
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,310
interested to hear this. We're thinking about

658
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,350
doing another anthology. There was

659
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,390
Three-Fisted Tales of Bob

660
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,070
is out of print, although it's on

661
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,370
subgenius.com. You can read the whole

662
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,470
thing. We've got Bob's

663
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,130
stories by Robert Anton Wilson

664
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,490
and William

665
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,470
S. Burroughs. I'm not kidding

666
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,110
either. John

667
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,850
Shirley, Lou Shiner, and

668
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,450
and

669
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:51,890
and

670
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:52,570
, and, and, and, and.

671
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,530
And it's a terrible one by me

672
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,690
that's actually a Doc Savage

673
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,830
homage.

674
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,990
But there's been so many good

675
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,570
new Bob stories coming out

676
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,050
on Scrubgenius, the secret

677
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,510
members only forum.

678
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,130
And there are many stories now?

679
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,750
Stories of Bob?

680
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,390
Yeah. Yeah, all of a sudden.

681
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:15,750
Reverend Dow Jones is writing a play.

682
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:22,330
Reverend Pantiera wrote something that doesn't really have Bob in it, but it's got a yeti.

683
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,690
and, oh, I can't give away the secret superstar

684
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,690
that appears at the end of the story

685
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,950
that would ruin it for everybody.

686
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,770
No, you can't, that's right.

687
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,570
But she'll be at X Day.

688
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:33,950
Thank goodness.

689
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,210
Oh, and before I forget,

690
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:40,050
I have a couple of little announcements to make

691
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:45,390
regarding shows that I don't stand to make a penny off of.

692
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,730
That's why I can announce them.

693
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,530
One is almost kind of pointless

694
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:51,970
because by the time people hear this,

695
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,950
it's on Tuesday, May 24th,

696
00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:00,990
there's a Canadian X Day drill at Boone's House Lounge

697
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,950
in Hamilton, Ontario.

698
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:08,510
So the one Canadian who's listening by internet

699
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,690
might want to know about that.

700
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,070
Mr. Sister was thinking about going to that.

701
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:16,550
I think there are many Ontarians who are denizens of Bob.

702
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,330
Quite a few.

703
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,050
Oh, yeah.

704
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:19,510
Oh, absolutely.

705
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,110
And also, now this one makes more sense.

706
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:25,810
It's June 4th in Raleigh, North Carolina.

707
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,030
Oh, and I just got more detailed news.

708
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,850
Yeah, June 4th in Raleigh, North Carolina

709
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,130
for our out-of-town Carolinians

710
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:40,110
at a place called King's in downtown Raleigh.

711
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,990
Let's see what this fellow said here.

712
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,650
Yeah, the title is,

713
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,870
it's a rock and roll revival featuring

714
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:49,950
The Loners.

715
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,670
It's being sponsored by Reverend Eddie T.

716
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,110
And that's his band.

717
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,690
And you can Google The Loners.

718
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,490
Then The Hell No,

719
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,690
which is a female-fronted rock and blues band.

720
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,430
The Hell No.

721
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:08,130
This is funny because our friend Dr. Dark

722
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,190
is married to Her Highness Hell No.

723
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:10,630
Yes.

724
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,950
Dr. Dark will be showing movies the next day, by the way.

725
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:17,430
And there will also be a grindhouse 24-7 all the time.

726
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,650
And another,

727
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,290
we're going to have a little bit of a grindhouse

728
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:19,290


729
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,190
So if it rains, we'll have plenty to do.

730
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:25,510
And a burlesque show with real live dancing girls

731
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,450
doing it old school with tassels

732
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:30,890
called Riot Here, Riot Now Burlesque.

733
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,170
And they'll be showing the subgenius video Arise

734
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:38,370
and a sound system with Reverend T

735
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:41,770
spinning only 45 RPM records

736
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,670
and a preacher named Deacon Tony.

737
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,390
So that's June 4th in Raleigh, North Carolina.

738
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:48,850
And we're going to have a little bit of a grindhouse

739
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,410
with the band.

740
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:54,190
North Carolina and Raleigh and Greenville

741
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:57,370
have a lot of subgeniuses.

742
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,050
Well, that's where the hamburger was invented.

743
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,850
And besides, I think the one guy who said his name,

744
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,850
that's actually two disc jockeys.

745
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:04,690
What?

746
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,010
No, you're thinking of two beans.

747
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:09,690
Two separate beans, of course, not two beans.

748
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,890
Two beans is the music that we're hearing

749
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,250
in the background right now.

750
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,050
But in a minute, we'll be hearing

751
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,130
Electric Junkyard Gamelon.

752
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,610
That was Electric Junkyard Gamelon.

753
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,210
Oh, it is now.

754
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:20,810
Yeah, now it's...

755
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,390
All that clinkety stuff.

756
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:22,770
Yeah.

757
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,490
That sounds like the fingernail.

758
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,430
I mean, the, you know, the finger flute

759
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,990
or whatever they call it in Saipan

760
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:30,310
where, you know, there's these little metallic things

761
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,430
and you go doink, doink, doink.

762
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,490
It's probably not.

763
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,310
Electric Junkyard Gamelon

764
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,430
creates all their instruments from scratch, I think.

765
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,550
Could be flower pots.

766
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,470
Yeah.

767
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:39,690
They do a lot of flower pots.

768
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,550
But they're still imitating gamelons.

769
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,130
Gamelon bongies.

770
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:46,270
It's a Junkyard Gamelon, electrified.

771
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,110
They're not going to be at Star Wars.

772
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:48,730
They're going to be at Star Wars this year, are they?

773
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:49,550
No, not this year.

774
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,050
They were there last year.

775
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,150
I saw them last year.

776
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,110
That's why I have the CD.

777
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:56,570
They're going to be there a few years from now.

778
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,310
Well, we don't have to worry about years from now

779
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,350
because the world ends July 5th.

780
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:01,810
Why?

781
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:04,490
Well, I thought it was supposed to already have ended.

782
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,510
If this is, in fact, 1998.

783
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,590
If indeed it is today, it's May 20, whatever the second it is.

784
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,630
Now, that's the funny thing, folks.

785
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,730
Now, most of the people hearing this,

786
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,030
it'll be,

787
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:23,150
but the night we're recording this happens to be May 22nd.

788
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,430
On May 21st of this year, of 2011,

789
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,310
it was widely predicted that the world was going to end

790
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:33,810
with the rapture, the Christian rapture.

791
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,770
All the Christian believers would be lifted up

792
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:41,390
and all the subgenius disbelievers and believers,

793
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,890
both, would all die horribly.

794
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,250
And all the claptrapture that accompanied the rapture.

795
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,090
The rapture, yes.

796
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,050
The rapture.

797
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,050
Well, what kills me about this whole thing is, of course,

798
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:57,230
all of a sudden, the pinks at large,

799
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,010
the humans, the normals, the mediocrities,

800
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,230
started throwing end-of-the-world parties

801
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,970
to make fun of those rapture people.

802
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,370
What an original idea!

803
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:09,090
We've only been doing that for 20 years!

804
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,590
And I must say, I was a little miffed

805
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:14,730
that we didn't get more media attention because of that.

806
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:15,090
Yeah.

807
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,550
We're experts at looking like idiots,

808
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,550
waiting for the end of the world to happen at a specific...

809
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:24,430
And this guy, even like us, he had a specific time.

810
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:28,390
According to Camping, Harold Camping,

811
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:32,270
the destruction was likely to have begun its worldwide march

812
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,930
as it became 6 p.m. in the various time zones.

813
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:41,670
Camping delivered his message as he sat upon a silver throne

814
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,990
accompanied with a big pink boy.

815
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:44,410
No, I'm sorry.

816
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,010
Well, it's just...

817
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:47,450
It just...

818
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,790
I mean, this is so old hat for us.

819
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:53,330
And of course, these people are nothing but July 5th deniers.

820
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,370
They're pikers!

821
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:57,290
And they're nothing but a bunch of psychosociopathic jalopies, too,

822
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,890
when it comes to driving next to them.

823
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,350
They practically run you down.

824
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,770
I got a single solid...

825
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:03,770
Well, I don't have it anymore

826
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,790
since I don't really have a back bumper anymore.

827
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:07,910
But once upon a time, many years ago,

828
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,330
I had the face of Bob on the back of my car.

829
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,250
And somebody slapped it off there.

830
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,070
And I see people going by and saying

831
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,290
the world's going to end tomorrow.

832
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,370
And they, you know, quote some scripture.

833
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,250
Of which I have no idea what the heck they're talking about.

834
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,070
And I'm expected to believe it now.

835
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,810
They almost run me off the road and kill me.

836
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:29,110
So the world was going to end tomorrow...

837
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,430
Today, and you may die.

838
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,410
And that right there, my friends, is a message of X-Day.

839
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,990
By his stripes, shall we know

840
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,310
that X-Day could come at any second.

841
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,190
That means you better be ready.

842
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:42,970
And I think if you want to understand how to be ready,

843
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,430
you might want to take a look at subgenius.com.

844
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,410
You don't have to.

845
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,530
You probably wouldn't.

846
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,130
You probably wouldn't even like it.

847
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,110
Oh, you probably couldn't afford it.

848
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,090
It's free, so you probably couldn't afford it.

849
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,570
I can understand the adverse psychology

850
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,910
used in your strategic marketing methods.

851
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,010
But it is a known fact

852
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,950
that it is a ridiculously lovely sight.

853
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,270
It's just an incredible feast for the eyeballs

854
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:07,950
and any other parts of your body you want to feast on, too.

855
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,430
It's like if you were Ludacris on the bridge

856
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,610
or perhaps great, what's his name,

857
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,450
the guy with the sphincter muscle on his head.

858
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,750
I'm trying to place him.

859
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,130
He plays with Ludacris sometimes, doesn't he?

860
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:20,350
Yeah.

861
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:21,010
Yeah.

862
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:21,930
I don't know.

863
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,250
Oh, some wag.

864
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,190
It may have been one of our wags

865
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:31,690
dubbed May 21st Nostra Dumbass Day.

866
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,970
I saw a couple of funny comments

867
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,210
in the Yahoo News comments.

868
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,010
Oh, my.

869
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,250
One was,

870
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:45,190
I wouldn't drink the Kool-Aid in Camping's Church this Sunday.

871
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,250
And the other one was,

872
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:47,950
screw up, Harold.

873
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:48,970
We all make mistakes.

874
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,210
It's not the end of the world.

875
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,970
I'm trying to figure out

876
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,150
how he was justifying his camera angles.

877
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,450
In the first place,

878
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,070
what calendar is he using?

879
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:05,210
The Julian calendar?

880
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,630
The Gregorian calendar?

881
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:07,890
The Humpisphere?

882
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:13,230
We just basically threw our calendars out the window.

883
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,030
Yeah.

884
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,450
Nothing beats a good old cocktail napkin

885
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,470
when it comes to,

886
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,270
getting dates right.

887
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,710
But by the same token,

888
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,330
I'm sure he's reading upside down

889
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,410
from the same Bible he was throwing at everybody.

890
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,230
Hey, hey, are you making fun of us?

891
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:27,710
Who, him or you?

892
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,210
No.

893
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,930
Remember there's that controversy about 1998.

894
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,110
If you look at the memo,

895
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,130
it was referred to in that short,

896
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,550
in that the agents,

897
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,350
that's what's so scary about that.

898
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,530
It's that thing that I've been reading,

899
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:43,170
the agent and Mr. Dobbs,

900
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,370
that was written in 1962.

901
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,370
And it refers clearly to that,

902
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,710
the same memo that I actually have

903
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,930
in the Slacker Mansion vault,

904
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,510
where Bob first wrote down,

905
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,450
the world ends July 5th, 7 a.m., 1998.

906
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,830
And it's kind of been cut out and taped back together.

907
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,150
And some people say that it originally said,

908
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:07,190
July 5th, 8661,

909
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,210
which is 1998,

910
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,730
if you turn those numbers upside down.

911
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:12,950
Upside down.

912
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:14,350
8991.

913
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,870
They had all the right numbers.

914
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,530
You just had them up.

915
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,330
Upside down.

916
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:19,250
9891.

917
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:21,670
So.

918
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,270
But those are all backwards numbers.

919
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,270
We need numbers that actually progress

920
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,750
from one point to another

921
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,350
in an incremental fashion,

922
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,270
like, say, for instance,

923
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,070
if we wanted to go from one to five,

924
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,450
we'd be going something,

925
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,350
you know, be going somewhere,

926
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,430
doing something.

927
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,650
If we were to go backwards

928
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,030
to like a negative five,

929
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,610
or perhaps, you know,

930
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,310
go to two and go back to one,

931
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,350
there'd be no salubritory mention

932
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,490
or more.

933
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:47,710
There'd be no movement.

934
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:48,810
Did you?

935
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,990
I think you went to the same math class

936
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,470
as Harold Camping.

937
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,950
Well, I'm not saying that I picked up

938
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,890
a few tasty little tidbits

939
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,110
from his rhetorical style,

940
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,370
but I do believe that scripture,

941
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,430
scripture, scripture,

942
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,850
is invaluable for...

943
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:06,410
um...

944
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,150
That reminds me,

945
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,990
I need to take my pre-scripture.

946
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:12,910
What is scripture?

947
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,810
I mean, what is it good for?

948
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,150
It's written.

949
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,230
Huh!

950
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:18,630
Scripture.

951
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:19,590
Huh!

952
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,190
Good God, y'all!

953
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,870
What is it good for?

954
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,310
Absolutely, I don't know.

955
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:28,270
Don't go see the Jack Black

956
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,750
Gulliver's Travels.

957
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:32,210
So we're not supposed to do

958
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:33,130
a call to action, right?

959
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:33,570
Right.

960
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,250
That's a call against action.

961
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,810
That's my movie review.

962
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:38,370
It's a review.

963
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:39,630
Did you know that they did

964
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,170
a recent version of the classic

965
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,430
Jonathan Swift story,

966
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:44,770
Gulliver's Travels?

967
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,070
I heard it was called

968
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:46,070


969
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:46,610
and it is so...

970
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:46,630
I heard it was called

971
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,090
popular mythology,

972
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:47,090


973
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:47,130
I heard it was called

974
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:47,130


975
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:47,130


976
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:47,230
I heard it was called

977
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:47,230


978
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:51,310
and it's a little bit

979
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:51,510
of a

980
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:58,530
I don't know what that has to do

981
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:59,350
with being tied down

982
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,930
by a bunch of little tiny elves.

983
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,810
I love the D.

984
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,810
I love Tenacious D.

985
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,070
Princess We can sing

986
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,450
every one of their hits

987
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,470
from memory,

988
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,390
but I can't believe

989
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,510
Jack Black signed on.

990
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,930
They must have paid him a lot.

991
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,370
That script is so bad.

992
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:19,010
And it ends with a version of War,

993
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,770
that song War, that is...

994
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,890
I thought Jack Black had something

995
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,010
to do with the making of that.

996
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:26,930
I hope not.

997
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:27,510
That's sad.

998
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,190
You know, you can't trust

999
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,090
anybody named Black.

1000
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,550
No puede.

1001
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,310
Pero, um...

1002
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,510
By the way...

1003
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,230
We can move on now.

1004
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,310
Oh, yes.

1005
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,790
No, I'm saying,

1006
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:46,750
what I was asking,

1007
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,450
did he have like a kind of a posh,

1008
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:49,650
poofy pompous accent?

1009
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,370
I said with three plosives in a row.

1010
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,230
Was he trying to sound British

1011
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:53,730
or something?

1012
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:54,190
No, no.

1013
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:56,130
It's all takes place

1014
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:57,450
in modern day America.

1015
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,670
And he's a guy working

1016
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,030
for a travel magazine.

1017
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,790
And he goes to the Bermuda Triangle.

1018
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,790
And that sucks him into Lilliput.

1019
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,230
Oh, and not only that,

1020
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,430
but the pretty editor girl

1021
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,410
he was trying to impress

1022
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:13,710
follows him and ends up in Lilliput.

1023
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:14,990
So he gets to save the day.

1024
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,350
There's a very brief segment

1025
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:19,050
that takes place in Brob-dig-nag.

1026
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,450
But it's really short

1027
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:23,150
and really stupid.

1028
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,170
You know, I mean,

1029
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,390
for somebody from the church

1030
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:27,250
of the subgenius

1031
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,830
to call a movie stupid,

1032
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,530
with that level of accent

1033
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:32,210
and the voice,

1034
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,490
it's got to be really dumb.

1035
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,470
That fan is driving me crazy.

1036
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,230
That thing is exactly

1037
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:41,330
at the same pitch

1038
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,710
that my tinnitus is.

1039
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,970
So it's as if it's doubling up

1040
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,290
the sound of the crickets and cicadas.

1041
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,150
Would you like it to be gone?

1042
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:49,710
I would say turn it off.

1043
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:52,630
I wish I'd had the presence of mind

1044
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,850
to request that earlier.

1045
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,470
Oh, I can actually hear

1046
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:56,290
the soundtrack now.

1047
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:57,310
Yeah.

1048
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:58,330
I mean, I can hear it.

1049
00:43:58,330 --> 00:43:59,050
I can hear it.

1050
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,350
That's Just John in the background.

1051
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,490
The music in the background

1052
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,850
for a couple of cuts now

1053
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,170
has been Reverend Just John,

1054
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:10,990
available at just-john.com.

1055
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:12,830
You don't write the dash out

1056
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:13,890
and make a little dash mark.

1057
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:14,970
Just-john.com.

1058
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:19,050
And these are all

1059
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,370
very, very fine pieces.

1060
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:22,010
You don't necessarily want to

1061
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,670
critique anyone's mental stability

1062
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,350
when you listen to them.

1063
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:28,330
You just take things as they go

1064
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,510
and you enjoy them

1065
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,450
as far as you can,

1066
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:32,490
within the context of perhaps

1067
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:34,410
a delightful radio show,

1068
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:35,050
a snack,

1069
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:37,650
a meeting with the local hippie

1070
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,870
NTO people at the bandwagon.

1071
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,190
So anybody who, you know,

1072
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:44,150
wears dentures or anything like,

1073
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:44,950
or a false device,

1074
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:44,950


1075
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:44,950


1076
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:44,950


1077
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:44,950


1078
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:45,870
or a false device on their body

1079
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:46,450
could be invited,

1080
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,370
provided they had the right,

1081
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:49,310
you know, first scriptures.

1082
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,870
I just want to do this whole show

1083
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:51,470
over again.

1084
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,210
I just want to start from the beginning.

1085
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:55,670
And turn off the fan.

1086
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:56,650
Well, I don't have to play

1087
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:57,970
all the background stuff again,

1088
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,130
but I have to read the story

1089
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,170
all over again.

1090
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:00,990
Start again.

1091
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:03,190
You mean the fan was on

1092
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,330
when you were reading the story?

1093
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:04,810
Yeah.

1094
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:06,810
Jeez, old man.

1095
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:07,690
It was, you know,

1096
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:08,870
I didn't turn the mic.

1097
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:11,470
I didn't hear it in the real world

1098
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:13,130
because I can't hear anything.

1099
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:14,850
But when I put on headphones,

1100
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,290
and turned the mic up,

1101
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:17,650
I thought, that's odd.

1102
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,330
There seems to be some extra sound.

1103
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,310
Oh, well, maybe it's on this

1104
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:23,110
Two Beans music in the background.

1105
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:23,790
But no.

1106
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:26,530
You know, we finally escaped

1107
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,110
the buzz of your phone,

1108
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,450
and then we get the hiss of the fan.

1109
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:33,390
Our fans, our hissy fans.

1110
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,990
I'm about to throw our hissy fit.

1111
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,390
And throw our fans out the window.

1112
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:41,470
This is a possibility you represent.

1113
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:43,990
You packaged yourself in the last piece

1114
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:44,830
as a T.I.S.S.

1115
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,830
Not TSL kind of thing.

1116
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,370
A Tennessee Williams kind of thing.

1117
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:49,610
The fan in the background,

1118
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:50,750
it's a Mississippi morning.

1119
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:52,030
You know, where I'm old.

1120
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:55,530
Slumber Jane is waking from the sidekicks

1121
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:58,070
as the pavement is steaming.

1122
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,710
And the various things are steaming

1123
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:02,210
on the pavement.

1124
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:04,330
And a mockingbird comes by

1125
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:05,470
and passes out.

1126
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,510
You know, stuff like that.

1127
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,790
That's all very atmospheric, Dave.

1128
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:11,350
But...

1129
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:13,610
Well, you do have the southern accent

1130
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:14,870
that accompanies it so well.

1131
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:15,370
I what?

1132
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:15,870
You could have said,

1133
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:16,130
y'all.

1134
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:16,870
I still do?

1135
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,450
No, you don't really, actually.

1136
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:19,010
I must say.

1137
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:19,850
But, um...

1138
00:46:19,850 --> 00:46:22,290
You must stuff out earlier in the show

1139
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:23,430
before you called in.

1140
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:26,750
I was playing tapes from 1980.

1141
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:28,130
Prince...

1142
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:28,830
I asked Princess,

1143
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:29,270
wait, I said,

1144
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,050
do you know who this is?

1145
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,070
And she did not know.

1146
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:31,850
I had no idea.

1147
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:32,110
It is gone.

1148
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,610
It was me as a young Texan.

1149
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:37,110
I must say it is gone.

1150
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:37,970
All traces.

1151
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:39,270
You sound like Mr.

1152
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:40,690
Mr.

1153
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:41,470
Announcer.

1154
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:42,770
Mr.

1155
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:43,350
Mr.

1156
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:43,550
Mr.

1157
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:43,790
Mr.

1158
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:44,710
Californian

1159
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:44,830
Mr.

1160
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:44,970


1161
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:45,350
Announcer

1162
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:48,190
from the Columbia School of Broadcasting.

1163
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:49,050
There you go.

1164
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:51,410
It comes of having to

1165
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:52,190
All prerequisite tests.

1166
00:46:52,550 --> 00:47:04,270
It comes of having to listen to one's own voice for 1,310 hours of slack which is where

1167
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:05,230
we're at right now.

1168
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:06,950
That's a lot of epiglottis.

1169
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:11,010
Think of all the time you spent in front of one of those little magnifying mirrors, actually

1170
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:13,250
looking at your epiglottis as it yodeled.

1171
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:14,130
when he said something.

1172
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:17,670
This is the way Diogenes taught his people how to do this.

1173
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,730
He'd fill his mouth with some dirt

1174
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:22,030
and go to the seashore and spit it out.

1175
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:25,510
And that's where, you know, rhetorically...

1176
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,610
You've spent a lot of time doing this, have you, Dave?

1177
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:31,390
Well, supposedly, or maybe it was Epicurus

1178
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,590
and the minions of Hedon or somebody, I don't know,

1179
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:39,750
somebody with a big, fancy, Romanesque, Greco name, you know.

1180
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:46,990
Well, all I know is I'm no fan of that fan in this radio station.

1181
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:50,350
That's no place for a talk show.

1182
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:51,870
A friend of mine...

1183
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:53,830
There's air conditioning in here.

1184
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:57,430
Well, I wondered about that when we first walked in

1185
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:00,530
because it reminded me of the old days

1186
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:04,090
in the old radio station with fans in the summertime.

1187
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:06,130
Yeah, we used to have fans back then.

1188
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:09,270
We've only got six of them listening now, I can tell.

1189
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:10,250
Just look at that screen.

1190
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:12,970
Actually, we're not doing too bad.

1191
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:14,850
Yeah, there's quite a few people listening by internet.

1192
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:17,690
Remember in the old days of the old studio?

1193
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:18,470
Hi, internet!

1194
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:18,870
Hi, internet!

1195
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:22,730
They all have little American flags next to them

1196
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:25,390
except for one who is in Canadia.

1197
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:30,190
Thanks be to all of our mighty forces

1198
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:33,090
fighting any broads that they find in the neighborhood

1199
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:36,450
who are too ungainly to put in a wheelchair.

1200
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:40,510
And first of all, what we have to try and remember

1201
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:42,350
is we're not at war.

1202
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:42,930
We're not at war.

1203
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:42,930


1204
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:43,630
We're at war right now.

1205
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:46,910
We're at war with war as...

1206
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:50,710
We're at peace right now.

1207
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:53,930
We are at peace with all nations around the world.

1208
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:57,230
And yet at the same time, certain nations must be blowed up

1209
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:59,290
to show the error of their unpeaceful ways,

1210
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:02,550
and we peacefully do it as peacefully as we can.

1211
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:05,650
However, on the other hand, if war is necessary

1212
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:09,390
and is justly necessary, we should have one every other day.

1213
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:11,770
All right, every day. What the hell?

1214
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:12,810
I turned down a war.

1215
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:13,630
I turned down a war job today.

1216
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:14,730
You got one?

1217
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,230
I had to.

1218
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:20,570
I got a letter from a guy I used to edit documentary films for.

1219
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:23,290
His regular editor couldn't do it,

1220
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:25,210
and he had just gotten back from Libya.

1221
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:27,370
This is a friend of mine.

1222
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:27,930
Get out of here.

1223
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:28,990
Reverend Mickey Grant.

1224
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:32,110
Whenever there's a war, he runs out there with his video camera

1225
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:34,410
and shoots everything they'll let him shoot

1226
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:38,870
and then comes back and tries to turn it into a movie.

1227
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:41,450
And apparently HBO wants his footage.

1228
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:42,190
Tuesday.

1229
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:44,210
So you're doing that.

1230
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:44,830
I am just.

1231
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:47,230
It's like, look, man, I got my own show I got to do.

1232
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:48,370
I got a war I'm fighting.

1233
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:52,010
I'm fighting a war against the pink boys, the normals.

1234
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:56,410
By the way, friends, if you never look at Subgenius on the Internet,

1235
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:04,650
you might want to check out the videos recently done by Dr. Legume.

1236
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:12,370
If you go to, I don't know if his channel is actually called DR Legume or not,

1237
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:17,670
but I know that mine is called Revstang in all small lowercase.

1238
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:22,970
If you look at my Revstang YouTube, OK, YouTube slash Revstang lowercase,

1239
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:30,630
look at my favorites and look at the ones you may want to look at the ones by my friend Dr. Legume.

1240
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:38,410
They are of questionable taste, but unquestionable hilarity.

1241
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:42,370
In fact, two nights in the last month,

1242
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:52,330
just we and I have had to cover our faces with pillows to keep our laughter from awaking the guests in the bedroom downstairs.

1243
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:59,210
I'm dead serious about how funny the Legume videos are.

1244
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:03,310
Some of them are directly related to Subgenius and some aren't.

1245
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,170
But they're all just amazing.

1246
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:12,790
I'm jealous as hell because I started out to be a filmmaker and these are way better than anything I've posted.

1247
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:12,790


1248
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:12,790


1249
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:17,830
I've posted on YouTube that I've made since I was much younger.

1250
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:23,030
I do have some good stuff on YouTube, but it was made when I was still a filmmaker.

1251
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:24,430
Merely a lad.

1252
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:28,490
Like I say, I just turned down a film job because I don't do that anymore.

1253
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,130
I'm too far behind the times.

1254
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:32,450
I don't think I even have an H.

1255
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:41,710
I think we finally got an HD TV so we could find out what HD looks like someday if we ever get an HD program to put on it.

1256
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:47,470
Well, I have one up there too that's absolutely hilarious, but it's a little bit brain damaged.

1257
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:55,150
It's called The Audition, but there's so many of them called The Audition and it's on this one list of people or something.

1258
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,870
There was like only 45 people.

1259
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,890
I think it was in my class and some other classes or something.

1260
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:01,970
And so it's a different name.

1261
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:09,650
There's a Japanese feature film called The Audition that's supposed to be really hard to take.

1262
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,770
Not the kind of thing you take a date for.

1263
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:12,770


1264
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:15,450
It's bloody and gory.

1265
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:16,770
Yeah, rapey.

1266
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:22,190
It's very rapey and horrendous if it's the one I'm thinking of.

1267
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:26,350
But The Audition, the Japanese movie, is supposedly quite horrendous.

1268
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:32,110
Well, in my audition, a guy comes over to audition, but he's trying to...

1269
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:36,110
First, he brought over some pizza, but he has a very, very large head.

1270
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:40,850
Like it's about the size of a tiger watermelon or something.

1271
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,070
It's humongous.

1272
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:42,890
He's an overman.

1273
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:46,910
Well, no, he's just a very, very large, a macrocephalic person.

1274
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,830
And he looks quite scary.

1275
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:53,630
And then I look scared at him, but then he plays all these funny instruments and does

1276
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:57,450
a weird dance and goes away going like that.

1277
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:02,210
So it's very, it's kind of childish and soft-marked, but it's also humorous.

1278
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:10,550
Speaking of going away, we have exactly six minutes left of show and I have a five-minute

1279
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,050
song that I wanted to play.

1280
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:19,330
Partly because it's pertinent to the end of the world and mentions issues that we brought

1281
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:19,830
up earlier.

1282
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:21,110
So it makes a good bookend.

1283
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:28,590
It's a live recording of a song by the Swinging Love Corpses, Dr. Philo Drummond and his brother

1284
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:31,650
Sphinx Drummond, Leif Cowabunga on bass.

1285
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:36,470
And in this case, the guitar player, Ray Hay, is singing this song.

1286
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:39,610
I wanted to play it specifically.

1287
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:42,030
This is a shout out to our friend, Mr. Hay.

1288
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:42,030


1289
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:45,270
He's a sister sister who vocally hates nature.

1290
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:51,970
He's a proud Republican who hates nature and makes no bones at all about it.

1291
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:54,770
Although he's actually been a pretty good sport about it.

1292
00:53:55,090 --> 00:54:00,670
And I thought he might enjoy this song because it's called Nature, I Hate It.

1293
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:06,630
And as I say it, oh, look at the background music by Just John ended at just the right

1294
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:07,010
moment.

1295
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:08,070
And that means I should.

1296
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:10,070
What a perfect setup time for the cue.

1297
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:11,030
It's magic.

1298
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,730
Now, remember, take that Q-tip out of your ear.

1299
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:15,370
OK.

1300
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:19,970
If someone were to come up really quickly next to you and perhaps maybe want to hold

1301
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:23,530
your head or something, it could go all the way to the other side of your head.

1302
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:03,750
Well, it's been a while since time began

1303
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:08,490
A bad struggle against nature, force and nature against man

1304
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:12,330
Tectonic, pre-human, to simple quicksand

1305
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:16,530
Nature has the power, nature has the upper hand

1306
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:19,930
Nature! I hate it!

1307
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:23,990
Nature! I hate it!

1308
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:34,790
Well, the forces of nature come in many degrees

1309
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:38,230
Maybe a forest fire peg

1310
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:38,470
Or a fire in the air

1311
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:38,470


1312
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:39,250
Or killer bees

1313
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,230
Or maybe an earthquake

1314
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:43,610
Or maybe typhoons

1315
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:45,410
Or tornadoes, volcanoes

1316
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:47,570
Or angel monsoons

1317
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:51,130
Nature! I hate it!

1318
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:55,250
Nature! I hate it!

1319
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:58,590
In the baby's dioxide

1320
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:03,150
Blue glitters

1321
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:07,230
Wipe out a whole species

1322
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:11,650
How does that make you feel?

1323
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:15,570
Cod your hole in the earth

1324
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:19,710
Fill that hole with plastic

1325
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:24,610
The way we treat our planet

1326
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:27,810
Wanderer than a man

1327
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:36,630
Nature! I hate it!

1328
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:40,230
Good Lord, I hate it!

1329
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:51,370
Way Remembers Me

1330
00:56:56,430 --> 00:57:01,470
íšŒ

1331
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:17,050
guitar solo

1332
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:45,290
solo

1333
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:46,570
Cal

1334
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:47,330
man

1335
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:07,290
the

1336
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:07,290


1337
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:11,510
wish I

1338
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:12,290
could control

1339
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:13,370
the action

1340
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:14,170
of

1341
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:14,550
others

1342
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:15,030
and

1343
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:18,430
We should love nature as one of our brothers.

1344
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:20,430
Don't you know it's not?

1345
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:22,570
Now say, who's your mother?

1346
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:23,830
Nature!

1347
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,190
I ain't never been to nature.

1348
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:28,130
Nature!

1349
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:30,330
Don't love it.

1350
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:32,210
Nature!

1351
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,590
Don't love it.

1352
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:36,390
Nature!

1353
00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:37,130
Nature!

1354
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:38,010
Nature!

1355
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:54,170
Come on!

1356
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:59,710
Come on!

1357
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:03,850
Come on!

1358
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:06,730
Thank you.

1359
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:15,010
I don't want to get off the stage.

1360
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:15,410
Get off the stage.

1361
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:18,430
Who told me to get off the stage?

1362
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,610
Am I just paranoid?
