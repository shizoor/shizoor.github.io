1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,300
Three stained drapes.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,280
When I knew I was still in Marty's hotel room,

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,200
I knew that hours had been thrown out of my life and thrown away.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,220
Then the light screamed again, and this time there were words.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,200
Big thousand-watt words that said,

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,540
Delicious dancing girls.

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,840
And in between there was the creaking sound of a rocking chair.

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,180
Then the rocking chair made words, too.

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,000
You're not thirsty.

10
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,500
You don't want a drink.

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,700
You don't want a drink.

12
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,860
His face, it's shaking!

13
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,680
And his hand, he's a monster!

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,920
Run, Horst! Run!

15
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,280
You can't get away, John! You can't get away!

16
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,100
It's my horse!

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,980
Where are you?

18
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,740
The Self-Genius

19
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,120
The Self-Genius

20
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,860
Yes, dear friends,

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,100
and thanks to Fernanda and Andy Leamer,

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,240
as always, for our opening credits.

23
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,220
This is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang,

24
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,020
and this would be

25
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,480
our

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,280
Hour of Slack number

27
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,140
1072

28
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,600
B

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,260
And it's a

30
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,660
rerun of somebody else's

31
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,960
subgenius show.

32
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,260
Yes, the great station

33
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,820
WREK in Atlanta

34
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,140
has a weekly show

35
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,980
called Bob's Slack Time

36
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,040
Fun House.

37
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,160
Every other week is done by the great

38
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,400
Reverend Susie the Floozy.

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:27,800
And

40
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,400
every other other week

41
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,140
is done by the Lymphnode Institute.

42
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,300
And this show is a wonderful example

43
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,980
of their work.

44
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,400
Unlike me, they're not barraged by

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,060
submissions

46
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,220
from subgeniuses

47
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,420
all over the world.

48
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,860
They just collect

49
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,260
things from their immediate environment.

50
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,400
So they have

51
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,040
more known music

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,740
running on their show, and they

53
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,700
do, well, you'll see.

54
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,040
They put a lot of work into writing

55
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,260
their show.

56
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,420
And this particular show is a great one.

57
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,000
At the end,

58
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,600
they'll give you more information

59
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,520
on where you can get podcasts

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,920
of their show,

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,480
which is via WREK.org.

62
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,560
And also,

63
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,580
if you poke around where you get the podcast

64
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,100
for Hour of Slack,

65
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,220
you will also find

66
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,940
Bob's Slack Time Fun House, and for that matter,

67
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,200
the Puzzling Evidence Show,

68
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,020
and links to all kinds of other

69
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,280
sublimiously audio

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,140
things. And so now, friends,

71
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,080
let us join

72
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,340
the mighty

73
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,520
Lymphnode Institute.

74
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,100
Yetis and simpletons,

75
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,200
poison ghouls.

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,340
Tonight, we once

77
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,400
again don the stiff, sticky

78
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,040
trappings of the faux

79
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,160
medicinal arts,

80
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,100
lace our boots

81
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,040
tight, and

82
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,020
duct tape our waders to our

83
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,220
waists as we wade

84
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,780
into the postmodern

85
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,500
moral quagmire

86
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,180
of torture.

87
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,300
We will titter with glee

88
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,200
as we watch our simian

89
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,120
cousins attempt to retain

90
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,740
their Judeo-Christian

91
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,840
ethics as they attempt

92
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,920
to survive in this

93
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,780
meaningless world that

94
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,360
Dobbs has sold them.

95
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,080
Of course, while this may be a great deal

96
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,880
of fun, it is

97
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,640
very, very, very

98
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,920
bad news for us, yetensany.

99
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,100
But,

100
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,760
we'll get to that

101
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,020
later.

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,520
No problem.

103
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,640
Ah!

104
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,720
No!

105
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,140
No!

106
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,380
No!

107
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,360
No!

108
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:58,660
No!

109
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:58,880
No!

110
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,100
No!

111
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,020
I was sitting there on Sunday morning in the chief of police's office at a large table.

112
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,240
Torture.

113
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,560
He was listening to a football game.

114
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,600
Let's be upfront about it.

115
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,360
A football game.

116
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,600
Torture.

117
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,700
T-O-R-T-U-R-E.

118
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,640
On the small transistor radio.

119
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,120
That's the bottom line these days.

120
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,700
And I had it very low.

121
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,620
It's replaced death.

122
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,400
Even teenagers kill themselves.

123
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
These days.

124
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,280
Along with the depressed.

125
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,520
And terminally ill.

126
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,500
And I began to hear.

127
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,280
Deaths are released from pain and anxiety and humiliation.

128
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,860
This very low.

129
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,820
Valued.

130
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,820
Reward.

131
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,440
Very low.

132
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,920
Wailing sound.

133
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,160
But the threat of death just isn't enough to control people.

134
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,420
So the ante's been raised.

135
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,760
Coming through the walls.

136
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,840
Now, it's torture.

137
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,620
Then it got louder.

138
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,620
And high tech torture at that.

139
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,520
Then it got louder.

140
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,280
And it was a low sound.

141
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,720
As the technocrats say, it's functional.

142
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,200
The chief of police told the colonel to turn up the radio.

143
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,680
That's why everyone who's intelligent and unanesthetized enough to care.

144
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,320
Then.

145
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,000
Has sort of put their life on hold.

146
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,960
Then the sound got louder.

147
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,400
Louder.

148
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,920
Underneath all the defensive layers of denial.

149
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:23,980
Return to.

150
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,300
We're all afraid of being tortured.

151
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,340
Anger.

152
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,700
Or homosexually gang raped.

153
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,360
Or having it happen to someone we care about.

154
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,300
Screaming.

155
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,240
And we're all self-consciously living a lie.

156
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,140
And I knew what it was.

157
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,860
We're all happy joes.

158
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,360
And I knew that this man was being tortured with.

159
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,620
How did it happen here in the land of the free?

160
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,100
In the home of the brave?

161
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,980
Tortured with electricity.

162
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,840
I mean in some banana republic.

163
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,320
Well it kept getting louder.

164
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,060
Some distant past.

165
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,640
Like the Spanish inquisition.

166
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,740
And more horrible.

167
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,960
World War II.

168
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,780
The Nazis.

169
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,760
The fanatical Japs.

170
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,040
And each time.

171
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,900
But not us Americans.

172
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,020
And each time.

173
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,040
G.I.

174
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,400
Joe.

175
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,560
And each time.

176
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,860
Frank Sinatra.

177
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,800
And each time.

178
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,200
Jerry Lewis.

179
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,900
Autumn in New York.

180
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,640
The chief would tell the colonel.

181
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,440
Baseball.

182
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,700
To turn up the radio.

183
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,880
College football.

184
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:20,980
Glenn Miller.

185
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,000
Pretty soon.

186
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,300
Some distant past.

187
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,300


188
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,300


189
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:23,300


190
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,680
Somehow it doesn't fit with torture.

191
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,000
Pretty soon the radio was very very loud.

192
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,040
But it does.

193
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,060
Of course it does.

194
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,160
But I could still hear those sounds.

195
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,300
Because it was always a facade.

196
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,720
The image of America.

197
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,780
And now the facade has finally failed.

198
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,280
Anguish.

199
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,660
Like a burned out clutch.

200
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,580
Screaming.

201
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,200
Screaming.

202
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,160
Or a decayed tooth that breaks open.

203
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:48,740
Horrible.

204
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,100
Horrible.

205
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,980
They both smell bad.

206
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,040
Strange.

207
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,460
Ominous.

208
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,400
Going back to the office in the embassy.

209
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,160
Naturally I was speculating who that possibly could have been.

210
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,000
But the motive that I had in everything that I did.

211
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,600
Was to save the lives of Americans.

212
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,400
Who in some cases were being tortured to death.

213
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,540
That's what I did.

214
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:53,180
That's what I did.

215
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,220
That's what I did.

216
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:53,220


217
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,240

is within the law.

292
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,940
We do not torture.

293
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,900
And therefore, we do not torture.

294
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,420
We do not torture.

295
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,600

We do not torture.

We do not torture.

298
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:40,960
We do not torture.

299
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,020
I think about this every day, every single day.

300
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,540
And I will continue thinking about it.

301
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,160
Is that alright if I call you a piece of work?

302
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,900
Hey Adam, I think about Iraq every day.

303
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,360
Every single day.

304
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,880
I think about this every day, every single day.

305
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,460
And I will continue thinking about it.

306
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,100
Is that alright if I call you a piece of work?

307
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,840
Hey Adam, I think about Iraq every day.

308
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,320
Every single day.

309
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,000
I think about this every day.

310
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,520
Every single day.

311
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,080
And I will continue thinking about it.

312
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:14,580
We are finding terrorists and bringing them to justice.

313
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,680
We are gathering information about where the terrorists may be hiding.

314
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,560
We are trying to disrupt their plots and plans.

315
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,960
Anything we do to that end, to that end is just effort.

316
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,860
Any activity we cannot do can be called a crime.

317
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,280
is within the law.

318
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,760
We do not torture.

319
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,800
And therefore, we work with Congress

320
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,380
to make sure that as we go forward,

321
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,840
we make it possible, more possible,

322
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,020
to do our job.

323
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,160
We are...

324
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,160
We do not torture.

325
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,020
We do not torture.

326
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,280
We do not torture.

327
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,240
We do not torture.

328
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,900
We do not torture.

329
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:50,540
Christianity, like most religions, seeks to suppress normal human mental function with pain and humiliation.

330
00:18:52,540 --> 00:19:00,980
Christianity is, at its core, a death cult organized around the sacrifice of their own God.

331
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:17,920
The highest grossing independent film ever made in the United States, graphically, almost pornographically, catalogs the many potential and supposed tortures of their God.

332
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:30,260
Torture is a natural extension of the fears and desires of pink humanity, and furthermore, a natural extension,

333
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:38,660
of the beliefs of Christianity, of self-sacrifice taken too literally.

334
00:19:38,720 --> 00:20:00,960
It's entirely reasonable that if one's own God was made to torture and die terribly, then why not a heathen, a Mohammedan, a Buddhist, or whatever?

335
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,460
Well, a subgenius.

336
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:13,160
You don't really believe that they are walling the Mexicans out, do you?

337
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:21,140
Oh, you poor, sad, dead, dead, dead little monkey.

338
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:28,840
What do you think the commander in chimp meant when he spoke recently of a third religious awakening?

339
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,960
Which bird?

340
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,880
A burning, of course.

341
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,120
Which burning?

342
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,000
You burning.

343
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,240
But, we've gone into all that before.

344
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,220
You should be well prepared for your terrible, terrible, terribly funny death.

345
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,760
I expect you to be laughing.

346
00:20:51,260 --> 00:21:00,960
And so the Institute is beyond asking the mere simple questions as to why monkeys can't recognize their parents.

347
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,620
And why do they have their own reflection?

348
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:12,940
And why they are surprised when adherents of the state death cult attempt to put their real beliefs into practice.

349
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:22,820
One cannot read the Gospels without getting the distinct impression that Jesus came to die.

350
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:30,380
Mark 8, 31 and he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things,

351
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,860
And they will mock him and scourge him and spit on him and kill him.

352
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,400
Much of the gospel narratives focus upon the death of Christ.

353
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:49,640
And those incidents surrounding the death of Christ sometimes called the passion narratives.

354
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,600
Now normally scourging was a precursor to the crucifixion.

355
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,940
And it was a brutal affair.

356
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,920
In fact, one could even die from it.

357
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:09,020
How do we, as we consider ourselves civilized people, how do we react to things like this?

358
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,540
With horror, with sorrow, and with determination,

359
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:20,660
it reveals the face of an implacable enemy who's willing to violate any norm of civilized behavior.

360
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,760
And it should stiffen our resolve to eliminate them.

361
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,480
And it should also make us understand how tough,

362
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,040
how tough this struggle is going to be.

363
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,600
The scourge itself was made out of wood.

364
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,480
It had a wooden handle with leather thongs.

365
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:44,260
And each, on each end of those leather strips was a sharp piece of bone or lead.

366
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:52,760
And it would lash the flesh, it would tear it into threads, it would look like tattered toilet paper.

367
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,120
Our dog sometimes goes after our toilet rolls.

368
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,920
He pulls them down and he tears them up.

369
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:05,380
And that's what it would have looked, his back raked with this scourge.

370
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:17,260
Sometimes, apparently, gaping wounds were of such size that you could peer in and actually see the vital organ or the end grain.

371
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:24,420
This body, no doubt, was covered with horrible bruises and cuts and wounds.

372
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,920
And don't forget that he had been beaten black and blue.

373
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,700
Black and blue prior to this.

374
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:37,520
Then they began to spit on him and to blindfold him and to beat him.

375
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:46,320
And when I saw the prisoners, the Iraqi prisoners being captured and being blindfolded by the USA Army, I knew it.

376
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,420
And the officers struck him with the palms of their hands.

377
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,300
Well, these are just a few bad apples.

378
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,000
It was verbatim.

379
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,920
What they said.

380
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:58,920


381
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:06,520
What they said about, you know, the torture manuals and those who killed the Jesuits and the church women and El Masote.

382
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,140
And the list simply went on and on.

383
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,740
And that really angered me.

384
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:20,500
But, you know, I must say they're consistent in telling the lies, you know, trying to downplay the evil and the seriousness of all of this.

385
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,580
But it's obvious here when you read through what they do here,

386
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,920
they are beginning to mock him like a cat playing with a cat.

387
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,320
They're bashing him with a half-dead mouth.

388
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,640
Bashing him back and forth like it were a ball of string.

389
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:48,000
It's that sadistic kind of cruelty that gets pleasure out of seeing people hurt and wince when you hit them.

390
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:53,480
I really wish that some one of these, you know, right-wing pundits would just let themselves be waterboarded once.

391
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,920
You know, just on national TV and tell us how that feels.

392
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,540
And then they can call that not torture.

393
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,460
How long it went on, we don't know.

394
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,460
But it must have gone on for a while.

395
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:12,100
Then they struck him or kept on striking him, kept on striking him, kept on striking him.

396
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,840
We could read it this way.

397
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,560
They kept on spitting on him.

398
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,940
They kept on spitting, spitting, spitting, spitting on him.

399
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,120
But don't we see, brethren, how depraved?

400
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,520
How depraved are the hearts of men?

401
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,780
Don't we see here how depraved are the hearts of men?

402
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:42,900
Very few people in the world, especially in modern Western culture, are willing to face who they are.

403
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,260
Well, it is tough, and I think we've been seeing that.

404
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,380
But where do we go from here?

405
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,400
Don't react in a way that makes us behave in the way they do.

406
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,280
Most people view themselves quite positively.

407
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:03,120
Most people have a view of man that is quite flattering.

408
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,700
Man is good, or basically good.

409
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:13,380
And they believe the longer we live on planet Earth, the better we get.

410
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,960
But how do you explain the Jewish Holocaust?

411
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:21,840
How do you explain September 9-11?

412
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:28,880
How do you explain the millions of babies unborn that are aborted every year?

413
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,980
How do you explain all of the sex crimes?

414
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,780
How do you explain all of the murders?

415
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,320
How do you explain the serial killers?

416
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,380
Man does terrible things.

417
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,180
Man has always done terrible things.

418
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,280
And man will always do terrible things.

419
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,820
And if you want simply to look back in history,

420
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:51,820


421
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,620
and time, and see how terrible man is,

422
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,800
look here.

423
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,840
Abuses are inherent to the world.

424
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,440
You cannot have a clean world.

425
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,320
You have to have rapings, killings, torture.

426
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,900
It's impossible. That's the world.

427
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,840
That is the meaning of world.

428
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,560
Is God somehow caught off guard?

429
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,160
No, he sits in the heavens and laughs.

430
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,940
There is no God.

431
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:37,480
All the loudspeakers walk up and say

432
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,620
There is no God.

433
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,940
All the loudspeakers walk up and say

434
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,660
There is no God.

435
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,140
The loudspeakers walk up and say

436
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,440
Christianity is stupid.

437
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,540
Christianity is stupid.

438
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,700
Christianity is stupid.

439
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,780
Christianity is stupid.

440
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,700
Christianity is stupid.

441
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,940
Christianity is stupid.

442
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,680
I am learning to live each day.

443
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,480
It's just one at a time.

444
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,780
I'm trusting in the Lord to make it ever sublime.

445
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,680
I will not put God first in my life.

446
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,640
I will trust in all that I do by accepting his Son, Jesus, to carry me through.

447
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,280
Jesus Christ

448
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,740
Jesus Christ

449
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:16,280
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.

450
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,060
This he has promised, this he will do.

451
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,200
And for Jesus alone can make all things new.

452
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,600
I now trust in Jesus to show me the way to happiness and love throughout the day.

453
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:41,360
With him at my side and his love in my heart, my life is beginning to have a new start.

454
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:57,580
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.

455
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:04,420
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.

456
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:58,000
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.

457
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:04,940
I am now learning how to love and forgive my fellow man as I am learning to live.

458
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:11,140
Learning to live means to accept the Lord by following his powerful dictates and full accord.

459
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,640
This I can do with Jesus at my side.

460
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,460
We now have a love that will never subside.

461
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:28,180
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.

462
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:42,100
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.

463
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:49,700
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.

464
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,420
Rock over London, Rock on Chicago.

465
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,180
The heart of the world is in your hands.

466
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,000
The heartbeat of America.

467
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,500
That's today's Chevrolet.

468
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,360
Yes, with all that Christian love and charity,

469
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,940
it's not hard to understand why some people,

470
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,920
having been told for their entire lifetimes that they were born bad,

471
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,800
and that in all likelihood they will spend all of eternity writhing in pain,

472
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,400
doled out by a loving God.

473
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,320
Well, some of these people get a little cuffed in the head.

474
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,120
And these rebels, as it were,

475
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,180
adopt the binary opposition.

476
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,020
No, no, not of actually enjoying pleasure,

477
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,520
which is a lot harder than it sounds,

478
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:52,360
and incidentally, recent studies indicate that this may only be possible for yetis.

479
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,900
No, these poor, sad, mere human apes.

480
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,160
Adopt the binary opposition.

481
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,140
The binary opposition of enjoying pain.

482
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,700
If we carry this thought to its illogical conclusion,

483
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:12,340
it suggests an afterlife in Christian hell of back rubs, foot rubs, oral sex,

484
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,980
that sort of thing.

485
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:19,480
Sadism, of course, is nothing without masochism.

486
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,220
And so we wind up in a world of young Baptist human ashtrays

487
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,400
and lots of cutters.

488
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,000
Yes.

489
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,300
Surely this is exactly what Jesus had in mind.

490
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,740
Cut me up.

491
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,400
My mind's on fire.

492
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,920
You cannot choose between lust.

493
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,760
Desire between love.

494
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,640
Hate.

495
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,300
Screw up my brain.

496
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,100
Your words mean nothing.

497
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,680
And I suffer the pain.

498
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,560
Cut me up.

499
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,220
My mind's on fire.

500
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,720
You cannot choose between lust.

501
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,500
Desire between love.

502
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,420
Hate.

503
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,080
Screw up my brain.

504
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,880
Your words mean nothing.

505
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,440
And I suffer the pain.

506
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:28,160
Cut me up.

507
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,860
Why couldn't I see?

508
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,240
My blood splattered body was in ecstasy.

509
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,320
Sex.

510
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,160
Pain.

511
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:35,940
Pain.

512
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,060
Pleasure.

513
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,380
Eternal torture.

514
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,080
Lasts forever.

515
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,920
Crucify me.

516
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,700
Why couldn't I see?

517
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,960
My blood splattered body was in ecstasy.

518
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,000
Sex.

519
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,000
Pain.

520
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:49,740
Pain.

521
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,760
Pleasure.

522
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,160
Eternal torture.

523
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,960
Lasts forever.

524
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,880
Cut me up.

525
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,540
And lead me to bleed.

526
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,140
For the rest of my life.

527
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,140


528
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,140


529
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,140


530
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,140


531
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,140


532
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,140


533
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,220
Come closer to me.

534
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,960
It's you that I need.

535
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,700
Decide what you want.

536
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,420
Give it to me.

537
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,600
My body is yearning and it's agony.

538
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,520
Penetrate me.

539
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,360
I'm invaded.

540
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,620
Your rite of pathage leaves.

541
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,120
Medegraded.

542
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,180
Stimulated.

543
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,120
Passion I have to endure.

544
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,420
Ritual.

545
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,140
Pleasure.

546
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,660
There is no cure.

547
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,080
Welcome to the torture chamber.

548
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,140
Set the sign above.

549
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,040
The entrance.

550
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,620
Left in as he chases you by the hand.

551
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,640
Looking like a man.

552
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,400
Naked savage.

553
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,640
Inside you consents.

554
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,340
The anguish.

555
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,200
Theater of pain.

556
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,260
Has just begun.

557
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,980
Mr. Torture is pain.

558
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,840
With his whips and his chains.

559
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,580
He knows just what to say.

560
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,120
Mr. Torture.

561
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,040
If you're feeling alone.

562
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,000
Then just pick up your phone.

563
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,880
I want it.

564
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,760
Oh oh oh.

565
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,080
Mr. Torture.

566
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,140
Mr. Torture.

567
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,200
Mr. Torture.

568
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,100
Is pain.

569
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,460
All this.

570
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,000
Desire.

571
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,740
Unlimited.

572
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,820
For his special bread.

573
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,640
A sinning.

574
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,600
So that there is heat.

575
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,060
To blow your mind.

576
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,300
You can't catch him off.

577
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:15,940
His website.

578
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,620
Has a legend.

579
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,700
Every witness.

580
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,600
Time and torture soon.

581
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,000
Coming your way.

582
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,960
Mr. Torture.

583
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,380
Is pain.

584
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,380
To let out.

585
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,300
Slice his pain.

586
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,140
He knows just what to say.

587
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,460
Mr. Torture.

588
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,140
Mr. Torture.

589
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,140


590
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,140


591
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,140


592
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,140


593
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,140


594
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,140


595
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,140


596
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,140


597
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,600
If you're feeling alone.

598
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,520
Then just pick up your phone.

599
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,360
I want it.

600
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,140
Oh oh oh.

601
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,580
Mr. Torture.

602
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,720
Mr. Torture.

603
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,540
Is pain.

604
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,940
Oh oh oh.

605
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,460
He knows just what to say.

606
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,140
All this.

607
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:51,840
Discartapak.

608
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,020
He knows just what to say.

609
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,020


610
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,020


611
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,020


612
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,020
Dinno ist bata.

613
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:54,840
Songs werden beschaires.

614
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:55,580

615
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:55,580

00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:55,580


617
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,460

Aup,

621
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,300
The money, the pleasure, the fear you scream

622
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,740
Mr. Torture is pain

623
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,720
With his whips and his chains

624
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,920
He knows you're from the club, Mr. Torture

625
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,880
If you're feeling alone

626
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,820
It's just me, got no phone

627
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,480
Don't want it, don't want no

628
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,840
Mr. Torture

629
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,980
Mr. Torture

630
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,760
Mr. Torture

631
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,900
Mr. Pain

632
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,460
Crucify me, why couldn't I see

633
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,860
My blood splattered body was in ecstasy

634
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:37,380
Sex, pain, pain, pleasure

635
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,720
Eternal torture lasts forever

636
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,280
Crucify me, why couldn't I see

637
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,620
My blood splattered body was in ecstasy

638
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:51,200
Sex, pain, pain, pleasure

639
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,420
Eternal torture lasts forever

640
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,480
Crucify me, why couldn't I see

641
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:20,760
My blood splattered body was in ecstasy

642
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,780
He tortures me with sadistic pleasure

643
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,440
It's just another

644
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,940
Another memory to treasure your lust for blood

645
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:36,340
Eternal pain, my mutilation that puts you to shame

646
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,420
Crucify me, why couldn't I see?

647
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,900
My blood splattered body was in ecstasy

648
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,360
Sex, pain, pain, pleasure

649
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,700
Eternal torture lasts forever

650
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,280
Crucify me, why couldn't I see?

651
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,660
My blood splattered body was in ecstasy

652
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,120
Sex, pain, pain, pleasure

653
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,560
Eternal torture lasts forever

654
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,260
My dog's singing, sharing travel

655
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:34,720
No work number, referee said

656
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,840
Won't you blow it, since you built it

657
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,220
Try to keep clean, cause the rent is due

658
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:45,160
And the water keeps tapping my head

659
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,100
The water keeps tapping my head

660
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,960
Since it's never your turn

661
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,360
I'll speak for you

662
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,440
Keep my hangnail, bloody brother

663
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,380
Wearing, tearing, sold I'm bare

664
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:13,160
If I don't make it, what's the use?

665
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,080
The water keeps tapping my head

666
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,340
The water keeps tapping my head

667
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:23,340


668
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:23,340


669
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:23,720
The water keeps tapping my head

670
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:32,820
Well, at least I lived through Chinese torture

671
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:40,740
At least I lived through Chinese torture

672
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,500
Without your hand, all right

673
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,360
With someone I didn't trust

674
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,420
Without your hand, without your blood

675
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:18,420


676
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:18,420


677
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:18,420


678
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,020
Could you finally understand?

679
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,020


680
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,940
After you left for work, where did you go?

681
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:30,980
At least I lived through Chinese torture

682
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,600
Things got mixed up under the bridge

683
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,700
And remember

684
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,060
Sound was used for centuries as a method of torture

685
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,480
Place someone's head inside of a bell

686
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,400
And ring it

687
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,140
And eventually

688
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,840
They'll go insane

689
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,100
And eventually

690
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,600
They'll go insane

691
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,020
They'll go insane

692
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,540
They'll go insane

693
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,920
And eventually

694
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,020
You're tired

695
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,240
You're beaten down

696
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,560
You're irritable

697
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,700
Your mental and physical health

698
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,800
Are suffering

699
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,140
You're a failure

700
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,560
You're a failure

701
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,600
You're a failure

702
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,280
You're a failure

703
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:55,760
You're a failure

704
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,440
You're a failure

705
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:04,040

L&I

717

Put together the Torture Collage

718
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,660
WhatHaveYa.com

719
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,040
All spelled out there

720
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,420
Put together

721
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,380
Rape and Torture

722
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,100
With President Bush's voice

723
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,460
Then

724
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,300
The Torture Cut-Up

725
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,420
A cut-up of House Resolution

726
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,860
Number 6166

727
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,080
The Detainee Law

728
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,300
Steve Craig

729
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,080
Manipulated our president

730
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,180
Into torture

731
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,860
Then the Jesus Torture Sermon

732
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,460
Which was mostly actually in context

733
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,980
An acapella version

734
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,860
Of Christianity is Stupid

735
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,980

FM

738
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,380
Just like Torture

739
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,960
Is All in Your Head

740
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,240
Athame

741
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,500
Got off on Eternal Torture

742
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,580
Hello Ween

743
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,280
Performed a compressed

744
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,260
As much as I possibly could

745
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,040
Version of Mr. Torture

746
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,540
And Johnny Society

747
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,640
Sang about Chinese Torture

748
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,840
And then Negative Land again

749
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,660
With Methods of Torture

750
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,780
We'll close out this evening

751
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,740
With a few

752
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,520
Relevant words

753
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,820
From former President

754
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,200
General Dwight David Eisenhower

755
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,840
A man who knew

756
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,300
About atrocity

757
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,680
And then Negative Land

758
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,280
Will do something terrible

759
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,280
To a monkey

760
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,560
Because we don't just torture each other

761
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,760
We now stand

762
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,200
Ten years past the midpoint of a century

763
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,620
That has witnessed

764
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,140
Four major wars among great nations

765
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,600
Three of these

766
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,100
Involved our own country

767
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,580
And the world

768
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,940
Despite these holocausts

769
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,460
America is today

770
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,960
The strongest

771
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,340
The most influential

772
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:26,140
And most productive nation in the world

773
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,320
Understandably proud of this preeminence

774
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,380
We yet realize

775
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,620
That America's leadership and prestige depend

776
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:38,380
Not merely upon our unmatched material progress

777
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,740
Riches and military strength

778
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,720
But on how we use our power

779
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,360
In the interest of world peace

780
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:46,720
Thank you for watching!

781
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,900
And human betterment

782
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,300
And human betterment

783
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,820
Christ sees there will continue to be

784
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,640
In meeting them

785
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,640
Whether foreign or domestic

786
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,940
Great or small

787
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,140
There is a recurring temptation

788
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,940
To feel that some spectacular and costly action

789
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,240
Could become the miraculous solution

790
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,780
To all current difficulties

791
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,820
A huge increase in newer elements

792
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:11,600
Of our defenses

793
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,800
Development of unrealistic programs

794
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,520
To cure every ill in agriculture

795
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:16,720
And to create a new world

796
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:16,720


797
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:16,720


798
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:16,720


799
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:16,720


800
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:16,720


801
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:16,720


802
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:16,720


803
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:16,720


804
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:16,720


805
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:16,720


806
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,940
A dramatic expansion in basic and applied research

807
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,960
These and many other possibilities

808
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,820
Each possibly promising in itself

809
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,620
May be suggested as the only way

810
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,000
To the road we wish to travel

811
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:36,920
But each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration

812
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,920
The need to maintain balance

813
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,100
In and among national programs

814
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,700
A vital element in keeping the world safe and sound

815
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,660
Does not make it it even more salvageable

816
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,180
One may warn and the other must maybe wait

817
00:46:51,180 --> 00:47:00,420
So our military assistance

818
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,340
offerings innumerable

819
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:06,980
With this type of means

820
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,300
The possibility of modern military intelligence

821
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:08,300


822
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,720
Is to take over

823
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:10,720


824
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:10,720


825
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:10,720


826
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:10,720


827
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:10,720


828
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:10,720


829
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,920
Through the command of the mandarin

830
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,820
Using weapon technology

831
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,420
At Ai-N firms

832
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:16,680
Under dunking

833
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,060
no armaments industry.

834
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,880
American makers of plowshares could,

835
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,280
with time and as required,

836
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,180
make swords as weapons.

837
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,880
But we can no longer risk

838
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,480
emergency improvisation

839
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,720
of national defense.

840
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,720
We have been compelled to create

841
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,540
a permanent armaments industry

842
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,900
of vast proportions.

843
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:39,920
Added to this,

844
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,600
three and a half million men and women

845
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,380
are directly engaged

846
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,900
in the defense establishment.

847
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,300
We annually spend

848
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,500
on military security alone

849
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,640
more than the net income

850
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,880
of all United States corporations.

851
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,380
Now this conjunction

852
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,380
of an immense military establishment

853
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,180
and a large arms industry

854
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,880
is new in the American experience.

855
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,420
The total influence,

856
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,500
economic, political,

857
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:09,920
even spiritual,

858
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,040
is felt in every city,

859
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,500
every state house,

860
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,320
every office of the federal government.

861
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,780
We recognize the imperative need

862
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,460
for this development.

863
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,460
Yet we must not fail to comprehend

864
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,380
its grave implications.

865
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:28,120
Our toil, resources, and livelihood

866
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,100
are all involved.

867
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,040
So is the very structure of our society.

868
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,980
In the councils of government,

869
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,620
we must guard against

870
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,080
the acquisition of unwarranted influence,

871
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,060
whether sought or unsought,

872
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,860
by the military-industrial complex.

873
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,660
The potential for the disaster

874
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:47,300
is the disastrous rise

875
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,960
of misplaced power to exist

876
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,360
and will persist.

877
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,180
We must never let the weight

878
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,040
of this combination

879
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,360
endanger our liberties

880
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,900
or democratic processes.

881
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,700
Today the solitary inventor,

882
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,820
tinkering in his shop,

883
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,840
has been overshadowed

884
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,240
by task forces of science,

885
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,360
in laboratories,

886
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,120
and testing fields.

887
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,220
In the same fashion,

888
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,160
the free university

889
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:13,880
of diversity,

890
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,480
historically the fountainhead

891
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:16,660
of the world's

892
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:16,660


893
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:16,660


894
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:16,660


895
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:16,660


896
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:16,660


897
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:16,660


898
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:16,660


899
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:16,660


900
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:16,660


901
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:16,740
most prestigious university,

902
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:16,740


903
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:16,740


904
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:16,740


905
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:16,740


906
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:16,740


907
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,800
free ideas and scientific discovery,

908
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,140
has experienced a revolution

909
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,520
in the conduct of research,

910
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,760
partly because of the huge costs

911
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,220
involved,

912
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,660
a government contract

913
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,240
has become virtually

914
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,600
a substitute

915
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,040
for intellectual curiosity.

916
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,020
For every old blackboard,

917
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,240
there are now hundreds

918
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,480
of new electronic computers.

919
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,820
The prospect of domination

920
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,160
of the nation's scholars

921
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,560
drives federal employment

922
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:46,640
to the brink of a crisis.

923
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:46,640


924
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:46,640


925
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:46,640


926
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:46,640


927
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:46,640


928
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:46,640


929
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:46,640


930
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,220
The power of money

931
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:50,980
is ever present

932
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:52,640
and is gravely

933
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,760
to be regarded.

934
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,300
Yet in holding scientific research

935
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,880
and discovery in respect,

936
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,060
as we should,

937
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,440
we must also be alert

938
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,740
to the equal and opposite danger

939
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,380
that public policy

940
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,460
could itself

941
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,000
become the capital

942
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,300
of the scientific,

943
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,940
technological elite.

944
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,400
As we peer into society's future,

945
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:16,620
we must be aware

946
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:16,620


947
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:16,620


948
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:16,620


949
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:16,620


950
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:16,620


951
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:16,620


952
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:16,620


953
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:16,620


954
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:16,620


955
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:16,620


956
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:16,620


957
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:16,620


958
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:16,620


959
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:16,620


960
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,300
that we,

961
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,540
you and I,

962
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,000
and our government,

963
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,960
must avoid the impulse

964
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,240
to live only for today,

965
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,640
plundering for our own ease

966
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,200
and convenience

967
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,060
the precious resources

968
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:29,640
of tomorrow.

969
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,320
We cannot mortgage

970
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,920
the material assets

971
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,960
of our grandchildren

972
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,020
without risking the loss

973
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,300
also of their political

974
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,560
and spiritual heritage.

975
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,220
We want democracy

976
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,020
to survive

977
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,260
for all generations

978
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:44,900
to come,

979
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,560
not to become

980
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:46,620
a burden

981
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:46,620


982
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:46,620


983
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:46,620


984
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:46,620


985
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:46,620


986
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:46,620


987
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:46,620


988
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:46,620


989
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:46,620


990
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,880
on the insolvent phantom

991
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,720
of tomorrow.

992
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,700
And now once again

993
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,820
it's time for

994
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:58,640
Wildlife Tonight.

995
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,680
Dr. Oslo Norway here

996
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,260
with a shocking remote

997
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,640
from Wildlife Tonight.

998
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,220
Right now we are going live

999
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:12,600
to Wildlife Tonight's

1000
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,140
Buck Logic

1001
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,260
over at the San Francisco Zoo

1002
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,620
where Buck is going to

1003
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:16,620


1004
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,200
demonstrate why there never

1005
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,700
was any Adam or Eve.

1006
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,860
Buck, are you there?

1007
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,660
Yes, thank you, Oslo.

1008
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,440
This is Buck Logic

1009
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,080
with Wildlife Tonight.

1010
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,100
And where could you find

1011
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,360
more wildlife tonight

1012
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,220
than the San Francisco Zoo?

1013
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,080
We're here in the zoo's

1014
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,360
new Stinky Monkey House,

1015
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,620
a generous endowment

1016
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,520
from the Simien M.

1017
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,160
Stinky Estate,

1018
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,220
makers of stinky

1019
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:39,640
shoe stretchers.

1020
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,480
And here with me is Chuck,

1021
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,700
the night shift monkey man

1022
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,280
at the San Francisco Zoo.

1023
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:46,620
Is that right, Buck?

1024
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,760
Yes, something like that.

1025
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,180
Well, we appreciate you

1026
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,660
letting us in after hours

1027
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:52,500
to do this, Chuck.

1028
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,480
And if you're ready now,

1029
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,400
please bring in the monkey.

1030
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,860
Are you sure about that?

1031
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,420
That's my last question.

1032
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,520
Yes, it's quite all right.

1033
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,880
And here he comes

1034
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,400
through the ironclad door

1035
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,640
with a chimpanzee.

1036
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,240
We'll do it right on the table

1037
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:09,860
there, Chuck.

1038
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:10,620
Careful.

1039
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,920
Get him up against

1040
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,600
the armature.

1041
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,000
Tie those straps securely.

1042
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,620
They can take your place.

1043
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:17,340
And he's got his face right off.

1044
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,200
He's doing the best he can.

1045
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:18,700
Yeah, I'm getting it.

1046
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,100
And so what we're going to do

1047
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,820
right here on Wow Life tonight

1048
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,240
is shave all the hair off this

1049
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,940
chimp from face to feet.

1050
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,560
Now Chuck is going to spray

1051
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,140
the restrained chimp all over

1052
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:36,500
with Gillette's New Tough Guy

1053
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,400
shaving gel.

1054
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,840
And we're going to begin

1055
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,840
shaving this chimpanzee's

1056
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,640
entire body clean of all hair.

1057
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,860
And I believe this is another

1058
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:51,740
exclusive for Wow Life tonight.

1059
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,260
And it's all in your head, FM.

1060
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,980
Although I must confess,

1061
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,620
I don't see why no one

1062
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:57,440
has done this before.

1063
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,120
And now Chuck...

1064
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,180
Ow, not too fast there, Chuck.

1065
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,060
That's really good.

1066
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,260
This is not an easy job.

1067
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,800
Chuck is rapidly shaving

1068
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,980
the chimp's body now.

1069
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,900
And there seems to be

1070
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,840
a little discomfort.

1071
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,480
But come on, we've all been shaved.

1072
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,920
It doesn't actually hurt that much.

1073
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,280
Now we're seeing some real skin here.

1074
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,260
We're doing this full body monkey makeover

1075
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,800
for the first time anywhere

1076
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,820
because I'll bet none of you listening out there

1077
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,820
have ever seen a shaved monkey

1078
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:30,960
before in your life.

1079
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,920
Think about it.

1080
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,140
I'll bet never before.

1081
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,020
And you know what?

1082
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,920
There's an important reason

1083
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,220
why you've never seen

1084
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,500
a shaved monkey before.

1085
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,540
And it does not include

1086
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,580
protecting the dignity of the animal.

1087
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,820
That's just an excuse.

1088
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,600
And it's not just a

1089
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:46,600


1090
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:46,600


1091
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:46,600


1092
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,160
It's a real shame.

1093
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:47,380
And it's a real shame

1094
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:47,520
that you're not allowed to see it.

1095
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,560
No, no, you have never been allowed

1096
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,380
to see it because it's a shocking,

1097
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,420
almost unbearable testament

1098
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,400
to our own intimate link

1099
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,780
with animal evolution.

1100
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,700
You know, I could lose my top over this.

1101
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,920
Oh, chimp appears very angry.

1102
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,080
The chimp is strapped in a skinny position

1103
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,760
to a sort of a crucifix-style armature

1104
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,560
on the table.

1105
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,600
Trembling a little under the restraints.

1106
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:15,620
Be gentle, Chuck.

1107
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:16,580
I'm having a little bit of a

1108
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:16,580


1109
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:16,580


1110
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:16,580


1111
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:16,580


1112
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:16,580


1113
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,780
I'm having a little trouble with this.

1114
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:18,060
Poor thing.

1115
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:18,740
I think I'm going to have to

1116
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:19,800
switch to something else here.

1117
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,920
And now Chuck is struggling

1118
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,780
to shave the feet and toes.

1119
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,420
What's his name, Chuck?

1120
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,620
This is a girl.

1121
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:30,740
We call her Cherry.

1122
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:31,480
Cherry.

1123
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:31,940
Wow.

1124
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,080
Cute breasts.

1125
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,720
Be sure to get all around

1126
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,800
her private parts, too.

1127
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,600
I want a completely shaved monkey.

1128
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,340
I'm done doing it.

1129
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,000
Wow.

1130
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,940
That makes her very angry.

1131
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:44,280
Yeah.

1132
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,580
She doesn't like that at all.

1133
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:53,200
You know, we're sorry we have to put this innocent chimp through this,

1134
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:57,580
but it's simply necessary to create a greater good for all of us.

1135
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,060
Sort of like testing cosmetics on them.

1136
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:06,120
Chuck is using a Jumbo Gillette Pro-Tech Tough Guy razor system on Cherry.

1137
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,020
And perhaps it should have been a Lady Pro-Tech,

1138
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,400
but it seems to be working just great anyway.

1139
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,780
From first shave to last,

1140
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,560
always a smooth shave with Gillette.

1141
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,500
And come to think of it,

1142
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,240
in Cherry's case,

1143
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,840
this probably is her first and last shave.

1144
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,300
But when this chimp is entirely shaved,

1145
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,700
everyone will see for the first time

1146
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,180
why we are truly all brothers

1147
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:33,400
to this sister under the skin.

1148
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,380
And now Chuck is finishing off her face and neck.

1149
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,680
Just leave a head of hair like us, that's all.

1150
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,440
No mustache, it's a girl.

1151
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,900
Great, great, that's it.

1152
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,440
And, uh,

1153
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,340
here comes the hose.

1154
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,560
Rinsing her all off now.

1155
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,680
And there.

1156
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,940
There you have it.

1157
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,160
Look at that.

1158
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,760
Release the straps, Chuck.

1159
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:04,640
Amazing.

1160
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,240
Creepy, but amazing.

1161
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,120
Turn her around, Chuck.

1162
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,560
Turn her around.

1163
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,240
Keep turning her, Chuck.

1164
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:17,640
That's it.

1165
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,360
She looks just like my kid.

1166
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,580
Now, I was gonna say,

1167
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,780
I realized this in rehearsal.

1168
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,140
Once you see a monkey's full frontal bare skin anatomy,

1169
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:30,240
something we have never been allowed to see before.

1170
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,680
It's so strangely like our own bodies,

1171
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,120
just different proportions in the parts,

1172
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,600
but all the same skeletal and muscular structures.

1173
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,040
It's like an organic revelation.

1174
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,420
All right, Chuck, you can go.

1175
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1176
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1177
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1178
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1179
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1180
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1181
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1182
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1183
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1184
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1185
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1186
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1187
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1188
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1189
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1190
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1191
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1192
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,420


1193
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,860
And remove the shaved chimp.

1194
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,580
A wonderfully telling demonstration.

1195
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,360
Thank you.

1196
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,580
Thank you, Chuck.

1197
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,120
And, uh,

1198
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,280
don't worry about Cherry, folks.

1199
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,280
We have a little skirt and sweater for her.

1200
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:04,000
And, uh,

1201
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:04,280
uh,

1202
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:04,680
Cherry,

1203
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:07,400
here's a banana for being so good.

1204
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:08,580
Well,

1205
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,800
what can anyone say?

1206
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,280
Seeing is truly believing.

1207
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,840
A wildlife tonight,

1208
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:15,400
revered by the world,

1209
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1210
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1211
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1212
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1213
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1214
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1215
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1216
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1217
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1218
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1219
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1220
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,400


1221
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,800
a revelation.

1222
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,320
And, for God's sakes,

1223
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,300
what more need we be?

1224
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,040
So, that's it.

1225
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,740
Nature's clock is ticking.

1226
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,120
Thanks to Cherry the Chimp,

1227
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,180
Chuck the Monkey Man,

1228
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,620
and the Gillette Shaving Corporation.

1229
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,700
Now, on your face with the Pro-Tech Maximus II Jet Shave System.

1230
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,540
I'm Buck Logic.

1231
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,920
Now, back to Oslo, Norway's brain,

1232
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:36,060
at It's All in Your Head FM.

1233
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,220
That's it for wildlife tonight.

1234
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,920
Thank you, Buck and Chuck,

1235
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,100
and good luck.

1236
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,380
Wildlife tonight.

1237
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:45,380


1238
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:45,380


1239
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:45,380


1240
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:45,380


1241
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:45,380


1242
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:45,380


1243
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:45,380


1244
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:45,380


1245
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:45,380


1246
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:45,380


1247
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:45,380


1248
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,920
Wildlife tonight is a syndicated feature of the Simian Stinky Networks.

1249
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,240
B reinforcement.

1250
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:24,240


1251
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:30,040
because waar theain't nobody gonna watch this anymore?

1252
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:34,860
See you tomorrow morning on praнымuk.com.

1253
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:37,000
I prepared a prep the next day,

1254
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:37,000


1255
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:37,000


1256
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:37,000


1257
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:37,080


1258
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:37,080


1259
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:37,080


1260
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:37,080


1261
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:37,180
and I feel so cr dumped to the r하시는 and her,

1262
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:37,640
I don't even know what it's called,

1263
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:37,640


1264
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,360
the��al you said.

1265
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:43,360


1266
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,460
you know who's on the radio.

1267
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:45,360
You want cleaned.

1268
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:45,360


1269
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:45,360


1270
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:45,360


1271
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:45,360


1272
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:45,360


1273
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,260
know by now, the hour of slack

1274
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,440
killed my baby. Every Saturday

1275
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,320
night at midnight right here on

1276
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:52,620
WREK Atlanta.

1277
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:55,020
Except that this probably isn't WREK Atlanta

1278
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,100
unless it is. We're running a show from

1279
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,120
mighty WREK tonight in lieu of Hour of Slack.

1280

The Lymphnode Institute Torture Show. Praise

1281
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,220

00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,040
Susie the Flusy Show and the Puzzling Evidence Show

1284
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,100

00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:11,000
page at subgenius.com.

1286
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,180
If you choose to look

1287
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,180
further into it, you may do so.

1288
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:17,140

1289

1290
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:19,420
