00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Thank you for joining us tonight. Now, I just heard in the report that

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,740
The Subgenius Hour of Slack

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,400
That is correct.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,020
To engage in this attack. That's correct.

5
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,660
Ah, yes, dear friends, there are several

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,760
Subgenius radio shows besides the Hour of Slack.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,000
The Puzzling Evidence Show and Bob's Slack

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,160
Time Funhouse have been on the air for as long or longer

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,080
And there have been other spin-offs that went extinct.

10
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,160
But there's now a new, powerful podcast

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,680
One that erupted like a pustule

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,500
Out of the Thorazine Urine Pod Crust comedy

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,080
Non-true called

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,100
Time for the Show!

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,740
Oh, the latest incarnations have been better recorded.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,060
And had less cussing than earlier ones.

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:05,340
And episode number 102 or 102 or 102 or something

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,520
Had me as a guest.

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,500
So I decided to just run that into the same thing pretty much as is.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,860
You can hear Time for the Show at

21
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,260
Timeforthewebsite.com

22
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,500
Or subgeniuses.com

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,980
Or hypercubelaboratory.com

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,480
I bet you can spell that yourself.

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,660
Hypercubelaboratory.com

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,800
Or look at the Hour of Slack radio section of subgenius.com

27
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,300
Anyway, the purveyors of Time for the Show so far have been

28
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:49,320
Reverend Fid Chulik, Dr. Argus Fox, and the ever insecure Reverend Pease.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,740
All of them heard on this very show, Hour of Slack, on many recordings from recent X-Day.

30
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,420
Praise Bob!

31
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,000
And now it's time for Time for the Show.

32
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,640
No muss, no fuss, no spill

33
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,120
You tired of kitchen drudgery

34
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,240
Everything must go

35
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,440
Going out of business

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,160
Going out of business

37
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,900
Going out of business

38
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,960
50% off original retail price

39
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,180
Skip the middle man

40
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,720
Don't settle for less

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,820
How do we do it?

42
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,440
How do we do it?

43
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,180
All you want

44
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,900
Going out of business

45
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,980
Time for the show

46
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,560
Time for the show

47
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:11,820
Time for the show

48
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,980
Tonight, on Time for the Show,

49
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:45,560
special guest, Reverend Pease, Fid Julie, and some other guy.

50
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,800
No! It's Reverend Ivan Stang from the Church of the Subgenius.

51
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,800
Will he make it here on Time for the Show?

52
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:31,020
Time for the Show.

53
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,600
The YouTube Laboratory.

54
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,580
And here are your hosts, Reverend Pease and Fid Julie, on Time for the Show.

55
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,560
Welcome, guys.

56
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,400
Time for the Show!

57
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,740
Boo! Time for the Show sucks!

58
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,940
It's my least favorite part.

59
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,740
Don't we have a special guest tonight?

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,560
We do have a special guest live from the post office.

61
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:08,900
It's Reverend Ivan Stang from the Church of the Subgenius.

62
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,780
Welcome to Time for the Show.

63
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

64
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,420
Repent. Quit your job. Slack off.

65
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,360
Okay, can I go home now?

66
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,980
No one's going to really believe it's you if you just phone.

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,980
Don't untie him yet.

68
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,540
The check doesn't clear until the clock rolls over, so you might as well, you know.

69
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,820
That is fact.

70
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,920
Well, where's Dr. Shoggoth?

71
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,600
I was expecting him to be here.

72
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Oh, wow.

73
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,320
Wow.

74
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,060
He goes right for your heart.

75
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,140
Right at the beginning of the show, he goes right for the...

76
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:52,340
It's like there's a giant bleeding wound in the shape of my inner hamburger.

77
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,900
Oh, it smells good, though.

78
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:57,840
Juicy.

79
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,180
Succulent.

80
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,540
I didn't know you were hip to such church gossip.

81
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,660
Can I get a closer look at that wound?

82
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,620
Isn't all hamburger technically inner?

83
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,460
Hamburger?

84
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,740
In what sense, Finn?

85
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,080
Until it's on the outside.

86
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,560
Oh, well, it all comes from the inside, though.

87
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
We're all asking the big questions here tonight.

88
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,240
Where's hamburger come from originally?

89
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,280
Well, that's why we have an expert.

90
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,260
We have the guy...

91
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,420
Hamburgers come from cows.

92
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,120
Those are those rectangular things that you also get milk from the store.

93
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,600
The little cardboard boxes.

94
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,880
Or plastic jugs.

95
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,060
Isn't it?

96
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,140
Those are cows.

97
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,720
Wonderful how nature packages everything so perfectly.

98
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,800
How do the cows know what dairy they work for, though, when they put out the little carton?

99
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,900
How do they know how to print it with their teeth?

100
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,020
They've been genetically modified.

101
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,580
They make love to the CEO.

102
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,520
And that's how the cartons come out that way.

103
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,720
Oh, I guess it's a combination of both those answers if you think about it.

104
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,280
It's genetical, peas.

105
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,720
Yeah, man.

106
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:10,860
Genetical.

107
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:12,860
Scientifical.

108
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,460
I've got a pair of geneticals for you.

109
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,180
You can't say that on the radio.

110
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,560
I have one genetical.

111
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,900
I think that you could say that on the radio.

112
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,760
I've got a genetical for you.

113
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,060
Yeah.

114
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,520
I'll show you guys that.

115
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,220
I don't want to see it.

116
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,420
That's right.

117
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,820
On time for the show, we're working with an odd number tonight, everybody.

118
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,660
What is that odd number?

119
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:39,780
Seven.

120
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,720
Seven.

121
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,480
That is actually a pretty good number.

122
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
It's seven on episode 11.

123
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,880
Hey.

124
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,660
So, yeah, this is the Luck Plane show.

125
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,780
The Luck Plane show.

126
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,720
7-11 was an inside job.

127
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,240
It's the Luck Plane show when it took us 10 minutes to start the show tonight.

128
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,960
So, I blame Ivan Stang for that, though.

129
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,060
We can.

130
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,420
We can.

131
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,840
You know, he didn't show up for his.

132
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,600
He wasn't in the green room.

133
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,080
You know, he was being all dramatic.

134
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,780
Well, there was some drama.

135
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,740
The audience needs to know that we had planned an extravaganza.

136
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:25,680
It's been six months of intensive segment writing done by me, Pease.

137
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,440
As you know, I'm the segment writer.

138
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,800
I don't have any editing credits or anything like that, like theater artists.

139
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,660
But regardless of that, we had a whole spectacular extravaganza.

140
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,960
At the last minute, Ivan Stang says, oh, I can't do it.

141
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,140
I can't do it, guys.

142
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,580
I forget what his excuse was.

143
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,420
He was insecure.

144
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,260
He found something else to do.

145
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,320
Found something else better to do.

146
00:08:48,660 --> 00:09:00,480
Every Macintosh or Apple product had become suddenly horribly vulnerable to terrible pirates and viruses just overnight.

147
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,300
Suddenly.

148
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,500
So, we all had to download this.

149
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,460
Well, that's what you paid for that quality machinery for.

150
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,080
No, it's actually.

151
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:08,940
He's actually.

152
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,020
The listeners are hearing me adjusting my microphone mic filter.

153
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,920
But nonetheless, so we had to write from scratch.

154
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:30,080
And for those of you not in professional radio, like Fidjuli and Argus Q Fox, Ivan Stang and myself, the pre-show activity, the writing of a show is about, like I said, a seven-month process.

155
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,000
It goes through many phases and faucets.

156
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,420
So, to throw one out with 15 minutes, you know, 35 minutes warning.

157
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,740
Well, you know.

158
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,180
This is.

159
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,260
We had a really probably a better show than what you're going to get now.

160
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,280
Because at the last minute, again, Ivan Stang says, oh, I can do it now.

161
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,440
So, we had to throw out all of the good show that we had lined up for you.

162
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,940
That we did spontaneously.

163
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,920
And going back to the old, here's Ivan Stang show.

164
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,060
Oh, come on.

165
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,560
You're trying to blame everything on me.

166
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,900
It was the censorship board.

167
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,700
You know, the censorship board.

168
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,100
They're not going to let anything out until they approve it.

169
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,560
Well, this is on a Canadian.

170
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,380
Canadian radio.

171
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,420
So, we don't have censors.

172
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,920
It's not that they censor us.

173
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,040
They just ask us politely not to do things.

174
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,880
Boys, could you stop swearing so much, eh?

175
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:19,780
Eh?

176
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,300
Of course we can.

177
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh, God.

178
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,760
Will we?

179
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,940
Yeah, we're on free thing radio.

180
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,860
Canadian radio is very different than American radio.

181
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,920
What about the trailer park boys?

182
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,160
How come they're not on this show?

183
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,660
Yeah, I mean, they're Canadians.

184
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,260
I think we should be able to get any Canadian.

185
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,520
Is like a legally obliged to be on the show.

186
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:41,980
D2 are.

187
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,240
Rick.

188
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,320
We have a Canada is a communist country.

189
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,320
Well, we have, we got the big man here.

190
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,260
We got, uh, we, we got Dr.

191
00:10:50,340 --> 00:11:03,260
Scab and, um, he's gonna, he's gonna open up that Rolodex of his, and he's gonna set us up with a, with an awesome celebrity interview for every week for the rest of the year.

192
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,540
So let's, uh, let's go.

193
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,280
Who we got first.

194
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,000
We can start with A's and work towards.

195
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,400
Z Adam celebrities.

196
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,660
The first one that you got, the one that'll give us the bump.

197
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,500
Our bar.

198
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,880
Hey, there we go.

199
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,320
I'm on the show.

200
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,280
Look at that.

201
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,160
That's convenient.

202
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,620
I'm also in the Rolodex.

203
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,680
Are you in the Rolodex?

204
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,460
The Rolodex of life.

205
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,140
I could be ended there a couple of ways.

206
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,480
Yeah.

207
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,720
So our August Fox, Brad Pitt.

208
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:45,160
Who would see be, uh, shouldn't it be a crunch?

209
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,280
Yeah.

210
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,040
He's a celebrity captain.

211
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,260
Is he really a captain or is that like a honorific, like being a Kentucky Colonel?

212
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,800
Well, he was a captain in the Naval reserve in intelligence unit.

213
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,860
See, he wasn't like riding on the prow of a ship saying fire away at those pirates boys.

214
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,820
He was more like.

215
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:12,100
We need to track down these homosexuals who went AWOL and find out.

216
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,740
Stole our crunch berries.

217
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,680
I thought it.

218
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:14,820
Yeah.

219
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,700
That's what I thought it was.

220
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,400
Cause you like a swashbuckling for crunch berries.

221
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,860
Well, that too, of course.

222
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:31,380
But you know, in, in, in his day job, captain crunch had this, uh, difficult Navy, Naval

223
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,360
intelligence job of having to track down AWOL sailors.

224
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,580
And 90%.

225
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:36,800
Yeah.

226
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:36,800


227
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:36,800


228
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:36,800


229
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,520
And 90% of the time it was because they were in love.

230
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,100
So you're telling me that the science having figures of being a branded official for a

231
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,780
delicious cereal, it's this really tedious day job where he has to track down errant

232
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,980
Naval lovers.

233
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:55,940
Basically.

234
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,580
Yeah.

235
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:56,980
Yeah.

236
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,940
But he developed a lot of sympathy for, you know, he started out.

237
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,200
I feel sorry for him already.

238
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,420
Kind of homophobic guy.

239
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,660
But as he, as he.

240
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,580
Had to interview.

241
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,820
So guys who'd run off, he began to gain sympathy for them.

242
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:22,500
And in fact, uh, I think he became fascinated with, uh, transgender or what you might call

243
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,660
what's the word chicks with dicks.

244
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,340
Captain crunch is actually a really big part of that whole scene.

245
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,620
I don't know if you guys knew that.

246
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,180
I do not know that.

247
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,400
I don't think anybody.

248
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,160
Anybody knew that.

249
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,700
That's why he started the cereal company.

250
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,260
He's in his late eighties.

251
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:51,360
If he's not 90 already, but he's a real big activist for, uh, um, not, not all transgender

252
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,220
rights.

253
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,660
Just the pardon the expression chicks with dicks.

254
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,480
He's really the hot ones.

255
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,380
Well, you know, uh, up to a point.

256
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:06,380


257
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:06,380


258
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,520
Who's going to question.

259
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:15,020
Well, I mean, he worked under general mills and we all know that general mills had a relationship

260
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,880
with Betty Crocker who was based in a battle Creek, Michigan.

261
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:29,040
They were part of that whole CIA, uh, Mocha man, LSD experiment that was going on, uh,

262
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,840
had a different public name.

263
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,900
How do we get in on those tests?

264
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,380
So, uh, yeah.

265
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:36,380


266
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,620
Yeah.

267
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:43,040
It's all part of the Kennedy assassination and all of it's just such a huge can of worms.

268
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,140
It's such a massive, who cares at this point?

269
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,880
Well, you're a Texas man.

270
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,360
I heard Kennedy wasn't assassinated.

271
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,220
He just ducked and then played dead.

272
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,740
So he could get out of the whole deal.

273
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,880
Well, isn't that interesting?

274
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:04,140
It sounds sort of funny to say that, but as a matter of fact, that is precisely what happened

275
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,560
with the help of Jr.

276
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,000
Bob.

277
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,360
Yeah.

278
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,720
Kennedy was miserable.

279
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,320
He needed slack.

280
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:17,940
Bob got it, uh, fake the whole assassination deal and got him a job as a taxi driver in

281
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,540
Argentina.

282
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,620
And if you don't believe me, read the fine print in book of the sub genius.

283
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:33,840
And the bullet that was fired was actually fashioned into a false tooth that found its

284
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,640
way into the lower gum.

285
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,720
The gum of Donald J. Trump.

286
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,480
That's how he inherited his power.

287
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,320
No bullet at all.

288
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,400
There's just a loud guy clapping real, real, you know, bang.

289
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:57,480
It had to go into Trump's face when he was about 10 years old or something.

290
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,340
Well, no, it didn't immediately go into his face, but through a series of, uh, made for

291
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:13,860
TV quality level, um, happenings and, uh, hijinks, it found its way over the course

292
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,880
of time into his mouth.

293
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,920
Oh, so it probably didn't happen until the late eighties or nineties when it got into

294
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,340
his mouth.

295
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,740
So that bullet was bouncing.

296
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:28,500
Their tooth bullet was bouncing around after it went through John Connolly's wrist and

297
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,620
Kennedy's brain three times.

298
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,120
It bounced around the United States until it ended up inserting itself into the jaw

299
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:44,220
of Donald Trump, age 12 at the, uh, reform school where his parents had said.

300
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,760
Hmm.

301
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:45,860


302
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,080
Yeah.

303
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:46,780
Yeah.

304
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,200
It's true.

305
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:47,920
Look it up.

306
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,760
Look it up.

307
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,900
It's on the internet.

308
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:50,920
Google it.

309
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,920
Google it, dude.

310
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,540
It's on the internet now.

311
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,920
It might not have been 10 minutes ago.

312
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:57,380


313
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:57,820
We're live.

314
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,980
We're live.

315
00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,780
I said it.

316
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,520
I wrote it down on a piece of paper and mailed it to myself.

317
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,140
Therefore it's true.

318
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,320
There you go.

319
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,780
Copyright trademark.

320
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,660
You can't copyright.

321
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,720
Did you send a letter to yourself with the whole premise on it?

322
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,440
You got to do that.

323
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,740
We've already talked about that.

324
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,260
Yeah.

325
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,500
And I sent it to myself so I didn't have to use a stamp.

326
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,560
They just put return to sender on it and took it right back to me.

327
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,100
That could be, that could be trouble in court.

328
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,640
Remember not to open it until you're actually in court.

329
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,460
Everybody does that.

330
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,080
Ed Wood did that and look at him.

331
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,200
He's not getting any royalties at all.

332
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,100
Every time they show plan nine from outer space, nothing.

333
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,460
But what's Ed Wood getting any, isn't Ed Wood, you know, passed away for quite a while now.

334
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,560
So he wouldn't be getting anything.

335
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,060
I guess.

336
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,060
I guess the state would, right?

337
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,140
Oh, well, I guess so.

338
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,040
I kind of forgot.

339
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,440
Let me ask you something.

340
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,260
You know, Michael Jackson was broke when he died, but now his estate is worth, you know,

341
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,080
I think billions.

342
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,000
And the same thing with Elvis.

343
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,800
Elvis, you know, he was on hard times.

344
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,740
He died.

345
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,520
All Elvis's family now is super rich.

346
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:10,220
Do you think that your state will rise in value with your untimely death?

347
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,960
That we don't know anything about?

348
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,240
Uh, that's a good question.

349
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,160
That question makes me uncomfortable.

350
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,000
For several obvious reasons.

351
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,380
Don't worry, Sam.

352
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,680
We haven't settled on a plan yet.

353
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,300
I'm just trying to figure out my blind eye.

354
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:38,300
That Dobbs head is worth a million bucks only as long as I'm alive to approve everything.

355
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,900
For the right reasons.

356
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,160
I don't know.

357
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,240
I think I'm a, I'm a.

358
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,300
I think you can write Princess We a personal message.

359
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,460
Oh, go ahead.

360
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,700
I'm sure she'd be flattered.

361
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,160
Well, uh, then she would-

362
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,940
Real actual correspondence with peas.

363
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,940
We'll laugh at her, make fun of you, mock you.

364
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,500
That's true.

365
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,680
She's super good at that.

366
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,460
Then you can get that all the way around peas on the show and off the air.

367
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,160
I think I provide a valuable service to everybody by being that, that conduit for

368
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,660
the mocker.

369
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,300
So does, you know, well, you know, it's like Everest.

370
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,820
If they didn't make punching bags, we'd just have to keep people.

371
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,760
If you guys didn't have a peas, you would have to invent him.

372
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,820
How would you invent a peas?

373
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:32,400
I imagine you would start off with a comedian from the 80s

374
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,140
and then wrap him up in a bunch of joint papers

375
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,180
and then train him to wink his tongue.

376
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,880
Do the kids call them spliffs?

377
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,260
Is a spliff still a technical term?

378
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,160
A spliff is marijuana and tobacco, isn't it?

379
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,180
Is it that specific?

380
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,120
Yeah, that's my take on it.

381
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,520
You just can't bang a spliff?

382
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,800
That's a Jamaican thing?

383
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,540
You can't bang a spliff?

384
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,020
I want to say you can.

385
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,600
Can we say spliff on the radio?

386
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,000
Can you say bone on the radio?

387
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,120
Do you guys call them bones?

388
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,380
You can say spliff as long as you call it splief.

389
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,220
You can say fropstick, man.

390
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,740
Just say fropstick.

391
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,400
Fropstick.

392
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,600
Nobody knows what that means.

393
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,240
The conspiracy will never figure out what we mean by

394
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,340
habifropzepulops or habifralium or habifrelSD

395
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,120
or habifrocaine or any of those code words.

396
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,780
They'll never figure it out.

397
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,000
That's true.

398
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,820
They are slow.

399
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,880
Yeah, so just go for it, man.

400
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,880
We'd also like to make a shout out to anybody listening to the,

401
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,120
at the NSA right now or the CIA or the FBI,

402
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,820
but more likely it's going to be our friends over in Russia.

403
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:55,220
The secret trigger word this week was frop.

404
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,060
In Soviet Russia, it's time for show listens to you.

405
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,600
Hey, P's, what's your actual physical address again?

406
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,260
What is it?

407
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:06,360
What?

408
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,340
What's your actual physical address again?

409
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:09,840
I forgot.

410
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,860
6428 Dobie.

411
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,760
Peak Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada, 8910.

412
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,380
Wait a minute.

413
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,220
We said if we did that, we try and make cobalt level Patreons.

414
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,520
No, no.

415
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,660
The, um, the cobalt level Patreon.

416
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,460
Because that's what the prize is for a cobalt level Patreon.

417
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:30,960
No, no.

418
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,460
That's your actual phone number, P's.

419
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,380
Oh, the phone number.

420
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:34,700
Okay.

421
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,600
Well, the address is good.

422
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:35,960
Yeah.

423
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,000
Yeah.

424
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,860
Didn't you just summon the secret service?

425
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,920
Ah, those guys.

426
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,300
Yeah.

427
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,560
Yeah.

428
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,100
We're swatting P's.

429
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,020
We're going to swat P's live on the radio tonight.

430
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:49,940
Nice.

431
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,280
We're going to tell him that he's a crazed cultist and, uh, totally unhinged.

432
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:08,440
I don't, you know, I have to admit it's occurred to me that if anybody was, uh, you know, a

433
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,460
target for that kind of terrible prank or abuse.

434
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah.

435
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,160
Yeah.

436
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,160


437
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,160


438
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,160


439
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,160


440
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,160


441
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,160


442
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:13,460
I'm going to be me.

443
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,500
That's why I can give it away in relative safety.

444
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,000
What would you like to say about the allegations against you now?

445
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:26,340
Well, what I'm thinking is I probably should go visit with the sheriff in the little town

446
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,780
I live in and go, now, sheriff, you may get some funny phone calls from the FBI and the

447
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,180
CIA and NSA.

448
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,480
LAVPs.

449
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:34,900
Yeah.

450
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,380
But I want you, you know, I'm part, my family's been here in this little town for a long time.

451
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,580
I just returned here from Cleveland, Ohio.

452
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,200
Yep.

453
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,960
Yankee town.

454
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:43,600
It's terrible.

455
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,480
But I'm back now.

456
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,220
Everything's fine.

457
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,640
I just want to let you know, it's all, it's all a bunch of silly joke.

458
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,600
You know, my, my, my brother runs a goat ranch around the corner.

459
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,160
My sister tests the water.

460
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:56,900
So come on.

461
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:03,620
You don't need to believe any of them city police forces that are talking about cults

462
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,420
and, uh, drugs and all that kind of stuff.

463
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:06,800
Dossier.

464
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,480
We don't have to look at no dossiers.

465
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,940
None of the sex cults are bringing the.

466
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:21,020
Dead back to life or the, uh, the keeping alive of brains in jars in extreme pain.

467
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,700
None of that.

468
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,560
That's all just part of our fun and satire sheriff.

469
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,060
Well, I've worked at in, uh, Sherman, New York.

470
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,860
We're used to have to have the.

471
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,680
It's used to be where X day used to be back in the day.

472
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,120
Wasn't it?

473
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,600
Right.

474
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,100
Right.

475
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,240
And now then we had to make friends with the sheriff of Pomeroy.

476
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,020
Right.

477
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,860
Oh, now we're getting into that deep subgenius hot goss.

478
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,000
Yeah.

479
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,460
When, uh,

480
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:56,400
Is, is which state troopers have knocked on the door of the command trailer, terrifying

481
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,400
us when all they really wanted was a Bob t-shirt.

482
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:06,700
And I'll tell you all of the state troops fit fell into that category.

483
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,220
They didn't want to bust us for anything.

484
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,760
They just wanted a Bob shirt.

485
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,300
Yeah.

486
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,240
So don't let staying for you.

487
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,380
When he says the keeping alive of brains is beneath him.

488
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,340
He just means it's happening in his basement.

489
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,120
He's just trying to throw off the, it's funny.

490
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:29,580
It's funny you would say that because he has one of the only basements in, uh, whatever

491
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,700
place and that's Texas.

492
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,120
No, no Texas.

493
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:39,040
Well, it's, I was scared to say special torture chamber, right?

494
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,860
Of course.

495
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,180
Of course.

496
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:41,780
But, uh.

497
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,160
But still it's on your mind.

498
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,440
It's unusual.

499
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,360
We call it a shit.

500
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:45,700
Yeah.

501
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,560
It's so, yeah.

502
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,800
You have to use dynamite to blast the rock out to make a hole.

503
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:50,840
Yeah.

504
00:24:50,980 --> 00:25:00,100
It's unusual to have any hole in the ground in this part of Texas, but you said hole holes.

505
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,100
We can make a hole.

506
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,140
I've been down in that hole, brother.

507
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,380
I know about that.

508
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,720
A lot of people, a lot of people think you've gone down there and you're living this life

509
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,180
of luxury.

510
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,940
You understand the perils and dangers that take place on this.

511
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:23,040
You very nicely call it a goat farm, but the reality is this entire place is filled with

512
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:29,320
monsters and mythological creatures that on a daily basis you do battle with the dreaded

513
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,520
armadillo, the rattlesnake of death.

514
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,420
Why?

515
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:38,140
If people believe that there'd be pinks trying to get in here all the time to make a movie

516
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:38,960
of it or something.

517
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,220
That's all a bunch of urban legend.

518
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,360
That's hoo-ha.

519
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,140
That's a lot of urban legend.

520
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,760
That's not there.

521
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,220
We don't have any super cool monsters or cyclopses roaming around.

522
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:55,560
Well, we do have cyclops and cool monster skeletons that we can exhibit.

523
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,220
$5 a piece.

524
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,740
But you would say to stray off the beaten path there is to invite peril, would you not?

525
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,640
I mean, that's just a couple steps off the path bit by a snake.

526
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,200
You're dead.

527
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,080
No one will find you.

528
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,380
No, you pay extra for that.

529
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,080
That's the $10.

530
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,120
That's a 10.

531
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,900
$10 tour.

532
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,560
Yeah.

533
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,560
Yeah.

534
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,000
The run for your life.

535
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,280
Do you have to pre-book that?

536
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,500
Can I send my money now?

537
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,500
No, it's by appointment only.

538
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,260
Snake.

539
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,340
I want the snake by it.

540
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,320
I want the whole experience, Carrots.

541
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:27,580
Right.

542
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,340
Exactly.

543
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:34,600
Now, we can never do X Day here because it's too dangerous.

544
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:42,740
It can only be kind of one volunteer at a time that is taken through the gauntlet.

545
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,100
That's what I was getting at.

546
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,680
The

547
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,600
UNAnsettled TV?

548
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,400
That's a fair number.

549
00:26:51,400 --> 00:27:02,180
Guys out those enjoying our define we're weekend.

550
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,500
It's a very expensive one.

551
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,120
How is it going?

552
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:13,280
Come up, X-Day, for our uninitiated listeners.

553
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,180
What is it that you're referring to?

554
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:24,480
Oh, actually, it's when everybody stupid is going to die horribly and everybody who's cool and smart is going to live forever and part of it.

555
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,220
Yeah.

556
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,460
It's so simple.

557
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:26,740
Correct.

558
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:46,920
In the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs, the living avatar of Slack, Saint of Sales, who founded this mighty church of the subgenius, this edifice of knowledge and wisdom and Slack upon a sandy beach of hypocrisy.

559
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,200
It made peace.

560
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:55,200
Just to survive, you know, the next 35 years.

561
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,520
Now.

562
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:06,860
Now, what about us good hearted Southern Baptist Christians that think that the this this good hearted church?

563
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:26,360
Well, Bob, this scrub genius is is is really, really just a sick ploy for for a bunch of dirty perverts to to get together on the Internet and sell drugs and child pornography in exchange for Bob.

564
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:26,660
T.

565
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,120
Shirts.

566
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,180
Well, it could be that as well.

567
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,480
Why not both?

568
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,340
There you go.

569
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,160
It don't.

570
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,200
You know, they're.

571
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,000
This is you got to be adaptable in this world.

572
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,800
Things are changing fast.

573
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,860
Is it?

574
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,700
So quick.

575
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,000
Cash in your Bob coin.

576
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,740
I too.

577
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,160
Are you trading?

578
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,640
Are you trading in Bob coins?

579
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,480
Oh, I blew it, man.

580
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,220
I had my chance.

581
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:02,780
I could have been rich in Bob coins and I blew it because I didn't even know.

582
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,580
I'm a millionaire.

583
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,640
I thought it was stupid.

584
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,940
It's like, oh, yeah, right.

585
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,360
First.

586
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,220
Okay.

587
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,260
Video video game.

588
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,840
Well, I'm a zillionaire in Monster Hunter.

589
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,380
But doesn't do me any good today.

590
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,660
Can't buy nothing.

591
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,100
There's my Ivan Stang bingo card.

592
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,740
Monster Hunter for I-25.

593
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,380
But I missed out on the Bob.

594
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,340
Coins, man.

595
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,720
That was the key.

596
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,600
That was like the that was like in investing.

597
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,060
Is that how we were really going to get off?

598
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,340
Is that you were going to try to get a hold of that guy?

599
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:38,900
Coins.

600
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:48,920
I actually tried to get a hold of that guy a couple of years ago because I wanted to see what I wanted to see what my Bob coin would convert to Bitcoin because Bitcoin so high now.

601
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,380
My club.

602
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:56,020
Maybe it's you can actually get hyper coin so you can actually cash in all your.

603
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,580
And fit can tell you about that.

604
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,120
What are the benefits of hyper coin?

605
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,600
Fid?

606
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:07,660
Yeah, we have e-quarters hyper hyper cube e-quarters available for sale.

607
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:17,060
And because, you know, people keep complaining about how Bitcoin is worth so much that you have to work with so many decimal places.

608
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:22,440
They're like, I got decimal places coming out of my ears over here.

609
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,680
You know, that's all.

610
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,740
That's all we get.

611
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,400
So we suck.

612
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:25,840
That would be a lot.

613
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:32,240
We decided to make e-quarters so that you'll you'll always be working with a whole number.

614
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,700
That's our guarantee.

615
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:39,600
You will always be working with a whole number when you use hyper cube e-quarters.

616
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,380
No more.

617
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,860
No more decimal places.

618
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,000
That's for like that's for scientists type people that believe that the earth is round.

619
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:50,300
I think I think while people think about that, we should listen to some diva.

620
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,680
We got DJ.

621
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,700
He's up here.

622
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,420
Well, you know, you get the schedule that we put out on the pre-production note meetings.

623
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,760
I'm just trying to.

624
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:09,700
He's going to go with the with the with the fun time schedule show.

625
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,440
Graham.

626
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,600
You put these nice things here.

627
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,400
You know, once you once you introduce the song piece.

628
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,760
All right, everybody.

629
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,960
We're going to enjoy Monster Man by Devo.

630
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,920
Spin the wax, Argus.

631
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:21,660
Freeze.

632
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,700
I, I wanted the c

633
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:37,700


634
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,520
Buuoc you in here.

635
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,460
The man's a hunter, a beast on the run

636
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,760
He's a virus, you can't stop with a gun

637
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,180
Mutant plans, but my mind is insane

638
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,320
Loud springs, but I also can

639
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:07,740
There is no

640
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,580
There is no

641
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,180
There is no

642
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,920
There is no

643
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,680
There is no

644
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,320
There's no way to hear the dogs

645
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:35,680
speak

646
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,720
There is no

647
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:37,720


648
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,000
What is in your head?

649
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,780
Say what you want, say what you will

650
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,020
Said and done, the threat is still

651
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,120
Off the mat, off the mat

652
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,900
They say beauty's in the eye

653
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,060
Of the beholder, so don't try

654
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,500
To understand him

655
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:11,940
Everything is Halloween, it's all obscene

656
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,920
To watch the man

657
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,220
It's time for the show!

658
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,040
The only show!

659
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,040


660
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,040


661
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,040


662
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,040


663
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,040


664
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,960
The only show that brings you more nutrition per bite

665
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,340
Than leading e-entertainment

666
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,920
It's Dr. Fox here

667
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,300
And that was, uh

668
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,760
Well, you guys can't hear it

669
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,720
The listeners can hear it

670
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:48,940
Nice

671
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,020
Sid's not back from break yet

672
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,080
Oh, I'm back

673
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,180
But, uh

674
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,780
Reverend Stang is here

675
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,820
Nice

676
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,920
He was on time for the show

677
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,440
You're a liar

678
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,300
Reverend Ivan Stang is not on time for the show

679
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,360
I wasn't making that noise

680
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,940
Of course not

681
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,140
No

682
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,820
Or the Devo song

683
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,920
I didn't do that

684
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,240
That wasn't my fault

685
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,220
Yeah, who requested Devo?

686
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,980
No, that was Bob

687
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,620
Bob asked for Devo

688
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,940
And while we're

689
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,400
Thinking Bob

690
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,140
Let's, uh, let's show

691
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:33,540
Uh

00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,760
Stang how we're making all of our big money here

On time for the show

694
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,560
Let's, uh, let's read off those Patreons

695
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,640
Oh, man

696
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,800
The Patreon list

697
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,440
It's so extensive

698
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,620
First of all, we've got to give a shout out to

699
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,840
Uh, uh

700
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,820
Apostasy X Ford

701
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,040
APO, the well-known artist in the church

702
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,580
She's, uh

703
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,220
She's Patreon-ing us

704
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,560
And, uh, I actually have to

705
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,680
Predict her fortune

706
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,940
And Fid, because of the

707
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,640
Level, she's very high level

708
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,040
She's AstroTurf level

709
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,540
AstroTurf level

710
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,340
And Fid will have to read a random Bible verse

711
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,520
And interpret it specifically related to her

712
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,760
Uh, so

713
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,180
I'm gonna, I'm gonna have to

714
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,160
You can give me a second

715
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,720
I have to go into a trance here

716
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,180
I have to, I have to manifest the future

717
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,500
Ivan Stang will understand what I'm doing

718
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,360
And as will

719
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,920
Fid Chuli and Argus Q. Fox

720
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,600
As we are all indeed

721
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,820
Masters of time and space

722
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,740
We are all

723
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,720
We all need that

724
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,580
Yeah, I'm gonna project myself into the future

725
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,180
Okay, now I'm back

726
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,060
I'm back

727
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,380
And, uh, what I see in, uh

728
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,280
Fnord's future

729
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,320
Is within the next

730
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,580
72

731
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,340
Days

732
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,300
The Pope, Pope Francis from the Vatican

733
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,140
Will ask her to

734
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,420
Uh, commission

735
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,160
A portrait of him

736
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,500
In a kind of

737
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,220
Um, more Nordesque way

738
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,400
And this will be displayed in the

739
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,240
The, uh

740
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,300
The Vatican in the main office there

741
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,420
Right where the Pope sits

742
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,820
On the ceiling, yes, thank you

743
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,380
I was floundering a little bit

744
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,000
Thank you so much for that, like, Brian

745
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,740
But that's, that's my prediction

746
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,980
It's really not a prediction, folks

747
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,940
Because, like I said, it is

748
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,020
Her future

749
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:28,760
Fid?

750
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,140
Uh, yeah

751
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,720
I didn't set off my future

752
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:33,720


753
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:53,640
I set off my future

754
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,580
Fid, don't you know

755
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:05,580


756
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,540
I, uh, I need to

757
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,820
That justamente

758
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,680
Seems pretty

759
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,740
Unlikable

760
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:18,740


761
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:18,740


762
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:18,740


763
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,300
Help

764
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:24,360
You think

765
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:24,360


766
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:24,360


767
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:24,360


768
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,320
When our

769
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:25,880
End��

770
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,300
Who

771
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:26,940
Both

772
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:26,940


773
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,600
Which

774
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:28,600


775
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:28,600


776
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,420
ife

00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:29,420

779
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:29,420


780
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:29,420


781
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:29,460
Jason

782

783
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:29,520
And

784
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:29,660
I

785
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:29,900
Do

786
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,040
The

787
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,500
Sax

788
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:30,860
For

789
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:30,920
Exactly

790
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,220
Flan

791
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:32,400
Ow

792
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:32,400


793
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:32,400


794
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:32,540
M

795
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:32,540


796
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:32,540


797
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:32,540


798
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:32,540


799
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:32,540


800
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:32,540


801
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,720
phosph

802
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:33,420
So

803
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:33,580
See

804
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,300
times have you read the Bible?

805
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,380
How many times what?

806
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,900
Have you read the Bible?

807
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,680
Oh, I've lost

808
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,800
count. I've read all

809
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,840
of the entire thing so many

810
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,940
times. But I know that this

811
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,020
is going to be about the horror of something

812
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,080
or the something of Babylon

813
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,700
one way or another.

814
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,020
No, it's random.

815
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,880
It's random. We have no way

816
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,880
of knowing. There's lots of parts

817
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,480
in the Bible.

818
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,820
What's your favorite part of the Bible,

819
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,020
Reverend Stang?

820
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:07,980
Hosea

821
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,220
715

822
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,580
All is vanity.

823
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,520
Simple as that.

824
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,600
That explains everything.

825
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,940
All is vanity.

826
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,740
Is that the verse?

827
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,920
No, that's not the one about

828
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,380
A.P.O. Stacey. No.

829
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,040
The one about her is that the horror

830
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,940
of Babylon shall descend down

831
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,820
from the clouds and spread

832
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,460
in the sky.

833
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,000
The slackedness across the

834
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,740
mutated until

835
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,840
their heads explode

836
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,660
and the beast with 10,000

837
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,040
testicles rises

838
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,920
from the sea to

839
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,360
admit that it

840
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,100
committed lust

841
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,040
in its heart

842
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,620
with that one other monster.

843
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,120
That's that New American Standard

844
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,920
translation.

845
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,280
Yeah.

846
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,080
New American

847
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,180
Dobsian.

848
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,720
Translation of the Bible.

849
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,660
That's what we need.

850
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,560
We need a subgenius

851
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,700
annotated

852
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,400
Bible.

853
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,000
Actually, you guys, there is a subgenius

854
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,660
who has his hands on

855
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,640
the ancient manuscripts

856
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,280
that comprise the Bible

857
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,100
or

858
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,080
should have comprised

859
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,280
it had they been

860
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,980
selected properly.

861
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,480
What's strange?

862
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,140
Dr. Onan

863
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,080
Kanabar is working for

864
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,980
some

865
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,560
sort of American Bible

866
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,400
Scientific Society

867
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,600
because he's a rare

868
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,860
book archivist. He knows how to

869
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,000
preserve and take care of

870
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,080
rare books and how to deal with them.

871
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,680
And there's nothing rarer

872
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,580
than the Dead Sea Scrolls

873
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,420
and the

874
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,820
book of James and

875
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,840
the book of Magdalene and all that

876
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,860
kind of stuff. And he gets to actually

877
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,660
finger those

878
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,960
ancient papyrus

879
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,520
manuscripts.

880
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,440
In Oklahoma City, of all places.

881
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,280
He is the neatest guy, too.

882
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,120
You can't say finger on the radio.

883
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,020
He's been to X Day a couple times.

884
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,000
So yeah, he's fingering the Bible,

885
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,020
the original Bible pages.

886
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,320
The pages written in the

887
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,460
blood of Jesus, god damn ya!

888
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,360
I'm telling you, this is where they

889
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,500
just took, they gathered the blood

890
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,760
from Jesus as he

891
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,060
was bleeding on the cross

892
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,500
and they wrote the Bible with it

893
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,400
and those are the pages that Onan,

894
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,760
has and he's scraping little bits

895
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,420
of the blood off so that we can

896
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,560
have preserved DNA

897
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,460
of the Lord Jesus Christ

898
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,040
and bring him back to life

899
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,420
like a Jurassic Park.

900
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,900
Jurassic Park? I was just going to say that. That'll be sweet.

901
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,920
Do you think there'll be like a G?

902
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,200
And here's

903
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,620
the other thing. We're working on

904
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,600
Adolf Hitler, too.

905
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,460
There was a subgenius

906
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,340
down there throttling

907
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,120
Adolf Hitler's neck

908
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,320
until blood,

909
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,800
spilled out of his mouth.

910
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,160
And who was that subgenius? It was none other than

911
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,300
J.R. Bob Dove!

912
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,840
Oh no! Not that guy!

913
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,500
Wouldn't it be funny if we cloned

914
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,520
Jesus and Hitler and the clones

915
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,320
became like super good friends?

916
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,620
They'd be like,

917
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,800
Hey! Adolf! Hey!

918
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,320
Well, here's the funny thing.

919
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,520
Oh! Did the Jews

920
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,020
do something to you, Jesus?

921
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,560
No, no.

922
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,560
It's been predicted.

923
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,220
It's been predicted.

924
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,080
It's all in subgenius doctrine.

925
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,760
Nenslow wrote it up.

926
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,960
He saw it in the vision.

927
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:38,600
Jesus

928
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,180
and Hitler.

929
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,340
Long before

930
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,420
the Iron Sky

931
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,600
producers made their movies.

932
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,320
Nenslow

933
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,240
had Jesus and Hitler

934
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,280
or their clones

935
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,700
which were the same

936
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,400
person, you see.

937
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,700
College roommates.

938
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,800
Who else was Hitler?

939
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,520
Well, he was a

940
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:01,520


941
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,800
than the Lord Jesus Christ.

942
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,380
Doesn't it all add up?

943
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:07,720
No.

944
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,020
Of course. It sounds absurd.

945
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:10,960
It sounds insane.

946
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,060
That's how you know it's true.

947
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,360
That's how you know it's true.

948
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,980
That's how you know it's true.

949
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,060
If it doesn't make sense.

950
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,320
If it doesn't make sense,

951
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,000
then you know it's been tampered with.

952
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,080
Or a little seal

953
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,660
has been broken.

954
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,460
If it doesn't,

955
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,060
if it doesn't make sense,

956
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,880
then the only reason that it can't make sense

957
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,120
is because it's been

958
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,760
tampered with

959
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,140
and corrupted.

960
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,680
So there should be like a tamper-proof

961
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,280
sticker on every book.

962
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,800
And if you break the seal,

963
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,420
then, you know, shit, you don't know if that book's

964
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,500
got good stuff in it.

965
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,760
Just a Mr. Yuck sticker, I think.

966
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,020
Mr. Yuck.

967
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,580
On any book. Just because books are hard.

968
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,740
Books are hard.

969
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,940
You have to like, read them.

970
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,300
Stay sane.

971
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,260
They say that we are in a digital dark age.

972
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,340
Hard covers, certainly.

973
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,680
But not soft cover paperbacks.

974
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,480
I'm not secure enough

975
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,160
in my masculinity to read

976
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,040
soft cover books, okay?

977
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,620
Reverend Stang.

978
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:14,860
Wow.

979
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,400
I ain't no homo, okay?

980
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,020
No, I think you are.

981
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,220
I think you are, dude.

982
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,900
There's nothing wrong with that.

983
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,780
That's fine, man.

984
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,560
Speaking of no homo,

985
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,620
uh,

986
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:32,020
we also have a shout-out for Reverend 80.

987
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,520
Reverend 80?

988
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,100
Reverend 80,

989
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,800
who is now a latex lover.

he's a latex-level subscriber.

992
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,440
He is a visionary.

993
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:45,960
Indeed.

994
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,620
He knows everything.

995
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,660
That guy knows every damn thing.

996
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:52,800
And, uh,

Dr. Cosmack.

1000
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,760
Oh, Dr. Cosmack.

1001
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,260

Right on.

00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,000
So we've got that.

1005
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:06,920
We've got a show.

1006
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,260
We've got to play music on it.

1007
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:08,440
No, it's funny.

1008
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,180
These are all the kind of people

1009
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,160

interpret this Bible verse.

00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,060
Uh, Fit, your verse was, uh...

1052
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,140
I thought we did that.

1053
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,100
Stang did it.

1054
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,340
Stang did it.

1055
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,120
So it's a...

1056
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:37,760
It's a bonus.

1057
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:38,700
It's a bonus.

1058
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:38,940
It's a bonus.

1059
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,280
She got her money's worth, man.

1060
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:40,720
She got...

1061
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,700
Yeah, we're gonna circle back.

1062
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,520
Dang bonus.

1063
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,400
We're gonna circle back.

1064
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,040
Rub that in.

1065
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,060
Let them know.

1066
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,060
Not bad for five bucks, everybody.

1067
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,460
There you go.

1068
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,200
Dr. Stag loves the show,

1069
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,120
so why don't you love the show?

1070
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,980
Come beyond the show.

1071
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,380
And speaking of...

1072
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,560
Speaking of Dr. Cosmack,

1073
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,640
Reverend Stang,

1074
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,120
guess what, buddy?

1075
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,960
Uh, Dr. Cosmack

1076
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,320
is, uh,

1077
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,320
already starting the beginning works

1078
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,760
of a subgenius video game.

1079
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,340
All right!

1080
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,240
Yeah, it's...

1081
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:17,640
It's about time.

1082
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,780
Is it gonna be, uh,

1083
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,300
like on the level of Grand Theft Auto

1084
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,700
with a huge open world

1085
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,960
that goes on forever

1086
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,460
in incredible detail?

1087
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,800
I imagine the idea...

1088
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,940
I imagine the idea...

1089
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,580
is gonna be like, uh,

1090
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,980
press this button

1091
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,660
and you, uh,

1092
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,100
enter your debit card

1093
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,480
and then you push the button

1094
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,160
and it charges you $35

1095
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,840
and it says you win.

1096
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,720
And then you do that again.

1097
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,040
Oh.

1098
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:44,700
Oh, yeah!

1099
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,460
I wonder if there's gonna be

1100
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,520
a peas element to it.

1101
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,320
Who gets the $35?

1102
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,620
Uh, the app developers

1103
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,620
are gonna have to take a,

1104
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:53,980
you know, an administration fee.

1105
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,340
Substantial cut.

1106
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,660
Is there overhead

1107
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,340
in research and development, boss?

1108
00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,000
Yeah.

1109
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,800
I know, yeah.

1110
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,980
You know, you'll get a lot

1111
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:02,160
of exposure from it, though.

1112
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,500
Uh, yeah, exposure.

1113
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,160
That's right.

1114
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,520
It pays off.

1115
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,360
You've heard that before?

1116
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,960
Come on, that's crazy talk.

1117
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,200
You know, I thought about putting

1118
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,160
my face on a T-shirt

1119
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,200
and people bought it.

1120
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,660
I've got a T-shirt

1121
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,780
with your face on it.

1122
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,760
You have a T-shirt

1123
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,560
with my face on it?

1124
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,360
Yeah.

1125
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,220
In fact, I was wearing it yesterday.

1126
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,440
Really?

1127
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:28,740
Yeah.

1128
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,200
And I was completely unable

1129
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,620
to pick up any chicks at all

1130
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,620
wearing that shirt.

1131
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,860
I tried and tried.

1132
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,800
You gotta wear it backwards.

1133
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,720
And they all get my shirt

1134
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,280
and my top.

1135
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:40,900
Jesus.

1136
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:41,700
You get them running

1137
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:42,440
the other way

1138
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,180
and you get a head

1139
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,120
10 seconds on them.

1140
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,240
It's only the hopelessly

1141
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:47,820
neck-bearded

1142
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,020
that seem to recognize

1143
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,300
the Argus Q Fox T-shirt

1144
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,500
for some reason.

1145
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:53,260
We haven't tried it.

1146
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:54,800
If only there was

1147
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,240
an organization

1148
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,200
for those people.

1149
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,820
Yeah, like a church.

1150
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:58,340
Yeah.

1151
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,400
They never get adopted.

1152
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,940
That describes me.

1153
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,560
I've got kind of a neck beard.

1154
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:05,720
Do you?

1155
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,280
I haven't seen you

1156
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:07,900
in a long time.

1157
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,760
You're not hopelessly

1158
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,440
neck-bearded.

1159
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,260
I didn't shave

1160
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,600
for the last three days.

1161
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,720
I'm thinking more about people

1162
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,260
whose neck

1163
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,980
grows out so fat

1164
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,740
that their beard

1165
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:25,040
is made out of layers

1166
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,960
of neck fat.

1167
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,500
That's a neck beard to me.

1168
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,280
Okay.

1169
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,960
I can't see the difference, boss.

1170
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,240
No, I'm the opposite.

1171
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,680
I'm a buzzard neck.

1172
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,240
So.

1173
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:34,880
Yeah.

1174
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,060
I'm a buzzard neck.

1175
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,900
You usually see someone

1176
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,820
that's in the church

1177
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,960
of the hopelessly neck beard.

1178
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:43,720
Fendora.

1179
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,840
They call it a Fendora,

1180
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,440
but what they're really

1181
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,760
wearing is a triby.

1182
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,900
They just don't know

1183
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:48,760
what their hat's called.

1184
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,640
And they're usually

1185
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,940
complaining a lot about

1186
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,140
the latest Star Trek

1187
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,320
and how it wasn't

1188
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,640
as Chewbacca should have

1189
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,680
got a bigger park in it.

1190
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,000
And we got it.

1191
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,160
Actually, I should be nice

1192
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,540
because we have a huge segment

1193
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,600
of that population subculture

1194
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,480
that is our fans.

1195
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,520
And it's time for the show

1196
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,020
here on Freethink Radio.

1197
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:09,940
It's time for the show.

1198
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,820
I'm not putting them down.

1199
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,720
I'm letting them know

1200
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,320
that I knew

1201
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,440
like, so I'm identifying

1202
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,200
with them.

1203
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,560
Yeah, I see.

1204
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,640
I know you're I know

1205
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,020
your thing.

1206
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,000
I know your thing.

1207
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:24,680
Yeah.

1208
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,020
We're total nerds.

1209
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,560
Well, maybe not

1210
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,040
Star Trek and Star Wars,

1211
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,020
but Church of the Subgenius.

1212
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:35,020
That's pretty nerdy.

1213
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,680
Those are the same thing,

1214
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:36,960
aren't they?

1215
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,160
Star Trek and Star Wars

1216
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:40,960
is the same thing.

1217
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,400
Those terms are interchangeable.

1218
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,440
Church of the Subgenius

1219
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,480
and Star Trek

1220
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,120
are my favorite things.

1221
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,920
I know the most about them.

1222
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,720
Star Trek was really good.

1223
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,540
Star Trek is kind of,

1224
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:54,460
you know,

1225
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,780
that's like the Star Trek

1226
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,560
is like like a Hot Wheels thing

1227
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,160
and you would click

1228
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,020
the track together

1229
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:01,000
like little spaceships.

1230
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,640
Bob gets me back

1231
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,840
on Star Trek.

1232
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,540
Bob gets me back

1233
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:06,840
on Star Trek.

1234
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,340
Oh, the show is taking

1235
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,260
a terrible turn.

1236
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,580
But if you're talking

1237
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,240
viewer mail,

1238
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,720
should we do viewer mail

1239
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,760
while we have Stang?

1240
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:14,640
I think we should do

1241
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,360
a blind eye.

1242
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,380
Oh, yeah.

1243
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:18,580
I think we should

1244
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,480
do the blind eye.

1245
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,660
We have a we have a guest

1246
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:21,240
on the show.

1247
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,560
He might have a blind eye.

1248
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,520
He wants to turn.

1249
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,680
Well, I have

1250
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,280
I always explain

1251
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:26,920
the blind eye,

1252
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,140
but I don't know why

1253
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:28,900
I explained the blind eye

1254
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,380
this week.

1255
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,380
I'm up for any program.

1256
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,520
OK, the blind eye

1257
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:33,500
segment

1258
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:34,620
is

1259
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,420
why don't you explain

1260
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,380
it to Dr. Fox?

1261
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:39,480
So

1262
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,380
each week

1263
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,500
we all know.

1264
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:44,860
Wait, let me explain it.

1265
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,980
I want to explain it.

1266
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,120
You guys bitched

1267
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:49,940
about how I explained

1268
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,840
it every week.

1269
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,540
Now I said, oh,

1270
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,440
you play.

1271
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,360
Well, I was hoping

1272
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,960
to throw it back to you

1273
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,840
and it would be a funny

1274
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,680
little joke.

1275
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,940
But he dropped

1276
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:58,140
it.

1277
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,180
It's you can't say

1278
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,300
explain on the radio.

1279
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,420
Ah, that's right.

1280
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:03,940
I'm sorry.

1281
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,300
We are doing super

1282
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,020
good, though.

1283
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,880
This time, don't you

1284
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,440
think, guys?

1285
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,000
No swearing or anything.

1286
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,640
I'm so proud of us.

1287
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,280
Yeah.

1288
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,100
Up until then.

1289
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,180
So bad.

1290
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,260
No fucking cussing.

1291
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,380
Well, these fuckers.

1292
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,660
There you go.

1293
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,280
Uh huh.

1294
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,600
So anyway, boss,

1295
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,580
how it works is

1296
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:22,140
here's the thing.

1297
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,860
We turn a blind eye

1298
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,480
to something.

1299
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:25,940
And if during the week

1300
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:26,800
between shows,

1301
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,620
ISIS,

1302
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:28,900
happens to

1303
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,260
take out

1304
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:31,060
whoever we turn

1305
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:31,920
the blind eye to,

1306
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,020
we're not going to

1307
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:33,900
get upset about it.

1308
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:34,880
Now, we're not saying

1309
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,040
that ISIS should do this

1310
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,920
or we're not telling

1311
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,200
people to do it.

1312
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,260
We're just saying,

1313
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,080
hey, if it happens

1314
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,120
this week,

1315
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:44,900
we're not going to

1316
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:46,500
time for this show.

1317
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,380
People, not

1318
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,420
everybody collectively,

1319
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:49,520
maybe just the three

1320
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,220
or four of us

1321
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,260
will say, hey,

1322
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,200
you guys get the blind eye.

1323
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,120
We're not going to help

1324
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,160
you out of that situation.

1325
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,520
We're not going to

1326
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,700
say anything to ISIS.

1327
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:58,920
If something bad happens.

1328
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,520
But at the end of the week,

1329
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,580
your time's done.

1330
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,480
And then if something

1331
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,000
did happen,

1332
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,220
we would all be

1333
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,280
righteously indignant

1334
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,840
and right.

1335
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,300
Just right.

1336
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,380
Righteously indigenous

1337
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,580
like the rest of America.

1338
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:11,700
Well,

1339
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,060
like in the past,

1340
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,080
I turned a blind eye

1341
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:14,700
to Betty White

1342
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,580
because she was kind of

1343
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:16,820
saucy with me one day

1344
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,900
in front of at bonds.

1345
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,260
He turned a blind eye

1346
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:19,580
to me.

1347
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,340
I turned a blind eye

1348
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,060
to Argus Figgs

1349
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:22,940
because he stepped

1350
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,400
on my heroin joke.

1351
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,920
I stepped on your

1352
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,740
heroin bit.

1353
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,880
Yeah, my heroin bit.

1354
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:30,920
Your heroin bit.

1355
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,740
Well, if I really

1356
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:33,860
stepped on it,

1357
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,440
you stepped on it so hard.

1358
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,580
It was barely even

1359
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,480
a heroin joke.

1360
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:39,100
I'd like to

1361
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,140
because you stepped

1362
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:41,220
on it so much.

1363
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,520
I'd like to turn

1364
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,440
my blind eye

1365
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,460
to people

1366
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,520
who start sentences

1367
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,560
with the word.

1368
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,600
So when they're

1369
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,480
explaining something

1370
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,900
to you and you can

1371
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:53,580
tell they're like

1372
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:54,560
getting off on a little

1373
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,300
bit too much because

1374
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,520
it makes them feel smart.

1375
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,480
You know, you say

1376
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:57,840
something like,

1377
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:58,960
Oh, gee, I wonder

1378
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,800
why this is the case.

1379
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,620
Like, so the reason

1380
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:02,700
that that is the

1381
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:03,980
situation is,

1382
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,480
you know, blah, blah,

1383
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:05,680
blah.

1384
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:06,920
So prefix.

1385
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,640
So implies that

1386
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,080
everybody else is wrong.

1387
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,440
Hold on a second.

1388
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,640
Let me sink that.

1389
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,980
Let me have that

1390
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,120
sink in for a second.

1391
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:18,720
Yeah, I know.

1392
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,540
I went with a different

1393
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:19,860
one.

1394
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,680
OK, look, I went

1395
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,460
with a different one

1396
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,280
that I said I was

1397
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:23,860
going to do.

1398
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,020
OK, but I just

1399
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,080
still couldn't pull it

1400
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:26,380
off.

1401
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:27,520
Hey, you guys

1402
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,720
didn't send me a script.

1403
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:30,340
I'm just.

1404
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,340
It's not a script.

1405
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,380
It's like notes.

1406
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,520
It's just suggestions.

1407
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,600
It's just, you know,

1408
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:35,980
lines.

1409
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,920
The guidelines are

1410
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,780
not so much rules

1411
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:39,960
as they're, you know.

1412
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,520
Anyway, so we're

1413
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,040
not anyway.

1414
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,360
Anyway, Fed.

1415
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,520
So we've got

1416
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,360
we've got we've got

1417
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,320
like a notepad

1418
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,980
like in the other

1419
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:48,340
room.

1420
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,400
It's professional

1421
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,300
radio people.

1422
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:51,740
We get together

1423
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,180
tonight.

1424
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,700
We get together

1425
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,600
20 minutes before

1426
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,840
the show and think

1427
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,720
of stupid things

1428
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,360
while we,

1429
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:57,840
you know, put

1430
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,960
stupid things into

1431
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,880
our stupid loans.

1432
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,080
Yeah.

1433
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,680
What it turns out

1434
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,300
is we work for

1435
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,760
two hours on a

1436
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,780
radio show to

1437
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:07,560
come up with one

1438
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,800
funny joke to tweet.

1439
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,800
The whole two hours

1440
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,520
is the production

1441
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,580
meeting for the one.

1442
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,320
Yeah, this isn't a

1443
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:13,660
show.

1444
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:14,680
This is a production.

1445
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:15,860
This is a two hour

1446
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,000
live production.

1447
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:17,960
The blind eye.

1448
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:18,800
That's what we're

1449
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:18,920
doing.

1450
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:19,740
It's the blind eye.

1451
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,200
You're giving a blind

1452
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,020
eye, Fed, to

1453
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:23,960
everybody who's

1454
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,960
so those guys,

1455
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:27,440
right?

1456
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,080
That's your blind

1457
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:28,700
eye word with the

1458
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,100
sentence.

1459
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,740
So too much.

1460
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,600
And they're smug

1461
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,140
about it.

1462
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:32,740
Those people

1463
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,620
blind eye to you.

1464
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:35,940
Have fun, ISIS.

1465
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,240
Go nuts.

1466
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,720
We're not telling you

1467
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,620
to, but if something

1468
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:40,660
bad happens to those

1469
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,080
people, we're

1470
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,200
we're not going to

1471
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:43,800
get we're not going

1472
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,340
to raise a stink.

1473
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,380
ISIS, if you

1474
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,640
independently decide

1475
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,920
to do something to

1476
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:48,920
those people, I

1477
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,060
just hope that you

1478
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,120
eat the hell out of

1479
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:51,660
that hamburger.

1480
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,480
Yeah.

1481
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:53,480
All right.

1482
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:54,080
Look away.

1483
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:54,680
We'll blind

1484

See, we're we're

00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,860
goosey here.

1488
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:00,260
OK.

1489
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:01,800
Loose is right.

1490
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,900
So, yeah, I may

1491
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,680

myself.

1494
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,260
Is that your

1496
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,060
Is that your viewer

1497
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:09,280

1498
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,220
Who's it from?

1499
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,780
But when we do

1500
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,300

00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,460

No, nothing

1683
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,480
happened.

1684
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,060
You lied.

1685
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,440
I'm

1686
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:36,800
buying it

1687
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,340
right now.

1688
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,400
I am on

1689
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,160
GoDaddy

1690
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:41,660
right now.

1691
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:42,680
You probably

1692
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,020
spelled subgenius

1693
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:44,480
is wrong.

1694
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:45,360
He probably

1695
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:45,740
did.

1696
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:50,520
Can't be

1697
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:50,820
true.

1698
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:51,580
Dr.

1699
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:52,440
Fox,

1700
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:53,100
this is

1701
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:53,320
the

1702
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,180
dot com

1703
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:54,480
work.

1704
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,380
Yeah, it

1705
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:56,880
does.

1706
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:56,920


1707
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:56,920


1708
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:56,920


1709
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:56,920


1710
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:58,200
Oh, it went to

1711
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,060
Hypercube

1712
01:00:59,060 --> 01:00:59,540
Laboratory.

1713
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,180
Oh, I see.

1714
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,280
You'll be

1715
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,100
hearing from

1716
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:08,060
my lawyers,

1717
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,220
Reverend

1718
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:10,740
Fox.

1719
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:14,500
Yes.

1720
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:15,640
So there you go.

1721
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,160
You can shout us

1722
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:17,920
out on the hour

1723
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:18,400
of slack.

1724
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:19,820
Yeah, just

1725
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:20,600
if we're really

1726
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,380
easy to find

1727
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,180
W. W. W.

1728
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:25,580
W.

1729
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:26,400
W. W.

1730
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,040
Oh, oh my god.

1731
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:28,480
That's

1732
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,100
sickening.

1733
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:29,920
Well, if you

1734
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,260
if you look at

1735
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,060
the past couple

1736
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:33,180
of messages

1737
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:34,660
I might have

1738
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:35,140
left you on

1739
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:35,520
Facebook

1740
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:37,860
it looks

1741
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,520
like when you

1742
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,260
refer people

1743
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:40,920
to subgenius

1744
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:41,880
dot com

1745
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,080
the number

1746
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:43,300
one

1747
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:43,660
website

1748
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:44,480
for subgenius

1749
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,380
related materials

1750
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:47,240
and stuff

1751
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:48,720
um

1752
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,940
that your

1753
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:50,400
phone might

1754
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:50,860
be auto

1755
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:51,280
correcting

1756
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,060
it to

1757
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:53,580
subgenus

1758
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:54,800
or genus

1759
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,060
dot com.

1760
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,740
Yeah, I've noticed that.

1761
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,240
And so I tried to buy that one,

1762
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,360
but they want like $10,000.

1763
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:05,080
Oh, God.

1764
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:07,100
Subgenus.

1765
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,000
Oh, Jesus.

1766
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,640
But as soon as I get that one,

1767
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,180
we're going to sweep you out.

1768
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:15,900
Oh, there really is a timeforthewebsite.com.

1769
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,920
We did all of this for you.

1770
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,420
I can't figure it out.

1771
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,460
You're on it right now.

1772
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:24,460
We're live streaming on time for the website.

1773
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:25,360
Timeforthewebsite.com.

1774
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,720
It's just more Hypercube.

1775
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,000
Just don't drill into it too much.

1776
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:30,040
That's a Hypercube.

1777
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,000
A Hypercube doesn't end in the third dimension.

1778
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,860
It's just more Hypercube.

1779
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,200
You're on it right now.

1780
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,460
It sounds horrible.

1781
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:46,380
It's time for the Time Warp.

1782
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,920
It's time for the Time Warp?

1783
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:50,420
It's time for the Time Warp.

1784
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,800
It doesn't end in the third dimension.

1785
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,660
It doesn't end in the third dimension?

1786
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:54,440
It's just more Hypercube.

1787
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,220
More Hypercube.

1788
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:56,980
More Hypercube.

1789
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,260
More Hypercube.

1790
01:02:58,260 --> 01:02:58,920
It just loops.

1791
01:02:59,100 --> 01:02:59,380
It loops.

1792
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,720
You're on it right now.

1793
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:03,980
It's time for the show.

1794
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:04,800
I got a bill.

1795
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,160
Her plane just got in early.

1796
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,040
I got to take off.

1797
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,720
Pease has to go murder people.

1798
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,700
Pease, you have to apologize.

1799
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:15,000
I've got to go there and cut the airport,

1800
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,500
cut Black Pease.

1801
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,040
I'm going to be at the airport before he is.

1802
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,260
God damn it.

1803
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:22,660
Darn it.

1804
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:23,980
Gosh darn it.

1805
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:25,780
Dude, we were doing so good.

1806
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:27,320
All right.

1807
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:31,060
It's great doing time for the show with you, Ivan Stang.

1808
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:35,340
I'm sorry that previously my booking schedule is so heavy

1809
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:39,500
with all the dilemma and crises that we have to fight down here

1810
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,300
at Freethink Radio.

1811
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:43,840
We just don't know where we get all the time to do it.

1812
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,360
But it's wonderful to have you.

1813
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,020
I hope to have you back very soon.

1814
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:48,100
It's horrible.

1815
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:48,980
Horrible.

1816
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:50,360
Horrible.

1817
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:51,540
I'm going away now.

1818
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,480
If I can find a way to sign off.

1819
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,440
You better go.

1820
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,520
You better go pick up carrots before I get there, buddy.

1821
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:58,560
Yeah.

1822
01:03:58,580 --> 01:03:59,040
Oh, man.

1823
01:03:59,120 --> 01:03:59,700
We can.

1824
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:00,300
We can.

1825
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:02,480
I forget the last time.

1826
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:03,460
Maybe it was Legume.

1827
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:04,620
He was stuck in.

1828
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:08,260
So maybe Stang will not be able to sign out.

1829
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,300
We'll just keep him on until the end of the show.

1830
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,100
So just carry your connection with you wherever you go.

1831
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,540
And Bob is here.

1832
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,960
Bob is here, Reverend Stang.

1833
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:22,040
Yeah, Bob just came into the room.

1834
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,180
Say hi, Bob.

1835
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:23,520
Hi, Bob.

1836
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:24,320
Hi, Bob.

1837
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:24,420


1838
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:24,420


1839
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:24,420


1840
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:24,420


1841
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:24,420


1842
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:24,420


1843
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:24,420


1844
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:24,420


1845
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:24,420


1846
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:24,660
Bob.

1847
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,400
Hello.

1848
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:26,520
That's Bob.

1849
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:28,780
Oh, that Bob.

1850
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:30,260
That Bob.

1851
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:31,540
The good one.

1852
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:35,460
But Bob's here.

1853
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:40,020
And Bob is joining us on the second half of the time for sure tonight.

1854
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:49,580
Because Reverend Pease has to go prevent the next 9-11.

1855
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:50,360
I don't know.

1856
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,480
He's headed to the airport.

1857
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:53,960
Hey, 9-11.

1858
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,340
9-11 was an honest mistake.

1859
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:56,640
Okay.

1860
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:58,920
It was an honest mistake.

1861
01:04:58,920 --> 01:04:59,820
And he figured it out.

1862
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,100
And he's out.

1863
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,000
But Pease is still floating.

1864
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,560
Pease and Stang.

1865
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:07,720
Finally.

1866
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:13,120
All it took for me to say 9-11 was an honest mistake to get Stang out of here.

1867
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,000
Finally.

1868
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:15,900
That timing.

1869
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:19,600
The show, The Hour of Slack.

1870
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:23,940
If you need more...

1871
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:24,580
Information.

1872
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:25,440
