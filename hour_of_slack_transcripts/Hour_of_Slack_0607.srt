1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,020
You feel lucky tonight, Bob, you feel lucky tonight, Bob, you feel lucky, Bob, you feel lucky.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:05,460
Lucky.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:08,540
Gosh.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:20,560
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Black, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,020
I'm coming around, I see your children, I see them, I see you're going down for the

6
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,540
ground.

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,360
Hey!

8
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,500
Hey!

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,840
Bob is our forecast now, Bob is our forecast, Bob is our forecast now, Bob is our forecast,

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,880
Bob is our forecast.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,900
Bob is our forecast now, Bob, the only thing I'm not really crazy about, Bob is our forecast.

12
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,680
All right, thanks, Bob.

13
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,680
Rub it up real good.

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,040
I got you.

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,300
I like the rub.

16
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,240
Rub it up real good.

17
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,880
Let me rub this one.

18
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,760
Let me rub that one.

19
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,040
Oh, I lost it now.

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,400
I was going to get naked, rub it all over my body and carry a can of Alpo and rub it

21
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,320
on my genitalia and go like maybe wear a pit bull in the heat and start making fun of it

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
and make noises and stuff.

23
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,020
I mean it all look like I'm naked.

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,560
I'm mad at myself and I have no exercise and I'm starting to have all these tears in my

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:38,560


26
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,860
I try a couple of times and then I Shinier's Nations crush me and then my 뛰 bigger

27
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,120
than I come around and I sit down.

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,760
I only even some real you know.

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,200
I can't drag my pants out.

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,500
I can't drag my pants out.

31
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:44,500


32
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,180
Yeah.

33
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,700
All right, so I disgusting bitch, I'm dying.

34
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,000
Just have that in my stinks so I can have enough compaction andласens on my shit.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,240
Yeah, have some energy boost riding to some more happiness and I'm gonna still be alive

36
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,580
and healthy at this point.

37
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,700
And I think that's going to be great.

38
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:58,700


39
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:58,880
Yeah, that's exactly what he's trying to get through.

40
00:01:59,500 --> 00:01:59,500


41
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,240
baby. You know what I'm saying?

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,500
Yeah, well, like that pit bull

43
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,520
in that Alpo, you know. That could be

44
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,040
kind of disastrous there, Dave.

45
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,860
Well, that's the disaster I'm looking for.

46
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,320
It's disaster,

47
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,340
man. Not lonesome cowboy

48
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,040
Dave. Wearing his

49
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,400
pants made of Alpo into a

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,060
pit full of pit bulls.

51
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,120
That's it, man. He's a love god.

52
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,620
He's a groin trepanation

53
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,040
freak.

54
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,060
Hooky, hooky, hooky, come on, baby.

55
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,480
You thought Don Knotts was a love

56
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,340
god. Wait until you see

57
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,440
love god lonesome

58
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,580
with his Alpo

59
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,660
britches.

60
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,300
Baby, oh, baby. Oh, that's all right, Mama.

61
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,720
Just get your hand away from there.

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,500
I'm waiting for Husky.

63
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,700
I passed out.

64
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,440
How did you get in here?

65
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,740
You're not supposed to be in here.

66
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,580
I am supposed to be in here.

67
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,880
It's my show.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,360
That's right. Mine. All mine.

69
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,640
And

70
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,340
a little

71
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,500
snippet there from the

72
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,840
last show in Cleveland,

73
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,540
friends, and we've got

74
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,160
oh so ever much coming up.

75
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,980
What have I got for this show

76
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,040
here tonight, friends? We've got

77
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,040
a bit more.

78
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,240
The last of the recordings from

79
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,620
Cleveland, the

80
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,840
and the Austin

81
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,580
prank call

82
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,860
extravaganza

83
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,160
starring the Crystal Methodist.

84
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,180
We're going to do a lot

85
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,160
of music this time. We've got some

86
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,200
X-Day songs that people

87
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,800
may have forgotten and

88
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,260
Indian Rope Burn. We'll do a little

89
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,880
tribute to that fine

90
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,940
band and

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,780
we've got some KPFA

92
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,000
and some Janer Wellman

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,920
and a little bit of

94
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,100
everything. But you know, girls,

95
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,660
X-Day is only eight months off.

96
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,640
This gives us eight cycles

97
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,460
for us to sync up and bleed

98
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,920
in one great Technicolor

99
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,620
unison.

100
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,580
Even if we all have to move

101
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,660
into a one-bedroom walk-up

102
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,680
on the east side, the lower east

103
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,500
side together, we must all be

104
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,980
in heat come X-Day.

105
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
All men,

106
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,000
the hairy barbarian scum,

107
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,680
must be driven into a breeding

108
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,740
frenzy by the scent of

109
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,180
our albunimal

110
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,580
spooge. We must

111
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,420
mate with those who don't kill each other

112
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,360
in their stupid sexual posturing

113
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,400
rituals. We will take them to our

114
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,580
lairs. We will let them kiss

115
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,300
and suckle our

116
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,580
ovipositors. And at the moment

117
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,640
of climax, we will

118
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,120
eat their heads

119
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,580
and use their bleeding neck

120
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,480
stumps as quivering

121
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,720
dildos.

122
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,740
Only Stang

123
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,620
shall be allowed to pleasure

124
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,460
us all, and on X-Day

125
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,260
he will choose the queen of the new

126
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,620
Xist brood. If it is

127
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,420
not me, I will submit

128
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,640
to the will of Stang and his queen

129
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,280
and ovipositor

130
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,480
shall caress ovipositor

131
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,280
and we will bear a million

132
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,600
Stangian eggs.

133
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,600
Join me, sisters. It is time for us

134
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,420
to unite in our discharge.

135
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,180
Signed,

136
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,040
Sister Arachnid,

137
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,720
also known as BugSexGirl

138
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,200
at

139
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,220
bugsexgirl.com

140
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,520
Well, by the time you hear this show,

141
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,060
BugSexGirl will probably have died

142
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,340
because they only live about three weeks.

143
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,860
But, friends,

144
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,200
the subgeniuses

145
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,380
are getting excited about X-Day.

146
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,360
As of this

147
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,220
recording, it's 223

148
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,140
days away,

149
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,840
seven months approximately,

150
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,280
and you

151
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,120
ought to see the arguments

152
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,240
and vindictive

153
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,720
hatefulness that's starting to...

154
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,040
to happen. It's practically civil wars

155
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,140
in subgenius land. If you look at the

156
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,140
news group

157
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,320
alt.slack

158
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,860
on the internet, that's just been a

159
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:08,900
shameful

160
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,360
display of

161
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,800
faithlessness. In many cases,

162
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,940
people are, like, going, well, what are

163
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,940
they going to do if the saucers

164
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,160
don't get here?

165
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,040
And other silly questions like

166
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,160
that. And, friends, for those of you

167
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,760
who are not familiar with the

168
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,580
main basic doctrine,

169
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,180
of the Church of the Subgenius,

170
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,580
Bob Dobbs, the world overlord

171
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,680
in secret,

172
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,640
living avatar of

173
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,420
slack, discovered that there was

174
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,400
a conspiracy of normal people

175
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,800
stealing away the slack of all the weirdos.

176
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,440
However,

177
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,560
come July 5th,

178
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,720
1998, at 7 o'clock

179
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,320
in the morning,

180
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,460
starting at the

181
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,480
Pacific dateline,

182
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,560
or the international

183
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,240
dateline,

184
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,280
so-called men from Planet X,

185
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,320
the exists, godlike

186
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
beings from other

187
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,100
dimensions, will

188
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,540
come to this planet to destroy

189
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,340
all the unbelievers and

190
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,040
to reward those who

191
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,100
became $30 subgenius

192
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,460
ministers with

193
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,920
two, count them, two

194
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,260
utopias

195
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,320
and eternal paradises

196
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,420
in heaven, or hell, or whatever.

197
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,420
That's what this is all about,

198
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,840
dear friends, and

199
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,640
now that you know that, I guess I can just

200
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,560
probably, I could probably

201
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,640
just shut up.

202
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,520
What else? Oh, I should mention this

203
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,600
in the news here.

204
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,680
We love to do the news every week

205
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,820
now. The news from The Onion,

206
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,160
the

207
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,540
newspaper of Madison,

208
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,140
Wisconsin.

209
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,160
Report,

210
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,380
drug use down among

211
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,760
uncool kids.

212
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,660
According to a study released

213
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,520
Monday by the Department of Health and Human

214
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,460
Services, drug use is on

215
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,380
the decline among

216
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,420
uncool kids in the United

217
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,620
States. While nearly 80%

218
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,580
of cool kids, whose levels

219
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,440
of substance abuse have risen steadily

220
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,080
throughout the 90s, use drugs,

221
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,800
the study found that just .007%

222
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,900
of uncool

223
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,600
kids between the ages of 12 and 19

224
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,200
use drugs, down from

225
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,460
.012% in

226
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:24,960
1990.

227
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,280
Really, this should surprise

228
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,340
no one, Health and Human Services Secretary

229
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,080
Donna Shalala said.

230
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,480
If you ever met any of these kids, you'd be

231
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,500
amazed they ever left their

232
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,360
own bedroom, let alone

233
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,760
smoked

234
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,320
a joint.

235
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,240
DEA guidelines established in

236
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,700
1989 define

237
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,980
quote, uncool kids,

238
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,100
unquote, as those who are

239
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,860
introverted and passive,

240
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,440
possess academic aptitude

241
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,260
and physical ungainliness,

242
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,540
and live in constant fear of

243
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,560
things that really aren't that big a deal.

244
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,600
Now, this description, friends,

245
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,720
obviously includes a lot of subgeniuses.

246
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,760
Speaking for myself,

247
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,500
I'm no longer one of those

248
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,540
uncool kids, but there was a time

249
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,640
when I definitely was.

250
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,460
Among the uncool kids polled for the

251
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,460
federal study were high school yearbook

252
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,600
editors, people unable to

253
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,380
do chin-ups for the President's Council

254
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,520
on Physical Fitness test,

255
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,640
forensics club secretary treasurers,

256
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,160
and newspaper

257
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,680
carriers.

258
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,620
Saving their money to buy a

259
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,780
capsella set. I don't understand

260
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,760
that. Well, anyway, friends,

261
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,380
that's a shame about the

262
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,980
uncool kids.

263
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,780
You know, but somebody's got to do it,

264
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,100
I guess.

265
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,540
I'm so glad I became cool.

266
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,760
You know, did all

267
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,460
the things that were expected of a

268
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,040
young fellow back in the

269
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,960
70s. Unfortunately, I'm

270
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,520
still doing the same things that I

271
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,720
did to be cool back in the 70s, so I guess

272
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,620
I'm not really very cool.

273
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,120
anymore.

274
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,300
Friends, let's

275
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,980
proceed.

276
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,840
On the road

277
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,820
Nothing's heavy

278
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,400
For a boss

279
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,060
Nothing's brutal

280
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,780
All your best

281
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,740
Well I see that

282
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,980
You're going down

283
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,820
At last

284
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,040
I'm a killer

285
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,620
My best

286
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,360
Sorry to spoil your party

287
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,300
You want him like mine

288
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,120
You're so ugly

289
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,560
Come on

290
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,560
Get in the corner now

291
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,000
For three, two, three

292
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,900
I'm a killer

293
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,500
I'm a killer

294
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:26,720
I'm a killer

295
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,400
Stuffed with

296
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,080
Havafrop Zipulox

297
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,900
My God

298
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,040
Whose God is he talking about?

299
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,160
My God's bigger than yours

300
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,660
Your God

301
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,760
My God's bigger than yours

302
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,400
My God

303
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,600
Oh yeah, my God

304
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,840
Ma'am

305
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,580
My God

306
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,720
Good Lord

307
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,980
Rich joke

308
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,800
Classic

309
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,660
On the sidekick hotline

310
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,300
We will put you in charge

311
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,120
With our professional sidekick

312
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,620
Gabby Hayes

313
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,460
Andy Devine

314
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,840
And many others

315
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,620
What about Robin?

316
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,360
Oh, resin

317
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,240
Oh my God

318
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,660
Oh, no

319
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,060
He is risen

320
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,500
You pinned the salamander to the wall with resin?

321
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,000
Cool it

322
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,760
So, I haven't seen you in six years

323
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,460
Video and radio

324
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,060
And instead of having a conversation

325
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,840
We're just going to get on the radio and rant

326
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,380
Yes, I think that's the general idea

327
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,480
We'll just get on and deliver a load of blather

328
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,920
This actually makes more sense than the real world

329
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,740
Some supposed quote real unquote conversation we might have

330
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,540
Yes, because...

331
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,780
Then we just live in the dark

332
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,760
They are forced to listen to you

333
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,300
Duh

334
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,660
And now we may speak without contradiction or interruption

335
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,760
Duh

336
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:38,860
Yes

337
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,620
So now that we got rid of all the contradictions, obstacles and interruptions

338
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,380
And now we can't think of anything to say

339
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,640
Well, we could tell them about our plan for future domination of the world

340
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,600
Yeah, well, just tell them about commotion instead

341
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:51,940
Excess

342
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,760
Talking about future

343
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,000
Commotion, yeah, that's where it starts or where one of them starts

344
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,980
We're going to make the world eat out of a dog bowl, man

345
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,480
You'll see that

346
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,820
But first you buy the world a coke

347
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,600
And keep it company

348
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,600
And pull its pants down to its shoes

349
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,080
And...

350
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,260
And Jaina Hyperclete at the club commotion at the horror church

351
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,060
That's right, that's quite true

352
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,860
I, Dr. Howell, will be present in a spiritual fashion

353
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,820
To shepherd the proceedings through thick and thin

354
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,600
All the naked women and whores will have to...

355
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,660
Obey the common rules of civility and parliamentary procedure

356
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,180
Are you going to have a...

357
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,420
Under my eager tutelage

358
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,920
The resident Eskimo

359
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,320
So if you don't remember to send money

360
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,440
To bring money

361
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,180
To also to send money

362
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,940
You should bring money because there is a cover charge of three bucks

363
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,380
Or if you take off all your clothes, they'll put them in a plastic bag

364
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:53,720
And naked as you were born, you may enter the presence of Saint Jaina the Hyperclete

365
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,220
You're not kidding, neither

366
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,620
This is really real

367
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,120
I told you this is real

368
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,120
This is not some satire that we're making up

369
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,180
No, no, this time we're serious

370
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,120
We're like...

371
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,080
No, this isn't part of a rant

372
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,780
It's really...

373
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,440
It's really...

374
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,100
It's not a joke

375
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,100
Okay, well it is sort of a joke

376
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,320
But it means a real joke

377
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,380
It's not a fake joke

378
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:11,640
Don't...

379
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,940
Don't lie in that way

380
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,240
I...

381
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,720
Just tell them it's real, brother

382
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,580
What about that part?

383
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:15,960
Is that real?

384
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,500
And it really, really works

385
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,060
Ronco presents the Cap Snapper

386
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,740
And you also get Jaina Hyperclete appearing at Club Commotion

387
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,000
Ow!

388
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,200
As part of the horror show

389
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,200


390
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,200


391
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,200


392
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,200


393
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,200


394
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,200


395
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,200


396
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,780
And you use the project to fire starters

397
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,400
And there's more

398
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,020
You use fire starters to fire starters

399
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,420
And it really, really works

400
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:38,660
And remember, every donate, every penny you donate to the My Wallet Foundation, nothing

401
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,560
is taken out for advertising costs, nothing is taken out for administration costs, there's

402
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,520
no fancy limos

403
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,400
Every cent you donate goes directly into My Wallet

404
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,140
No other charity can make that claim

405
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,620
Well, you see, this is part of a program which has been attracting lots of attention

406
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,460
in the greater Bay Area

407
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,120
I'll send you my porn

408
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,200
You're not gonna get it

409
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,200


410
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,200


411
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,200


412
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,200


413
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:01,740
And in all of Northern and Central California, the rush, the headline rush to give all you

414
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,160
have to Jaina Hyperclete

415
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,360
Whistled right into the ground, buddy

416
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,000
Is one of the most astonishing phenomena of modern times

417
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,240
Yes, we're down here on Channel X, you can see the Jaina device and Dr. Howell, there

418
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,480
they go, they're engaging now in the liquid slack bank

419
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,840
Wow, I'm really getting a lot of attention, that's why I went into show business the first

420
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:17,840


421
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,460
Now the nurses have washed the Jaina off

422
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,080
I have to go to the bathroom for some reason

423
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,760
They're beginning to clean the fins

424
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,160
Hello

425
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,800
At our Jaina 7-Hour Channel

426
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,200
Yes, we've got a little bit of a show here

427
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:25,520
Please join us

428
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,560
We'll allow you to go to the bathroom

429
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,100
Here on the air

430
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,420
Until you absorb our message

431
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:29,540
In six

432
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,460
Don't be afraid to jump right in

433
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:31,800
It won't hurt

434
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,700
Listen to 16 hours of solid ranting from Jaina Hyperclete at our Jaina trademark seminars

435
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,000
Some people swear by these techniques and you also get there

436
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,620
Okay, what's the problem?

437
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:41,840
Jaina Hyperclete's ranting

438
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,640
We will try to help you

439
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,180
This young man needs help, doctors

440
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,200
See the 72-foot blue octopus with the percolating something

441
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,840
You'll have to join in there, sir

442
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,500
See the giant flying bat

443
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,040
Boom, thong, fin

444
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,640
Down, careful

445
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,060
Limbo dance

446
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:16,220
Badim

447
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,360
Hello

448
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,360


449
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,420
Thong

450
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:16,960
Jump

451
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:16,960


452
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:16,960


453
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:16,960


454
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,320
Oh, I'm so happy

455
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,700
They're so happy to see someone else

456
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,840
Malcolm

457
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,680
Dominique

458
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:22,680


459
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,480
Bon Appétit

460
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:23,980
Oh

461
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,900
Bob's is Bob's.

462
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,780
Great Bob.

463
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,840
How you doing, son?

464
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,980
I'm, I'm, I'm...

465
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,100
Poor Bob.

466
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,040
Thanks, Bob.

467
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,260
I almost felt sorry for you.

468
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
All right, thanks, Bob.

469
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,380
Thanks for coming to the show.

470
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,360
But, you know, the, um...

471
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,520
What really disgusted me more about that

472
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,120
than the fact that they couldn't spell Bob's name right

473
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,040
and they had the dates wrong and all that shit

474
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,160
was the way the normals,

475
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,620
the normals took it upon themselves to go,

476
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,000
oh, all these pundits on television and the radio

477
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,920
had to take it upon themselves to go,

478
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:08,140
gosh, isn't it a shame about those silly, superstitious weirdos

479
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,740
who believe that some invisible space gods

480
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,760
would save them if they kissed its ass enough?

481
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,540
Gee, isn't that terrible?

482
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,360
And what it boiled down to was it was a society of Americans

483
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,940
and everybody all over the world

484
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,300
basically saying to the Heaven's Gators

485
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,120
and any other kind of dead weirdos,

486
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,500
ha, ha, ha, my invisible monster

487
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,320
is bigger than your invisible monster.

488
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,120
Nya, nya, nya, nya, nya.

489
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,200
Mine let me live and yours killed you.

490
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,320
Now, friends, you might laugh at how, you know,

491
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,960
these are the same people that believe Noah built a boat

492
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,060
that took two of every animal on it.

493
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,380
And you can laugh, but the fact is

494
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,500
87% of Americans believe

495
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,440
really believe in that invisible monster.

496
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,060
And because of them,

497
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,080
there is a fucking invisible monster up there.

498
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,520
But, friends, you can fight back.

499
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,960
We will fight back.

500
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,580
As a matter of fact, we will turn the tables.

501
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,160
And as of this moment,

502
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,860
we now declare war on God.

503
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,020
Now, I'd say that takes a little bit of balls,

504
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,580
don't you think, in ovaries?

505
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,700
It's not everything.

506
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,660
It's not the church that declares war on God.

507
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,540
But just between you and me,

508
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,020
I find it rather offensive when

509
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,440
little old ladies and conservative pinch-faced yo-yos

510
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,140
feel like God is not big and strong enough

511
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,360
to protect himself from the offensive statements

512
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,520
of people like me.

513
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,040
You know, really, I mean, think about it.

514
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,640
There's, um, didn't, didn't,

515
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,940
wasn't there something in the Bible about

516
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,180
vengeance is mine, saith the Lord?

517
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,920
You know, don't these dumbasses give God

518
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,860
enough credit to be able to kick my ass?

519
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,760
Do they have to, you know, hold protests and have genius?

520
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,540
I wish they would, actually, God.

521
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,940
It makes me sick that they let us get away with this.

522
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,200
This country's going to the dog.

523
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,600
Thank God, thank, praise Bob,

524
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,080
there's only 245 days left.

525
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,580
Ah!

526
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,480
Ah!

527
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,100
War on God

528
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,620
War on God

529
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:52,920
War on God

530
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,680
War on God

531
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:55,740
War on God

532
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:05,320
War on God

533
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,460
War on God

534
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,360
War on God

535
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:12,840
War on God

536
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,300
War on God

537
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:15,900
War on God

538
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,740
Well, let me put it this way, okay,

539
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,680
a lot of people, if you just pick up

540
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,140
oh, um, some

541
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,800
magazine,

542
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,160
article about Church of the subgenius they always get wrong and they'll start going well it's for

543
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,420
the slackers yeah that's it you know like Generation X it's a religion for slackers

544
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:04,300
but still Bob's idea of slack is the diametric opposite of what the conspiracy wants you to

545
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:11,980
think Bob's idea of slack is the conspiracy wants to speak for Bob Dobbs himself and say

546
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:18,580
oh slack you know man slack that's like when life becomes a big Miller beer commercial

547
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,780
you drink a 12-pack your team wins sorry

548
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,820
you

549
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:29,520
you're watching your very favorite show and you're doing a nice job that doesn't really

550
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,020
challenge anybody and and by the way stay away from that creepy internet and don't turn

551
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:40,400

556
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,220
you can watch some crap on that tube

you know drinking beer all day and watching your favorite cartoons praise bob but it can also be a

560
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:19,960
frenzied insane level of uber work in the service of bob dobbs or even in the service of yourself

561
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:27,560
it can be such a high level of activity and so little sleep that your third eye snaps open

562
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:35,860
and for once for once in your life you're smart enough just for an instant to realize that you

563
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:43,800
are god life is worth living and the world is still just as cool and psychedelic and beautiful

564
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:53,560
as that old t-shirt that you can't fit into anymore now hold that thought hold that thought

565
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,380
just hang on to it get a grip on that slippery thing and and pay

566
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:57,540
it back

567
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:03,860
friends because i know how easy it is to let the conspiracy or the day job you know the

568
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:09,220
the depression the pittness all around you to drag you down i know how that works

569
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:17,380
but you can break the cycle you can break that evil cycle and we're here to prove it

570
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:25,220
we're here to prove that by example that you can indeed get rich but without working price bomb

571
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:33,080
but there's only one there's only one way to do that friends you've got to just you've got to just say no

572
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:42,220
to jobs just say no to jobs you've got to get off your butt and do it yourself don't expect

573
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:50,800
the aliens or the or magic to save you i know there's probably some people here that really

574
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,480
you know they go well i know that praying won't help but if i do magic and obey you know and do

575
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,660
like that alistair crowley and all that cool stuff then i'll have my own guardian demons and stuff

576
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:12,220
friends magic may be real but uh judging by its practitioners belief in it i'm afraid does

577
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:20,820
defeat the purpose and as for the aliens oh well you know you can wait for the aliens which ones

578
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,220
you're gonna wait for little pipsqueak greys the ones with the flying saucers that crash

579
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,460
you're gonna have to do it yourself friends

580
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:36,780
you can learn to think for yourself but only bob can show you how and that's this this religion in

581
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:42,020
fact any religion all religions that's all it is it's just a big pep talk it's kind of like a booster

00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:23,260
now needless to say friends all of these rules all kinds of rules like they teach in most religions should be plain common sense

611
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,580

612
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,400

619
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,860
personal hygiene could go a long way in that direction it really could I want

620
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,820
you to stop and think about that that inner subgenius short duration personal

621
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,220
marriage available right here about two hours from now

00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,040
no but seriously friends whatever happened in common sense you know you

623
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,240
would think that you would that people would wouldn't have to be told over and

624
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:35,120
over again be nice to other people and other people will be nice to you

625
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,400
actually that doesn't always work out that way and you know some people are

626
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,620
just plain assholes and you should avoid them or kill them repent quit your job

627
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:50,860
slack off salvation begins at home stay home from your job

628
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,940
stay home people were saying ah

629
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:01,940


630
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:07,060
Qué 살� la vida

631
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:07,640
H Lions

632
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:07,640


633
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,800
my facebook business

634
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:09,960
which has changed

635
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,320
an ordinary ind transient

636
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:10,320


637
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,720
Под Hayres

638
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,080
really

639
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,380
obtaining

640
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,420
everything

641
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,040
is not done

642
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,340
you get past society

643
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,840
and people can't stop you

644
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,020
but people get violent

645
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,760
television consciousness, and true slack consciousness.

646
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:34,040
In other words, the difference between those who have made the effort

647
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,660
to pay attention to the slack that is already there.

648
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,080
You're waiting up your neck in a sea of Bob's pills.

649
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,300
You're just too deaf, dumb, and blind and toneless to taste them, friends.

650
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,860
So don't let the conspiracy turn it into slackers versus slack

651
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,280
or the cutesy Bob versus the real Bob.

652
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,320
You know, we're now, we've been around 15 years,

653
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,180
and now we're the official, authorized, anti-establishment institution.

654
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,260
And as such, we're looking for the down-home, for real people,

655
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,780
the gamblers, players, pips, bulldiggers, perverts, weirdos.

656
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,800
Friends, do you pee? Do you pee? Do you pee?

657
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,880
Do you pee?

658
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,940
Then you're probably, you're sure to be interested in what I have to say tonight.

659

660
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,300
Ah, yes dear friends, and uh,

661
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,860
I've been wanting to do a, um, a little, a little tribute

662
00:30:53,280 --> 00:31:02,960
subgenius band called Indian Rope Burn for a while here. These guys have played at almost

663
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,680
every show we've done up in the Cleveland area over the years, and that's a lot of shows.

664
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:13,500
We're not able to play at the last one, and so I'm going to make up for that.

665
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,120
As of right this minute, Indian Rope Burn, friends. Thank you.

689
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,380
The rats in the fountain, along with men.

690
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,600
My heart is bursting, the love you give.

691
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,760
The rats in the fountain, for draining fish.

692
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,760
Straight trigger mounting, keep me from them.

693
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,240
The rats in the fountain, stand by for mine.

694
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,460
For mind control, stand by for mine.

695
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,220
For mind control.

696
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,080
I can't understand the world.

697
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,380
I can't understand the world.

698
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:37,160
I'm the heavy mama.

699
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,280
Positively, the finest soul.

700
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,420
Brain moving darkness, the smell of the wind.

701
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,420
The lights of downtown, start again.

702
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,640
Delicious cycle, party and slip.

703
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,820
My friend Antoine, busted lip.

704
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,140
Scrap sheeting metal, your gleam of noise.

705
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,400
Contain the answer, I'll hear the voice.

706
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,860
I can't understand the world.

707
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:14,780
I can't stand to hear the voice.

708
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,960
I can't understand the prize.

709
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:19,960


710
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,800
Oftentimes strong, I feel shook.

711
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,920
Buthistic, how to hear the voice.

712
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:25,920


713
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:25,920


714
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:43,220
A real grass- perseverance K

715
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:43,220


716
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:43,220


717
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:43,280
Is that the question?

718
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,280


719
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,280


720
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,980
You're on time.

721
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,140
100 years.

722
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:46,180
90 years.

723
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,200
in farming.

724
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:57,420
I can't understand the world

725
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,080
It's bad to hear the voice

726
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,740
I can't understand the world

727
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,340
It's bad to hear the voice

728
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,980
I can't understand the world

729
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:18,660
It's bad to hear the voice

730
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,200
I can't understand the world

731
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,100
It's bad to hear the voice

732
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:13,960
It's bad to hear the voice

733
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:43,540
It's bad to hear the voice

734
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,680
It's bad to hear the voice

735
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:58,220
Oh-oh الaaa Oh-oh الaaa

736
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,560
Oh friend

737
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:12,920
Oh friend

738
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:13,960


739
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,080
This is the song I did the video garage for.

740
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,940
I wish that someday y'all could see it.

741
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,380
It was full of the most delicious Hong Kong evil.

742
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,400
The thoughts remain, arms and legs feel the same.

743
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,920
Swing the whip, caress the feet.

744
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,140
Your pleasure is my pain.

745
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,460
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red light.

746
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:23,280
The red light, the red light, the red light still burns in your eyes.

747
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:31,040
The red light, the red light, the red light still burns in your eyes.

748
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,880
The faces change, the thoughts remain.

749
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,500
Arms and legs feel the same.

750
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:43,960
Still the same.

751
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:43,960


752
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,180
Illuminate the darkness.

753
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,920
Skip your love for me.

754
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,860
Cut down your soul, build it up again.

755
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:57,960
The red light, the red light, the red light still burns in your eyes.

756
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:05,940
The red light, the red light, the red light still burns in your eyes.

757
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,780
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red light.

758
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:22,080
You now know why I'm alive.

759
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,940
Cold and cold.

760
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,000
And I don't let the boring past痛.

761
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,000


762
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,920
For a sad, wanting husband.

763
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,040
Straight to a very cold love that I don't care how I maybe have felt.

764
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,060
So sweet, happy, wonderful and degrading…

765
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,060


766
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:39,280
The такое, the terror, you and your gang are the ultimate superhero.

767
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,280


768
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,280


769
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,280


770
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,440
But now come back how I once became yours.

771
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,560
I'm the second baby, the Quarren leader's physician from a faừ.

772
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:41,560


773
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:41,560


774
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:41,560


775
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:41,560


776
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,060
So, let's face this.

777
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:43,420
Cut it.

778
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,860
Through the city, underground

779
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,300
The sirens scream tonight

780
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,060
Meet me there, the sacred hall

781
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,300
Turn on your red light

782
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,620
The faces change, the thoughts remain

783
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,940
Arms and legs feel the same

784
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,520
Swing the whip, caress the feet

785
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,820
Your pleasure is my pain

786
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,740
The red light, the red light

787
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,960
Red light, red light, red light, red light

788
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,220
Yes dear friends, it's Indian rope

789
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:35,740
Red light, red light, red light, red light

790
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,320
Red light, red light, red light

791
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,980
Available once again from

792
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,280
PO Box 1784

793
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,320
Kent, Ohio 44240

794
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,880
Yes, friends, it's kind of like for a long time there,

795
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,920
it wasn't really a subgenius revival in Cleveland

796
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,300
or Clevelandian areas in northern Ohio

797
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,940
without Indian rope burn.

798
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,740
And, yes.

799
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,180
Yes.

800
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,480
I wish I could show you the video for that one, friends.

801
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,720
Yes.

802
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,160
Oh, thank you.

803
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,500
Ha, ha.

804
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,380
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

805
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,220
Whoa.

806
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,520
Ah.

807
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,380
Ah.

808
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:18,960
Ah.

809
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,780
Ah.

810
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,360
Ah.

811
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:20,520
Ah.

812
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:20,620


813
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,320
Ah.

814
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,320


815
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,320


816
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,320


817
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,320


818
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,320


819
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,320


820
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,320


821
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,460
Ah.

822
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:22,760
Ah.

823
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,740
I will hit the little button that starts the song.

824
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,360
Ah.

825
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:35,860
Ah.

826
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,460
Ah.

827
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,440
Ah.

828
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,540
Ah.

829
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,020
Ah.

830
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,140
Ah.

831
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,200
Ah.

832
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,200
Ah.

833
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:53,360


834
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,340
Ah.

835
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:56,640
Ah.

836
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:57,320
Ah.

837
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,220
Ah.

838
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:58,980


839
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,000
Ah.

840
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,100
Ah.

841
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:00,100


842
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:00,260
Ah.

843
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,260


844
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,260


845
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,260


846
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,260


847
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,260


848
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,260


849
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,260


850
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,100
Okay, friends.

851
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,980
I'm gonna try something here.

852
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:10,160
I'm gonna try to play back the recordings of the prank calls made to a Christian radio

853
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:21,060
station in another state from the subgenius devival in Austin, Texas by the

854
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:28,520
group of prank or telephone sociological experimenters called the Crystal

855
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:35,380
Methodists. Okay friends, this is the Crystal Methodists trying to ply their

856
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:43,460
trade live over loudspeakers being overheard by an entire paying audience at

857
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:50,800
a subgenius show, but at the same time trying to prank a talk show host or a

858
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,420
series of talk show hosts actually at a Christian talk radio station a thousand

859
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:04,120
miles away. This was at the Austin Devival a couple of months ago thanks to

860
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,200
Fringeware.

861
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,660
Fascism for the individual! It's what we call

862
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:16,060
patriopsychotic and narco materialism. The political party of the Church of the Subgenius.

863
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:16,600
How you doing Josh?

864
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,420
Yeah, pretty good. Is this the Leaf here?

865
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,020
It is Leaf.

866
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,240
Yeah, how you doing?

867
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,300
I'm fine, what's on your mind?

868
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:31,720
Well, I'm calling up because, well, I have two concerns here. One of them is, well, I really like what you're saying about the

869
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,420
humanism in the church today in America.

870
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,360
I've had two concerns.

871
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,640
I've had some first-hand experience.

872
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,100
You're probably one of them, right?

873
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:43,380
Hedonism in the church? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I'll get to me later.

874
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:58,460
But first, a town of mine, well, he and I have been messing around with different forms of religion and in particular a cult called the Church of the Subgenius.

875
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,740
Now, this cult of the subgenius is dangerous.

876
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,340
I'm sure it is, Josh, but we're talking about hedonism tonight. I don't know what you're talking about.

877
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:05,340


878
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:05,340


879
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,640
I want to talk about the Church of the Subgenius.

880
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,380
I'm getting to that. I'm getting to that.

881
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:13,100
Well, you better get there quickly, my friend, or otherwise I'm going to dump you.

882
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:18,860
Oh, okay. All right. He was a good Christian. I turned him over to Bob in the worship of Splash.

883
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:19,500
What?

884
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:32,380
And he took it to such an extreme that he gave up all worldly possessions to live in a cave in Arizona, relying on nothing but the Lord to keep him alive.

885
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,080
Now, if that isn't crazy.

886
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,180
I don't know what is. And it's all thanks to this Bob.

887
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,420
Well, Bob's on the other line, so let's go to Bob and see what Bob has to say. Bob, are you there?

888
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,540
Yes, sir.

889
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,260
Is this the Bob that took everybody out in the desert and lived in caves?

890
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,320
No, I'm just Bob, just regular Bob.

891
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:56,980
Oh, okay. Well, you heard the other guy talking about Bob, and I saw your name, Bob, and you're calling from the same city, and I just figured you're maybe the cave dweller guy or something.

892
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,520
That's crazy.

893
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,440
What's up, Bob?

894
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:04,420
No, I've been accused of being a cave dweller. I'm always on my computer.

895
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:08,360
But other than that, I get out every now and then.

896
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:27,840
Well, friends, I changed my mind. I decided that the sound quality on that recording is so bad that that requires us to go back to the Cleveland show, which was recorded quite a bit better, where there was a song, in fact, about weirdos in Arizona.

897
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:33,640
This is Einstein's Secret Orchestra doing the song.

898
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:51,860
Now, we will come back to the crystal Methodist amazing pranking of that Christian radio station probably next week, because it really deserves an entire show devoted to it.

899
00:46:51,940 --> 00:47:04,400
They not only had Brother Russell, or Melba, as the case may be, calling from our devival, but they also had subgeniuses connected through the radio station.

900
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:04,400


901
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:04,400


902
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:25,300
They were all over the country calling that same station that same night, and repeatedly bringing up the subject of Bob Dobbs, Church of the Subgenius, and so forth, and basically driving the poor bastard crazy to the great astonished amusement of the live audience at the Austin concert.

903
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:29,160
But we'll do that next week.

904
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:34,320
In the meantime, the truth about the state of Arizona.

905
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:34,400


906
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:34,400


907
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,600
It's not a place you want to go alone.

908
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:43,600
It's not a place you want to go if you have too many clothes.

909
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,940
It's not the place you want to go.

910
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,300
Toe or allergic to red clay and red sand.

911
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,200
It's not a place at all.

912
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,220
This is a true story.

913
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,360
It's a part of your brain.

914
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,540
Another true story.

915
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,700
It's another true testimonial tonight.

916
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,960
I want to tell to you all tonight this true story.

917
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,260
It happened in Arizona.

918
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,600
And we were camping out.

919
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,980
Actually, Michelle and I, the violinist Michelle and I were camping out.

920
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,640
I thought you were with Louie that night.

921
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,720
Guitarist Lonesome Cowboy Dave was not there.

922
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,160
Other guitarist Lou Kolai was also not there.

923
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,860
And our drummer Bob Mosick was not there either.

924
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,180
It was just Michelle and I.

925
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:33,460
And we were there camping out about a mile from the Grand Canyon.

926
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,460
At about 3 in the morning.

927
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,640
Sparks started to fly in the sky.

928
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,040
I came down there.

929
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,280
And we noticed that there were black ravens flying in the sky at night.

930
00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:02,780
And there was this guy out there in the middle of the wilderness, the middle of the desert.

931
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,200
At 3 in the morning.

932
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,320
Just chanting.

933
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,220
.

934
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:15,980

940
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:21,540

00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:58,500

946
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,760
espanyol Cantiles fumaria arrugado,

947
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:15,820
I'm riding alone out on my own in a land of sand and stone.

948
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,300
I'm living in Arizona.

949
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:24,340
I'm living in Arizona.

950
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,500
I'm living in Arizona.

951
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,560
I'm living in Arizona.

952
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,620
I'm living in Arizona.

953
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:12,580
I work with my hands in a land born free.

954
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,440
Live in a white house in Canyon DeShay.

955
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:22,740
What I take I give to living in peace.

956
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:28,860
Awareness is a universe through your eyes and sees and knows.

957
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:29,320
Sweet.

958
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,080
Deep in duties are a state of mind.

959
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,200
You're so at sea.

960
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,400
They just walk, walk, walk into the light.

961
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,640
And I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I work with my hands.

962
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,340
I work with my hands.

963
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,140
Building castles made of sand.

964
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:58,520
I'm riding alone out on my own in a land of sand and stone.

965
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,880
I'm living in Arizona.

I'm living in Arizona.

969
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:18,800
I'm living in Arizona.

970
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,220
I'm living in Arizona.

971
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,320
It's beautiful now.

972
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:27,840
But what kind of living in Arizona do you want to have to survive on this planet?

973
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:27,860
Is it better because an operator will take care of you first?

974
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:27,860


975
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:27,880
No, I've lived very few settled in the US.

976

Yes, dear friends, you're listening to

989
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,500
Goodbye, Mom.

Goodbye, Dad.

991
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,420
Goodbye, Chaz.

992
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,080
Goodbye, Dave.

993
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,980
I gotta go in the tuna can now, Ma.

994
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,800
I gotta get on the pleasure ship.

995
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,080
Time for the launch.

996
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,600
I gotta go on the pleasure ship now, Ma.

997
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,000
It's X-Day.

998
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,280
I gotta go into space, Ma.

999
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,680
Goodbye, son.

1000
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,220
You know how them Smith boys

1001
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:27,540
are.

1002
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,820
And I'm never coming home.

1003
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,580
Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

1004
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,900

a couple of months ago.

1008
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,460
Yes, and

1009
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,940
before we continue,

1010
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,260

1013
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,480
Orchestra, and here's a

1014
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:58,580
little bit of a sneak peek.

1015
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,300
Here's their Thursday night

obtain CDs

1020
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,300

who we have not played at all tonight,

1022
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,300
but for the last

1023
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,580
four shows we did,

1024
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,620
from www.

1035
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,640
It's coming back up.

1036
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,000
Yeah.

1037
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,400
Whoa!

1038
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,180
It's intense, man.

1039
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,760
Do some really sick twisted things

1040
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,140
so you don't want to miss what's happening.

1041
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,160
Is that my penis buzzing?

1042
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,260
No, it's the back of my neck.

1043
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:11,060
I hear the voices again.

1044
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,660
This is a...

1045
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:16,420
This is a part that's just like a rock concert.

1046
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,960
So if you all want,

1047
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,100
you can take out your lighters

1048
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,120
and sway back and forth

1049
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:21,840
to the beat.

1050
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,080
There.

1051
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,160
Just like a real rock show.

1052
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:35,280
The day unfolds

1053
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,020
from lamplight streams

1054
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,480
The asphalt shimmers

1055
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,720
from blackened streams

1056
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:49,680
And all about my feel and smell

1057
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,040
and sense your presence, Neil

1058
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,660
The lines are drawn

1059
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,480
the wrong direction

1060
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,460
Then I am the one

1061
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:58,660
I'm aware

1062
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:01,380
No words in books

1063
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,060
here have a look

1064
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:05,580
There's something in the air

1065
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:08,160
And measurements of time

1066
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,720
are crumble and climb

1067
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,400
For Jaguar

1068
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,100
Knight

1069
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,080
and White Deer

1070
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,220
So I'm drooling

1071
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,560
And stopping late

1072
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:35,140
I don't know, I really, I'm dazzled

1073
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,860
I don't know what I know

1074
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:37,060
Oh, look at all that

1075
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:40,580
Just let me at least

1076
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,560
do something

1077
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,960
For all theseachusetts

1078
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:49,520
On every conventional

1079
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:49,520


1080
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,020
drop-in

1081
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:52,020
I ain't home that night

1082
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:55,340
I won't be in doom

1083
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:57,200
I'll arrive home

1084
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:04,180
Measurements of time, a couple of times, for day or night, that's why it's me.

1085
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:49,620
Living in jungles of radio waves, never now or ever or yesterday,

1086
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,360
and just now in the air, we're black.

1087
00:58:57,140 --> 00:59:02,800
Well, just now in the air, we ran out of the tape.

1088
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:09,960
And so we go from Einstein's Secret Orchestra to back to the 70s.

1089
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,000
Actually, this is from the 90s.

1090
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,840
Guitar god Frank Marino. Thank you.

1091
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:17,880
guitar solo

1092
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:51,120
Well, I see your power, baby, now.

1093
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:56,260
And I see your power coming around.

1094
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:01,620
I see your children lashing out

1095
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:08,160
I see you're going down for the count

1096
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,000
Hey!

1097
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,320
Hey!

1098
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:16,980
Hey!

1099
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:17,000
Hey!

1100
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,660
I've never loved you

1101
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:26,000
But what you're gonna be

1102
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:33,720
You've never gone too sweet

1103
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,160
Hey!

1104
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:35,340


1105
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:36,320
Hey!

1106
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,040
Hey!

1107
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:42,560
I see you riding on the road

1108
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,800
I see you headed for a fall

1109
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:53,280
I see you ballooning on your best

1110
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:59,540
I see that you're going down with a last

1111
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:11,480
Thank you.
