1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920
It has become more absolute that the wealth of the nation consists in the number of superior men that it harbors.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,320
Ass up, genius!

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,160
Howard has slack!

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,700
Come in! Come in, sergeant! Stop that noise! Come in!

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,400
Why do you stand there? What is it?

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,360
Speak up, you empty head!

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,840
Do you keep watching the clock?

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,020
Do you run down and jittery?

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,360
Do you tire? Do you never end?

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,600
If that's how you feel, for your own sake, try Subjetiometer.

11
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,760
That's right. Subjetiometer gives you glorious strength, energy, and needed vital substances.

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,280
Plus iron. The name is Subjetiometer.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,440
And now, turn off your radio.

14
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:50,860
Now.

15
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,360
And the local business has donated $2,000 to Bob.

16
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:13,320
Because Bob is going to save and recharge the spiritual batteries of those young Christian youths.

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,100
My friends, but I want you to know something very important that you must face.

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,640
And that is that the subgeniuses have been watching you, Americans.

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:27,880
Yes.

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,660
Waiting.

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,600
And planning.

22
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,940
And training with the most grim and terrible purpose.

23
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:44,120
But here and there, oh, comedy, certainly to lift our spirits, as the liberal media declares.

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,500
The subgeniuses, oh, the subgeniuses, says the liberal media, are all washed up.

25
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,020
Oh, out-of-date cavemen. Gun nuts. Nuts, they call us.

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,540
Now we think about your hateful slanders, Americans.

27
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:06,880
And they shall play upon our lips as we introduce the bureaucratic infidels to their duly appointed rendezvous with eternal torture.

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,480
Oh, so Bob is out-of-date, huh?

29
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:18,680
When your own pink media reports over half of Americans believe the biblical book of the subgenius end times shall befall this generation?

30
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,820
Oh, practice your weeping, Americans.

31
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:29,000
For this shall be the plague wherewith Bob will smite all the people who have fought against him.

32
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,760
And the people who have fought against Jerusalem and Dallas.

33
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,520
Their feet shall consume away while they stand upon their feet.

34
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,920
Listen up, you evolutionists, bureaucrats, peaceniks.

35
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,080
And their eyes shall consume away in their holes.

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,880
And their tongues shall consume away in their mouths.

37
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,000
Zechariah 14, 12.

38
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,600
The Lord is sore displeased.

39
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,040
The earth shall be utterly laid waste and utterly dispoiled, for the Lord hath spoken his word.

40
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,520
Isaiah 24, 3.

41
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,000
True subgeniuses have real family values.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000


43
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:07,460
My friends, they do not abandon their issue to socialist daycare indoctrination robot scarecrow centers.

44
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,880
Oh, practice your weeping, Americans.

45
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,200
Christians.

46
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:21,420
The school prayer ruling by the satanic mind-control Frankenstein puppet Supreme Court.

47
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,680
Oh, go ahead, sure.

48
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,700
This is but the final insult to Dobbs.

49
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,660
This...

50
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:35,820
This nation hath known naught but chaos and piqueness since Lincoln, upon orders from his masonic masters,

51
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:46,900
did most illegally, unconstitutionally, and immorally in rendering void with but a stroke of his bloody pen the private property of patriots.

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:55,320
This indeed was the wake-up call for the book of the subgenius believing subgeni.

53
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,580
This was the natural order perverted.

54
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,360
Bob's plan mocked.

55
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,700
And ever since that infamous act, up has been called down.

56
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,580
Black has been called white.

57
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,780
Evil has been called good.

58
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:24,280
And the madness of orchestrated global war is only one more global war to go, praise Bob, with fearsome persecutions, till at last we greet the reign of the Prince of Slack, our savior.

59
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,300
Bob hath been slain.

60
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,460
And hath been plotting his most glorious vengeance.

61
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,760
Until now.

62
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,720
South Africa has fallen to the Communists, pledged its allegiance to the Dark One.

63
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,780
It is plain to all with but an ounce of liquor sense that we, we are next.

64
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,160
Some TV whore, choked with Jezebel hate, screeches,

65
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,160
I fear to live in a country with two hundred million guns.

66
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,620
You don't like it, harlot?

67
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,560
You can get the hell out.

68
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,540
Not that there will be anywhere safe to hide once the nukes start flying, pink boy.

69
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,940
Thus saith the Lord, behold, I am shaping evil against you and devising a plan against you, Jeremiah 1911.

70
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:17,680
Satan's mighty armies, the armies of the pink, the armies of the Democrats, the armies of the Republicans, the armies of, yes, the Libertarians and the Peroninaitists,

71
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,700
staffed with moral degenerates, so-called Americans,

72
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,540
are arrayed against the subgenius patriots.

73
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,980
As Bob instigates his one-world plot,

74
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,360
praise Bob, have courage, subgeniuses,

75
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,880
the preordained conclusion to the revolution

76
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,200
is that none but the true subgeniuses across this planet shall remain unslain.

77
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,100
Only the subgenius shall remain unslain.

78
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:51,740
This planet, purged of filth,

79
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,360
of ungodliness, yes,

80
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,680
of anti-Dobbs,

81
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,580
psst, of hates,

82
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,720
of half-assed, pinky-winky, normall hate,

83
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,860
the infidels, all,

84
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:17,620
all shall be purged on that great day, X-Day, 1998, July 5th at 7 o'clock in the morning,

85
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,340
when those of us who have our subgenius membership cards in our pocket

86
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,640
will be ruptured up into power and glory upon the space vessels of the escaped goddesses.

87
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,480
Ah, yes, you've heard it so many times,

88
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,640
but, you know, I just love to remind the others,

89
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,540
because I know, subgeniuses, that there are others lurking, listening, all the time.

90
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,140
Sure, they monitor us.

91
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,860
The other, the other hates us.

92
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:48,840
The other writhes in jealousy to hear us bespeak the glory,

93
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,520
the naked glory.

94
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,120
Of the word of Bob.

95
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,780
Oh, yeah, they're jealous.

96
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:01,200
They, and then, you know, funny thing is, at the same time, they are just so sure that we're going to hell.

97
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,300
I'm not so sure they're so sure about that, friends, and I think you can hear.

98
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,740
I understand them.

99
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,120
They don't understand me.

100
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,600
They are the normals.

101
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,820
They're all that I'm not.

102
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,520
But I'm a subgenius, a whole different species.

103
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,580
If I had my way, they all would be shot.

104
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,480
For when I was young, the pinks ruled the world.

105
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,540
Now all that has changed, cause Bob's flag's unfurled.

106
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,960
I spit on normals, cause I hate their guts.

107
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,500
I am a subgenius.

108
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:48,840
I am a subgenius.

109
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,640
They like their jobs for all the wrong reasons.

110
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,060
They wear me down with their false holler smiles.

111
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,040
But my kind triumphed, and now we will kill them.

112
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,520
Dead normal bodies for mile after mile.

113
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,240
For when I was young, the normals held sway.

114
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,940
Now all that has changed, cause Bob has his day.

115
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,040
My shoe will soon kick a hole in their butts.

116
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,460
I am a subgenius.

117
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:32,800
I am a subgenius.

118
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,300
I am not bitter for all they did to me.

119
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,360
They're only humans.

120
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,620
They're deaf, mute, and blind.

121
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,900
But I am a subgenius, and I have a duty.

122
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,200
The utter destruction of all humankind.

123
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,000
For when I was young, the pinks ruled the world.

124
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,860
Now all that has changed, cause Bob's flag's unfurled.

125
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,100
Soon I will grind their face in the dust.

126
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,380
I am a subgenius.

127
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,900
I am a subgenius.

128
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,140
I am a subgenius.

129
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,940
Thank you.

130
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,260
Oh, yes, dear friends.

131
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,040
That was Dr. Onan Kanabite with a very, very old song.

132
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,340
Our titles were by Lemur,

133
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,300
and we heard some old rant by yours truly,

134
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,880
Reverend Ivan Stang from the early 90s.

135
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,340
Now, from Madison, Wisconsin in 1996,

136
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,600
the psychoacoustic ladies from WORT.

137
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:54,560
Reverend Velveteen Sly and Heidi during the Subgenius World Tour.

138
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,800
Well, dear friends, I'm most proud to present to you

139
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,060
the psychoacoustic preachers with their special little medieval morality play.

140
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,020
Sister Velveteen Sly and the mighty Heidi.

141
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,040
Thank you.

142
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,340
Thank you.

143
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:13,900
Thank you.

144
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:14,860
Thank you.

145
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:14,860


146
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,140
That will only get you so far.

147
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,400
The money is what counts, and you know it.

148
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,420
We will praise Bob.

149
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,400
We will save these sinners here tonight.

150
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,940
We're not really like this on the radio.

151
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,300
We're usually really naked when we're doing radio.

152
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,780
The power of Bob is near.

153
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,660
I can feel it, friends, I can feel it.

154
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
But we need to do a little invocation.

155
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,700
That's right.

156
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,760
A little consecration.

157
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,200
That's right.

158
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,400
I need everybody's help here.

159
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,000
Now let's see.

160
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,660
From here, where are we at?

161
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,260
This way is north, I think.

162
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:44,800
Right here?

163
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,240
Is that north?

164
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,080
Okay.

165
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:47,980
All right.

166
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,880
We got to do, well, it's not exactly a dance,

167
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,740
but just kind of a little consecration here.

168
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,060
And we have to summon Bob to this space.

169
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,080
Well, even more than he already has been,

170
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,020
but to this ritual right here.

171
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,000
First, we will bob to the north.

172
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,940
It's because it's so damn cold.

173
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,260
And then we will bob to the east.

174
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,120
Oh, give us your ancient Chinese secret.

175
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,740
That's right.

176
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,220
Then we will bob to the south.

177
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,980
Everybody bob.

178
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,060
Cha-cha-cha-cha.

179
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,260
Cha-cha-cha.

180
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,500
And now we will bob to the west.

181
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,280
Yee-haw!

182
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,880
Now bob up and bob down.

183
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,620
And bob all around.

184
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,960
All right.

185
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,620
Good job.

186
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,040
Very good, friends.

187
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,760
And we need our bob signal here.

188
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,920
You got a remote control?

189
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,820
Well, I keep it right here next to my toilet.

190
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,780
Great for that extra meditation.

191
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,200
Alone with Bob.

192
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,520
Send him the bob signal.

193
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,220
All right.

194
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:47,900
What should I do to place?

195
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,500
Flashback.

196
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,840
Yeah, yeah, flashback.

197
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,060
Now, can you hear Bob?

198
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
Can you hear him?

199
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,680
Why doesn't Bob ever talk?

200
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,600
I don't hear him.

201
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,600
Well, you know, the normals can't hear Bob

202
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,040
because he's closed caption for the reality impaired.

203
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,780
Oh, okay.

204
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,220
But can you hear him coming through?

205
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,640
And we'll translate for you.

206
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,240
And the more you pay, the more Bob's word you will hear.

207
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,500
So help us to summon Bob.

208
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,820
Let me hear you say, do you want slack?

209
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:14,920
Yeah.

210
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,080
Do you want slack?

211
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,840
Yeah.

212
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,460
One more time.

213
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,640
Do you want your slack?

214
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,580
Yeah.

215
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,840
Amen.

216
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:23,820
Yes.

217
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,460
A women.

218
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,320
Yes.

219
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,740
And praise Bob.

220
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,360
Praise Bob.

221
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,360


222
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,480
Oh, I believe he's coming now.

223
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:32,820
Praise Bob.

224
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,600
I believe he's coming.

225
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,200
Oh, I believe he's coming.

226
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,440
Oh, let's make it.

227
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,460
Bring lights down for one moment.

228
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,700
So Bob can come to us.

229
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,920
It's time for a miracle.

230
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,280
A miracle from Connie.

231
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,240
I feel her coming through me.

232
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,340
I think, I think Connie needs a little.

233
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:51,880
Step back.

234
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,320
A little dimming of the lights.

235
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,660
I feel, I feel really weird.

236
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,080
Like.

237
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,840
What do you feel, sister?

238
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,620
I feel Connie in me.

239
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:04,940
Let it out.

240
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,960
I feel Connie.

241
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,060
I feel Connie.

242
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,660
Let it out.

243
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,520
Let it out.

244
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:08,820
Let it out.

245
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,800
It's the miracle of Connie's panties.

246
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,700
It's the miracle of Connie's panties.

247
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,880
How sweet she is.

248
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:18,900
Thank you.

249
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,580
Praise sister.

250
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,560
Thank you.

251
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,640
Heidi, for bringing us the miracle of Connie's panties.

252
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,440
Too much Bob, and not enough Connie.

253
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,660
That's a problem with this world.

254
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,840
But we will let Bob have the stage back again.

255
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,200
Smell them.

256
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,520
Smell the panties of Connie.

257
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,200
Thanks a lot.

258
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,440
Smell them.

259
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,940
That's, oh, he's gonna smoke them.

260
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,140
He's smoking those panties.

261
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,760
Stick them in your pipe and smoke them.

262
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,600
Cause you know, without Connie to manipulate the luck plane.

263
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,200
Thank you.

264
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,120
There would be no luck plane for Bob to surf.

265
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,080
I think we'll let Bob have the stage back again, but thanks a lot.

266
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,180
Praise Bob.

267
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

268
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:54,980
.

269
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,680
Hail Connie.

270
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,200
Hail Connie.

271
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,200


272
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,200


273
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,860
Oh, the things, the things I see in this job, dear friends.

274
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,180
The Miracle of Connie's panties, that's a, jeez, that's a new one.

275
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,600
If anybody has any of those extra panties, I never got one.

276
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:27,480
The relating of spiritual declension is never the pretty sight or the pretty picture.

277
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,960
Because as foolish as Bob gets, as foolish as Bob gets,

278
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,540
it's the wisdom of the ages, it's the foolishness and the idiocy

279
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:44,940
that has kept man from being satisfied with his lot in life.

280
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,920
It is that stupidity which has caused man to build his great monuments,

281
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,880
his mighty gas-powered engines, his nuclear reactors.

282
00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:02,100
It is that which has given man his urge to master the entire earth,

283
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,940
no matter what.

284
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,560
No matter how nice it was before.

285
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:13,080
And it is this mighty, sacred archetype of an urge that's in Bob and in all of us

286
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,700
that makes us want to smite our brothers.

287
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,760
And, friends, if it weren't for that, where would us subgeniuses be?

288
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,900
We'd be like everybody else.

289
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,320
We'd be no different.

290
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,660
We'd have nothing to gripe about.

291
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,940
And without the mightiest, the most powerful, the most powerful, the most powerful,

292
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,120
the mighty grunt power and the mighty hate,

293
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,960
the hate for the normal that we can feed,

294
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,400
the hate that can make us go out and earn something for nothing,

295
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:56,800
the hate that will make us overcome every last conspiracy attempt to hold us down that there's ever been.

296
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:02,000
In the long run, we may stay poor and broke, we may stay neurotic,

297
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,020
or whatever we started out as, or whatever we may fall into,

298
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,080
but by God, we've got Bob and Nate!

299
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,320
And for that, we can hate him!

300
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,780
Hate him!

301
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,220
Hate him!

302
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,340
Come to your kindergarten tomorrow.

303
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,100
Don't worry about it.

304
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,640
The spirit of Bob Crane is speaking to your children.

305
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,720
Hey, no problem. Don't worry about it.

306
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,920
He is dancing in the pale moonlight.

307
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,780
You're not going to fight.

308
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,460
Don't worry about it.

309
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,060
Pointing to his hair.

310
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,980
And his glistening pubis as he sings in a high bird-like voice.

311
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,400
Just let them do what they want to do.

312
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,760
Don't worry about it.

313
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,900
Make your body a vessel of this great land.

314
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,000
Sign up. Line up and reenlist today.

315
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,400
You are needed for Uncle Sam's war machine.

316
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,360
Did you hear about, like, they used to do LSD experiments on the soldiers?

317
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,640
And I guess there's some secret Prozac experiments?

318
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,760
That's what happened to Elvis.

319
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,040
Yeah.

320
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,180
Yeah, and they didn't know how to, what the proper dose was.

321
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,540
They were overdosing soldiers.

322
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,320
Well, they were also giving them, uh, what do you call it?

323
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,440
Biological weapons.

324
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,200
They had to break out the old stash of LSD to bring them back.

325
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,500
Yeah, so they could withstand the biological warfare experiments.

326
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,440
That's from that Prozac homo.

327
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,060
First we dosed them out of the tox.

328
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,680
Now we're going to give them some acid and see how they took to it.

329
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,780
Where do you think Dr. Legume came from?

330
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,020
I thought he was the spawn of hell and came out from under a rock.

331
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,220
That's what everybody says.

332
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,700
He was in those army experiments where they,

333
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,980
they gave them these drugs that they thought might give them psychic powers

334
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,460
because the Russians were studying that and were way ahead of them.

335
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,960
He's telling the story of the first thought, Dr. Legume.

336
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,420
Psychic warfare.

337
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,580
Oh yes, you're gonna flip and fly like one of the little god's children of the air.

338
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,560
Look at your feet, they're already getting bigger, like a, like a pair of duck.

339
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:58,760
Unfortunately, the mutant power that Legume got was the ability to read guinea pigs' minds.

340
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,620
Yeah, and also read backwards.

341
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,000
And this is how he gleans the future from the minds of a guinea pig.

342
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,300
He actually reads people pretty well too.

343
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,120
This is a very, very arcane, very arcane skill.

344
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,540
And only entrusted to a few mutated genes born into the...

345
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,220
War guinea pigs.

346
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,140
War pig.

347
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,380
The pigs.

348
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,080
Are you being fattened up to be a war pig, Private Pyle?

349
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,120
Are you gonna wear those epaulettes like barbecue sauce?

350
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,960
Private Pyle!

351
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,740
I need a cigarette.

352
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,040
I need a cigarette.

353
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,060
I need a cigarette.

354
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:31,420
What are they gonna do?

355
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:31,940
They can't...

356
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,680
It's kinda hard to bring the dra...

357
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,920
The kids, you don't have to worry about the draft coming back.

358
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,880
You just don't have to worry about the draft coming back because this American Army and

359
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,160
Navy, they all know that American children are a bunch of little fat asses.

360
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,860
They would never cut the training, you know?

361
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,860
It's gotta be a volunteer force, you know?

362
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,740
It's gotta be gung-ho people, you know, just do it Nike, you know, shtick going.

363
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,860
But this is how the corporate state has sliced our freedom.

364
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,020
And I'm not gonna lie.

365
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,020


366
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,280
And the rest are all the little fat bodies.

367
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,120
Disgusting little fat bodies in front of television sets.

368
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:07,660
That's me.

369
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,820
Soaking up...

370
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,620
They don't want me.

371
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,540
Uh, Nestle Crunch bars.

372
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,200
I'm a disgusting fat body.

373
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,540
Gray, flaccid skin.

374
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,560
I'll stay home.

375
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,380
Moistened by the pale light.

376
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:17,860
Forehead.

377
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,600
The artificial light beamed in from the great Centurion Pactor.

378
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,820
There they lie.

379
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,680
Eating television.

380
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,080
Either that or they're gonna send the fat bodies over.

381
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,280
Something will dry.

382
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,000
Don't give them guns, just give them knives and forks.

383
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,640
Yeah.

384
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,360
Yeah, give them silverware.

385
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,280
A wave of...

386
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,500
Just give them computers.

387
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,400
A wave of fat bodies rolling into Baghdad with knives and forks.

388
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:41,860
With silverware.

389
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,580
Getting ready to eat, you know?

390
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,900
Ring, ring, ring.

391
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,760
Blackbird.

392
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,500
We are not halal.

393
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,160
We are pigs.

394
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,500
The American...

395
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,160
The attack of the American fat body.

396
00:19:53,500 --> 00:20:00,260
And that was ESO Swamp Radio from 2002 on WCNN.

397
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:00,260


398
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,080
ESB Cleveland.

399
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,320
Oh, those were the days, friends.

400
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,500
With the late Professor Chaz Smith.

401
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,520
The lonesome cowboy Dave.

402
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,120
And now, Massive Hot Dog Recall.

403
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,220
Please don't look at me.

404
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,320
I'm a bottle of Summer's Eve.

405
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,600
Now that we're all sharing, I'm not worth the clothes I'm wearing.

406
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,300
I wish that you'd stop staring.

407
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,500
I found myself in Stockholm.

408
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,460
Fine-tuning the syndrome.

409
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,400
Negotiations broke down.

410
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,580
Free to go, but I think I'm gonna stick around.

411
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,880
This is my kind of town.

412
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,240
And now, Massive Hot Dog Recall.

413
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:30,820
Please don't look at me.

414
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,200
Please don't look at me.

415
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,660
Cr discut quarterback Tim Fraser.

416
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,760
I'm afraid everybody goes out.

417
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,700
But I'm not alone here.

418
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:47,700


419
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:47,700


420
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:47,940
My certificate to the West Coast's Marketforum Queen was annulled inЭтоB JERSEY UNTER nasal

421
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:55,260
cam emee help number MWF LOS clothes

422
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,180
never made no money

423
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,480
Dick Cavett, you had us fooled

424
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,220
No need to scrutinize your interview

425
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,620
You sit down with Laurence Olivier

426
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,760
You crawl under the carpet anyway

427
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,460
You crawl under the carpet anyway

428
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,260
Enough of me

429
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,900
Let's talk about something else

430
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,060
Enough of me

431
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,760
I'm sick of yourself

432
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,260
Broken seductions

433
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,820
Everything collapses

434
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,780
Enough of me

435
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,100
Enough of me

436
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,940
Enough of me

437
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:21,460
Enough of me

438
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,220
I'm sick ofkatjuse,

439
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,800
Broken synapses

440
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,240
Everything collapses

441
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,240


442
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,240


443
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,240


444
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,240


445
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,240


446
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,240


447
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,640
I think of ourselves

448
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,580
Enough of me, enough of me

449
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,960
Enough of me, enough of me

450
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,320
Un-nuff of me

451
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,660
Un-nuff of me

452
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:36,520
Un-nuff of me

453
00:24:52,060 --> 00:25:09,940
Un-nuff of me

454
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:33,020
Un-nuff of me

455
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,940
Un-nuff of me

456
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:38,760
Un-nuff of me

457
00:26:42,120 --> 00:27:08,580
Un-nuff of me

458
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:39,940
Un-nuff of me

459
00:27:39,960 --> 00:28:09,440
Un-nuff of me

460
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,940
Un-nuff of me

461
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,320
Un-nuff of me

462
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:18,940
Un-nuff of me

463
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,940
Un-nuff of me

464
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:36,880
Un-nuff of me

465
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:09,940
Un-nuff of me

466
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:19,340
Un-nuff of me

467
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,200
That's what they always say

468
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,800
That's what they always say

469
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,820
If you do, you're gonna be dragging that bed frame with you

470
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:57,020
I wish I had a big fat soda right now

471
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,920
Wouldn't that be nice, but

472
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,580
Big ol' fat soda

473
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,240
Sheery rabbit soda

474
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,940
Now I'm gonna meet soda with a lot of fat

475
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,420
They have them

476
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,560
If you go to

477
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,560
If you go to

478
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:09,940
If you go to

479
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:09,940


480
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:17,060
Virginia City, they have a store that sells meat and potatoes soda and turkey soda and all this other stuff.

481
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,440
Wow.

482
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,660
I didn't get any.

483
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:23,040
They also have all the bizarre candy that you never heard of.

484
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:32,300
That's like the Jelly Belly factory, you know, where you can get the booger-flavored Jelly Belly and the vomit-flavored Jelly Belly.

485
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,340
All these earwax-flavored Jelly Belly.

486
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,960
All these crazy things.

487
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,020
Why would somebody eat that stuff?

488
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,320
Yes, because you'd have to admit in that case that you knew what those things tasted like.

489
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:44,820
Ronald Reagan would.

490
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,620
No, Reagan just liked lime, cherries, strawberries.

491
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,780
Yeah, you'd have to say, this doesn't taste like a booger.

492
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,480
He didn't even take the licorice.

493
00:32:52,600 --> 00:33:02,160
You know, the full assortment of jelly beans classically had licorice and mint, which can throw the rest of them off if you cram a bunch into your mouth.

494
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:08,660
But these days, they've got gourmet jelly beans of essence of popcorn.

495
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:13,280
Oh, Hal, you would love to go to the Jelly Belly factory.

496
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,120
Of course I would, but I would never leave.

497
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,920
I would die after consuming too much of it.

498
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,460
They have a tour.

499
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,460
You take a tour and you walk through the actual factory.

500
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,800
He died from massive glycemic shock, officer.

501
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,080
His making Jelly Belly.

502
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,140
His aisles of langer hands couldn't take the jelly bean challenge.

503
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:39,760
But fortunately, this saves the state from having to preserve his remains with embalming fluid.

504
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,020
Now made of perfect sugar, he belongs to the...

505
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,640
He just hardened into his last known shape.

506
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,540
Just don't let those kids lick me.

507
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,720
So, it was a sad thing.

508
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,280
The, uh...

509
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,740
The licking of the chops.

510
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:05,160
Yes, I guess I can't lick every man on this ship after all.

511
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,920
But you'll never get enough.

512
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,700
You better not try.

513
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,220
These boys don't like that kind of stuff.

514
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,640
Why didn't you let them...

515
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,080
say so?

516
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,680
Well, I guess I should take a poll.

517
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,860
Just install that...

518
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,320
Alright, man.

519
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,600
How many of you boys want to get licked?

520
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,980
All over.

521
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,940
And, uh, keep on ticking.

522
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:30,900
You gotta...

523
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,500
I'll have some...

524
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,960
Keep on ticking, also.

525
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:33,840
Me, me, me!

526
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,880
Sorry, only one lick to a customer.

527
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,560
And you've got to...

528
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,680
Install that screen door.

529
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:46,580
There's a little bit more, uh, acceptance there than I thought at first consideration.

530
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:51,660
Well, life on a sub beneath a misty ocean is a long slog.

531
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,260
A long slide?

532
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,400
A slog.

533
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:55,980
Oh.

534
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,500
A slog like...

535
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,700
A long slide into...

536
00:34:59,360 --> 00:34:59,640
Tramping through the...

537
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,120
Floods...

538
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,780
A different world.

539
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:01,140
...the fields.

540
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,540
Did anybody see the Wonder Woman movie?

541
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,700
Did you see it, Kira?

542
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,660
Yeah, I saw it.

543
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,460
So, it's in World War I?

544
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:09,700
Yeah.

545
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,700
It, uh...

546
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,580
How'd they do?

547
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,000
Did you like it?

548
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,220
Yeah, Wonder Woman beat World War I.

549
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,240
It's a very popular...

550
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,920
She won World War I?

551
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,240
Yes.

552
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,260
Yeah, that's a little-known historical fact.

553
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:21,880
Wow.

554
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,400
Uh, but, um, that means that...

555
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,320
She was the Golden Age.

556
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:31,660
See, we see her in Batman Meets Superman, and she's still young-looking, so how come...

557
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:37,400
She's in World War I, but then in the ultra-modern era, she still looks great.

558
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:37,940
Uh, because she's...

559
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,440
Because she's an animal.

560
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,440


561
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,440


562
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,440


563
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,440


564
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,440


565
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,440


566
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,440


567
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,440


568
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,440


569
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,440


570
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,440


571
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,440


572
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,440


573
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,760
She's, uh...

574
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,060
She's, uh...

575
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,460
She doesn't age.

576
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,960
She's super, in other words.

577
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,260
Yeah.

578
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:42,360
You know.

579
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:42,620
Yeah.

580
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,020
I don't know.

581
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,640
She's, uh, a goddess.

582
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,700
Well, it wouldn't bother me that she was 98 years old...

583
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,340
Princess Diana.

584
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:49,800
Yeah.

585
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:55,640
I mean, as long as she looks like she's better than the bovine disco-dancing Princess Diana.

586
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,660
She's much taller and, uh, and much attract...

587
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,340
More attractive.

588
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:00,940
Yes.

589
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,600
Hubba hubba.

590
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,280
Yes.

591
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,700
But her name is Diana as well.

592
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,380
Her human secret identity name is...

593
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:08,420
Oh, I didn't know.

594
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:08,420


595
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,660
Yes, as you correctly state.

596
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,680
Diana Prince.

597
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,620
Yeah.

598
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:13,700
Yeah.

599
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,920
And then there's her boyfriend, that, uh, overmatched soldier.

600
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,440
Steve!

601
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,160
Steve.

602
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:19,940
Yes.

603
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,520
Steve.

604
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,420
Another Steve.

605
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,380
That's Steve Rogers.

606
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,320
Steve Adorno.

607
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:24,960
Steve Rogers.

608
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:25,840
Oh, Steve Rogers.

609
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,480
Yeah, okay.

610
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,560
And it's a beautiful day in his neighborhood until Wonder Woman comes and makes him take

611
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,200
out the truck.

612
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,700
And does she have her transparent hair?

613
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,160
Wonder Woman.

614
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,240
I've told you a thousand times, I'll take the trash out later.

615
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,000
In the World War I thing, does she have a transparent airplane?

616
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:44,840
Right?

617
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:49,080
No, she has, uh, a sword, a shield, and a lasso.

618
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,460
Oh.

619
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,780
No transparent airplane.

620
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,040
But Steve flies us up with Camel or something like that.

621
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,100
He has the World War I thing.

622
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,600
He crashes one.

623
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,480
Yeah, he crashes.

624
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,160
He crashes one.

625
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,180
He's like John McCain.

626
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,720
He can't keep it in the air.

627
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,860
He can't keep it in the air.

628
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,860
He's gonna be the guy that gets caught.

629
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,380
Crash one of those little fabric trucks.

630
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:06,860
Hey, look.

631
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,500
We got these guys on the team.

632
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,420
Oh, there's McCain.

633
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,880
Oh, he's gonna get caught.

634
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,660
Taken away from the high hat squadron.

635
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,860
I'm not exaggerating.

636
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,140
He was known, John McCain was known as Crash McCain because he destroyed so many aircraft

637
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,480
with their landings.

638
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,560
But, uh, you know, now we know not to make those.

639
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,640
He found a good, he could take that, what he learned from crashing those airplanes and

640
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,200
apply that to his, to his new job.

641
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:35,640
Yeah.

642
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:44,100
All that experience from crashing airplanes, he's been able to parlay that into a, a lifelong

643
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,540
Senate career.

644
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,640
How about, uh, Sarah Palin?

645
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,340
Did she ever get back from the center of the earth?

646
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,200
Uh, did they ever find the-

647
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:52,460
I don't think so.

648
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,360
No?

649
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,700
She's trapped down there.

650
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,880
Uh, she met Hitler riding a Tyrannosaurus.

651
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,860
That was the last I, I saw.

652
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,980
Uh, did they ever finish that thing?

653
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,740
I don't know.

654
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,500
But I like the idea.

655
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,920
I like the idea of, uh, riding a Tyrannosaurus.

656
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,380
Well, there were many good things.

657
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:15,680
For one thing, the, not only Hitler, Hitler Heil Hitler.

658
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,300
Is that lurch?

659
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,320
But the Tyrannosaurus also with its little arm did the Nazi salute with its two fingers

660
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,040
to which Sarah Palin returned a middle finger salute.

661
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:35,480
Then also the beginning shows the nuclear war starting and they, they take, they take

662
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,440
the

663
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,600
Hey man, I played a game where I actually ride dinosaurs.

664
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,140
I mean, not dinosaurs.

665
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:00,460
I ride an elephant and the elephant is like knocking guys out of the way and button them

666
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,700
with his tusks while I'm shooting with a sniper rifle.

667
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,460
I ride dinosaurs.

668
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,880
Or even a machine gun.

669
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,760
They're not dinosaurs.

670
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:15,260
So I'm mowing the guys down while he's, while my, my good old pal the elephant is also mowing

671
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:15,820
them down.

672
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,280
My friend is the elephant and the elephant has a machine gun.

673
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,320
Yeah, no, the elephant doesn't have, I'm the one with the machine gun.

674
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,640
Well, get your story straight, man.

675
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,600
The elephant is carrying me on his back.

676
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,680
That's your elephant.

677
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,980
Who are these guys anyway?

678
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,620
Nazis.

679
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,400
No way Nazis.

680
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,440
You'll deal with them.

681
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,440


682
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,440


683
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,440


684
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,440


685
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,440


686
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,440


687
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,440


688
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,440


689
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,440


690
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,440


691
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,440


692
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,580
We should have a new comic book.

693
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,820
It'd be like little, like little, uh, what was his name?

694
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,560
Little hot stuff.

695
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,400
Little hot stuff?

696
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,840
It'd be like little hot stuff, but only be little Nazi.

697
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,420
Okay now.

698
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,440
Like a little bitty Hitler running around.

699
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,500
Because you mentioned that.

700
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,700
Playing pranks on people.

701
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:59,480
I have to say, there was an episode of little hot stuff and I have it and could show it

702
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:05,240
to you where Hitler came and visited the fancy forest, the fairy forest where hot stuff hung

703
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,420
out.

704
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:05,420


705
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:05,420


706
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:05,420


707
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:05,420


708
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:05,420


709
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:05,420


710
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:05,420


711
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:05,420


712
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:05,420


713
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:05,420


714
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:05,420


715
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:05,420


716
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:05,420


717
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,760
Hitler and his men.

718
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,460
Wow.

719
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,720
And they were

720
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,720
hiling and everything.

721
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,960
They wanted to take

722
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,720
his supply of apples

723
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,040
that he eats.

724
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,520
Believe it or not,

725
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,660
the Harvey comics

726
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,460
did go for this.

727
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,180
It's unquestionably

728
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,700
Hitler and all his

729
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,580
henchmen are hiling,

730
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,220
but they're like

731
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:22,620
in civilian clothes.

732
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,420
That sounds like a Herbie.

733
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,180
That's something I would

734
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:24,720
see in Herbie.

735
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,780
It's in civilian clothes

736
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,920
because it's after the war.

737
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,760
They can't wear

738
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,600
their uniforms,

739
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,460
but I swear.

740
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,220
But they're all

741
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,080
hanging out together.

742
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,320
It's in a little

743
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:34,980
hot stuff,

744
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,620
stuff anthology

745
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,480
that I have,

746
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,420
which was compiled

747
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,840
by Leslie Kabarger.

748
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,760
The applesauce cave.

749
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,380
There it is.

750
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,080
That's the one.

751
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,360
Boy, you found it

752
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:43,760
on your device.

753
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,480
See, there's Hitler.

754
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,220
They're hiling him

755
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,600
and there's hot stuff

756
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,080
sleeping in the apple tree.

757
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,140
I'll have to post this

758
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,280
on the Puzzling Evidence

759
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,220
fan page.

760
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,960
Well, I bet you

761
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,400
never knew

762
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,340
hot stuff and Hitler

763
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,260
ever got together,

764
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,460
although it ends up

765
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,620
with him driving Hitler

766
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,440
and his men out.

767
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,560
Hi.

768
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:03,800
Hi.

769
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,340
How's it going,

770
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,240
Dr. Brujaha?

771
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,140
Overlord Animal.

772
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,740
What a surprise.

773
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:10,660
Yeah.

774
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,180
Hey,

775
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,300
I'm just out here

776
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:13,740
in the wild.

777
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,700
I've been adventuring,

778
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,140
foraging, if you will.

779
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:16,900
Me too.

780
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,160
I just went to the

781
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,280
the Far East Asian

782
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,840
Trading Company

783
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,220
and Bazaar.

784
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,080
I too went to

785
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,780
the dollar store.

786
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,900
Yes, the dollar store.

787
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,300
The gems of the Orient,

788
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:33,540
the dollar store,

789
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:33,960
prevail.

790
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,980
I found some things today

791
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,360
and they're so amazing.

792
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,720
I got this thing.

793
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,780
It's like the head of a bear

794
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,800
and you stick it onto a thing

795
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,900
and then it spits out mist

796
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,080
like the kind that you see

797
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,720
on the movie Pet Sematary.

798
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,180
Like fog.

799
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,940
But it's supposed to be able

800
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:54,760
to help you breathe.

801
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,860
So I think it zombifies bears.

802
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,580
It's a bear zombie fire.

803
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,760
I think so.

804
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,340
I think so.

805
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,440
It makes my sign.

806
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,860
It says just open right up

807
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,100
and ready for bears.

808
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,860
I got a frozen poop maker.

809
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,460
Oh my gosh, you do.

810
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,320
That is going to be

811
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:12,840
lumpy.

812
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,100
It makes little lumpy logs.

813
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,000
That's, uh...

814
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,720
I think they're supposed

815
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,040
to be cartoon worms,

816
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,100
but you know.

817
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,580
Yeah, as opposed to

818
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,280
the real worms.

819
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,040
Yeah.

820
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,300
Because you can't

821
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,440
get worms in the store.

822
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,080
You can't put them

823
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,740
in your freezer

824
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,260
either to make frozen.

825
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,560
I mean, never mind.

826
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,300
You totally could.

827
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,140
I could probably

828
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:33,300
buy a tapeworm

829
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:33,420
and make it.

830
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:33,440


831
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,440
one of those places.

832
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,540
Does tapeworm segments

833
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,040
work in frozen drinks?

834
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,520
I don't know.

835
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,600
No, you use it

836
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,680
as a stir stick.

837
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,800
You freeze them

838
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,220
and it's like

839
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:44,880
the tapeworm is

840
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,800
a great stir stick

841
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,640
and appetizer

842
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,560
all in one.

843
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,260
A flatworm stir stick.

844
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,320
Like a pretzel rod,

845
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:50,980
but...

846
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,680
But doesn't disintegrate

847
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,160
in your drink.

848
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,420
But will make you

849
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,420
just want to

850
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,820
consume more and more.

851
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,260
It's much like

852
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,320
American television.

853
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,460
Yeah.

854
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:01,900
It's...

855
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,240
Now available

856
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,460
as seen on TV.

857
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:05,880
Tapeworms.

858
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,540
Tapeworm stir stick stir.

859
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,620
Oh, oh my goodness.

860
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,860
Oh, but there was a...

861
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,480
There were these things

862
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:14,020
that I got.

863
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,300
Most people use them

864
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,280
for cleaning dishes.

865
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,540
I give...

866
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,600
My cats take them

867
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,400
as toys, though.

868
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:20,780
It's like

869
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,640
those cute little sponges

870
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,600
in various shapes.

871
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,520
Oh, yeah.

872
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,360
And all.

873
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,360
And also,

874
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,820
what was the...

875
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,120
Oh, and I just wanted

876
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:31,820
to clarify those.

877
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,620
The tapeworms,

878
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,320
they're 8-track.

879
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:33,980
They're not cassette.

880
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,080
Mm-hmm.

881
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,040
It does...

882
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:36,540
They're like...

883
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,720
They're not the small cartridges

884
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,740
that you would see.

885
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,900
Yeah, 8-cassette tapeworms.

886
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,040
It is an 8-track.

887
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,380
8-track tapeworm.

888
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,360
8-track tapeworm.

889
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,260
Yeah.

890
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:45,960
Gotcha.

891
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:46,760
Very, very,

892
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,600
very specifically.

893
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,640
Yeah.

894
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,620
This is a...

895
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,660
Like the wide flat noodles.

896
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,620
I got the

897
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,800
narrow mouth

898
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,780
spell bottle

899
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,240
strainer.

900
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,380
That's what this is.

901
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,020
It's part of your

902
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,840
magical drip system.

903
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:00,380
Yeah,

904
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,360
for when I need to

905
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,380
make extraction.

906
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,500
And whatnot.

907
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,740
And infusions.

908
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,280
Oh, gosh, Dr. Bruja.

909
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,960
I wish you could

910
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,060
make an infusion for me.

911
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:11,660
Why?

912
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:12,620
Yeah.

913
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,240
Well, to not have to

914
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,340
need to go to this

915
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:15,920
magic...

916
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,420
to this fantastic place

917
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,360
to get all these

918
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,240
acquisitions

919
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,940
like once every season.

920
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,460
I'd rather not.

921
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,080
I'd rather just have them

922
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:25,920
like show up

923
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:26,740
on my doorstep.

924
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,640
Yeah, but then you'd have

925
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,560
to use those companies

926
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,120
that make that one guy

927
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,320
really rich.

928
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,180
And kill whales.

929
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,860
Doesn't every company

930
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,140
like sacrifice a whale

931
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:37,780
if they want to be good

932
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:38,440
at business, though?

933
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,540
I thought that was like

934
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,320
part of the deal.

935
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,060
Like, that's what the

936
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,080
Illuminati script says.

937
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,020
Like, you want to be

938
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:45,820
rich in business,

939
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,240
you've got to kill a whale.

940
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,000
Well, I mean,

941
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,400
if it involves, you know,

942
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,800
shipping container ships,

943
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,220
full of shipping containers,

944
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,780
going across their

945
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:57,480
hunting grounds,

946
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,000
then yes.

947
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,460
Yes, it does.

948
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,940
I got those snack boxes.

949
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,900
A set of snack boxes

950
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,160
with family snack boxes.

951
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,320
So it starts with the

952
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,080
dad-sized snack box

953
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:10,840
and the next is the

954
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,540
mom-sized snack box.

955
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,220
The next is the

956
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,000
older child.

957
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:15,920
I'm going to say

958
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,640
it was a girl, possibly.

959
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,040
A bob-tailed,

960
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,460
a bob-headed,

961
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:22,720
a bob-tailed,

962
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,260
you know, there was no,

963
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,220
you couldn't see the tail,

964
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:24,920
it was bobbed,

965
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,320
but the bob haircut as well.

966
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,880
And then there was

967
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,880
the small mutant.

968
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,120
And I'm not even sure,

969
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,080
it was a child.

970
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,000
It might have just been

971
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,660
a very, like a demure,

972
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,220
diminutive,

973
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,500
like an adult

974
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,940
that wasn't fully hatched.

975
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:41,900
Was it?

976
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:42,580
Well, that's kind of

977
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,680
what children are, aren't they?

978
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,740
They're like half-hatched adults.

979
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:47,540
I guess.

980
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,760
I don't know.

981
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,200
I just, I thought, like,

982
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,420
you know, kids make

983
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,220
a lot of noise

984
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,200
and this box wasn't

985
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,160
making any noise at all.

986
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,080
So I was just like,

987
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,060
you know, maybe this is

988
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,580
just a small adult.

989
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:58,880
It could be

990
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,080
a very small adult.

991
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:00,740
You know?

992
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,080
And not even,

993
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,060
not even necessarily

994
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,420
an endodorf

995
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,580
or a dwarf

996
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,740
or a midget

997
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:08,620
or any of those

998
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,300
particular size terms,

999
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,400
but possibly just someone

1000
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,040
from South America.

1001
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:16,700
Like in Peru,

1002
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,420
they're quite

1003
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,560
not as tall as

1004
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,140
there's a lot of people here

1005
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,120
in this part of North America.

1006
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:24,140
That's only because

1007
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,720
they starve for their childhood.

1008
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:26,580
Cool.

1009
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,160
Okay.

1010
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,200
So I could, like,

1011
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,460
just not feed kids

1012
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,640
and they'll stay tiny?

1013
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:31,220
Yeah.

1014
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:31,600
Forever?

1015
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:32,040
Yeah.

1016
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:32,300
That's a good idea.

1017
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:32,700
That's the reason why

1018
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,160
I'm all like,

1019
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,200
wait, forever ever?

1020
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,140
I mean, you know,

1021
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,220
they'll stay tiny-ish.

1022
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:36,480
I mean,

1023
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,360
I bet if we, like,

1024
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,240
put a, like,

1025
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,220
a Mount Vesuvius

1026
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,260
kind of action on it,

1027
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,420
they would stay tiny forever.

1028
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,300
Yes.

1029
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,040
Definitely.

1030
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,120
If you Pompeii'd them,

1031
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:44,680
they would never

1032
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,320
get any bigger.

1033
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,500
You know,

1034
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,080
I was gonna say,

1035
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,700
my grandparents,

1036
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,920
they all starved

1037
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,440
during the,

1038
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,060
like, the wars and stuff.

1039
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:51,880
So they're,

1040
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,420
they never got to be

1041
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:54,400
above 5'4".

1042
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,260
Like, they're like,

1043
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,280
So what's your excuse?

1044
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,300
Uh,

1045
00:46:58,300 --> 00:46:58,740
just

1046
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:00,800
bad genes.

1047
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,140
I just carry

1048
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,340
the starvation gene.

1049
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,220
It's just,

1050
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:05,500
Yeah.

1051
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,460
Well, you know,

1052
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:06,660
it's,

1053
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,620
well, like,

1054
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,920
Oh, they hear that rumble?

1055
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,140
Half Hobbit.

1056
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,060
Yeah, they're rumbling

1057
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,600
the glacier moving by.

1058
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:13,520
Oh, jeez.

1059
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,220
Is the glacier

1060
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,580
calving again?

1061
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:16,660
I think so.

1062
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,820
I think so.

1063
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:18,400
Just don't,

1064
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,140
don't yodel.

1065
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,020
Yeah.

1066
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:20,920
That tends to create

1067
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,700
an avalanche effect.

1068
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:24,660
It's,

1069
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:25,020
you know,

1070
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,080
it really gets going

1071
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,460
sometimes when the sun

1072
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,380
shines on it,

1073
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,020
where the,

1074
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,740
it really starts calving

1075
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:32,220
and, like,

1076
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:32,960
it groans

1077
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,220
and screeches

1078
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,520
and grinds

1079
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,340
and makes all kinds

1080
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:36,960
of crazy noises.

1081
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,520
So that's not just

1082
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,880
the cat on the outside

1083
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,880
of your glacier box?

1084
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,440
The cat that's hungry

1085
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,600
and wants some kibble?

1086
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,060
Yeah.

1087
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:44,440
The cat,

1088
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,360
the cat is

1089
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,540
plotting to murder us all.

1090
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:48,540
I, uh,

1091
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,120
I'm sorry.

1092
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,400
Your cat's nice.

1093
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,380
I keep forgetting

1094
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:53,120
not everybody

1095
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,220
has a murder cat.

1096
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,040
Yeah.

1097
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,040
She's too old

1098
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:56,640
and tired

1099
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,680
to be a murder cat

1100
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,160
anymore.

1101
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,120
Some days.

1102
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,520
She used to be,

1103
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:01,940
but she's retired.

1104
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:02,900
She's a murder cat.

1105
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,200
Thank you,

1106
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,460
Overlord Anna Mall

1107
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,140
and Reverend Boo Ha Ha,

1108
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,780
and we'll close

1109
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:11,540
with Doctors for Bob.

1110
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:13,240
Specifically,

1111
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,160
Pope Sternodox's

1112
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,340
classic rap

1113
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:16,920
called

1114
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,040
The Explanation.

1115
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:20,640
And remember,

1116
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,120
subgenius.com.

1117
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,160
Now before we

1118
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,440
proceed with our

1119
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,040
quote,

1120
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,360
schizofreniatric,

1121
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,260
scatolographic,

1122
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:39,940
metagalactic,

1123
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,440
pri-primality

1124
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,240
induction seminar,

1125
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,700
this evening,

1126
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:49,560
I would just like

1127
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,680
to take this opportunity

1128
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,700
to state

1129
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,720
briefly

1130
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,580
and for the record

1131
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:58,740
that

1132
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,280
my fellow

1133
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:01,660
doctors

1134
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:02,300
and doctors

1135
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:02,300


1136
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:02,300


1137
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,260
for Bob

1138
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,440
and myself

1139
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,640
are members

1140
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,700
in good standing

1141
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,820
of a church.

1142
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,760
But not just

1143
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,780
any church,

1144
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,100
for the church

1145
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,160
to which we belong

1146
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,200
just happens to be

1147
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,120
beyond a shadow

1148
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:23,700
of a doubt

1149
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,860
the world's only

1150
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,800
bogus true religion.

1151
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:29,820
Of course,

1152
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,720
I am referring to

1153
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,780
the Church of the Subgenius.

1154
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,980
This one's dedicated

1155
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,840
to Reverend Cleve Duncan.

1156
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,860
Now the Church of the Subgenius

1157
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,460
is founded by

1158
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,680
J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1159
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,100
Santa Sales,

1160
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,100
Master of Slack,

1161
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,220
1953,

1162
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,000
the prime religion

1163
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,060
of the future,

1164
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:57,280
united,

1165
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,060
superior mutants,

1166
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:01,440
social,

1167
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,980
renegades,

1168
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,280
twisted geniuses,

1169
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,800
and sci-fi sinners

1170
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,560
in a worldwide

1171
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,180
rampage

1172
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,920
of inborn

1173
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,360
and profane

1174
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,940
yucks and grins.

1175
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,160
Yucks and grins

1176
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,180
which will hopefully,

1177
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,680
inevitably,

1178
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,100
lead us directly

1179
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,300
to a commodity all too

1180
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:27,900
lack.

1181
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:31,620
Today's modern, dead-age, agogos society,

1182
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,700
and the most

1183
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,160
modern and brilliant,

1184
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,620
is Slack.

1185
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,180
Slack is what the conspiracy takes away from us.

1186
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,660
Slack is what the conspiracy deprives us of.

1187
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,920
Slack is our way

1188
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,720
of grabbing life by the lapels

1189
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,720
and fucking it up the ass.

1190
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,320
Now back in the 50's,

1191
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:57,240
Bob himself noticed

1192
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,540
a decided lack of Slack

1193
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,220
in our culture.

1194
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,340
He noticed

1195
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:08,780
an awful prevalence of normalcy.

1196
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,200
He noticed

1197
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,220
that the normals

1198
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,200
formed a vast conspiracy

1199
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,660
against the different.

1200
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,380
An insidious conspiracy

1201
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,720
dedicated to squelching

1202
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,600
our natural rogue instincts.

1203
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,860
Dedicated to wiping out

1204
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,540
our fun factors.

1205
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:32,600
Dedicated in short,

1206
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,040
to the total and utter eradication

1207
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,300
of the original Slack

1208
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,880
with which we were all born.

1209
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,640
Well Bob wanted to fight this conspiracy

1210
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,780
ladies and gentlemen.

1211
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,840
What better way I ask ye,

1212
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,340
than by the foundation

1213
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,600
of a major,

1214
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,220
new,

1215
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:49,180
world,

1216
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:49,760
religion,

1217
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,240
hence the church's subgenius,

1218
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,020
Prince Bob!

1219
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:53,500
Woo!

1220
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,340
Help me somebody!

1221
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,340
Now many people I know,

1222
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,020
have been told,

1223
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:00,020


1224
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:01,860
that the Catholic Church

1225
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:01,860


1226
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,080
A very tiny one.

1227
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:08,760
A very stupid one.

1228
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:12,680
A very microscopically mediocre level.

1229
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,060
Mediocrity.

1230
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,340
You see the conspiracy only in

1231
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,880
the think tanks,

1232
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,340
Time Magazine,

1233
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,280
CBS,

1234
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:22,980
NBC,

1235
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:23,960
the US government,

1236
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:24,400
CIA,

1237
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:24,860
FBI,

1238
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:25,540
Lutheran Church,

1239
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,200
Missouri Synod,

1240
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:26,820
Catholic Church,

1241
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,580
Jewish Advocacy League,

1242
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,920
Council on Foreign Relations,

1243
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,000
Trout of Labyrinth,

1244
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,000


1245
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,000


1246
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,000


1247
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,000


1248
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,440
Federal Commission.

1249
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,240
All the more occultated individuals,

1250
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,900
see to the next level.

1251
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,280
You see the conspiracy as,

1252
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,420
the Heliopters for Gobotran,

1253
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:42,400
the Men in Black,

1254
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,440
the Green Energy Demon,

1255
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:47,060
the advanced supersonic Nazi Hell creatures from the Hollow Earth,

1256
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,880
the henchmen of Negi and,

1257
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,900
the Yonkatismo.

1258
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,640
But even they don't have the full story,

1259
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:55,640
ladies and gentlemen.

1260
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,400
I'm here to tell you tonight,

1261
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,320
that the conspiracy exists,

1262
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,800
as none other,

1263
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,840
than Jehovah One,

1264
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,420
Alien Space God of Wrath from some corporate sin galaxy,

1265
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,940
and his stark vest of removal.

1266
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,980
Now many of you here tonight,

1267
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,060
many of you here tonight I'm sure,

1268
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,200
view the Church of the Subgenius as a bit,

1269
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,320
old,

1270
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:23,860
demonic.

1271
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,840
You're right,

1272
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,420
it is demonic.

1273
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,460
But well,

1274
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,300
speaking of an animal,

1275
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,300


1276
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,300


1277
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,300


1278
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,300


1279
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,300


1280
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,300


1281
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,300


1282
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,300


1283
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,300


1284
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,300


1285
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,300


1286
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,300


1287
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,300


1288
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:29,300


1289
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,100
there are some very evident demons here.

1290
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,700
Well the Church of the Subgenius does recognize,

1291
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,640
every major deity,

1292
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,400
of every world religion.

1293
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:37,460
Jesus,

1294
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:38,300
Buddha,

1295
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:39,420
Krishna,

1296
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:40,380
Mohammed,

1297
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,540
Elvis,

1298
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,800
Merle,

1299
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:43,760
Hank,

1300
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:44,820
Arnold,

1301
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,160
Butch.

1302
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:50,280
Rather than having one central authority,

1303
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,080
great figure,

1304
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,080
the Church of the Subgenius,

1305
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,860
possesses an entire pantheon,

1306
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,420
or subgenion as it were.

1307
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,560
One referred to as,

1308
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,140
short duration personal savior.

1309
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,480
Now you're a short durper Sam,

1310
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,360
if you can think from,

1311
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,280
multi-stage vibrators,

1312
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,700
sending white noise signals,

1313
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,140
to the very epithelial center of your brain.

1314
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,480
To a multi-level,

1315
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,460
pyramidal religion,

1316
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,340
guaranteed to empty your pockets,

1317
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,420
and send your soul to heaven.

1318
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:29,100
Hallelujah!

1319
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:29,280
And the most important thing,

1320
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


1321
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


1322
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


1323
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


1324
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


1325
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


1326
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


1327
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


1328
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


1329
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


1330
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


1331
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


1332
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


1333
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


1334
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


1335
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


1336
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:29,280


1337
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,840
it could be anywhere from,

1338
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:34,320
bleeding,

1339
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,520
decapitated,

1340
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,920
neck-stump of a world cup golfer.

1341
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,940
Sailing its arc way,

1342
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:40,920
through the heavens,

1343
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,600
for your salvation.

1344
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,760
And it could last anywhere,

1345
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:45,900
from a nanosex,

1346
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:47,440
to your entire lifetime.

1347
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:48,840
And you could have one,

1348
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,560
or ten,

1349
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,280
or millions of short durper Sam's,

1350
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,340
concurrently,

1351
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:54,680
consecutively,

1352
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,820
and simultaneously.

1353
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:58,520
It's the only way,

1354
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:58,860
that you can take,

1355
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:58,900


1356
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:58,900


1357
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:58,900


1358
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:58,900


1359
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:58,900


1360
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:58,900


1361
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:58,900


1362
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:58,900


1363
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:58,900


1364
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:58,900


1365
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,080
Now as in any other major world religion

1366
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,820
The church of the subgenius has certain inalienable tenets

1367
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,500
Certain basic precepts

1368
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,960
Around which a life philosophy can be formed

1369
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,500
The most important of which are

1370
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,320
One, too much is always better

1371
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,920
That's not enough

1372
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,440
Can I get a too much?

1373
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,020
Too much

1374
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,520
Can I get another too much?

1375
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,280
Another too much

1376
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,780
What is it always better than?

1377
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:29,800
Not enough

1378
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,940
Wake your children, praise God

1379
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,260
Woo, help me somebody

1380
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,240
Praise God, right on, amen

1381
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,760
Now the next rule of the church of the subgenius is

1382
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:42,040
You can pull the wool over your own eyes

1383
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,760
And relax in the safety of your own delusions

1384
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,920
So relax

1385
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:50,480
Now the third rule of the church of the subgenius

1386
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,780
And this is one that a lot of religions

1387
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,620
Particularly the Christians really get into

1388
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,200
The third rule of the church

1389
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,200
The third rule of the church of the subgenius is

1390
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,960
You'd pay to know what you really think

1391
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,480
And you just watch Swagger the Follower on TV

1392
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,960
Sometime you'll see that point illustrated all too clearly

1393
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,220
And the next rule of the church of the subgenius

1394
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:09,180
I'd like to mention tonight

1395
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,400
Don't just eat a hamburger

1396
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,800
Eat the hell out of it

1397
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,840
Can I get a scrumptious bovine?

1398
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,420
Scrumptious bovine

1399
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,820
Can I get another scrumptious bovine?

1400
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,180
Two more scrumptious bovine!

1401
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:26,660
Two more scrumptious bovine!

1402
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,480
Thank you children, praise Bob

1403
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:28,840
Whoo!

1404
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,140
Kill me somebody!

1405
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,780
Now the next rule of the church of the subgenius is

1406
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:38,200
Don't just launch a golfer hit

1407
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,540
Launch the hell out of it

1408
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,140
Can I get a bloody four?

1409
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,240
Bloody four!

1410
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,200
Can I get another bloody four?

1411
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,360
Another bloody four!

1412
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,400
Thank you children, praise Bob

1413
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:51,720
Whoo!

1414
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:54,000
Kill me somebody's bovine!

1415
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,180
Now the next rule of the church of the subgenius is

1416
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,660
We don't practice what we preach

1417
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:02,880
Cause we're not the kind of people we're preaching to

1418
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:08,600
Now have you ever seen another church with the guts to admit that most basic of all religious principles?

1419
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:09,740
Say no!

1420
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,400
No!

1421
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,020
Say hell no!

1422
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:14,760
Hell no!

1423
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,120
Say no children!

1424
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,580
Say it hell fuck no!

1425
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,400
Thank you children, praise Bob

1426
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:20,740
Whoo!

1427
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,660
Kill me somebody!

1428
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:26,180
And the last rule of the church of the subgenius I'd like to mention tonight is that we're

1429
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:26,180


1430
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:26,180


1431
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:26,180


1432
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:26,180


1433
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:26,180


1434
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:26,180


1435
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:26,180


1436
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:30,620
the most important rule of all!

1437
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:38,380
The final rule of the church of the subgenius, the ultimate rule of the church of the subgenius

1438
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:38,940
is...

1439
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,500
Fuck them if they can't take a joke!

1440
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,140
Can I get a fuck them?

1441
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:45,500
Fuck them!

1442
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,060
Can I get another fuck them?

1443
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:47,960
Fuck them!

1444
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,000
Can I get a fuck them if they can't take a joke?

1445
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,040
Fuck them if they can't take a joke!

1446
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:53,880
Thank you children, praise Bob!

1447
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:54,300
Whoo!

1448
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,580
Kill me somebody's bovine!

1449
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:55,960
Fuck them!

1450
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:56,180
Fuck them!

1451
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:56,180


1452
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:56,340
Fuck them!

1453
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:56,340


1454
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:56,340


1455
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,960
Even if they can take a joke!

1456
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:09,440
So, if you are what they call different, if you think we're entering a new dark age,

1457
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:16,480
if you suspect that there's the slightest possibility that they're gonna introduce

1458
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:23,300
bleeding golfer head launching in our public schools in the near future, if you're not

1459
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,160
ready to wear the skin of your grandma's face in the next year, if you think you're gonna

1460
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:26,160


1461
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:26,160


1462
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:33,500
wear a mask that says, This is a badge of your tri-primality, if you view the entire universe

1463
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:44,940
as one vast, morbid, cosmic joke, if you think you're a plug being enough, if you think we're

1464
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:53,080
entering a new dark age, if you are searching for an inherently bogus religion that will

1465
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:56,160
condone superior degeneracy, then I'm gonna take a fucking joke!

1466
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:56,160


1467
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:00,500
And tell you that you are above everyone else!

1468
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:09,120
And most important of all, if you can help us with a donation, then the torch of the

1469
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:12,620
subgenius may just provide you with the slack you lack!

1470
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:22,040
Now I'd like to finalize here tonight with a quote from Bob himself, as he wrote in the

1471
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,140
Economicon, the book of Neuronomics, the book of Neurology.

1472
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:26,140


1473
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:26,140


1474
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:26,140


1475
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:30,320
Verse 661, chapter 13.

1476
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:34,040
Watch two girls making it.

1477
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:37,060
Hell, I'd rather be two girls making it!

1478
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:38,480
Help me somebody!

1479
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:44,380
And remember, subgenius.com.
