1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
Bud Light presents the subgenius power of swag.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,820
Real American heroes.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,580
Today we salute you, real American heroes.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,340
Don't stay in too long, or everyone will shout.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,820
Finish quickly and come back.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,880
Oh, well.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:33,200
Anyway, it seems silly to talk about basic Bob-ology to a bunch of hardcore subgeniuses

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,120
who've come to this special occasion, and they know Bob backwards, forwards, and sideways,

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,620
inside out, and reversed.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,540
And not a pretty sight.

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,160
Well, we've seen it all.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,980
About every distortion that could be done to a Bob head has been done by this point,

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,620
many of them by Ivan Stang with his many colorful films of clouds and rocks and oceans

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:55,860
all over the world.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:02,320
All turning into that leering, dripping, mutating face of Bob that's everywhere you look,

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,320
no matter which direction you look, trying to see something that, well, you know, I've

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,080
seen those films.

18
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,960
Well, my office is like that in real life.

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,440
You can't escape.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,180
Yeah, everywhere you look, there's that face.

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,120
Imagine that.

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,200
Having your boss's picture everywhere you look.

23
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,460
Get to work, Stang.

24
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,900
You better get to work slacking off.

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,800
Right-o, Mr. Duck.

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,060
Bob?

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,660
I'm slacking off as hard as I can, sir.

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,540
I'm really, I'm about to die from slack.

29
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,800
Well, the proof is in the pudding, Stang.

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,920
Hey, memberships are down.

31
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,000
We're only selling...

32
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,520
Actually, I shouldn't give numbers.

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,060
It's so...

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,620
Yeah, don't give out any actual data like that.

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,060
Let's just say that if you don't work hard enough, there might not be a place for you at Bobco.

36
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,920
Take that advisedly.

37
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,300
And all the legends you've heard about us.

38
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:02,540
Using slave labor in Malaysia and children being paid in cigarettes to...

39
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,460
Nobody's doing what they don't want to do.

40
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:04,680
...draw dobs.

41
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,820
It's hard to get cigarettes there anyway.

42
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,780
We don't want to spend money on printing presses.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,060
Yeah.

44
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,180
Those are mostly just rumors.

45
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,360
Remember that movie, King Kong Meets Godzilla, where they pass out cigarettes to the kids?

46
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,940
That's kind of like our outreach in Malaysia.

47
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,720
I don't remember that.

48
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,480
You don't remember that when they come to the island, they pass out cigarettes to all the little kids?

49
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,080
Does anyone remember that movie?

50
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,740
Has anyone seen King Kong Meets Godzilla?

51
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:30,980
Nobody?

52
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,180
I saw it.

53
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,540
Oh, Tempura.

54
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,540
But I saw it in the drive-in with my parents.

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,340
How sad.

56
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,940
Well, it's time you see it again, Stang.

57
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,320
It actually contains stop-motion tentacles during the giant squid attack scene.

58
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,760
But don't forget, it does show that they pass out cigarettes to the kids.

59
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,220
It's an amazing scene.

60
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,780
Well, how come that's not in Arise?

61
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,040
I couldn't say.

62
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,260
We'll have to talk to Court Holland about that.

63
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,380
I don't know.

64
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,580
He joined Scrub Genius about two months ago.

65
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,500
The guy that edited Arise, or co-edited Arise.

66
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,900
You'll never scrub that subgenius scene away.

67
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,580
He did most of the old movie clip stuff.

68
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,380
I more did the whole overall outline of it, and then he filled in a lot of blanks.

69
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,320
But yeah, he joined Scrub Genius.

70
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,460
A lot of people do this.

71
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,120
They join Scrub Genius, and I let them in, and then they never, they just lurk.

72
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,300
Court Holland made a movie of my personal judgment.

73
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,480
A personal journey to Dobstown.

74
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Is that in your archives?

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,880
No, because he shot that in a really poor way.

76
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,640
Oh, well.

77
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,300
It was awful.

78
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,480
You couldn't hear a word.

79
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,280
All you could hear was, you know.

80
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,880
The motor of that boat going up that river.

81
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:42,420
Yeah.

82
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,000
And you could tell it wasn't a river in the Amazon.

83
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,560
Drowns out my narration.

84
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,580
Well, we have to take it easy on ourselves, you know.

85
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,440
We can't.

86
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,420
That was done when cameras were huge.

87
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,400
Like the size of that Jim Beam bottle.

88
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,400
Instead of the size of your thumbnail or your glasses.

89
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,280
How long am I supposed to sit up here just staring at this Jim Beam bottle?

90
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,040
Well, you can do more than stare.

91
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,920
That's not your house.

92
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,940
It's mine, and you're welcome to sample it.

93
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,180
Take some samples.

94
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:21,700
I bragged online that I had bought you that, and somebody sent me $17.50 towards your booze.

95
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,100
I'm told this is better than old girl data.

96
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,880
That's half of $35.

97
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,360
I like that.

98
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,080
He's a big spender.

99
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,400
I think old granddad's better.

100
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,320
I was told, though, by an authoritative person that this was better.

101
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,720
It's what they said.

102
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,860
It's a buck more expensive than old granddad.

103
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,540
Hey, I noticed you mentioned Kamchatka vodka.

104
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,220
What?

105
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:41,540
No.

106
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,300
Please don't associate me with that.

107
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,840
You brought it up.

108
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,480
No, no, wait.

109
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:45,820
What?

110
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,780
Hold on, hold on.

111
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,360
I disavow any mention of Kamchatka vodka.

112
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,040
Oh, shoot.

113
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,500
You can't turn her to an idle remark.

114
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,080
Mike C. Todd brought Kamchatka vodka.

115
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,200
Don't look at me.

116
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,200
I didn't do it.

117
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,500
I'm not responsible.

118
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,980
All these designer vodkas they've got now, lemon, lime, and so forth.

119
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,600
That's the one I bought.

120
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,120
Watermelon juice.

121
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,700
Cheap, but it's not too bad.

122
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,740
We can edit this part out of the show so no one else hears it.

123
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,360
I didn't do it.

124
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,760
I never drank Kamchatka vodka.

125
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,160
It's gross.

126
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,740
That you remember.

127
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,300
I take it back.

128
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,380
How about tequila?

129
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:16,860
It's not that gross.

130
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,480
It does have a bit of a motor oil taste.

131
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,360
But I always thought that was what vodka was supposed to be.

132
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:22,500
It's awful.

133
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,060
Oily?

134
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,740
It's like the worst.

135
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:24,920
Huh?

136
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,220
Motor oil.

137
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,800
Motor oil.

138
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,580
30 weight.

139
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,380
Yeah.

140
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:28,820
Yeah.

141
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,620
It's got a...

142
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,140
You could probably run a lawnmower with it.

143
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,600
Not the lawnmower.

144
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,080
It's got like the shortest time span of hangover, drinking to hangover.

145
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,640
It's as soon as it touches your tongue, you're hungover already.

146
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,920
That explains it.

147
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,780
Anyway, it doesn't have sugar.

148
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,740
Maybe it does.

149
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,700
No, no.

150
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,700
It's just pure...

151
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,200
It's motor oil, basically, with some kind of...

152
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,000
Hooch in it.

153
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,420
Hmm.

154
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,520
Pouring oil on troubled waters.

155
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,140
Yeah.

156
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,180
Well, gin, of course, is oily.

157
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,800
What can you do?

158
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,600
Nothing is perfect.

159
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,860
You have to shop around for your method of getting slack.

160
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,680
Well, you can buy jugs of moonshine now.

161
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,620
The labeled moonshine, which it seems like that defeats the whole purpose.

162
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,040
The fun of moonshine is that it was illegal.

163
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,340
Yeah.

164
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:20,680
Right.

165
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,220
How can you...

166
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,400
Yeah, if it's bottled in some factory...

167
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,020
It lacks...

168
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,900
It lacks authenticity.

169
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,180
Making it authentic to today's life.

170
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,340
That's like legal marijuana.

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,380
It's just...

172
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,400
What is the point?

173
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,540
Yeah, what's that going to do to all our friends who are old, scruffy dope growers and dealers?

174
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,500
It's going to ruin their lives.

175
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,280
All because some namby-pamby goo-goos have to make marijuana legal.

176
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,100
Oh, man.

177
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,160
It's a good thing it's still illegal in Ohio.

178
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,700
Are we never...

179
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,240
Are we perpetually dissatisfied?

180
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes.

181
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,860
The minute they legalize that crap, I'm mad too.

182
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:54,460
I'm mad too.

183
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,260
Bob.

184
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:55,940
Never touch it again.

185
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,480
Yeah, I'm too mad, Bob.

186
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,840
We can't be satisfied until we're aboard our personal saucers.

187
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,820
We have to give thanks for the conspiracy because elsewise, where would we be?

188
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,120
How would we know what to hate?

189
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,520
What would we have to fight against?

190
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,160
Yes, it's what repels us like the pole of a magnet.

191
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:15,600
Yeah.

192
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,840
We have other subgeniuses to fight against, which, if you look on the internet, is going over...

193
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,940
Well, they say they're subgeniuses.

194
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,000
They claim they're...

195
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,920
They're credentials, but...

196
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Oh, it's always easiest to fight the enemy that's most familiar.

197
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,600
You know, your next-door neighbor or the other person in your members-only subgenius club.

198
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,940
The enemy that's most like you, but with one tiny difference.

199
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,320
Right.

200
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,160
It's the one you hate more than the one that's completely, totally different from you in every respect.

201
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,300
Right.

202
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,120
The Baptists and Methodists hate each other so much more...

203
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,140
Oh, it's so good.

204
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:46,500
I love it.

205
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:46,900
...than they...

206
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,020
Really, than they hate even the Catholics or the Muslimics.

207
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,500
We should just declare war on First Church of the Last Laugh.

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,220
Again.

209
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,580
I don't know.

210
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,160
Was that ever done?

211
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,600
No.

212
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,620
We declared war on them?

213
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,940
Oh, that's what Philo was saying then.

214
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,980
Oh, Philo just likes to stir things up.

215
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,220
Well, okay, if we haven't done it yet, then we should definitely do it for the first time,

216
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,860
especially if it hasn't been done before.

217
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,360
Death to St. Stupid and the First Church of the Last Laugh.

218
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,720
We want the last laugh.

219
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,260
Yeah, we want the last laugh.

220
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,200
Bob is stupider than St. Stupid.

221
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:20,460
Yeah.

222
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,740
But they have been ecumenically yoked.

223
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,860
And at the St. Stupid Pavilion at Burning Man, yes, Burning Man again,

224
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:36,020
they have allowed subgenius to have a department there, which has no other presence.

225
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,420
Gee, that's rather condescending.

226
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,720
Well, where else is subgenius to be found?

227
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,180
No one else will come forward and do it.

228
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:50,460
And they themselves are next to a heretical sect of splitters from the First Church of the Last Laugh

229
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,780
called the Fathers of St. Stupid, who go a different way.

230
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,520
They're the ones that like to get naked, right?

231
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,060
No, they don't.

232
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,720
But they sure like to say insulting things about St. Stupid and his church.

233
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,200
Well, that's, you know, as soon as the Church of the Subgenius got on its feet,

234
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:15,840
of course, there had to be anti-subgenius schisms made by the most dedicated subgeniuses.

235
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,000
The naked people actually do show up for the St. Stupid parade.

236
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,400
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer Launcher Society.

237
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,680
We kind of disavowed them.

238
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,220
Oh, speaking of which.

239
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,960
Because they're all...

240
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,640
Ugly.

241
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,400
I just remembered something.

242
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,280
What was that, Stang?

243
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,960
I don't have...

244
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,100
Of course, I don't have the true, original bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

245
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,200
I would think not.

246
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,180
We'd all be dead.

247
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,920
But I do have a really good replica.

248
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,120
And I would think, and it's been a long time since we had a head launching.

249
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,620
And it wasn't just invented by the hyperclites.

250
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,260
Papa Joe Mama did it a few years ago.

251
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,460
No, well, we all did it.

252
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,040
We've all been caught, you know, launching heads here and there.

253
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,780
Oh, right, right.

254
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,680
Yeah, that's right.

255
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,180
Here at Wisteria, Papa Joe did it.

256
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,840
Was that the first year?

257
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,040
The first year at Wisteria?

258
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,120
I don't know.

259
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,340
It was some kind of a head.

260
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,140
I don't know if...

261
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,260
It was some sports figure head, I think.

262
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,380
Mass Wisteria.

263
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,940
It may have been Tiger Woods.

264
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,560
I don't think it was.

265
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,020
But I do have a Palmer head.

266
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,020
I think it was some kind of alien head.

267
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,760
A recognizable, official Palmer head.

268
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,320
Hand-painted.

269
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,580
Hand-painted.

270
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,520
Bleeding.

271
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,340
Ever bleeding.

272
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Like a fountain.

273
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,860
And that head, we could...

274
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,300
We have to think about that.

275
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,300
Well, don't let me keep you back.

276
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,560
You know, if you all have any good ideas about some new way...

277
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:38,880
Slingshot.

278
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,300
You know, we have these rockets.

279
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:41,980
Slingshot.

280
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,260
Yeah, big slingshot.

281
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,580
With a...

282
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,360
We could stick a...

283
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,800
The light bulb's good.

284
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,700
Anybody got a giant rubber band like in a Warner Brothers Roadrunner cartoon?

285
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,240
That's what we need, is a...

286
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,940
Well, we...

287
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,240
We can put a rock in it.

288
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,240


289
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,600
We can put a rock inside that rubber head to give it some inertia.

290
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,280
We talked about possibly a monster was responsible for that little dog's disappearance.

291
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,060
Oh, that's silly.

292
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,900
But, of course it is silly.

293
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:13,680
But I'm just saying, if there were a monster, that launching that bleeding head might be the only weapon that could conceivably stop it.

294
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,740
If that comes up, we'll have to think about it.

295
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,960
Yeah, we should work on a big slingshot.

296
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,300
They have those big slingshots for water balloons.

297
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:20,920
Right.

298
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,400
And it's summer, which means they're out there somewhere.

299
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,740
Well, we don't need to go buy one.

300
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,120
They should.

301
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,040
They splattered themselves with the balloons.

302
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,260
He can make one out of logs and skin.

303
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,780
His own skin.

304
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,500
It's pretty stretchy.

305
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,060
He's very dedicated.

306
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,560
That stretches it all right.

307
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,020
He donated his hair to the church one time, and he had about as much as me.

308
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,220
Look at that.

309
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,920
Greater love hath no man.

310
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,780
I can stick it all the way out at the end of my arm.

311
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,820
He's been at it longer than you, baby bear.

312
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,920
You'll catch up.

313
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,600
You'll catch up.

314
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,840
We need to trim this.

315
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,040
It's getting way down in there.

316
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,620
Huh?

317
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,160
There you go, Stan.

318
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:11,020
You've nurtured this Delilah in the church who's sapping you of your strength by cutting off your manly hair.

319
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,380
Oh, bit in pieces.

320
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,760
Yeah, she did actually give me a haircut this morning.

321
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,920
I didn't know you messed with the bottom of it.

322
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,640
Clean up America.

323
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,300
Get a haircut.

324
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,760
That's the part that keeps my ass crack warm.

325
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,940
It'll grow back.

326
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,540
It's a living, growing hair.

327
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:22,740
No, actually.

328
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:22,880
It's a living, growing hair.

329
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,540
I'm not so sure about that.

330
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,360
Oh, yeah?

331
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:25,860
Well.

332
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,640
It's getting kind of thin.

333
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,340
I can hide most of it in one of my ears.

334
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:38,220
Well, I could talk about my own ailments also, but I'm not sure that's of great interest to our audience today.

335
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:45,960
They don't want to hear a couple crotchety old people falling apart want to hear other such stories.

336
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:52,580
Well, we were talking earlier about how Bob is kinky and likes some kinky stuff.

337
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,280
Well, we'll get to that.

338
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,740
There have been times where he likes to flatline.

339
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,340
He gets a kick out of it because he knows he's going to come back.

340
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,480
Hmm.

341
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:07,040
He has had us flay him alive.

342
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,980
Oh, don't stop now.

343
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,140
Oh, please.

344
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,760
Finish it.

345
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,380
Get the rest.

346
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,620
This feels pretty good.

347
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,580
I might get to like it.

348
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,440
He's had us give him organ transplants while he's conscious.

349
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,900
He's had us.

350
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:28,160
He's had us blow him up with dynamite because when the smoke clears there,

351
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,580
he's sitting there with a few band-aids and dark smudges.

352
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,360
Just like those cartoons.

353
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,740
For a humorous effect.

354
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,040
Right.

355
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,720
He got tired of the little death.

356
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,840
He wanted the big death.

357
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,620
Yeah.

358
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,200
Yeah.

359
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,640
Or he gets the same from the big death that most people get from the little death.

360
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,900
But Bob does nothing by small niggling increments,

361
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,640
but always in one huge blowout blast.

362
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,880
Well, remember, it started with him tricking Puzzling Evidence into shooting him to death

363
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,320
right in front of us.

364
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,380
What a chump.

365
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:06,860
And then not six months later, he tricked Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo into doing it again.

366
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,440
I was there both times, actually.

367
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,440
So, yeah, he's...

368
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,380
And then he just moved up.

369
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,900
It's like we weren't deadly enough.

370
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,760
I understand he went to fight the Taliban single-handedly for a while

371
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,820
because he heard about...

372
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,960
That beheading stuff, that sounded fun.

373
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,580
You know, we can't pretend to...

374
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,180
We just got the we.

375
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,160
We can't put ourselves in Bob's head.

376
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,500
There's nothing there.

377
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,060
We doesn't agree.

378
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,300
We don't know what nothing truly is.

379
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,320
You know?

380
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,960
Is nothing sacred?

381
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,340
Space isn't really nothingness.

382
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,420
But what's inside Bob's head?

383
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,700
Well, it's the same thing that's in his pipe.

384
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,080
Our faith, friends.

385
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,080
Our trust.

386
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,900
Our faith in Bob.

387
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,880
Our faith in Bob.

388
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:52,880


389
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,160
The F.I.B.

390
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,040
Praise that man, Bob.

391
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,020
Right.

392
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,300
No Fliberty gibbet.

393
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,600
A living, breathing, sanctifying, slack-filled savior.

394
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,520
On the other hand, my butt's getting tired talking about him.

395
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,920
You've been talking with that, then?

396
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,540
No, no.

397
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,320
I'm just tired of sitting here.

398
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,620
Actually, what time is it?

399
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,540
Is it past my...

400
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,580
It's past three.

401
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,760
We finished one hour.

402
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,820
It's quarter after three.

403
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,360
Oh.

404
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,800
Wow.

405
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,280
We won't be here until five.

406
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:24,980
That's for sure.

407
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,820
I have a shift.

408
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,580
Oh.

409
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,160
Oh, at the swag table.

410
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,260
Which means someone else can come up.

411
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,020
All right.

412
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,280
Yes, we have room now.

413
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,140
Baby Bear is leaving the stage.

414
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,860
If someone else wishes to come up...

415
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,200
I want to leave the stage.

416
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,660
Well, you can do whatever you want.

417
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,240
Or you can go and sit at the registration shack.

418
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,380
But I think the sitting is the problem, right?

419
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,000
The lack of motion.

420
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,020
The lack of momentum.

421
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,800
Actually, I think I need to go meditate

422
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,880
in one of those...

423
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,600
sweat lodges.

424
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,020
They love lighting the room.

425
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:56,920
Well, make sure you do.

426
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,180
Pretty soon, too.

427
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,840
Well, I...

428
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,040
Princess, why don't you come up here

429
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,820
and just sit here and laugh

430
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,160
while Dr. Hal talks.

431
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,220
Laugh.

432
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,820
Let's hear that laugh in the dark.

433
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,760
And Pisces says Skull has stories to tell.

434
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,700
Oh, headphones.

435
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,900
Oh, boy.

436
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,160
I'll...

437
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,960
Yeah.

438
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,540
Yeah.

439
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,580
There we go.

440
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,080
Good Lord.

441
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,860
Now I hear everything in stereophonic sound

442
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,540
with all the sound effects,

443
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,680
the savagery and splendor,

444
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,760
the might, the music,

445
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,240
and the miracle of X-Day

446
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,920
blazing into my ears.

447
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,700
So how come there's only one pair of earphones

448
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,340
in this lousy...

449
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,060
in this...

450
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,040
on this historic occasion?

451
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,820
Yes, I must say

452
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,940
that it is a signal honor

453
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,460
to be seated here

454
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,600
with the subgenius Archons

455
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,500
and...

456
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:51,680
and, uh,

457
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,740
bobcasting

458
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,680
for perhaps a future Earth.

459
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,560
A better world than this.

460
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,700
A place where inexplicable insects

461
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,240
will not suddenly gang up on you.

462
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,140
Or maybe they will.

463
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,160
We must adjust ourselves

464
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,220
to an entirely new scale of values.

465
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,320
The old world will die

466
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,980
and the old beliefs along with it.

467
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,040
And after traveling through

468
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,560
many hundreds of years,

469
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,740
hundreds of universes

470
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,180
and sub-universes,

471
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,900
one ultimately comes to

472
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,720
the so-called

473
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,500
end of the rainbow,

474
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,780
the punch line.

475
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,480
I refer you to the

476
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,020
afterlife diagram

477
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,840
in Revelation X,

478
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,760
the undescended, uh,

479
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,320
new testicle of the

480
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,140
book of subgenius,

481
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,260
the second subgenius book.

482
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,000
Now out of print,

483
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,920
like the third one,

484
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,980
also out of print,

485
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,460
hard to come by,

486
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,740
accruing in value

487
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,860
constantly.

488
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,660
But, of course,

489
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,380
and I've said this before,

490
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,500
nothing is more valuable

491
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,700
or rare than the

492
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,560
lost subgenius comic book,

493
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,380
Bob's Comics and Stories,

494
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,240
because the run was small

495
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,120
and then they were all stored

496
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,700
in an illegal Chinese fireworks factory,

497
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,760
which exploded and destroyed

498
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,940
most of the run.

499
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,020
So although you can see these online

500
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,360
and order them,

501
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,260
they are expensive.

502
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,360
Except, of course,

503
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,760
to the true blue subgenius

504
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,300
who will spend on

505
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,240
any old subgenius thing.

506
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:27,900
And it's a pity,

507
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,780
because they've got

508
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,180
great stories,

509
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,960
including one horrible story,

510
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,380
so horrible that it's not

511
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,340
recommended for anyone

512
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,220
who is subject to

513
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,460
fits of depression.

514
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,660
That is, of course,

515
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,460
Care Bob Meets,

516
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,360
no, Care Dog Meets Pea Bear

517
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,180
by Ivan Stang,

518
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,600
illustrated by

519
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,260
St. Paul Mavridis.

520
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,120
And I have work in the book,

521
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,380
too.

522
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,200
There's a lot of good stuff in there,

523
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,080
but no one will ever see it.

524
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,320
Just as when they made

525
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
the medieval cathedrals,

526
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,220
sometimes those stonecutters

527
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,800
would make some little gargoyle

528
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,140
or something that was way up there

529
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,620
in an angle that nobody could ever see.

530
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,160
But God would see it.

531
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,840
God would know

532
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,460
what they did.

533
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,880
And that's why they're there.

534
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,940
And a lot of work done

535
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,560
in the Church of the Subgenius

536
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,100
is work that's done in the church.

537
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,320
That only Bob will ever see.

538
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,700
But that doesn't mean

539
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,280
it's not worth doing.

540
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,940
For one thing,

541
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,700
practice makes perfect.

542
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,120
It'll set you

543
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,840
into a better channel,

544
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,540
on a better path.

545
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,960
Do you agree, Princess Wee?

546
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,080
I absolutely agree.

547
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,780
Yes, I saw you shaking

548
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,920
your head at some of our

549
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,360
flights of fancy before.

550
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:44,660
Yes, but the audience

551
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,680
can't hear that, so.

552
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,280
No, but I definitely want to do

553
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,060
what you will approve here,

554
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,020
not the other way,

555
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,520
but the other way around.

556
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,060
Oh, I very much approve.

557
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,740
I agree.

558
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,580
Right.

559
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,920
So, when the roll is called up yonder,

560
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,760
I'll be there.

561
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,580
I'll be there.

562
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,220
When the roll is called up yonder,

563
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,300
I'll be there.

564
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:05,720
Right?

565
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,440
In the suite, by and by,

566
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,240
we will meet at the beautiful shore.

567
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,340
Yes, and I'll be there.

568
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,840
Yes, we'll all be there.

569
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,260
In our white linen undergarments.

570
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,700
Those are provided.

571
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,600
Provided for free.

572
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,660
We won't have to worry about supply,

573
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,400
chain, supply and demand,

574
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,000
all that stuff.

575
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,660
Are they magic underwear?

576
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,180
Apparently.

577
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,660
Won't we be in some transhuman state?

578
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,060
Well, obviously, the underwear

579
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,340
must expand to fit that, too.

580
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,340
Yes, I guess so.

581
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,220
Yeah, it's logical.

582
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,020
I'm only speaking on a basis

583
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,840
of what one might logically infer.

584
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,500
I possess no secret knowledge

585
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,460
about the mystery that lies

586
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,340
behind the veil.

587
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:49,760
Well,

588
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,040
Oh, sure you don't, Hal.

589
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:52,900
Sure you don't.

590
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,520
I'm just, I mean, it's,

591
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,360
nobody knows what happens

592
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,580
when the fellow in the bright nightgown

593
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,680
comes to your door,

594
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,660
takes your number.

595
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,760
Strange is it not

596
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,200
that of the myriads who before us

597
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,280
pass the door of darkness through,

598
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,720
not one returns to tell us of the road

599
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,200
which, to discover,

600
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,940
he must travel to.

601
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,800
Indeed.

602
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,180
Indeed.

603
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,040
And I would even add,

604
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,140
the revelations of devout and learned

605
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,460
that rose before us

606
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,100
and as prophets burned

607
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,760
are all but stories

608
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,520
which arose from sleep

609
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,100
they told their comrades

610
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,240
and to sleep returned.

611
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,800
It's a pity they didn't have the wine

612
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,580
that we do.

613
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,360
I mean, we know the way it really is.

614
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,760
Their religions are false,

615
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,440
ours are true,

616
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,500
but it's necessary to have the,

617
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,000
have something,

618
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,820
to kick against,

619
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,520
like the conspiracy,

620
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,200
as we mentioned before.

621
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,980
Subvert the conspiracy from within

622
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,920
and be a glorious subgenius without.

623
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:00,320
Huh?

624
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:00,740
Hmm?

625
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,400
Mm-hmm.

626
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:01,900
Indeed.

627
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,460
Mm-hmm.

628
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:02,920
Uh-huh.

629
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,380
Uh-huh.

630
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,380
Yeah, anybody wants to throw anything in here,

631
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,840
if I'm leaving anything out,

632
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,840
now's the time to bring it out

633
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,380
when the secrets of all hearts are made known

634
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,820
and the sea gives up its dead

635
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,300
and monsters walk the earth

636
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,160
and so forth.

637
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,160


638
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,160


639
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,160


640
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,160


641
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,160


642
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,560
Meanwhile,

643
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,340
continue to enjoy the projections

644
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,140
to my left.

645
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,280
They are valuable educational assistance

646
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,980
which will bring you further in alignment

647
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,120
with the sacred doctrine of Dobbs.

648
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,200
Also, this could be the point to say,

649
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,440
if you have submissions for the Bull Dada auction,

650
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,680
we need to start collecting them

651
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,440
to make this Bull Dada auction

652
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:51,290
the greatest in subgenius history.

653
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,750
So we all go out with a bang.

654
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,010
Yes, indeed.

655
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,290
Bring them to the stage

656
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,470
and let them gather around here.

657
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,130
Follow in Mr. Sistar's golden footsteps

658
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,270
because he's already gifted us

659
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:09,610
with a bunch of ultra-watchable DVDs.

660
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:09,910
Yes.

661
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,770
But we'll even accept VHS

662
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,590
as we have in previous years.

663
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,410
And white elephants of all kinds.

664
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,370
Right.

665
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,770
That's your elephant.

666
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:22,010
Yes.

667
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,470
Anyway, we'll take them.

668
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,450
Just bring them up.

669
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,990
So on that great day mentioned in your schedules,

670
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,750
you can begin.

671
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,410
Just get a taste of the avalanche load of swag

672
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:40,510
coming your way when all goes right.

673
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:45,150
And visit the swag table over there

674
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,250
where Reverend Baby Bear,

675
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:47,390
where Reverend Baby Bear,

676
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,890
will happily sell you

677
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,610
any number of Dobbs, Chucks,

678
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,170
Chkis, and Doodads.

679
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,970
How many of you don't have

680
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,110
a little Bob pin to wear?

681
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,330
You know, it's a little pin

682
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,670
and somebody will ask you about it.

683
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,350
And you can tell them about subgenius.

684
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,030
Yes, they'll ask you about it

685
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,030
at the worst time possible

686
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,530
when you are in trouble

687
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,070
by the side of the road or whatever.

688
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,210
And then you have to start talking about Bob

689
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:12,750
and so on.

690
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,310
And it's awkward.

691
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,890
But you can be a proselytizer,

692
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,450
an evangelizer,

693
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,390
and tell the good news

694
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,970
to these oafs and pink vapid glorps

695
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:24,570
and so forth

696
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:28,110
and maybe shock them

697
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:31,150
out of their somnolence and sloth.

698
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,790
And from what I saw,

699
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,890
there's only just a tiny bit of things

700
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,170
sitting out that are for sale.

701
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,850
I think that the sales department

702
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,890
has a lot of unfurling to do.

703
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:44,670
Just ask.

704
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,210
Just ask.

705
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,050
And, and,

706
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,630
and she'll get it out for you.

707
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,390
She'll share it for you.

708
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,230
I believe there are some pretty neat things

709
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,310
Might even model it for you.

710
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,150
that are here that you

711
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,630
aren't seeing out on the tables.

712
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:56,010
I'd like to look through them.

713
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,570
Including a pin that is by Suds Pasha,

714
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,730
our sound guy.

715
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:01,410
Really?

716
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,390
I hadn't heard of this.

717
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,430
A pin?

718
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,150
Yes.

719
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,570
And, oh, there it is.

720
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:05,790
Yeah.

721
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:06,450
Medallion?

722
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,150
Mm-hmm.

723
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:07,690
Yes.

724
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,390
Can be used

725
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,170
How about that?

726
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,510
in many ways.

727
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,610
Yes, for many purposes.

728
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,210
Yes.

729
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,590
Which we won't enumerate here.

730
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,350
You have to use your imagination.

731
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,110
I mean, do I have to draw your picture?

732
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:20,430
No.

733
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,970
Suds will draw the picture.

734
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,230
Same thing with Dobbshead's pins.

735
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,370
That's right.

736
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,230
Well, the Dobbshead pin,

737
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:25,590
I,

738
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,870
it's such an easy way

739
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,050
to stand up just a little bit

740
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,470
for your subgenius inheritance.

741
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,090
I always try to,

742
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,570
to stick it on me somewhere.

743
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,310
Yeah, here it is.

744
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,590
See, I wear mine.

745
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:38,830
They're cheap

746
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,170
as things like that go,

747
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,490
considering what they indicate,

748
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,090
what they say about you.

749
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,270
The cloisonne pin

750
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,190
is a really nice pin.

751
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,550
Yes, it is, isn't it?

752
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,290
Yes, you can pin the tail

753
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:53,850
on the tail teller.

754
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:54,950
Sew?

755
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,970
Sew or knit.

756
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,050
That's right.

757
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,490
You can knit it also.

758
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:03,810
You can have a knit cap for Dobbs.

759
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,210
And look at this.

760
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,170
Look at that.

761
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,530
A Bob T-shirt

762
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,750
held out there

763
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,270
by Pisces now.

764
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,710
Tripping Bob, isn't it?

765
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,030
Or no?

766
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,970
Tripping, you say?

767
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,090
Well, look at,

768
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,290
it's not so much

769
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,270
as Bob is tripping.

770
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,330
It's the way Bob looks

771
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,930
when you are tripping.

772
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:23,850
I don't have to look.

773
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,250
Well, generally,

774
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,470
we have them in small,

775
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,230
medium, large,

776
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,930
extra large,

777
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,110
extra, extra large,

778
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,250
elephantine,

779
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,850
and circus tent.

780
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,750
It looks great from here.

781
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,870
I can't see the tripping aspect,

782
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,550
but my eyes are not

783
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,610
what they used to be.

784
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,210
Too many thousands of hours

785
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:43,930
looking through.

786
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,290
Yeah, I know.

787
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:45,990
I have,

788
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,150
I haven't come down for years.

789
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,190
I once was at a gathering

790
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,670
where I had seven males

791
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,570
who my husband claims

792
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:58,130
are not fabric-oriented

793
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,070
talking to me about

794
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,050
that very op art T-shirt

795
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,850
that Pisces was just holding up.

796
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:05,770
Look at that.

797
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,290
They were all trying to describe

798
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,630
that T-shirt

799
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,050
which Potter Nostril had worn

800
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,570
the weekend before.

801
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,470
And they were stumped

802
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,770
as to how to describe,

803
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,430
I guess op art

804
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,190
just didn't come to them.

805
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,110
I should mention that the,

806
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,870
those extra black shirts

807
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,050
are ones that

808
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,230
we don't sell in our catalog.

809
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:29,290
They,

810
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,370
because I don't have room

811
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,770
in the Slacker Mansion

812
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,470
for stacks upon stacks

813
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,390
of all these shirts

814
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,190
of different sizes.

815
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,150
Anticonformity.com makes those.

816
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:43,030
And I ordered a giant box

817
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,410
of his extra specs

818
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,870
and special different designs

819
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,910
for last X Day.

820
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,910
They arrived at the end of Starwood.

821
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,350
So they're fresh.

822
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,330
And they're here now.

823
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,650
They're fresh and you'll never,

824
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:56,950
they're not in our catalog.

825
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,190
They're in his catalog

826
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,710
but you'll never find them for sale

827
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,650
right in front of your face

828
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,590
like this again.

829
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,190
It was destiny.

830
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:04,750
You see,

831
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,770
last year didn't come off

832
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:07,530
as X Day but.

833
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:07,990
That image there

834
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,790
was done by Don Truby

835
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,070
of the Dancing Cigarettes

836
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,010
using scotch tape

837
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,450
and fake cigarettes.

838
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,310
It was a fake magazine.

839
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,290
Well, I'll be.

840
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,610
He would lay the scotch tape

841
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,450
onto a headline

842
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,570
on fake magazine

843
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,690
which had crappy ink

844
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,070
and peel it off

845
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,350
and then put the tape down

846
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,430
on the Dobbs head

847
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,170
and it would still hold

848
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,530
the headline

849
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,910
or the ad from fake magazines.

850
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:33,510
So kids,

851
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,950
you don't need Photoshop.

852
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:38,970
All you need is a crappy pulp magazine,

853
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:39,990
a Dobbs head

854
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,210
and some scotch magic tape.

855
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,290
And there you go.

856
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,210
You can make a colon.

857
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,770
That is old school.

858
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,930
You need those things.

859
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,550
Old school.

860
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,570
Yes, but you also need zeal.

861
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,990
The zeal and zest

862
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,270
which cause you to make the art.

863
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,650
Just zeal.

864
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,730
Yes, you can zeal it down

865
00:28:58,730 --> 00:28:59,710
with scotch tape.

866
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,950
You need the zest also

867
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,970
to clean it

868
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,270
but basically you need

869
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,910
a motive force,

870
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:07,910
a motive power

871
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,010
to inspire you

872
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,670
to make subgenius art

873
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,750
what it is.

874
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,470
And it is what it is,

875
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:14,850
ladies and germs.

876
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,990
Hey, I can switch places with you now.

877
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,930
Very well.

878
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:19,470
You don't know what to do

879
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,270
with those headphones.

880
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,870
There's nothing coming through them.

881
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,410
And you wouldn't know what to do

882
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,470
because you're not the engineer.

883
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,170
There was a subgenius

884
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,550
who lived in a shoe

885
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,110
when he had subgenius earphones.

886
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:35,130
He didn't know what to do.

887
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,470
That's right.

888
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,750
The subgenius engineer is back.

889
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,690
You could actually hear through his earphones.

890
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,330
A rambling wreck from Georgia Tech.

891
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,390
And a subgenius engineer.

892
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,290
Oh my goodness.

893
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,670
Wow, the Obey shirts.

894
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,990
Those are like...

895
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,730
That's a tiny one.

896
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,690
We don't have very many

897
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,870
of the tiny little lady shirts.

898
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,210
Oh, that's for the females.

899
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,150
Slightly, yes.

900
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,470
Makes it easier to read.

901
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,110
Make your own art

902
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,610
with your body.

903
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,470
Oh, the koozies.

904
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,250
The beer koozies

905
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,570
are $5 a piece.

906
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:10,430
That's another thing

907
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,690
we don't carry in the catalog.

908
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,810
Dobbshead beer koozies.

909
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,430
They matter.

910
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,890
Magically keep your drink cold

911
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,470
or at least lukewarm

912
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,370
or room temperature anyway.

913
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,550
Eventually, they will keep it

914
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,470
at room temperature.

915
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,170
Sold at X-Day only.

916
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,430
Improve your drinking experience.

917
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,370
Anybody else want to be

918
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,390
on the hour of slack?

919
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:33,530
Slack.

920
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:35,510
Yes.

921
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,770
All you have to do is just...

922
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:37,170
Slack.

923
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,090
Slack.

924
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,050
Skull, come on up, man.

925
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:39,670
The soft voice.

926
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,570
Well, I know that...

927
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,870
Slack, the luminous cloud.

928
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:42,790
Look, he's got a script.

929
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,410
We in ourselves rejoice.

930
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:45,970
Slack.

931
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:46,290
Whack.

932
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,610
I have to sit here

933
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,530
because I'm the only one

934
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,450
who knows how to work

935
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,770
these complicated radio chat machines.

936
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,850
Well, you just keep doing

937
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,770
that razzmatazz, Stang.

938
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,790
We're all counting on you

939
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,850
to turn those knobs

940
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,230
and twist those dials.

941
00:30:59,230 --> 00:30:59,790
I'm a star.

942
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,710
I'm a star.

943
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,250
Hi, Mom.

944
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:02,290
Oh, God.

945
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,130
I can't even speak now.

946
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:03,790
Hi, Mom.

947
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,430
I mean, she's dead,

948
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,310
but she can hear me.

949
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,330
Well, I hope that didn't do it.

950
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,150
I've got a sort of

951
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,690
a related Bible story.

952
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,270
Well, let's hear that one, Stang.

953
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,530
And I even have music

954
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,450
that goes with it.

955
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,010
Music?

956
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:18,530
Yeah.

957
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:19,830
Sweet music.

958
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,370
Well, it's not exactly

959
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,370
a Bible story.

960
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:22,970
Is this...

961
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,930
If music be the food of love,

962
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,070
play on.

963
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:26,710
Okay.

964
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,570
Count Jesus

965
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,670
is the name of this.

966
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:34,850
Count Jesus?

967
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,650
Yeah.

968
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,990
All right, let's hear it.

969
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,710
How do I count the Jesus?

970
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:38,810
How do I count the ways?

971
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:40,630
We'll see.

972
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,790
I'm waiting for my background music.

973
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,190
Waiting for that background music

974
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:44,950
to cue in.

975
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,650
Here we go.

976
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,290
The tale begins with Simon Peter,

977
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,550
a newly qualified Judean solicitor

978
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,110
journeying from Jerusalem

979
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,250
to Lord Christ Jesus'

980
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,090
crumbling remote castle

981
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,690
on the border of Galilee.

982
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,730
The purpose of his mission

983
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,670
is to provide legal support

984
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,010
to Jesus for a real estate transaction

985
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,650
overseen by Peter's employer

986
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,470
in Jerusalem.

987
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,330
At first, enticed by Jesus'

988
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,410
gracious love,

989
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,670
Peter soon discovers

990
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,190
that he's become a prisoner

991
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,010
in the castle.

992
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,750
He also begins to see

993
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,970
disquieting facets

994
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,850
of Jesus' normal life.

995
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,950
One night,

996
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,110
while searching for a way

997
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,050
out of the castle

998
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:28,890
and against Jesus'

999
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,390
strict admonition

1000
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,750
not to venture outside

1001
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,770
his room at night,

1002
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,630
Peter falls under the spell

1003
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,390
of three wanton female

1004
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,090
Nazarenes,

1005
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,490
or brides of Jesus,

1006
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,570
referred to only as

1007
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,070
the sisters in the novel.

1008
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,910
He is saved at the last second

1009
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:45,410
by the Lord Jesus Christ,

1010
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,590
because he wants to keep

1011
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,890
Peter alive long enough

1012
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,390
to obtain needed legal advice

1013
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,630
and teachings about Jerusalem,

1014
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,590
his planned travel destination,

1015
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,150
so as to be among the

1016
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:57,470
quote,

1017
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,250
teeming millions.

1018
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,410
After preparations are made,

1019
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,570
Jesus leaves the castle

1020
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,470
and abandons Peter to the brides.

1021
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,250
He barely escapes the castle

1022
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:06,830
with his life.

1023
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,390
Not long afterward,

1024
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,410
a Roman galley,

1025
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,710
the Golgotha,

1026
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,990
having weighed anchor at Galilee,

1027
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,350
runs aground on the shores

1028
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,370
of the river Jordan,

1029
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,630
during a fierce tempest.

1030
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,850
All of the crew are missing

1031
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:18,650
and presumed dead,

1032
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,050
and only one body is found,

1033
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,110
that of the captain

1034
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,410
tied to the ship's helm.

1035
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,270
The captain's log is recovered

1036
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,730
and tells of strange events

1037
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,610
that took place

1038
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,730
during the ship's journey.

1039
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,090
The disappearance of the entire crew,

1040
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,370
apparently owing to

1041
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,350
a malevolent presence

1042
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,290
on board the ill-fated ship.

1043
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:37,270
An animal described as a large dove

1044
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,110
is seen on the ship

1045
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,270
flying ashore.

1046
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,330
The paraclete,

1047
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,590
the ship's cargo,

1048
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,550
is described as frankincense

1049
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,390
and boxes of candy.

1050
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:45,670
It is described as a

1051
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,470
of myrrh,

1052
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,250
or perfume,

1053
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,550
from Nazareth.

1054
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,850
Soon, Jesus is tracking

1055
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,850
Peter's devoted fiancée,

1056
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,470
Hail Mary,

1057
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,570
and her friend,

1058
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,570
Mary Magdalene.

1059
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:56,750
Magdalene receives

1060
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,110
four marriage proposals

1061
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,050
in one day,

1062
00:33:59,090 --> 00:33:59,830
from John,

1063
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:00,350
Mark,

1064
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:00,790
Luke,

1065
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:01,450
and Matthew.

1066
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:02,950
Magdalene accepts

1067
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:03,890
Matthew's proposal

1068
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,830
while turning down

1069
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,510
John and Mark,

1070
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,570
but all remain friends.

1071
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,270
Jesus has a notable encounter

1072
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:10,490
with John's patient,

1073
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,450
John the Baptist,

1074
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,650
an insane man

1075
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,710
who means to consume

1076
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,270
insects,

1077
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:15,850
spiders,

1078
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,190
birds,

1079
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,030
and other creatures

1080
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,490
in order to absorb

1081
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,910
their life force.

1082
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:21,590
John the Baptist

1083
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,490
acts as a motion sensor,

1084
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,810
detecting Jesus' proximity

1085
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:28,190
and supplying clues accordingly.

1086
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:29,910
Well, I probably should skip

1087
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,030
over the whole story

1088
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,970
because you know

1089
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,650
many of the details

1090
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,770
from coloring books.

1091
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,630
But they get him eventually.

1092
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,150
At the end,

1093
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,610
after the group sterilizes

1094
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,990
all of Jesus' lairs

1095
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,650
in Jerusalem

1096
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,970
by putting pieces

1097
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,470
of deconsecrated host

1098
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,630
in each box of earth,

1099
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,250
Jesus,

1100
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,790
flees back to his castle

1101
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,790
in Nazareth,

1102
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,930
transported in a box

1103
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:52,650
pursued by Pontius Pilate's group

1104
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,050
who themselves are aided

1105
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,690
by Pontius Pilate

1106
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,830
hypnotizing Mary

1107
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,850
and questioning her

1108
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,650
about the Messiah.

1109
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,670
Pontius Pilate and Mary

1110
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,530
camp in the forest

1111
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,450
outside the castle

1112
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,210
where the Nazarene sisters appear

1113
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,730
and attempt to entice Mary

1114
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,850
to join them entirely.

1115
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,790
Pontius Pilate manages

1116
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:10,870
to drive them away

1117
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:11,590
and during daylight

1118
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,530
goes to the castle

1119
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:13,230
and kills them.

1120
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,230
Shortly afterwards,

1121
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,030
all converge,

1122
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:16,390
the Lord Christ

1123
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,730
just at sundown

1124
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,510
under the shadow

1125
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,230
of the castle.

1126
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,490
Peter and Mark

1127
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,270
rush to Jesus' box

1128
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,770
which is being transported

1129
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:24,710
by rabbis.

1130
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,750
Peter shears Jesus

1131
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,770
through the throat

1132
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,310
with a circumcision knife

1133
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,430
while the mortally wounded Mark

1134
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,210
slashed by one of the rabbis

1135
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,030
stabs the Lord Christ

1136
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:37,790
with a spear in the heart.

1137
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,450
Jesus crumbles to dust

1138
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,730
and Mary is freed

1139
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,790
from his curse.

1140
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,050
But he will,

1141
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,030
he will return

1142
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,310
in the sequel.

1143
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:47,670
He will return.

1144
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,750
Count Jesus.

1145
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,150
Are any of us safe from him?

1146
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,670
Well, we will be shortly.

1147
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,590
Him with a capital H.

1148
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,610
We'll be safe shortly.

1149
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,490
Aren't you glad

1150
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,910
I skipped over some of that?

1151
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,810
Yeah, some of it is too grisly

1152
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,210
to tell.

1153
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:03,970
Yeah, it's too horrible.

1154
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,050
The things that the...

1155
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,790
With dead people coming to life

1156
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,610
and all that stuff.

1157
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,130
We don't want to scare our listeners.

1158
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:10,910
Well, the Nazarenes

1159
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,470
take, use mind control.

1160
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,350
Yes, they do.

1161
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,090
They have a lot of pork in there.

1162
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:15,210
They do.

1163
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,530
Now, I have a rant here

1164
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,110
written not by me,

1165
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,010
but by fellow citizen Bork,

1166
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:25,690
a subgenius in Norway.

1167
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,030
Bork, you say?

1168
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,650
Yeah, fellow citizen Bork.

1169
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,830
He's a Norwegian.

1170
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:33,810
His English is considerably better

1171
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,010
than most American writers.

1172
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,410
I bet his English is better

1173
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,510
than most Americans Norwegian.

1174
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,410
Anyway, it's a short one.

1175
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,530
And it's about where...

1176
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,630
Your job, working at a job.

1177
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,570
It was called,

1178
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,230
I wonder if the asshole,

1179
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,350
asoles, not assholes,

1180
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,510
but asoles,

1181
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,590
know how rare they are.

1182
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,770
I mean, out of all the hundreds

1183
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,690
or even more than a thousand people

1184
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,090
I'm forced to talk to

1185
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:02,730
in the smile prostitute part of my job,

1186
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,670
I can count the number of true asoles

1187
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,410
in a year on one hand.

1188
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:09,890
They really are very alone.

1189
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,670
Even though they act like they have

1190
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,610
the full support

1191
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,350
and the wrath,

1192
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,030
of all right thinking society,

1193
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,810
slapping their back and going,

1194
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:18,930
you go big man,

1195
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,830
rage and rant at that girl trying to help you,

1196
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,370
until she goes hiding behind the closet to cry.

1197
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,250
I wonder what they would do

1198
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,750
if they ever found out how lonely they are.

1199
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,430
How would they react if they knew

1200
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,170
how freakish and disturbing

1201
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,010
their behavior really is?

1202
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,430
Even normal people,

1203
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,690
being obsessed with normality as they are,

1204
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,850
seem to have trouble rationalizing

1205
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,910
the asolish mode of interaction as normal.

1206
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,990
You can see it making the inner pigeon brain,

1207
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,030
magnetic normality compass,

1208
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,670
wobble a bit,

1209
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,030
until it settles back down to pink.

1210
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,190
It's like watching someone deliberately

1211
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,590
and proudly piss themselves in public.

1212
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,410
I don't know whether to be entertained,

1213
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,290
mortified or profoundly saddened

1214
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:06,050
at this deep failure at pretending to be human.

1215
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,770
It's like their grip on their inner chimp

1216
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:12,030
just slips and it comes brachiating out

1217
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,190
at high speed,

1218
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,810
howling and yammering,

1219
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,770
hammering the walls with both fists

1220
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,270
and smearing crap everywhere.

1221
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:22,350
Isn't that what playing human is all about?

1222
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,950
Holding down that damn monkey

1223
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,470
and pounding it in the nuts

1224
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,870
until it won't dare to raise

1225
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,990
its beetle-browed little noggin ever again?

1226
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:33,010
It's amazing there are so few slip-ups, really,

1227
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:36,490
but it just makes having to experience it for money

1228
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,610
infinitely sadder.

1229
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,090
The end.

1230
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,170
All these monkeys,

1231
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:43,470
monkey references.

1232
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,930
Thank you, fellow citizen Bork.

1233
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:45,870
Yeah, no offense.

1234
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,690
Are you making fun of my family again,

1235
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,290
Ivan Stan?

1236
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,750
Well, you know,

1237
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,130
you should be used to that by now.

1238
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,870
How do you feel about movies like Planet of the Apes?

1239
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,270
Well, I always root for the apes.

1240
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,190
Apes aren't monkeys.

1241
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,370
Well, of course.

1242
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,870
You know, apes are actually the superior intelligence.

1243
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,270
We are apes, yes.

1244
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:04,850
No.

1245
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:05,910
Monkeys are...

1246
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,430
No, they're really horrible.

1247
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:10,550
Monkeys are stinking little chattering brainless animals

1248
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,370
one step above humans

1249
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,590
on the evolutionary chain.

1250
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,370
Damn right.

1251
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:15,810
I mean, you know...

1252
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:19,830
I think there's a line like that in the Tim Burton

1253
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:21,890
Planet of the Apes.

1254
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,130
I need to catch up with that.

1255
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,230
The best part of which is that some of it was shot at

1256
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,190
the Trona Pinnacles

1257
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,190
outside Death Valley.

1258
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,150
And they move them around a lot.

1259
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,050
I noticed in the movie they took some...

1260
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:41,450
some real liberties with the placement of those

1261
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,950
big rock formations.

1262
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,050
Well, that's Hollywood.

1263
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:45,630
Yeah.

1264
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,630
But, you know, that Tim Burton version is actually

1265
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,010
very, very authentic.

1266
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,070
Sticks to the line of the original novel.

1267
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,950
Yeah, it is a little bit more like Pierre Belay's weird novel.

1268
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:01,170
You mean they got cars and buildings and things?

1269
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,290
It ends in...

1270
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,570
When they come back in time, they found that the apes

1271
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,630
actually took over the world.

1272
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,070
Right. It's not Earth.

1273
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:09,070
It doesn't have the Rod Serling ending.

1274
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,430
It really is a planet of go-realism.

1275
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,410
And gorillas and chimpanzees and humans.

1276
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:14,350
But at the end...

1277
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,370
It's not Earth after an atomic war.

1278
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,550
At the end of the Pierre Boulle novel,

1279
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,310
they get off from the Planet of the Apes.

1280
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,170
They blast off. They go back home.

1281
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:26,490
And find that Earth now has been taken over by apes.

1282
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,270
That's how the Tim Burton movie ends.

1283
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,650
Well, that's the end of the Boulle novel, too.

1284
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:35,030
An officer comes across the landing field in a jeep.

1285
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,370
And when he gets out, he's a gorilla.

1286
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,570
And the people who read the message in the bottle

1287
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,890
that he found in space are apes.

1288
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,130
Because the original novel...

1289
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:44,590
That's right.

1290
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:48,370
The story was like a message in the Bible.

1291
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,890
You don't know who they are in the book until after the end.

1292
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,250
And they're apes, too.

1293
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:56,250
They're space-going, space-faring apes.

1294
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:00,410
So the whole thing is a great comfort to the selectors.

1295
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,230
And only these dirty, rotten humans...

1296
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:05,830
One thing I really like about the Tim Burton movie, though,

1297
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,650
they brought back Linda Harrison.

1298
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,550
Is this the new...

1299
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,610
Tim Burton movie?

1300
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,590
Well, it's the one about six years ago.

1301
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:13,150
Oh.

1302
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,350
It's not the new, new reboot.

1303
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:15,910
Okay.

1304
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:18,470
There was the Tim Burton movie, which is too dark to see.

1305
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,050
I'm so confused.

1306
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,650
The one with Mark Wahlberg. It's not that one.

1307
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,410
That's what we're talking about.

1308
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:24,770
Oh, yeah.

1309
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:25,450
Mark Wahlberg.

1310
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,430
Okay. All right. Sorry.

1311
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,390
Then there's the new CGI ones.

1312
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,070
Just suck.

1313
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,010
CGI?

1314
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,490
Yeah. The plant...

1315
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,410
Yeah. You've seen...

1316
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:35,290
There's two of those now.

1317
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:35,550
Yeah.

1318
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,710
What's his name? Gollum.

1319
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,270
The guy who played Gollum is the...

1320
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,390
Right. Andy Serkis.

1321
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:40,550
Yeah.

1322
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:44,090
He's the go-to guy for motion control of apes in Hollywood.

1323
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:47,310
So he has on his resume playing King Kong, Gollum,

1324
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:50,830
and a super smart Caesar ape that takes over the world.

1325
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:51,110
Yeah.

1326
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:53,770
If I had my way, he would play Bob.

1327
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:58,870
Because in a movie, although he's British, he can handle...

1328
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,090
Or Australian or something.

1329
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,030
He can handle... Or New Zealand-ish.

1330
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:05,130
He can handle lots of accents. I've seen him do it.

1331
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:05,870
Including American.

1332
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,250
And if you were going to make a big Hollywood movie,

1333
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,650
about J.R. Bob Dobbs, obviously he can't play himself.

1334
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:16,430
And there's the problem of using a human actor.

1335
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,810
I call the Sean Connery problem.

1336
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,370
Or the James Bond problem.

1337
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:23,290
You've got... The guy has you over a barrel.

1338
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,790
If he... If Stephen Colbert plays Bob,

1339
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:30,210
then for a million dollars in the first movie,

1340
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:33,310
he can charge five million dollars the next time.

1341
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,470
So...

1342
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:35,830
But what about CGI?

1343
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:39,250
Let's face it. If you study the head of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1344
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:42,250
that is not a human head.

1345
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:45,250
Despite the fact that it's taken from a photograph of him,

1346
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,630
back when he could be photographed.

1347
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:50,770
It is not a head that will match any other human.

1348
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,110
Well, you know...

1349
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:55,330
And why not use CGI for Bob?

1350
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,590
He looks a little off.

1351
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,250
You're not sure...

1352
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,330
You know, they call it the uncanny valley.

1353
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,330
He's already made out of dots.

1354
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:08,830
They make a CGI character that's as close to human-looking as possible.

1355
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,510
Like in the Neutron remake.

1356
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,510
But it just doesn't cut it.

1357
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:14,270
There's something that gives you the creeps.

1358
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:16,450
You know what a human looks like.

1359
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:17,790
And...

1360
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:18,650
Kind of like Mitt Romney.

1361
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,590
So the fake one, that somehow shows.

1362
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:24,050
In the case of Bob, that's the way he is in real life.

1363
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:25,910
It's what you...

1364
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,810
It's very hard to be in the room with the guy.

1365
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:33,650
If he hadn't been killed that time, he showed up in San Francisco,

1366
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,550
I don't know what would have happened to Hal and me.

1367
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,510
And everybody else on stage.

1368
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:39,670
Well, actually, look what happened.

1369
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,430
Yes.

1370
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:45,370
So, Andy Serkis being the go-to guy for CGI characters,

1371
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:50,610
and having played King Kong, the greatest role any actor could ever hope for,

1372
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:56,630
I say we're going to hold out for Andy Serkis to play Dobbs.

1373
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,810
Of course, later on, we'll have built the model,

1374
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:01,310
and we can have somebody else play him if Serkis decides to get hoarse.

1375
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:01,450
Yes, that's the thing.

1376
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:04,190
It used to be that the actor would have you over a barrel,

1377
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,570
but now, once you've got his...

1378
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:11,730
his looks from all sides, then you can simply generate him spontaneously.

1379
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,170
Now, Stang, I want your input.

1380
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:16,810
This new theory going around that Bob is actually some kind of shape-shifter?

1381
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:18,410
What's that sound?

1382
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,250
Is that that monster? That thing? Whatever?

1383
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:22,650
No, it's just a motorcylce.

1384
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:24,650
Just an internal combustion engine.

1385
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:29,410
No, but there's a new theory out there that Bob is actually like a shape-shifter,

1386
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,530
like on the Salt Vampire on Star Trek.

1387
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:32,510
He looks at...

1388
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:35,390
We see Bob, each person sees Bob,

1389
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:35,890
and Bob is a different person.

1390
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,390
So Bob wants your salt, eh?

1391
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:38,090
Yes.

1392
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:41,710
But, you know, he doesn't look the same to each person,

1393
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,430
like the Salt Vampire on Star Trek.

1394
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:47,550
What's your opinion on that theory?

1395
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,690
I'm sorry, I completely...

1396
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,410
What's your opinion of whether Bob is a shape-shifter

1397
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:59,590
like the Salt Vampire on Star Trek?

1398
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:02,930
When you mentioned Star Trek, that was where I spaced out.

1399
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,530
I never saw any of those except the first season.

1400
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:07,870
Well, I'll tell you. I'll answer that for you.

1401
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:08,910
Did you say spaced out?

1402
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:10,350
Spaced out.

1403
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:11,870
Connie is described that way.

1404
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:16,350
Connie changes shape and hair and makeup and everything.

1405
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:17,570
May I answer?

1406
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:18,150
Yeah.

1407
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:21,710
The shape-shifting salt monster on Star Trek

1408
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:26,010
looked like whoever you wanted it to look like.

1409
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:30,810
It was actually this horrible shaggy thing, but...

1410
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:35,810
It looked like your loved ones or your deceased wife or whatever.

1411
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:38,830
In that regard, Bob is like the monster

1412
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:42,050
because he looks like what you want him to look like.

1413
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:45,910
It just happens that what you want him to look like most of all is Bob.

1414
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:48,110
Right. Yeah, that's a good answer.

1415
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:49,490
Yes, very good.

1416
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,510
It's like his luck.

1417
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:55,250
What's gonna happen just happens to be what he wanted to happen anyway.

1418
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:58,950
That's his secret, and it's no big secret.

1419
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,790
But he can't change it.

1420
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:01,530
He can't share that power.

1421
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,830
I don't think he knows he has that knowledge.

1422
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,690
It's ingrained stupidity.

1423
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:10,570
Knowledge is not what Bob seeks.

1424
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:12,870
Contracted consciousnesslessness.

1425
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:16,570
I thought he was an example of what they called unintelligent design.

1426
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:17,890
Bob.

1427
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:21,090
I don't know who's calling the shots with that one.

1428
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:24,630
He's just too stupid to realize how smart he is.

1429
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:27,110
Well, he's not the only one.

1430
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:29,910
Intelligent but hallucinating design.

1431
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:32,450
Nobody's ever brought that one up.

1432
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:37,630
Intelligent but psychopathic design.

1433
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,790
That sounds about right.

1434
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:42,430
I can see, I can believe in that.

1435
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:47,390
Psychopathic intelligent design is where people came from.

1436
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,150
Could be.

1437
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:52,530
And those crazy looking rocks that I like to see.

1438
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:55,710
The old god was and is crazy.

1439
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:57,410
So there you go.

1440
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:59,370
The original creator.

1441
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:05,070
That was a big part of Philip K. Dick's crack pathology.

1442
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:07,110
He got there the hard way.

1443
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,170
The insane creator god.

1444
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:09,590
He discovered it.

1445
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,010
He discovered that we're all in the Black Iron Prison.

1446
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:15,490
But some of us know a way out.

1447
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:16,790
Ex-day.

1448
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,330
Well, if you don't want me to say something.

1449
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:24,070
That's a good way to end the show, actually.

1450
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,090
A way out.

1451
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:26,890
I'm going to get up and shift my stones.

1452
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:30,730
And get down there and look at some of the swag while it's still out.

1453
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:32,330
I'm always available.

1454
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:33,270
I think that's a good idea.

1455
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:34,670
Continue.

1456
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:35,790
Anyway.

1457
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:38,050
Mr. Sister is shuffling up here.

1458
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,290
You can take my spot if you want.

1459
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:46,470
Mr. Sister is just a, now this is good news for once.

1460
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,870
Tomorrow, when did you say?

1461
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:50,730
About now.

1462
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:53,550
Yeah, around about this time of day.

1463
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:54,690
Around 4 o'clock or so.

1464
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:56,870
Mr. Sister will be hosting a show.

1465
00:47:56,870 --> 00:48:06,810
She's hosting a socialist social in which he, with the means of production, will dole out bloody marriage.

1466
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,050
The blood of the workers.

1467
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:08,850
To the workers.

1468
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:09,650
To you, the workers.

1469
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:10,410
The blood of the workers.

1470
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:24,670
So, you can, the big boss man, the cigar chomping capitalist is going to go lol socialist just for tomorrow and feed or get everybody drunk at any rate.

1471
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:29,370
He was originally planning to make everybody a sammich, but that's a little bit ambitious.

1472
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,210
And nobody's given him a black eye yet.

1473
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:41,550
Some of the more sensitive subgeniuses didn't like one of Mr. Sister's fix me a sammich pictures.

1474
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:44,430
Even though that's been going around the internet for a long time.

1475
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:45,330
Yeah, yeah.

1476
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:46,270
It's a common meme.

1477
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:50,870
But I guess suddenly you were a sexist instead of a sexist.

1478
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:52,030
I'm a manyist.

1479
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,890
There are many things that I am a this.

1480
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:56,010
Oh.

1481
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:59,930
But above all a patriotic, psychotic, anarcho-materialist.

1482
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:01,250
Anarcho-materialist, yes.

1483
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:02,510
That's what brings us all together.

1484
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:11,150
Republic pukes and lip tarts and all those, all the other ones that don't count because you're throwing your vote.

1485
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:18,930
And, and, and it, let's get rid of that obabo as quickly as possible too.

1486
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:21,350
Obabo the presa serp.

1487
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:22,010
The presa serp.

1488
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:32,610
You all may not have seen the, the, the pictures of obabo, the spirit behind what we think of as the President Obama.

1489
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:36,310
Whether he's good or evil, we don't really know yet.

1490
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:37,430
Yeah, he's the leader of the.

1491
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:41,010
He would probably say evil, I would probably say, what's the difference?

1492
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:46,510
The bizarro Washington D.C., the one that has, that has two capitals.

1493
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:46,930
Right.

1494
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,330
He presides over them, both.

1495
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:50,930
The kingdom of obabo.

1496
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:53,210
We know that he's watching us.

1497
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:54,690
They, they, they.

1498
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:55,970
He's listening right now.

1499
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:56,810
Of course.

1500
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:57,610
Making notes.

1501
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:58,930
Right, and it's not even online.

1502
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:02,450
No, usually they send a, a, a minion here.

1503
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,790
And I recognize almost everybody here.

1504
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:11,150
You don't think that some of these dragonflies are biological?

1505
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:11,910
Right, the bugs.

1506
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:13,950
When they say that they got your room bugged.

1507
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:15,410
They're, they're trying.

1508
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:17,010
They got you bugged with real bugs.

1509
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,770
They're trying to get into our luxury RV.

1510
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:21,610
Are they really?

1511
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:27,630
We, we, yes, we, we lay in there at night and we hear them crashing into the sides just like the birds.

1512
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:29,150
See, they love you.

1513
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:30,670
They want you.

1514
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:31,750
They don't want me.

1515
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:32,650
They don't love me.

1516
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:36,970
And yet I'm, and yet I so love the bugs.

1517
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:40,730
You know, people used to call me Needle Dick, the bug fucker.

1518
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:41,730
I will tell you.

1519
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:42,670
I will tell you.

1520
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:43,330
You know, back in the day, but.

1521
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:45,290
Should I tell you what I did with my.

1522
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:46,670
Hold it, hold the mic closer to you.

1523
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:47,950
My condo ants.

1524
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:49,330
Yeah.

1525
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,330
How bad did you kill the condo ants?

1526
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:52,970
Well, this is.

1527
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:53,730
You need to train them.

1528
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:57,010
This is the ant killing technology that they have now.

1529
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:06,050
Through scientific studies, they determined that the drone ants are just a few that go out and gather food.

1530
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,850
And they eat as much food as they can.

1531
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:13,730
And then they go back into the colony and they throw it all up.

1532
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,730
And all the rest of the ants have a feast.

1533
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:18,070
Oh, like.

1534
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:19,870
Like some genius radio show.

1535
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:20,390
Exactly.

1536
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:20,790
Yeah.

1537
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:24,070
So they regurgitate and then everybody has a warm meal, you know.

1538
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:31,370
Well, the, the exterminator told me that the theory behind the poison was, is it's completely safe for humans.

1539
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:40,130
Because the poison is micro encapsulated in a resin that the human body cannot digest.

1540
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:41,250
However.

1541
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:42,210
Is that a challenge?

1542
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:44,230
The ants can pick it up.

1543
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:53,190
And by the time they regurgitate it for their meal inside the ant colony, the poison is released.

1544
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,170
They all die.

1545
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,130
I'm still betting on the ants.

1546
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:05,570
You know, there are ant colonies larger than several states right now, including the Argentine ants that march through this area.

1547
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:09,370
Yes, this is, this is a Sandoz technology, of course.

1548
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:12,590
Ants will win every time, I believe.

1549
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:13,410
But maybe not.

1550
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:15,010
We're pretty good at killing stuff.

1551
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:17,770
Some people call them aunts.

1552
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:18,550
Aunts.

1553
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:19,530
No, those are different.

1554
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:20,470
Constance was talking about her pet ant.

1555
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:20,890
Yes.

1556
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,090
That's not the same kind of aunts, dog.

1557
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:24,750
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1558
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:25,330
I'm sorry.

1559
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:32,450
So, so I don't, I, I've had it.

1560
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:33,250
Are we through?

1561
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:34,570
I'm, I'm through.

1562
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:40,470
If nobody else wants to get up here and take over this idiotic charade, I'm out of here.

1563
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:41,990
You're welcome.

1564
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:43,390
You can, you want to go?

1565
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:43,690
You want to do a?

1566
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:45,470
Okay, sure.

1567
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:46,250
That'd be great.

1568
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:47,250
We've got the machines running.

1569
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:54,370
When the moon was new and the sun young, Of silver and gold the gods sung.

1570
00:52:54,630 --> 00:53:00,930
In the green grass they silver spilled, And the white waters they with gold filled.

1571
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:09,750
Ere the pit was dug or hell yawned, Ere dwarf was bred or dragon spawned,

1572
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,890
There were elves of old.

1573
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:16,830
And strong spells under green hills in hollow dells.

1574
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:23,030
They sang as they wrought many fair things, And the bright crowns of the elf kings.

1575
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:31,550
But their doom fell and their song waned, By iron hewn and by steel chained.

1576
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:40,350
Greed that sang not, nor with mirth smiled, In dark holes their wealth piled.

1577
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:47,770
Graven silver and carven gold, Over elven home the shadow rolled.

1578
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:56,750
There was an old dwarf in a dark cave, To silver and gems his fingers clave.

1579
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:02,850
With hammer and tongs and anvil stone, He worked his hands to the hard bone.

1580
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:10,330
And coins he made, and strings of rings, And thought to buy the power of gold.

1581
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:19,110
But his eyes grew dim, and his ears dull, And the skin grew yellow on his old skull.

1582
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:26,690
Through his bony claw, with a pale sheen, The stony jewels slipped unseen.

1583
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:33,970
No feet he heard, though the earth shaked, When the young dragon his thirst slaked.

1584
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:40,310
The stream smoked at his dark door, The flames hissed on the dank ground.

1585
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:49,790
And he died alone in the red fire, His bones were ashes in the hot mire.

1586
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:59,090
There was an old dragon under grey stone, His red eyes blinked as he lay alone.

1587
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:05,010
His joy was fled and his youth spent, He was knobbed and wrinkled,

1588
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:10,290
And his limbs bent in the long years To his gold chain.

1589
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:14,710
In his heart's furnace the fire waned.

1590
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:23,170
To his belly's slime gems stuck thick, Silver and gold he would snuff and lick.

1591
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:29,430
He knew the place of the least ring Underneath the shadow of his black wing.

1592
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:36,410
Of thieves he thought on his hard bed, And dreamed that on their flesh he fed.

1593
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:40,270
Their bones crushed, and their blood burned.

1594
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:44,710
His blood drank, his ears drooped, And his breath sank.

1595
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:48,830
Male rings rang, he heard them not.

1596
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:51,870
A voice echoed in his deep grot.

1597
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:57,870
A young warrior with a bright sword Called him forth to defend his hoard.

1598
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:07,730
His teeth were knives, and of horn his hide, But iron tore him, and his flame died.

1599
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:12,390
There was an old king on a high throne.

1600
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:15,890
His white beard lay on knees of bone.

1601
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:21,490
His mouth savoured neither meat nor drink, Nor his ears song.

1602
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:26,330
He could only think of his huge chest With its carven lid,

1603
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:34,130
Where pale gems and gold lay hid In secret treasury in the dark ground.

1604
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:37,710
The strong doors were with iron bound, And the iron doors were with iron bound.

1605
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:37,710


1606
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:45,950
The swords of his thanes were dull with rust, His glory fallen, his rule unjust.

1607
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:54,350
His halls hollow, his bowers cold, But king he was of elvish gold.

1608
00:56:54,950 --> 00:57:01,750
He heard not the horns in the mountain pass, He smelt not the blood on the trodden grass,

1609
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:07,430
But his halls were burned, his kingdom lost, In a cold pit his bones.

1610
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:08,870
His hands were tossed.

1611
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:19,350
There is an old hoard under dark rock, Forgotten, behind doors none can unlock,

1612
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:23,210
That grim gate no man can pass.

1613
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:30,230
On the mound grows the green grass, There the sheep feed and the larks soar,

1614
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:33,010
And the wind blows from the sea shore.

1615
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:37,390
The old hoard the knight shall keep.

1616
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:42,410
While earth waits and the elves sleep.

1617
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:53,090
Dr. Howell just makes that stuff up off the top of his head, you know.

1618
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:54,910
He's just spouting.

1619
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:56,210
Ridiculoso.

1620
00:57:57,970 --> 00:57:59,770
Who, is that Tolkien?

1621
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:00,850
That is Professor Tolkien.

1622
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:04,110
J.R.R. Todd Tolkien.

1623
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:04,550
Yeah.

1624
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:07,150
Originally printed in the Oxford magazine.

1625
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:11,210
Back in the day when I was a little shaver.

1626
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:12,070
Nerd.

1627
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:14,790
Okay, I'm outta here.

1628
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:22,770
You've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

1629
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:37,330
For free information write to P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44.

Or see www.subgenius.com.

1631
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:47,730
Praise Bob.

1632
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:53,190
We will lead this damn nation to damnation, as Dr. Leib gave us.

1633
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:55,470
We will lead this nation to damnation.

1634
00:58:56,110 --> 00:59:01,390
Those weren't his real eyes, those were the subgenius fake 3D eyes that he bought from

1635
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:01,870
Stank.

1636
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,270
Or not, he didn't buy them from Stank.

1637
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:07,270
Stank approved them and sold them and endorsed them.

1638
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:07,310


1639
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:07,310


1640
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:16,630
Don't be jealous.
