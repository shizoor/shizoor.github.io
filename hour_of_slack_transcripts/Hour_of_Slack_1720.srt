1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,600
The mind of man has always longed to know what lies beyond the world we live in.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,780
Explorers have ventured into the deeps and the heights.

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,340
Of these explorers, some are scientists, some are mystics.

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,680
Each is driven by a different purpose.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,060
The one thing they share in common is a wish to cross the borderlands that lie beyond...

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,440
The subgenius power of slack.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,520
Stand by. Stand by please.

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:38,140
1-3-0-1-3-1-3-0-1-3-1-3-0-1-3

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,320
From PR News in Washington, I'm sexually abused by Catholic priests over decades.

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,140
Leading to catastrophic PR news.

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,380
According to Twitter, he added, we look forward to identifying together the most effective sexual abuse.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,420
President Trump is rejecting the bill.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,980
He's rejecting an official government tally.

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,440
Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rosselló posted on Facebook that the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico, quote, deserved their pain.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,160
The Vatican has announced Pope Francis has ordered an investigation of PR.

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,480
And Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan says there's no reason to dispute.

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,480
PR reports Weinstein's lawyer says this is PR news.

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, we can make it work.

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,880
We, the Christians, can make it work.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,940
Every time.

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,200
So we better get up, stand up for your rights.

22
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,100
Or someone would say we're coming in from the cold.

23
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,360
Or another one would say the sun is shining and the weather is sweet.

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,560
And someone would say is this love.

25
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,280
And everyone would say everything.

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,960
Let's move it.

27
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,780
Preach a man, oh, tell me if heaven is on the earth.

28
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,760
I know you don't know what life is really worth.

29
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,620
Is that all that glitter is gold?

30
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,180
After story and everything told.

31
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,280
So now you see the light.

32
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,340
Hey, you stand up for your rights.

33
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:23,860
Because

34
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,180
Now, in the midnight hour.

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,980
Stand up for your rights.

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,780
We're the rebel, yeah.

37
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,640
Don't give up the fight.

38
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,280
Don't give it up right now.

39
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,720
In the midnight hour.

40
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,540
Stand up for your rights.

41
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,780
Stand up.

42
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,400
We're the rebel, yeah.

43
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,300
Don't give up the fight.

44
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,220
Most people think.

45
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,020
Great God will come from the sky.

46
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,960
Take away everything.

47
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,820
And make everybody feel high.

48
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,440
But if you know what life is worth.

49
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,320
You would look for yours on earth.

50
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,300
And now you see the light.

51
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,380
Yeah, you stand up for your rights.

52
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,060
Because

53
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,200
In the midnight hour.

54
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,040
Stand up for your rights.

55
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,880
We're the rebel, yeah.

56
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,780
Don't give up the fight.

57
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,480
Don't give up the fight.

58
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,760
In the midnight hour.

59
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
Stand up for your rights.

60
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,080
Stand up for your rights.

61
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,500
We're the rebel, yeah.

62
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,340
Don't give up the fight.

63
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,580
We're sick and tired of your easy-kissing game.

64
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,020
Die and go to heaven in Jesus' name.

65
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,760
Lord, we know and we understand.

66
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,760
Almighty God is a living man.

67
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,220
You can fool some people sometimes.

68
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,680
But you can't fool other people all the time.

69
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,560
So now we see the light.

70
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,840
What you gonna stand up for?

71
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
Yeah, and I...

72
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,320
What we gonna do?

73
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,640
No time for pointing the finger at me.

74
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,920
That's right, we gotta stand up.

75
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,940
Let's hold on...

76
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,740
Hello, we're the rebel, yeah.

77
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,080
And now you see the light.

78
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,820
Stand up for your rights.

79
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,340
And now you see the light.

80
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,540
Because in the midnight hour

81
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,340
Stand up for your right

82
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,380
Keep us troubling

83
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,260
With a rebel yell

84
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,060
Don't give up the fight

85
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,840
Get up, stand up

86
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,040
Stand up for your right

87
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,600
Get up, stand up

88
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,680
Don't give up the fight

89
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,400
Get up, stand up

90
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,460
Stand up for your right

91
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,160
Get up, stand up

92
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,180
Don't give up the fight

93
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:45,460
Get up, stand up

94
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:46,760
Get up

95
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:46,760


96
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:46,760


97
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:46,760


98
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,060
ings into me

99
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,440
Yy-k has arrived

100
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,100
We're k-y'd up

101
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,920
We're going to slide Home Free

102
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,100
He gots slide Home Free, baby

103
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,880
On the X, X-ray

104
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,100
x,y,z

105
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,640
X cheers zero

106
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,720
I love prophecy, seriously.

107
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,420
But this time we've learned our lesson.

108
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,080
We can't rely on invisible monsters from outer space.

109
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,040
We can't even rely on Bob.

110
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,280
We have to learn how to escape Earth

111
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,360
without being dependent on the conspiracy or any extraterrestrials or salesmen.

112
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,980
Sure, send in your 30 bucks, but

113
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,480
build your own ship!

114
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,360
You may not have to, but just to cover your ass.

115
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,700
Build your own ship!

116
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:56,520
Even better, go buy Hangar 18 or Area 51 or Cape Canaveral or Studio 54

117
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,580
and steal your own ship!

118
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,840
Ah, yes.

119
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,560
Extract your own fuel.

120
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,600
And while you're at it, friends,

121
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,900
let's swap the deck on the spaceship that we're already stuck together on.

122
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,460
We're already riding on the spaceship.

123
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,720
And it's in bad shape.

124
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,700
And it's high time we cleaned it up.

125
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,680
Earth, we must get off!

126
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,080
Whether we leave it or leave it a cinder.

127
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,840
Whether we blow it off or blow it up.

128
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,740
Just don't blow it, friends.

129
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:38,100
That $30 to Bob proves that you consider your life to be worth $30.

130
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,300
You don't spend that much on prancing rock stars anymore.

131
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,120
Oh, but some people think,

132
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,600
well, Bob might be lying again.

133
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,640
Oh, no.

134
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,000
Friends, Bob makes a million dollars every time he screws up.

135
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,080
By screwing up last time, he made $10 billion.

136
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,040
This next day, when the saucers do arrive,

137
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,700
he won't lose that $10 billion,

138
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,140
because we already did!

139
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,120
We're out our $30.

140
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,380
His fuck-up already happened.

141
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,760
He has nothing to gain by us losing.

142
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,680
So this time, we will win!

143
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,200
And, uh, you know, even if X-Day didn't work out,

144
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,200
we'll go for Sex Day!

145
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,160
We want you people to dance into the new century.

146
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,640
Screw into the new century.

147
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,740
Sleep and eat your way into the new century.

148
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,920
Whatever you're doing in the moment of turnover

149
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,040
is what you'll be doing forever.

150
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,260
So make sure you're not asleep.

151
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,380
Make sure you're not watching TV.

152
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,180
Make sure you're not listening to Pat Boone.

153
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,640
Make sure you're not reaching for an itch

154
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,400
you'll never be able to scratch.

155
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,980
Friends, you're floating in a sea of pills.

156
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,340
A sea of Bob's pills.

157
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,980
But you're just too blind, deaf, and dumb to see them.

158
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,100
Oh.

159
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,520
Oh, friends.

160
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,560
I know you're not the dumb, ass-dicated type.

161
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,180
I know you're the smart-ass-dicated type.

162
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,800
Oh, but people say,

163
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,360
Reverend Stagg, what is slack?

164
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,920
I want you to tell me what slack is.

165
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,020
You know, friends,

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,360
the television doesn't have to watch you

167
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,520
as long as you are watching the television.

168
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,060
And a lot of people,

169
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,360
a lot of people think that slack is that Miller beer commercial.

170
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,480
Where everybody's good looking,

171
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,040
and you're rich, and your team just won the game,

172
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,560
and you're drinking Miller beer,

173
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,380
and your favorite show is on.

174
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,000
And you know that's bullshit,

175
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,460
because slack is not laziness, friends.

176
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,240
Slack is getting into the zone.

177
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,420
It's being awake and alert

178
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,440
and doing what you wanted to do

179
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,840
until your eyes snap open

180
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,360
and you're smart enough to realize

181
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,220
that you are God.

182
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,220
Life is worth living.

183
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,360
And everything is just as simple.

184
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,320
It's as psychedelic as an old T-shirt

185
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,420
that you can't get into anymore.

186
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,840
Now hold that thought.

187
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,380
Hold it in your head.

188
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,960
Because that is what slack is all about, friends.

189
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,240
Slack is something for nothing.

190
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,760
As you know, we don't have a river to dunk you in.

191
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,480
But we cleaned out the muck sink.

192
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,360
And, um, yeah, you might just want to take off your shirt.

193
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,680
Okay, nope. See, I can't do this.

194
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,940
I'm sorry. I really want us to get along.

195
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,400
I do.

196
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,500
But I can't pretend to believe in something I don't.

197
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,280
And I don't.

198
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,380
Chatwin, we've all had our doubts.

199
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,660
No, see, this isn't doubts.

200
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,300
I believe in science.

201
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,580
I believe in evolution.

202
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,600
I believe in Nate Silver and Neil deGrasse Tyson

203
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,340
and Christopher Hitchens, although I do admit

204
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,700
he could be kind of an asshole.

205
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,060
I cannot get behind some supreme being

206
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,260
who weighs in on the Tony Awards

207
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,920
while a million people get whacked with machetes.

208
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,360
I don't believe a billion Indians are going to hell.

209
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,680
I don't think we get cancer to learn life lessons.

210
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,480
And I don't believe that people die young

211
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,920
because God needs another angel.

212
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,080
I think it's just bullshit.

213
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,980
And on some level, I think we all know that.

214
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,540
I mean, don't you?

215
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,660
The angel thing does seem kind of desperate.

216
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,360
Look, I understand that religion makes it easier

217
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,060
to deal with all of the random,

218
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,960
shitty things that happen to us.

219
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,260
And I wish I could get on that ride.

220
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,280
I'm sure I would be happier.

221
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,100
But I can't.

222
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,140
Feelings aren't enough.

223
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,400
I need it to be real.

224
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,440
And that little rant comes from the TV show called

225
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,220
Orange is the New Black,

226
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,460
which I've been watching out of solidarity with prisoners,

227
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,260
even though it's basically just a funny TV show.

228
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,860
That big ranting with music,

229
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,180
that comes from a devival that I did

230
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,620
with Einstein's Secret Orchestra in the Pufferdome

231
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,200
at Starwood Festival in the year 2000.

232
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,900
Our titles and news are from Limer.

233
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,140
And that mashup of Bob Marley and Billy Idol

234
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,580
is from a video by Bill McClintock,

235
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,580
which I got off YouTube after I was turned on

236
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,960
to this guy's stuff by Reverend Susie the floozy.

237
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,860
In fact, there's another one by,

238
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,100
uh,

239
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,660
Bill McClintock coming up in about three minutes

240
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,140
after this song,

241
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,280
Low Road,

242
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,440
by the band called Massive Hot Dog Recall

243
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,160
with Al Mothersbaugh on vocals and trombone.

244
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,720
I got my guitar,

245
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,460
I got my guitar,

246
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,380
I got my guitar,

247
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,680
I got my guitar,

248
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,080
I got my guitar,

249
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,220
I got my guitar,

250
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,160
I got my guitar,

251
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,360
I got my guts in the glove box,

252
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,040
I got my Dukes ten and two,

253
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,800
My better judgment is asleep in the backseat,

254
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,620
I'm looking for you.

255
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,080
Bumper tap in the left lane,

256
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,920
I'm gonna pass you on the right,

257
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,320
Chubby truckers on their CB radio,

258
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,160
Saying mofo's tight.

259
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,560
Not taking the high road,

260
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,060
though I probably should,

261
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,720
Spitting gravel on the low road,

262
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,920
Does me a desk cloud of good?

263
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,000
Not a deserted justification,

264
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,020
I'm wavy all night,

265
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,640
Switchbacks don't mean a thing,

266
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,860
I'm not coming back,

267
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:50,760
Listen,

268
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,440
Not gonna waste all my time,

269
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,700
Waiting for you to come correct,

270
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,280
Gonna get to you,

271
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,580
Feeling restless,

272
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,960
This chicken's gonna back back,

273
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,560
I got that!

274
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,300
Low road feels good in the moment,

275
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,500
Only if you do it right,

276
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,240
Low road is a necessary evil,

277
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,240
When you wanna take a bite,

278
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,340
Not taking the high road,

279
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,880
Though I probably should,

280
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,440
Spitting gravel on the low road,

281
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,680
Does me a desk cloud of good?

282
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,940
Not a deserted justification,

283
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,820
I'm wavy all night,

284
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,460
Switchbacks don't mean a thing,

285
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,780
I'm not coming back,

286
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,040
Listen,

287
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,540
Not a deserted justification,

288
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:46,820
Over the hill I'll hit it,

289
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,200
First time I'm driving fast,

290
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,800
While moving is the only way,

291
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,820
And I'm the only one who knows fast,

292
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,660
highest my braille,

293
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,160
Makes things much a little weirder,

294
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,040
There will be an Representation,

295
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,680
Like Trump there!

296
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,400
Who unite?

297
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,680
That's just black and white,

298
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,020
Whoτο 계.�

299
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,160
Mmmm,

300
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,400
Not taking the high road

301
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,020
Though I probably should

302
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,660
Spitting gravel on the low road

303
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,900
Does me a dust cloud of good

304
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,180
Not incertitude and justification

305
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,140
I'm way beyond that

306
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,660
Switchbacks don't mean a thing

307
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,700
I'm not ever coming back

308
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,180
Living just enough

309
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,400
Just enough

310
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,260
Living just enough

311
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,800
For the support

312
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,640
Of the people

313
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,440
Yeah

314
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,800
A boy's born in Hotline, Mississippi

315
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,800
Surrounded by a world that ain't so pretty

316
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,820
His parents give him love and affection

317
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,140
To keep him strong, moving in the right direction

318
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,560
Living just enough, just enough

319
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,480
Living just enough for the city

320
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,900
Just enough

321
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,360
His father works some days for 14 hours

322
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,820
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar

323
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,460
His mother goes to scroll the floors for many

324
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,100
And you best believe she'll hardly get the penny

325
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,600
Living just enough, just enough

326
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,020
Living just enough

327
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,460
Living just enough

328
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:00,460


329
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,320
For the city

330
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,480
His sister's black, but she is shown the pretty

331
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,400
Her skirt is short, but little legs are sturdy

332
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,160
To walk to school, she's got to get up early

333
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,540
Her clothes are old, but never are they dirty

334
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,040
Living just enough, just enough

335
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,840
Living just enough for the city

336
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,360
Just enough

337
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,440
Her brother's smart, he's got more sins than many

338
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,200
His patience long, but soon he won't have any

339
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,880
To find a job is like a haystack needle

340
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,540
Cause where he lives, they don't use colored people

341
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,980
Living just enough, just enough

342
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,740
Living just enough for the city

343
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,280
I'm saving for the city

344
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,440
A saving for the city

345
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,240
Just a saving

346
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,720
Save for the city

347
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,540
Save for the city

348
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,860
Just a saving

349
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,920
Save for the city

350
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:12,540
Bill McClintock did that mashup of Stevie Wonder and Guns N' Roses, and now, from KPFA Berkeley, some puzzling evidence.

351
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,740
Now we're going to start by splicing Gene Shellick down the street here.

352
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,980
Then we'll splice Gene Hoffman and Gene Simmons.

353
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,380
And Gene Simmons to Gene Seabird.

354
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,200
I was fighting the collars off with a pipe, you know.

355
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,220
Oh, ye.

356
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,780
Heading down to Coral Landers.

357
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,780
Oh, you're on here.

358
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,860
And unaware in your underwear.

359
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,420
The collar tried to kill show with special signal.

360
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,240
Hello, you're on.

361
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,160
Special sound effect.

362
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,960
Not possible.

363
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,440
Oh, wait a minute.

364
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,020
Wait a minute.

365
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,720
I know this collar.

366
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,440
Cut him off.

367
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,120
All right, let's try the other collar.

368
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,720
I don't want that other one on.

369
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,760
That collar doesn't know the meaning of fair play and good 100% Americanism.

370
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,720
Oh, I see.

371
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,460
And as an American and a subgenius, I resent these collars trying to make this show their own personal playground.

372
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,060
This am not show.

373
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:56,820
This show, mister.

374
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,000
Hey.

375
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,460
Why do I get confused with the show?

376
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,460
This is rotten.

377
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,680
I've tried everything.

378
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,700
It's not cool.

379
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,480
I remember those parties we used to have.

380
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,220
We'd have the subgenius beach party.

381
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,160
We'd all go down there.

382
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,180
Subgenius beach party.

383
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:13,880
Hey.

384
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,520
Subgenius circus time.

385
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,400
You were invited.

386
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,040
Come on down to the subgenius beach party.

387
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:21,920
Yeah.

388
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,460
We got hot dogs.

389
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,720
Subgenius beach party.

390
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,660
Ice cream.

391
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,440
You prepared that?

392
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,500
And it's getting hot.

393
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,400
It's getting better.

394
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,040
You won't imagine, come on.

395
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:51,440


396
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:51,540
Advisor, sir.

397
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:51,780
It's been some practice.

398
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,560
How long have you Behavioral and Behavioral Sports?

399
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:52,560


400
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:52,560


401
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:52,560


402
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:52,560


403
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:52,560


404
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:52,560


405
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:52,560


406
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,240
fallait in turn that.

407
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,900
Easter wanted to invite.

408
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,400
But still a rest it def Michel fell,

409
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,520
I can bear.

410
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,800
Of course I apologize to the editor.

411
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:57,800


412
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:57,800


413
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,620
Coco multivariate.

414
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,360
Well, you didn't have to wear tongue such as a female compare.

415
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:00,360


416
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,420
I see the bad moon rising

417
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,320
I see trouble on the way

418
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:11,220
I see earthquakes and lightning

419
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,900
I see bad times today

420
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,140
Oh!

421
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,920
Kill it in the name of

422
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,360
Oh!

423
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,180
Don't go around tonight

424
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,060
Let's finally take your life

425
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,020
There's a bad moon on the rise

426
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,440
I hear hurricanes a-blowing

427
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,540
I know the end is coming soon

428
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,780
I hear rivers overflowing

429
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,400
I hear the waves overflowing

430
00:23:59,400 --> 00:23:59,400


431
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,100
Boys are raging ruin

432
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,960
We know you're doing what they told ya

433
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,640
Don't go around tonight

434
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,500
Let's finally take your life

435
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,640
There's a bad moon on the rise

436
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,680
Oh!

437
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,000
Thorns who died are justified

438
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,040
But wearing a badge ain't a chosen one

439
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,200
But wearing a badge ain't a chosen one

440
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,200


441
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,460
Thorns who died but wearing a badge ain't a chosen one

442
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:24,700
But wearing a badge ain't a chosen one

443
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,860
Hope you got your things together

444
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,180
Hope you got your things together

445
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,520
Hope you got your things together

446
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:39,560
Look like we're in for nasty weather

447
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,520
One eye is taking for a nap

448
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,660
Don't go around tonight

449
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,860
Let's finally take your life

450
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,360
There's a bad moon on the rise

451
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,460
Don't go around tonight

452
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,320
Well, it's fine to take your life

453
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,400
Yeah, the bad moon on the rise

454
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,600
Now you do what they told you

455
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,200
Don't go around tonight

456
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,140
Well, it's fine to take your life

457
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,100
Yeah, the bad moon on the rise

458
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,540
Bad moon rising

459
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,880
I won't do what you tell me

460
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,860
Quite prepared to die

461
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,160
I won't do what you tell me

462
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,020
We're in for nasty weather

463
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,520
I won't do what you tell me

464
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,480
The boys are right here to ruin

465
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,740
I won't do what you tell me

466
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,780
Oh!

467
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:16,100
That one was mixed by, or at least posted to YouTube by, someone named Pixel Shifter.

468
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,780
And now this.

469
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:28,960
Hundreds of New Yorkers at a religious revival chanting the name of a modern-day prophet.

470
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:29,880
Bob.

471
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:36,620
Bob's teachings are the foundation of a church that does little more than parody cults and American consumerism.

472
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,100
It's called the Church of the Subgenius.

473
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,060
Tom Vitale has this report.

474
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,260
You will pay to know what you really think.

475
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,880
But if you give us money, we will tell you what to think.

476
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:56,380
And not only have you paid to know what you really think, but once you will get value for your dollar.

477
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:02,100
Americans will buy anything, and they're getting sold short.

478
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:08,940
That's the message of the Church of the Subgenius, as delivered by the Pope of all New York, David Meyer, at a recent revival.

479
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:18,300
Meyer also instructed the enthusiastic crowd in how to get slack, how to get right with Bob, and how to pull the wool over your own eyes.

480
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,940
For they shall see God.

481
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,520
It's still true.

482
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,500
God still speaks in special ways to each of us today.

483
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,820
But my feelings toward him are still so brittle and sour.

484
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,440
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care anymore.

485
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,760
Tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired.

486
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,100
I can't tolerate it.

487
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,160
I can't live with it.

488
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,620
And that's how I became a subgenius.

489
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,880
Children of the great St. Lenny Bruce said, American society cripples you and arrests you for limping.

490
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,620
Here in the Church of the Subgenius we say,

491
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,940
Cast off those crutches and crawl with pride.

492
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,180
You can crawl again.

493
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,600
You can crawl again, children.

494
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:10,060
I may sound like a Bible beater yelling up a revival at a river crossing camp meeting,

495
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,220
but that don't change the truth, no.

496
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:18,540
I want to see if one person, one single person,

497
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:25,080
will have the courage of their convictions and come down here and open up to Bob and give me their wallet.

498
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,360
I don't just want your...

499
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:26,700
money.

500
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,900
Don't just want your credit cards.

501
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,680
We want your library cards, your voter registration.

502
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,380
Give it all up now.

503
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,940
Give it all up now.

504
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,640
Give it all up now.

505
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,400
Give it all up.

506
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,520
Now, now, now.

507
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,460
Well, there once was a man.

508
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,920
The world's greatest salesman.

509
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,360
And he led the way.

510
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,480
Had to find a plan to get the shackles from my feet

511
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,760
Oh yeah, but now he's gone

512
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,680
A martyr for the cause, far to follow

513
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,480
And he's coming again

514
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,480
Who knew that the first shot

515
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,080
Was gonna be the last shot

516
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,000
But he's got a hard driving pipe

517
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,180
The gas won't go through the night

518
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:34,720
And although he may be hurting the universe

519
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,040
He'll keep on squirting all the fun, oh

520
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,220
And he's coming again

521
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,400
guitar solo

522
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,320
He can save us from the men in black

523
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,640
With just a shot from his mighty sack

524
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,040
If only he could make it back

525
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,920
From the land of the dead

526
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:29,040
But until that happy day

527
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,560
We can only drink and say

528
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,160
Far to follow

529
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,140
And he's coming again

530
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,960
I know he can make it

531
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,820
Without him we can't take it

532
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,040
We'll lose the pieces of our minds

533
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,060
To the pink boys and the reds

534
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,120
And the whims

535
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,000
Until the day that he comes back

536
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,600
It'll be a world without sack

537
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,920
Far to follow

538
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,960
And he's coming again

539
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,240
Far to follow

540
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,960
Far to follow

541
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,160
Far to follow

542
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,780
Far to follow

543
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,020
And he's coming again

544
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,240
If we don't want the X's upon us

545
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,020
Then we need far to be honest

546
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,080
Far to follow

547
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,760
Far to follow

548
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,860
Far to follow

549
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,080
And he's coming again

550
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,260
Great gunning going through me right now

551
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,200
Far to follow

552
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,740
Again

553
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:55,420
Far to follow

554
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,280
From our video called Arise

555
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,100
That was Brother Cleve Duncan

556
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,820
Doing his classic hymn

557
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,040
Bob is My Load and I'm Coming Again

558
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,440
Also some Pope David Meyer

559
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,940
From a 1980's DeVival

560
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,820
Recorded by NPR

561
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,380
But now

562
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,940
I'm afraid it's time for the show.

563
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:23,020
This time with Dr. Philo Drummond as their guest.

564
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,300
You know,

565
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:25,900
Fid.

566
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,640
Peas,

567
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,220
I'm trying to interview our guest.

568
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,240
Well,

569
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,200
move it along.

570
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:30,780
Okay.

571
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,920
Five dollars.

572
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,760
It costs five dollars to live in America for one minute.

573
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,920
That's a deal.

574
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,700
It does seem like a good deal if you think about it.

575
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,460
But I mean,

576
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,700
you get any kind of food,

577
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,160
any,

578
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,520
any kind of food that you want,

579
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,280
you can get here.

580
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,840
It's not like in Pakistan,

581
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,280
you're hard pressed to get Mexican food in Pakistan.

582
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,000
I would think,

583
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,280
I think like maybe there's a Taco Bell,

584
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,320
but you know,

585
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,740
there's not a Roberto's for sure.

586
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,660
And so what would you do for Mexican food in Pakistan?

587
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,900
But here in the United States,

588
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,740
we have all,

589
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,240
we have Pakistan food next to a Mexican food place.

590
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,420
So I think it's pretty good.

591
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,320
Paco Bell.

592
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,280
Yeah.

593
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,480
Yeah.

594
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,120
The water in Pakistan isn't nearly as good as it is in Mexico.

595
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,360
There's not nearly enough camel in my taco.

596
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,880
So Philo Drummond,

597
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,580
you know,

598
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,380
since we have a mutual love of crack the sky,

599
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,980
and I always thought you were funnier than staying.

600
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,020
Don't tell him I said that it'll hurt his feelings.

601
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,860
But I wanted to ask you if,

602
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,220
if you'd ever been employed at a Chuckie,

603
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,320
cheese in,

604
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,540
in Maryland or not.

605
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:44,880
No.

606
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,020
Okay.

607
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,460
I haven't employed at churches,

608
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,800
fried chicken in Houston.

609
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,620
Oh,

610
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,180
well,

611
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:50,520
I,

612
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,260
I never,

613
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:51,540
uh,

614
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,680
I've never pooped in the ball crawl at churches,

615
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,040
fried chicken in Houston,

616
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,580
Texas.

617
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,200
I don't even know if they have a ball,

618
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,140
ball crawl,

619
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,700
but if they don't know,

620
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,660
Oh man.

621
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,020
Hey,

622
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,500
you want to go in on a franchise on a church's franchise with me,

623
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:07,960
Philo,

624
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,160
and,

625
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,860
we can put in a ball crawl and I can,

626
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,580
we can crap in it.

627
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:10,860
Um,

628
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,340
I'm really good at it.

629
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,460
Um,

630
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,280
I'd make you,

631
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:14,980
I'd make you proud.

632
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,920
I'll let you break the ground on that.

633
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:27,440
Is it true that churches chicken puts excessive amounts of testosterone in their chicken to facilitate the,

634
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:27,980
uh,

635
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,060
quicker death of African-Americans?

636
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,200
The huge death,

637
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:31,900
the huge,

638
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,640
huge breast.

639
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,600
It makes huge,

640
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,060
huge,

641
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,060
huge chicken breast for some reason.

642
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:36,940
Yeah.

643
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,160
Those chickens were all virgins.

644
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:39,580
Oh,

645
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:39,840
yeah.

646
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,740
Those chickens are only like six months old.

647
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,880
I feel like churches is the worst of the chicken.

648
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,640
Chicken titties.

649
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,360
You know what I used to do?

650
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,860
I was a cook there at churches chicken and I could cook.

651
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,240
Um,

652
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:59,600
it was nine chickens per stove and I'd do three stoves and I'd do that.

653
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,100
Uh,

654
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,980
there was eight parts per chicken.

655
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,500
So that was,

656
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
there was 81 pieces per stove.

657
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,720
Do those three in 11 minutes.

658
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,600
Is it a,

659
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,080
is it a,

660
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,500
now is that like a oil based pressure cooker that you cook?

661
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:14,860
That's no,

662
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,880
it was an open hot grease,

663
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,240
360 degrees.

664
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,420
You just throw the grease,

665
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,360
throw the chicken in there and dip them out.

666
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,680
It's awesome.

667
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,880
I used to go in there and take the breasts,

668
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:31,680
a tear off the big chunk of white meat off of about five or six of them.

669
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,940
And then I double,

670
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,180
double batter them and then make this giant chicken tender.

671
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:37,960
Yes.

672
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,300
Yes.

673
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:38,740
Yes.

674
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,120
Yes.

675
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,700
Yes.

676
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:39,820


677
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


678
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


679
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


680
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


681
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


682
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


683
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


684
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


685
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


686
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


687
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


688
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


689
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


690
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


691
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


692
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


693
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


694
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


695
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:39,840


696
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,360
I invented chicken tenders.

697
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,280
Now was,

698
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,100
was that anybody else had chicken tenders?

699
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,200
Was that authorized?

700
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,580
I invented those.

701
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,740
That was that authorized chicken tender.

702
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,620
That's my boy.

703
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,040
It was aware about that.

704
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,260
Your employer condones that kind of behavior.

705
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,200
Of course.

706
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:55,600
No,

707
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:55,940
no,

708
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,480
they would,

709
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,640
they would have fired me if they knew it would have fired.

710
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,860
So you had to keep that.

711
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:00,880
Yep.

712
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,600
There you go.

713
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,180
Sega does what chicken in 10.

714
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,000
Don't see.

715
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,620
I sacrificed my credit for perpetual,

716
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,340
uh,

717
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,660
fame and fortune just for a few bites of fried chicken tenders.

718
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:16,500
Now,

719
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,440
do you go into a churches now and kind of eyeball the layout and see what

720
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,500
changes they've made and go,

721
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,060
Hey,

722
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:23,380
yeah,

723
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:23,920
that's good.

724
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,800
I see what they did over there with that griller.

725
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,260
That's,

726
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,060
that was a good call.

727
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,340
Or do you not yet?

728
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,360
I'll have an interest in that.

729
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:29,540
Any,

730
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:34,540
I haven't been in one and 40 or 50 years.

731
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,380
Wow.

732
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,320
40 years anyway,

733
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,680
maybe now,

734
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,240
I could,

735
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,820
I was in one in Oakland,

736
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,340
California.

737
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,580
The last 10 chicken attendees is the only truth.

738
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,040
Philo Drummond.

739
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,980
You need to find chicken.

740
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,580
Christ.

741
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,600
Philo Drumstick.

742
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,560
Philo Drummond.

743
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:55,940
Uh,

744
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,440
you should know I named a chicken.

745
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,060
I did actually name a chicken after you.

746
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,660
Uh,

747
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,500
his,

748
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,620
his name was Colonel Philo Drumstick overcock,

749
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,520
but Bach,

750
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,040
but Gawk,

751
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,820
and he was a real,

752
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,280
real live chicken.

753
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,180
That,

754
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:11,480
uh,

755
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,100
seems like,

756
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,400
it seems like a cat's name.

757
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,880
I was in Delaware near very close to the,

758
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:22,800
the Tyson chicken factory and a truck went by and this little chick fell off that was

759
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,160
bound for the factory.

760
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:29,840
And I picked him up and I breastfed him and I raised him as my own.

761
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,280
And what did I name him?

762
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,060
But yes,

763
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,220
Colonel say it again.

764
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,440
That's right.

765
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:35,980
Nice.

766
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,780
What was the rest of his name?

767
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,440
Uh,

768
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,360
Colonel Philo Drumstick,

769
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:40,640
uh,

770
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,460
overcock,

771
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:41,980
but Bach,

772
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,360
but Gawk.

773
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,560
All right.

774
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:43,960
Very well.

775
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,560
Well played.

776
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,100
Julie,

777
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,160
he's dead now.

778
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,220
He's dead now,

779
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:47,780
by the way,

780
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,380
he's dead.

781
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,840
What happened to him?

782
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,340
What happened to him?

783
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:51,740
Oh,

784
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,400
well,

785
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,500
actually the government,

786
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,120
the government killed him.

787
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,620
Damn the government.

788
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:03,520
They said everybody eventually government stepping on my aviary rights.

789
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,580
Obama took away my chicken.

790
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,260
Did our Patreon funds pay for it?

791
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,240
That one can go a lot.

792
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,440
Well,

793
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,620
he was president at the time.

794
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,600
I'm just saying he was president at the time and the government came and took away my chicken.

795
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,520
You,

796
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,700
you guys do the math.

797
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,420
Okay.

798
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,320
That's sad.

799
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,740
That's a real sad story.

800
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,140
This one.

801
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,440
Did you invent anything with your chicken though?

802
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,160
I'm going to follow.

803
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:37,240
It's got this great story about how he invented chicken nuggets and then didn't get the credit

804
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,300
for it because he had to do it on the down low.

805
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,980
So his boss would whatever,

806
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,000
whatever they could do it on.

807
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,300
It just depends on you could have chicken system for chicken tendy redemption.

808
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,180
So

809
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,180
you're about to lose a lot of 10 D's.

810
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,940
You're about to 10 don't purposes.

811
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,100
And yes,

812
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,700
I like 10 didn't.

813
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:01,360
But wouldn't you rather have chicken chunks instead of chicken chunks?

814
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,180
Sounds like a little girl's.

815
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,460
Yeah.

816
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,320
Like,

817
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,820
like a chicken chunks.

818
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,340
Is it kind of a manly sounding?

819
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,060
What about,

820
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:09,300
uh,

821
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,840
what about lady fingers?

822
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:11,700
Please.

823
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,280
Yeah.

824
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,620
That sounds like you're not going to get full at the end.

825
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,080
Yeah.

826
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,420
Could I have a chicken?

827
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,240
Can I have a plate of lady fingers,

828
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:19,980
please?

829
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,120
Yeah.

830
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:21,980
You know,

831
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,720
you might as well just give me some of them chunks.

832
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,420
I need chicken chunks.

833
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,040
You guys don't understand marketing.

834
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:35,300
So a lot of you may have heard Philo Drummond recently on the sheriff's slice book.

835
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:35,300


836
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,260
I'm not sure if you're aware of this podcast because,

837
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,000
uh,

838
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,500
I don't know if you were aware of this.

839
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:42,320
But Sean is always copying us.

840
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,080
That's why the sheriff's slice podcast is,

841
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:45,620
uh,

842
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,600
of a member of the free think radio.com family.

843
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,260
So you did,

844
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,540
uh,

845
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,880
you did the,

846
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,160
the actual good show and now you're doing our show.

847
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,300
Lady tenders.

848
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,180
This is the chicken nuggets show.

849
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,380
I guess,

850
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:04,740
man.

851
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:04,980
I,

852
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,280
I'm pretty sure.

853
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
I'm really confused.

854
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,520
Well,

855
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:09,680
I,

856
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,500
I haven't been here a long time.

857
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,980
Maybe this is all old hat to everybody else who's been here for the last month.

858
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,340
But again,

859
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,260
the guys wouldn't let me be on the black history month shows.

860
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,440
So,

861
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:19,760
uh,

862
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,440
this is called an old hat.

863
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,600
Old hats.

864
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,600
Because,

865
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,800
because it was a familiar piece of equipment for you.

866
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,180
Oh,

867
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:31,800
okay.

868
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,200
That's what I'm thinking.

869
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,900
That's why I'm thinking they did that.

870
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,260
Eric.

871
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,260


872
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,260


873
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,260


874
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,260


875
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,260


876
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,260


877
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,260


878
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,260


879
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,260


880
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,260


881
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,260


882
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:35,520
I'm sorry.

883
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:35,520


884
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:39,540
My left nut is tingling and that means it's time to do the blind eyes.

885
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,840
Oh,

886
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,660
blah,

887
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:41,760
blah,

888
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,320
blah,

889
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,120
blah,

890
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:44,400
blah,

891
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:44,680
blah,

892
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:44,860
blah,

893
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,080
blah,

894
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,300
blah,

895
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:45,420
blah,

896
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:45,880
blah,

897
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,280
blah,

898
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,040


899
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:47,720


900
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:47,780


901
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:47,900
blah,

902
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:47,940
blah,

903
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,160
blah,

904
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:49,220


905
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:49,220


906
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:49,400


907
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,260
blah,

908
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:50,340
blah.

909
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:50,440
Yeah,

910
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:50,440


911
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:50,440


912
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:50,440


913
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:50,620
You know what I mean?

914
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,000
So just let go of it.

915
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,000


916
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,000


917
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,000


918
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,000


919
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:51,760
Well,

920
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,300
phylo.

921
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,340
This is the part of the show where,

922
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:54,760
um,

923
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,280
you know,

924
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:55,520
because,

925
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,080
you know,

926
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:01,300
you can't stop ISIS from killing everybody all of the time.

927
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,680
So we figured you're not,

928
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,700
that's right.

929
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:06,840
So,

930
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:10,800
so we feel like the best way to handle that is,

931
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,100
uh,

932
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,540
to every week on the show,

933
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,000
because we have a very high ice or ISIS,

934
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,420
uh,

935
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,260
listenership.

936
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,260
Very high.

937
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:25,120
that we feel like we'll just tell them who they can kill,

938
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,440
who we don't like, to get it out of their system,

939
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,480
and we'll turn a blind eye to it,

940
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,140
and that's why it's called the Blind Eye Segment.

941
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,580
Hit me with that cowbell, please.

942
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:35,940
Yeah.

943
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,020
Oh, my gosh.

944
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,740
So we'll all take turns.

945
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,300
Cue the Wishbone Ash tune right quick.

946
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,680
Play that Wishbone Ash riff.

947
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,300
Do it, B's.

948
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,820
Blind eye.

949
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:48,900
Blind eye.

950
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,840
Oh, we might have to play that next time we do a Blind Eye Segment.

951
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,820
Open that segment with Blind Eye by Wishbone Ash.

952
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,060
Blind Eye.

953
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,680
Are you writing this down, Dr. Fox?

954
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,520
Okay, I'm going back to work now.

955
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,540
Blind Eye by Wishbone Ash.

956
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,200
Thank God.

957
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,880
Wishbone Ash.

958
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:05,800
Wishbone Ash.

959
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,000
All right.

960
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,580
Philo with the producer credit.

961
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,740
They're an awesome band.

962
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,900
So I'm curious, before we break out on this,

963
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,200
you know, a lot of announcements,

964
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,500
and I know that, um,

965
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,740
what do you mean before?

966
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,700
All right, go ahead, Phil.

967
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,000
Go ahead.

968
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,940
Go ahead, B's.

969
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:25,960
No, no.

970
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,580
You have a lot of announcements

971
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,560
before we break into the bit that we just introduced.

972
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,880
A lot of announcements.

973
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,480
I wanted to ask my friend Phyla Drummond some questions,

974
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,400
but that's fine.

975
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:37,980
Let's go.

976
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,720
Let's move it along.

977
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,540
Well, I'm glad you waited

978
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,860
until after I said we were doing the Blind Eye.

979
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,780
I really held back.

980
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,900
I really held back.

981
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:45,680
Blind Eye.

982
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,280
Blind Eye.

983
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,580
I did all that, man.

984
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,780
I worked really hard on that.

985
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,880
I practiced all day.

986
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,200
And now you're like, you're really like, you know.

987
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,160
Didn't practice all day.

988
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,040
Don't lie to me.

989
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,160
You're really giving me a flat tire over here, P's.

990
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,880
All right.

991
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,700
Who's your Blind Eye?

992
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,680
My Blind Eye?

993
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,040
Yeah.

994
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,560
Well, uh, John, my Blind Eye.

995
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,620
Yes, Mr. Reagan.

996
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,520
It's very, it's a deep Blind Eye.

997
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,880
God damn it.

998
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,620
You don't have one again.

999
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,620
It's a heavy, heavy, heavy.

1000
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,300
All right.

1001
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:18,500
No.

1002
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,500
Dr. Fox, buy him some time.

1003
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:27,020
My Blind Eye this week for any terrorists

1004
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,560
that were to kill these people.

1005
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,240
I'm not saying to, but people who make up new sports.

1006
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:40,600
I think it's, there's only, I'm not a, I'm not a sportsman.

1007
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,800
You know, I'm not good with, with the ground ball.

1008
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:47,500
I'm not, I'm not good with the, with the throwing ball.

1009
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,560
I'm not good with the discs.

1010
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:56,480
I'm not good with, with, with the, the chucking, the lobbing, the lifting, the running.

1011
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:56,840
You're not bad.

1012
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,500
You're not bad with the shafts.

1013
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:05,600
The looking at it, looking at sports isn't really my thing, but when people try to come

1014
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:12,320
up with new ones, the only reason we've got what we've got today are because these are

1015
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,300
somewhat comprehensible.

1016
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,480
But when you go to riding go-karts and sports,

1017
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:26,500
slinging high lie balls or, or, or playing a tag football with a bag of marshmallows

1018
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,860
strapped to your upper shin and you go to, and then you go to kick your friend, you go

1019
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,000
to kick your friend and the marshmallows come out.

1020
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:36,480
Get them.

1021
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,240
You have to, you have to meet at the 50 yard line and mate hot cocoa.

1022
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:43,620
Cause this is, this is the Dutch way of football.

1023
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,120
This is how they do it.

1024
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,400
So you're basically turning a blind eye.

1025
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,320
To Calvin ball.

1026
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,980
Calvin balls, a sport.

1027
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,300
Okay.

1028
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,240
It's a sport.

1029
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,180
It's an ultimate Frisbee.

1030
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:56,260
No, I die.

1031
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,040
Not a sport.

1032
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:57,400
Okay.

1033
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,700
Ultimate Calvin ball.

1034
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:58,960
Yeah.

1035
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,920
And did you say Calvin ball?

1036
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:08,520
Because Dutch people were Calvinists, uh, during the religious reform and that tied into the whole

1037
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,400
Dutch aspect of the football thing that he was talking about.

1038
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,040
Why else would I have brought it up?

1039
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,840
I thought it was pretty, I just wanted to make sure because

1040
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,120
I thought it was brilliant.

1041
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:19,640
Fit.

1042
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,020
But there you go.

1043
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,520
Put bag.

1044
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:23,840
I fucking hate it.

1045
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,580
At the foot bag competitive foot bag.

1046
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,640
Do they hear the effect in the discord room?

1047
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,940
Yes they do.

1048
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:32,940
Terrible.

1049
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:33,840
It's awful.

1050
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:38,620
They just took a round of applause for show robot.

1051
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,140
30.

1052
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,660
Does he have a back story?

1053
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,160
Does he even have a name?

1054
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,720
Does show robot have a name?

1055
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,020
Like he's guy.

1056
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,440
Show robot has a name.

1057
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,120
His name is show.

1058
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,740
His name is Sho Rogan.

1059
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,480
All right.

1060
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:58,320
Well, I'm going to stop recording now, and we can go to bed.

1061
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,720
Got it in the can.

1062
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,740
Thank you very much, everybody.

1063
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,140
We'll see you next time.

1064
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,620
Bye-bye.

1065
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,400
Bye-bye.

1066
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,000
Bye-bye.

1067
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,360
Bye-bye.

1068
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,100
Bye-bye.

1069
00:48:47,120 --> 00:49:17,080
Bye-bye.

1070
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:17,200
Bye-bye.

1071
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:17,540
Bye-bye.

1072
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:17,540


1073
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:17,540


1074
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:17,540


1075
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:17,540


1076
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:17,540


1077
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:17,540


1078
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:17,540


1079
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:17,540


1080
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:17,540


1081
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:17,540


1082
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:17,540


1083
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,920
The swear words, we are trying to be friendly to families, and I don't know which family

1084
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,980
they're talking about, because, like, the Manson family.

1085
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,900
The one big happy family.

1086
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,520
The, I don't know.

1087
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,500
The all in the family.

1088
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,120
You know, that was a kind of messed up family.

1089
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:32,420
They.

1090
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:33,520
Yeah.

1091
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:34,460
That's what I'm saying.

1092
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,540
Social workers might have gotten involved, and it would have been better off.

1093
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,560
Those kids were raising themselves.

1094
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,360
Yeah.

1095
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:40,980
That was dangerous.

1096
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,700
I thought they were all adults.

1097
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,160
That was a lot for two single parents to take up.

1098
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,700
Two single parents.

1099
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,080
Two single parents.

1100
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,320
Have you, yeah, do you not remember this yet?

1101
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,300
It was two single parents.

1102
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,140
Anyway, that's besides the point.

1103
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,840
Their future was already doomed.

1104
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,080
I'm talking about ours.

1105
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,580
If we were to continue to do this, we can no longer say certain words.

1106
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,580
Those words being, uh.

1107
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:03,620
Bleep.

1108
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:05,020
Jeez.

1109
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,040
That, sheesh.

1110
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,620
Okay, yeah, but that's one of them.

1111
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,320
Bleep is on the top of the, you're right.

1112
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:09,880
There you go.

1113
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:10,120
Okay.

1114
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,680
I can't say fornication.

1115
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,060
Excrete.

1116
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:18,860
Then there's also, diddly is one of them.

1117
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,000
Doody.

1118
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,900
Yeah, doody is right out.

1119
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:23,460
Doody.

1120
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,500
That is still funny.

1121
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,360
You said doody.

1122
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,200
Sorry.

1123
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,080
Pencil shavings.

1124
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:31,640
Can't say pencil.

1125
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:34,360
Galdarnit.

1126
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:35,860
Dagnabbit.

1127
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,480
Carbuncle.

1128
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,560
Oh, gosh, no.

1129
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,680
You cannot say carbuncle.

1130
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:42,700


1131
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,420
What about propuscular?

1132
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,180
No.

1133
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:45,940
No.

1134
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,240
And none of the dirty words.

1135
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:47,560
No.

1136
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:47,940
No.

1137
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:48,580
Soil.

1138
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,360
Sand.

1139
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:51,260
Mulch.

1140
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:51,960
Grit.

1141
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:52,960
None of that.

1142
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,600
No granite.

1143
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,020
No grit.

1144
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:55,460
No.

1145
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,040
Mud.

1146
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,000
No.

1147
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:57,720
No mud.

1148
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,420
Goiter.

1149
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,420
You are a pervert.

1150
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,920
You are just so sick.

1151
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,820
I'm going to vomit.

1152
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:06,380
Oh, that is.

1153
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:06,580
Sorry.

1154
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:07,540
How about.

1155
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:09,060
Oh, that is even.

1156
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:09,580
Tarnish.

1157
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,780
No effing and jeffing.

1158
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:13,980
What about shimmin and fimmin?

1159
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,020
None of them either.

1160
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:15,820
They're not invited.

1161
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,180
They're no longer invited to the party.

1162
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:25,720
It's just like apparently it's just too nasty for some people and their dirty, dirty minds.

1163
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,380
They take what we say and turn it into other things.

1164
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,820
Like was we for us as as sailors on shore leave.

1165
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:34,340
Yes.

1166
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,400
We we we just talk like that.

1167
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,140
Yeah.

1168
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,400
It just falls right the F out of our mouth.

1169
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:42,680
How are you going to know where the bleep to put the anchor?

1170
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,260
Right.

1171
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:54,020
And if if if I if something if well, if something hits me in the shin, I'm going to expletive.

1172
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:54,460
Yeah.

1173
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,460
Yeah.

1174
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:55,940
Right.

1175
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,320
The expletive out of there.

1176
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,700
And I'm going to, you know, anyway, but the most important thing.

1177
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,400
Watch out.

1178
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,720
Somebody might hoist the hall here throat.

1179
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:05,500
Whoa.

1180
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,940
You get too dirty on the air.

1181
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:10,380
Right.

1182
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:10,880
Right.

1183
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,000
So.

1184
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,660
So because there's like the censorship board or something like that.

1185
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,740
I don't know how bored you have to be to do that for a hobby.

1186
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,640
But I'm so bored on the censorship.

1187
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:21,500
I'm bored.

1188
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,080
Really?

1189
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,360
So like, yeah.

1190
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:24,860
Yeah.

1191
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:29,040
You know, darn the nation.

1192
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,920
They have very easy buttons to push.

1193
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:32,640
Really?

1194
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:33,380
Like greasy.

1195
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,480
So you just don't have to try and get pressed.

1196
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:36,780
Yeah.

1197
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,000
People come with their own buttons.

1198
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,660
But I have a whole bunch of buttons here to push.

1199
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,700
Like there's a red shiny one that says, please don't.

1200
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,120
I can push that one.

1201
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,460
I just am not supposed to.

1202
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:48,820
Well, you know, I will.

1203
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:49,500
Can I push this one?

1204
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,040
No, no, no.

1205
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:50,480
Wait.

1206
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:50,780
Okay.

1207
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:50,980
Yeah.

1208
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:51,420
Yeah.

1209
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,180
Of course you can.

1210
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,720
You can push all the buttons.

1211
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,400
I don't have any buttons.

1212
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,180
I just have knobs.

1213
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,080
You have knobs?

1214
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:57,640
Yeah.

1215
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:58,140
Just knobs.

1216
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:58,700
No buttons.

1217
00:52:58,980 --> 00:52:59,220
What are you?

1218
00:52:59,540 --> 00:52:59,920
Analog?

1219
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:00,520
Yes.

1220
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,800
Not analog.

1221
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,340
No touch screen.

1222
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,100
No, I'm animal.

1223
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,220
It's nice to meet you.

1224
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:06,440
Analog.

1225
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:06,980
Animal.

1226
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:08,760
So.

1227
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,180
Yeah.

1228
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:09,460
So.

1229
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:10,480
So.

1230
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:10,800
So.

1231
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:10,940
So.

1232
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:10,980
So.

1233
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:10,980


1234
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:10,980


1235
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:10,980


1236
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:11,860
These knobs, I guess.

1237
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,220
Yeah, but no, that's true too, though.

1238
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:18,080
I mean, like I also have, yeah, but our knobs are up to like 11 and they can't handle that

1239
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,360
with their digitized equipment.

1240
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:19,800
See?

1241
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:20,020
Yeah.

1242
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,660
No, their knobs are like below decibel levels.

1243
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:23,500
Right.

1244
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:24,780
Like sub-hearing.

1245
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:25,480
Yeah.

1246
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,120
It's like you don't even have to say things.

1247
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,960
They can hear you think them and then the buttons get pushed and suddenly there's an

1248
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,320
explosion.

1249
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,200
Yeah.

1250
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,000
It's thought crimes, I think, is what those are considered.

1251
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,600
Explosions look like monetary fines.

1252
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:38,480
Yeah.

1253
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:38,820
Yeah.

1254
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,960
And I need to send all my money to the Church of the Subgenius.

1255
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:41,920
Oh, that's it.

1256
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:46,740
So instead of saying beep, they can say send money to the Church of the Subgenius.

1257
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:46,960
Okay.

1258
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,720
So say an expletive.

1259
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,140
So instead of Flemming.

1260
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,480
You can say.

1261
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:52,400
Flemming.

1262
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,060
Send $35 to the Church of the Subgenius.

1263
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:55,600
In.

1264
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,360
Yeah.

1265
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,980
That would be a great soundbite.

1266
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,320
Yeah.

1267
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:00,980
There you go.

1268
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,780
Send $35 to the Church of the Subgenius.

1269
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:08,160
I would definitely rather have that than somebody telling me not to say something.

1270
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,280
Somebody could just put that over.

1271
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,860
All the kneecaps.

1272
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,220
You know, all this stuff that I would rather say.

1273
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:17,780
Bonesburgs.

1274
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:18,120
Oh.

1275
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:18,980
Yeah.

1276
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:19,860
All that.

1277
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:25,220
The thing is, it's like, because we, you know, we're cross-talking all the time and sometimes

1278
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,340
they have to bleep both of us at the same time.

1279
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:27,880
It's true.

1280
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:31,560
Which is understandable because we are foul-mouthed humans.

1281
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:32,180
Yeah.

1282
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,260
But that's.

1283
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,960
Send money to the Church of the Subgenius.

1284
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:36,620
Fine.

1285
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:37,760
And so.

1286
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,780
I was just thinking the other day.

1287
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,160
Maybe we could make up new cuss words.

1288
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:44,180
Okay.

1289
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,760
That are acceptable to families.

1290
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,380
But I need to find.

1291
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:51,660
I think if they just, by definition, you call them cuss words, they'll become unacceptable.

1292
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,060
Or expletives or whatever.

1293
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:58,440
I was like, hey, can I borrow your family so I can try out some new cuss words at them?

1294
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:59,980
You could call it colorful phraseology.

1295
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:01,440
Ooh.

1296
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,540
I like colors.

1297
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:03,220
Yeah.

1298
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,480
People like colors.

1299
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,880
Like if they like art and they're not colorblind.

1300
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,220
I don't like colors, actually.

1301
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,660
I don't want a monochrome world.

1302
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,320
I want everything.

1303
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:11,560
It's painted black.

1304
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,200
But, you know.

1305
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,920
There's already songs about it.

1306
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:16,420
Yeah.

1307
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,860
I'm just saying, if we call it cuss words, they're going to come at it with a closed mind.

1308
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:25,180
But I bet in today's world, there's a few people that would lend us their families to cuss at.

1309
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,820
To see if they are offended or not.

1310
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,920
Like, hey, I just want to see if you get offended at these.

1311
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,640
And if they don't get offended, but I can still say it.

1312
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:32,800
Could we.

1313
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,200
Isn't that like a win-win?

1314
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,080
Yeah.

1315
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:35,980
It's true.

1316
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:40,680
We could even read them Shakespeare for Fonzies.

1317
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:41,760
Oh, that's.

1318
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,240
I don't think we have.

1319
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,320
No, that's just naughty.

1320
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:44,820
That's.

1321
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:45,240
That's.

1322
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:46,000
That is.

1323
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:46,380
Yeah.

1324
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,080
Well, maybe if they offer to pay extra, we'll read them Shakespeare.

1325
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:49,600
Possibly.

1326
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:55,300
But, in the meantime, you know, we're just going to have to send $35 to the church and

1327
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:55,800
say, genius.

1328
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:57,200
Or whatever.

1329
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:57,820
Yeah.

1330
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,440
Yeah.

1331
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,600
I think that's a great idea.

1332
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:00,400
I think so, too.

1333
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,220
Cool.

1334
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:01,920
High five.

1335
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:04,620
Davey.

1336
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,480
Davey Crockett.

1337
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:07,740
The King of Gear.

1338
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:10,960
Born on a hill.

1339
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:11,160
Born on a bar.

1340
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,540
When he was only three.

1341
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:13,780
Davey.

1342
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,540
Davey Crockett.

1343
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:16,780
The King of Gear.

1344
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,460
He went off to Congress and served a spell.

1345
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:22,720
Davey.

1346
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,460
Davey Crockett.

1347
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:25,860
Serving his country.

1348
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:26,540
Gear.

1349
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:29,860
So.

1350
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,400
Don't come up to me saying, oh, Reverend Stang.

1351
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:36,320
I spent my $30.

1352
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,760
I went to the subgenius show.

1353
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,360
I saw all the preachings.

1354
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,160
Heard all the bands.

1355
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:40,760
But.

1356
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:41,840
I didn't get slack.

1357
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,160
Where's my slack?

1358
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:44,140
Give me my slack.

1359
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,020
My friend.

1360
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:48,600
If that's the way you're thinking, then you never heard anything Bob said.

1361
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:51,700
You never understood a word he wrote in the book of the subgenius.

1362
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:56,520
Because the day that we can sell you slack is the day the conspiracy has won.

1363
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,020
You make your own slack.

1364
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,440
Bob is not the answer.

1365
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,520
But neither is anything else.

1366
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:08,280
You must learn to think for yourself.

1367
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,940
But only Bob can show you.

1368
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,380
You have.

1369
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,280
Question authority.

1370
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,840
Or helps.

1371
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:20,220
And fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1372
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,920
Praise Bob.

1373
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,380
Tell me somebody.

1374
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,360
Good night.

1375
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,260
Einstein's secret orchestra.

1376
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,040
Field your own shit.

1377
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,620
Be all the soft.

1378
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,560
I don't need you no more in this world.

1379
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:40,940
I'm going to be a man.

1380
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,440
I'll see you on the next one.

1381
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,580
And don't.

1382
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:44,040
Be.

1383
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,140
Late.

1384
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,000
Praise Bob.

1385
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:58,080
My dad, you never know how to stay in touch with your mom and dad.

1386
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:00,460
Good night.

1387
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:00,580
Good night.

1388
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:00,580


1389
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:00,620
Good night.

1390
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:02,900
Good night.

1391
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:02,920


1392
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:03,480
Good night.

1393
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:03,760
Good night.

1394
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:06,900
Good night.

1395
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,640
Good night.

1396
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:09,940
Good night.

1397
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:19,000
And do heart of the moon crazy!

1398
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,160
Can be fully

1399
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,180
Do as you wish.

1400
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:21,200


1401
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:21,240
Yes.

1402
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,120
You got.

1403
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:24,760
All right?

1404
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:25,320
It is picture어가.

1405
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,780
And you're a woman.

1406
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:35,820
you.

1407
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,240
Break on through to the other side

1408
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:40,360
Break on through to the other side, yeah

1409
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:47,460
We chased our pleasures here

1410
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,200
Dug our treasures there

1411
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:53,680
Can you still recall the time we cried

1412
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,420
Break on through to the other side

1413
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:59,140
Break on through to the other side

1414
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:02,000
Hey!

1415
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:04,440
Come on!

1416
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,100
Hey!

1417
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:12,400
Everybody loves my baby

1418
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:17,580
Everybody loves my baby

1419
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:19,240
She get high

1420
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,240
She get high

1421
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,960
She get high

1422
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,760
She get high, yeah

1423
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,460
On it lights

1424
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:35,480
Hey!

1425
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,720
guitar solo

1426
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,260
I found an island in your heart

1427
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,100
Country in your eyes

1428
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,200
On the train of eyes aligned

1429
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,040
Break on through to the other side

1430
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,700
Break on through to the other side

1431
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,240
Break on through, oh

1432
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,240
Oh yeah

1433
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:26,940
Made to see week to week, day to day

1434
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:31,040
Hour to hour, day to straight, deep and wide

1435
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,240
Break on through to the other side

1436
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:36,280
Break on through to the other side

1437
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:39,240
Break on through, break on through

1438
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,960
Break on through, break on through

1439
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,460
Oh, oh, oh, oh

1440
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,120
Break on through to the paranoid side

1441
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,000
by Bill McClintock

1442
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,780
and this is when we end the show

1443
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,020
by telling you that everything you need to know

1444
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,300
such as all the secret and public

1445
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:01,140
subgenius Facebook pages

1446
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:03,240
and access to our website

1447
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,560
our books and videos

1448
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,660
and events

1449
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:09,960
are all at subgenius.com

1450
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,240
Our two biggest events are coming up

1451
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,180
X-Day from July 1st through 7th

1452
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,660
and Starwood Festival

1453
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:19,760
July 9th through 14th

1454
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,900
Dr. Hal and I and Princess We will be there

1455
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:26,000
and apparently President Vermin Supreme

1456
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,940
and there will be the Bibles and Feasts

1457
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,760
and music and saucers

1458
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,140
and the end of the world

1459
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,480
and slack

1460
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,680
Let there be slack

1461
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,920
From PR News in Washington

1462
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,340
I'm Barefoot in response to a Costa Rican

1463
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:45,860
sex abuse and forced women's rowing and basketball

1464
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:48,860
at the Asian Games in Ireland last weekend

1465
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,320
in Costa Rica

1466
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,540
PR's reports

1467
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,660
don't end on, don't arrest

1468
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:56,360
It's the first ever Gold PR News

1469
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:02,460
Ah, but that's just the end of the broadcast version of the show, friends

1470
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:05,820
Now I'm talking only to internet listeners

1471
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:12,100
for whom it is not illegal for me to hard sell our cool stuff

1472
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:16,400
And this is the time for me to do some hard selling

1473
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,380
because Princess We and I are now officially broke

1474
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:23,220
from having to pay for two houses

1475
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,140
for an entire year

1476
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:30,140
due to unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances

1477
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,440
Actually, two and a half years ago

1478
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:32,440


1479
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,060
we were in the half houses

1480
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:38,920
The Slacker Mansion in Cleveland is nearing readiness to be put on the market

1481
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,380
and then you, you, dear listener, will be able to buy it

1482
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:44,300
Cheap!

1483
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:51,540
But meanwhile, I need to have a word with you freeloaders and rewardians

1484
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:56,000
You've been listening to this show and getting slack from it for years now

1485
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,120
For free!

1486
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:02,420
Don't you think it's time to both put some back in

1487
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:02,420


1488
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:02,420


1489
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:02,420


1490
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:06,040
and purchase yourself the keys to salvation

1491
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,760
plus the most interesting folks on the whole planet

1492
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,660
plus a package with like 25 different cool religious paraphernalia items

1493
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,180
from the Church of the Subgenius

1494
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:18,100
And did you know our books

1495
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:23,080
our books are much, much better than our radio shows?

1496
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,220
Did you know that?

1497
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,800
We wrote and illustrated those before all the brain damage set in

1498
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:32,420
When that subgenius feature documentary got cancelled,

1499
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:32,420


1500
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:32,420


1501
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:37,300
and a while ago wouldn't even have paid to run and up a famous novel

1502
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:38,300
isn't this work of the devil

1503
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:38,300


1504
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:38,300


1505
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:41,060
The type of adventure in which all of us after all

1506
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,500
have come from

1507
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:55,020
Grrrr

1508
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,260
Magma

1509
01:03:57,260 --> 01:04:02,040
Gir disguise

1510
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:02,060
Вам

1511
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:02,400
your

1512
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:06,420
Get in on the top floor of a lucrative old cult now.

1513
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:12,800
Well, it'll be lucrative once you jackanate non-members finally buy something.

1514
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:19,680
Heck, for that matter, friends, you can easily just give us money for nothing.

1515
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,640
Just because you like Bob.

1516
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:28,460
Because there's donation buttons on the homepage of subgenius.com

1517
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:32,500
and on the radio page of that massive archival website.

1518
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,140
So get it or get with it, man.

1519
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,100
In fact, why not both?

1520
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:41,420
It's just like having your cake and eating it,

1521
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,200
but still having it to eat all over again.

1522
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:46,960
Forever, if that's what you want.

1523
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:52,220
And I know what Bob wants.

1524
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:57,660
Bob wants your money being PayPal'd to me.

1525
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:00,260
Subgenius.com.

1526
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,200
And don't miss X Day.

1527
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,660
Any X Day could be the last, by definition.

1528
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:09,560
In fact, each one was supposed to be the last.

1529
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,620
You're just lucky they weren't.

1530
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:16,440
So hop to it, because cadets don't be a gimme Bob.

1531
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:22,520
The kind that posts on the unofficial subgenius pages, Facebook pages,

1532
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,040
without even knowing how to spell Bob right.

1533
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,840
And believe it or not,

1534
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,800
most of y'all don't.

1535
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,320
Get on the stick and praise Bob like you know you want to.

1536
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:37,840
With your wallet.

1537
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,460
And I'll let Jimmy Ryan take us out.

1538
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,840
