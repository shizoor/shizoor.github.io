1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
So, NATO is...

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,560
It's not...

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,000
The subgenius power of...

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,640
What?

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:20,600
Knowing that God has given us charge, and we're going to take charge of that home right now,

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,780
I send right now power, the very glory of God, into that home.

7
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,940
I move back the foul spirits of opposition, the lying spirits, the binding spirits.

8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,480
I speak authority.

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,220
Don't ask any questions. Just do as I say. All right?

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,940
Attention, all humans.

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,940
Attention, all humans.

12
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,460
Stand by for an important...

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,640
Formulation.

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:58,600
We're different.

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,440
We were getting in high-guts.

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,300
We had the number one show.

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,620
Then Bob showed up.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,700
Network pulled the plug on our show.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,620
Yeah!

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,800
They forgot all about us.

21
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,000
Hell, they left us out there to die.

22
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,340
I want you to tell me about the Bob.

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:22,100
The Bob will lead us all through heaven's chimney in a giant cigar-shaped UFO-brand flying saucer.

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,560
Really?

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,020
So Bob is a special person.

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,180
Interesting.

27
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,840
Maybe he's collaborated with God...

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,820
Guys, maybe he is a strangevebijaydempian

29
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:43,900
And I think God will send me a auditable challenge...

30
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,020
To kamc.

31
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,020


32
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,360
Whoo!!

33
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,900
Who is in bravedats.

34
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,820
This крепan over here isentin soup.

35
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,120
ーム

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,380
You're savory, but don't you know...

37
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:56,760
you're somewhat silly,

38
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:56,760


39
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,760
Me neither!

40
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,120
in a giant cigar-shaped UFO brand flying saucer

41
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,000
I repeat, this is not a grill, this is the apocalypse

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,140
in a giant cigar-shaped UFO brand flying saucer

43
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,620
Yo, yeah! Praise Bob!

44
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,800
Praise Bob!

45
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,220
The Bob has no ears, sir

46
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,360
I repeat, this is not a grill

47
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,180
In front of God

48
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,200
Yo, yeah! Praise Bob!

49
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,040
in a giant cigar-shaped UFO

50
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,340
Yo, yeah! Praise Bob!

51
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,620
Praise Bob indeed!

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,040
The Bub of E taxi through a hy Wei

53
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,380
The Re nostrigy Vou

54
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:51,180
But gose

55
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,120
Lead us all through heaven's chimney in a giant cigar shaped UFO brand flying saucer.

56
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,080
Really? So Bob is a special person?

57
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,240
Now open your mind!

58
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:03,600
Bob!

59
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,560
The Bob is not a person, the Bob is pure light and energy.

60
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,700
Do I have to praise Bob?

61
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,040
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

62
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,560
The Bob is not a person, the Bob is pure light and energy.

63
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,580
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

64
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,540
You yo-

65
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,320
The fuck are you?

66
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,140
In a giant cigar shaped UFO brand flying saucer.

67
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,000
I repeat, this is not a grill, this is the apocalypse.

68
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,040
In a giant cigar shaped UFO brand flying saucer.

69
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,960
Do I have to praise Bob?!

70
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,140
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

71
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,520
The Bob has no reason to be here.

72
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,380
I repeat, this is not a grill, this is pure light and energy.

73
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,240
Do I have to praise Bob?!

74
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,000
In a giant cigar shaped UFO-

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,520
Do I have to praise Bob?!

76
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,560
Praise Bob! Praise Bob indeed!

77
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,560
You got megatron!

78
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,500
Perhaps this is as good a time as any to take a few minutes to repeat a message

79
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,020
that seems frequently lost in the hustle and bustle of our daily activity.

80
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,580
Bob will have thousands of followers in a minute, okay?

81
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,120
Because remember where Bob is?

82
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,540
Bob is at PO Box 1403-06.

83
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,500
That's Texas!

84
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,540
7-5-2-1!

85
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,280
Hey, stop it!

86
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,060
7-5-2-1!

87
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,200
He's Bob!

88
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,520
Bob don't ever change.

89
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,520
He's Bob!

90
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,120
Always will be Bob.

91
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,860
Oh, that Bob is the same.

92
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,700
He's Bob!

93
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,240
Working on the sub-T railroad.

94
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,220
Bob!

95
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,220
Bob don't ever change.

96
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,920
I've got a hammer down to silver.

97
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,800
He's Bob!

98
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,460
Oh, it's tough hammering these pipes.

99
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,040
Oh, my God!

100
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,280
Always will be Bob.

101
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:02,560
His pipe is the bowl with the doddle that rains on the roof like fire.

102
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,240
Oh, hammer these pipes in the ground.

103
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,960
His neck is the skin with the waddle in flaming folks' desire.

104
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,260
He's Bob!

105
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,040
How do you learn to sing so good out here?

106
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,520
Just hammer and pipe.

107
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:15,520


108
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,460
Just try to hit the pipes in the ground all day.

109
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,380
Don't make no chance.

110
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,160
Bob don't ever change.

111
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,640
He's Bob!

112
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,480
Bob!

113
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,420
Then he's got luggage with a brain.

114
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,620
Yes, luggage with a brain.

115
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,480
That's what Bob's got.

116
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,520
I first had my experience with Bob at a Bob's Big Boy on the corner of Bellevue Drive in

117
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,480
Los Angeles, California in 1959.

118
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:45,520
It changed my life and I became able to open my third nostril and snort the divine wisdom of God.

119
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,820
I learned the wisdom of the subgenius.

120
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,940
Every morning before breakfast I find it helpful to go into my sternutician room as we call

121
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,500
them and sniff up.

122
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,840
Yes, violent sternutician may be observed.

123
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,160
Named after the famous sternio?

124
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,780
Well, yes, the famous sternio does practice sternutician as does everyone who possesses

125
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,180
the simple accoutrement of a handkerchief and a head full of ideas that need to be relieved.

126
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,740
Blast it out as it might be.

127
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,280
Subdivisive box brain.

128
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,980
Oh, Bob with your square little gray brain.

129
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,300
How do you use that thing?

130
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,240
It's hooked up all wrong.

131
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,300
Oh, Bob, what about this rumor that your pipe is a living organism?

132
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,420
Yes, that has invaded your brain and made everything all wrong.

133
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah, what about that Bob, grinning malarkey turkey flunky prophet of the...

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,460
What about them aliens as you say or us aliens?

135
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,280
We're not aliens.

136
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,080
How about it, Bob?

137
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,440
And who's this anti-Bob?

138
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,380
Some relation of yours?

139
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,680
Some nepotistic cousin on the payroll end?

140
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,920
In a computer field of nerds.

141
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,220
We dare to question our supreme epopt Bob because we have the freedom within the church

142
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,660
of the subgenius to question even the basic verities.

143
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,280
That's right.

144
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,120
Like whether or not there is a Mokele and Bembe.

145
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,960
Whether it's frog like Bellow does echo over the South American or even the African swamps.

146
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,100
Swamp?

147
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,600
Swooms?

148
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,320
Swamps.

149
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,400
Yes, yes, swamps.

150
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:52,780
Right now.

151
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,500
That's where they live.

152
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,720
Glass Madness is in that swamp.

153
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,500
Yes, he's gone down.

154
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,060
There's a green hill.

155
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,880
They say the Mokele and Bembe lives in Lake Ukabalabonga, which is only four feet deep,

156
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,620
but the creature of...

157
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,360
Ukabalaboomba.

158
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,660
No, Ukabalabonga.

159
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,120
All my...

160
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,380
That's rubbish.

161
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,440
These people are making rubbish.

162
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,120
Let's just keep walking.

163
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,680
That's not stop.

164
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,840
Huckabooka huckabooka.

165
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,420
It's time to go.

166
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,940
It looks like it's time to go.

167
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,340
Buy the book of the subgenius.

168
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:22,060
I have suddenly realized within the last few years it's more of a not what you know and

169
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,480
what you do, but who you know game.

170
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:29,500
Because we need more girls in the church and bring your rich fathers and we'll convince

171
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,500
them that we're not really that weird and we can get some money.

172
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,120
The smell of success is never too sweet.

173
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,560
We can help you out.

174
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,680
I think we're being sold a bill.

175
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,220
A big bill.

176
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,440
We're selling good.

177
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:51,560
If this was indeed an extraterrestrial spacecraft with living occupants, it must have been very

178
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,100
disconcerting for them to cross millions of miles of space, only to be hit on the head

179
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,140
with rotten oranges.

180
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:05,220
The dramatic advent of such fascinating objects as those which were first called flying saucers

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,580
attracted the inevitable attention of those individuals who let their imaginations run

182
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,720
away with their veracity.

183
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:18,600
By 1950, some of these characters were beginning to spin their stories of fantastic conversations

184
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,540
with alleged space people.

185
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,700
Some of them expanded the stories to include alleged rides in the UFOs.

186
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,380
Suddenly everything went black and I realized that I'd been cut off and shut off in a little

187
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,280
tiny room where nobody was listening to me.

188
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,960
And I was talking to this hot little plush felt red rubber tip microphone and not hearing

189
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,680
a thing and seeing only little tiny lights.

190
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,700
I'm wondering why I was struggling.

191
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:41,700


192
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:41,700


193
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,220
I was trapped in this chair and put into this studio that seemed to be rotating very

194
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,340
rapidly with lights flashing off rhythmically and there was a small man with a swollen head

195
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,700
and hideously deformed eyes sitting behind the console pushing the buttons while pencils

196
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,060
of light and energy flashed across my body.

197
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,520
And I wondered why I was there and what did they want of me and I couldn't figure out

198
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,700
why I was sitting there.

199
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,080
And they didn't say anything.

200
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,600
They just kept flashing those lights at me and pumping those strange chemicals into me.

201
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,440
And the man with the funny head.

202
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:11,920
The leader.

203
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,640
The man with the strange grin and the pipe.

204
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,120
Well, I just want to know if you want to be in the church or out of the church and where's

205
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,840
your wallet?

206
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,980
The DC9 pushed the button.

207
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,180
Yeah.

208
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,420
I didn't know that I'd been snatched up and it wasn't really a dream until I saw

209
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,740
these sacred nasal positions and suddenly it all came back to me.

210
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,280
And I realized that they'd stolen four and a half hours out of my life when they put

211
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,200
me in that tiny room and plugged all those wires into me and made me talk.

212
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,080
And talk.

213
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:42,700
And talk.

214
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,000
And talk.

215
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,240
And talk.

216
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,240


217
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,540
And talk.

218
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:44,540


219
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:44,540


220
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,460
Because you only paid for an hour and a half.

221
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,540
Sire, the situation is-

222
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,500
We're here at the International Festival for those who have gone too far.

223
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,740
Below us, the band serenades the fools as they dance on the empty glass sea of mischief.

224
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,440
Yes, it's an exciting day here at the Fool's Symposium.

225
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:30,460
And here comes the President's limousine, dumping the dirt on the freeway of success.

226
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,680
And there's his curly-headed wife playing the bass drum.

227
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:45,760
And the small but polite audience of those who don't know any better.

228
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,420
Ah, we are the Fool's Symposium!

229
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,360
We are out of here!

230
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,680
That is my favorite song for sure.

231
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,860
Oh, we're out of that Belfast battle zone!

232
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:13,400
Slave Driver drove his tank into his reserved parking spot and stepped out looking like Margaret Thatcher.

233
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,740
The war was on!

234
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,680
Ah, the keys!

235
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,760
They didn't know where they lost the key, and didn't seldom use it.

236
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,500
But I heard her voice.

237
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,320
I thought they were surely in the rules.

238
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:43,780
Ah, it was Charlotte.

239
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:43,780


240
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,020
Oh, my marry, sort of.

241
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,280
Leave it alone, I'll get you some respect.

242
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,740
and our chairs were chained to the desks.

243
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,620
Our pleas for justice were ignored

244
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,640
and the end seemed near.

245
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,760
But we busted our Margaret Thatcher

246
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,740
slave driver's little bitty balls.

247
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,420
We've charged out of their brick fortress.

248
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,740
The streets are ours

249
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,920
because it's Friday!

250
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:26,800
Friday!

251
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:28,700
Friday!

252
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,980
Children, how does a conspiracy operate on you?

253
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,320
How does a conspiracy get you to do what they want you to do?

254
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,240
How do they get you to buy what they want you to buy

255
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,260
and leave what they want you to leave

256
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,260
and sell it to that lady?

257
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,020
What happened to you when you were young?

258
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,660
When you were four or five years old,

259
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,840
you had a mad rescue personality.

260
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,860
What happened to you?

261
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,860
Well, the first thing that happened was

262
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,280
you wanted to be popular.

263
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,820
That was the great challenge for children in America.

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,220
They want you to be mediocre.

265
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,520
They want you to fit back into that old.

266
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,360
And that's how they make you want to be popular.

267
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,180
You wanted to be as one with your little nose picket peers.

268
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,880
You wanted to do what they do and thought what they thought.

269
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,560
And then, thank you son,

270
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,400
and then a while later,

271
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,920
when you were in high school

272
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,700
and suddenly not doing what your peers did

273
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,280
was an expression of peerdom.

274
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,840
Well, by God, then you went out and contradicted your peers.

275
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,960
Sheep, children, sheep!

276
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,220
That conspiracy wants you to be sheep.

277
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,560
It wants you to turn your back into that wind.

278
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,380
It wants you to watch that television.

279
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,320
It wants you to buy those products.

280
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,280
But children,

281
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,040
who's the most creative goddamn person in your life?

282
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:41,720
It's you.

283
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,980
And it's you.

284
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,080
And it's you.

285
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,960
And if you tie it on the bob,

286
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,220
that which is Bob's,

287
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,860
name of your money,

288
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,920
instead of tying it on a conspiracy,

289
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,280
that which is Bob's,

290
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,300
you let Bob into your heart.

291
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,260
You let Bob into your mind.

292
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,060
You let Bob into your life.

293
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,140
You let Bob into your wallet.

294
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,640
You do the walking.

295
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,160
Let Bob do the talking.

296
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,540
I mean, you let Bob into your heart.

297
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,280
So then suddenly,

298
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,160
the vast armada of conspiracy and paraphernalia

299
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,660
become ridiculous to you.

300
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,660
They're absolutely ridiculous.

301
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,180
And you look around and you see,

302
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,740
it went from stem to stern.

303
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,460
But number thyself among them,

304
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:17,640
no!

305
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:19,940
Mowers.

306
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,960
Children, a lot of popular cults

307
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,660
have a very serious problem.

308
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,840
And that is,

309
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,560
they expand into mediocrity.

310
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,200
They get too many people for their original purpose.

311
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,480
And the people they can attract,

312
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,100
they can attract for the wrong reasons.

313
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,100
You know the story.

314
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:34,780
It's always happened.

315
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,800
But the church and the subgenius

316
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,680
get fancy against expanding into mediocrity.

317
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,840
Bob is the one tamper group individual.

318
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,260
They don't know why he's smiling.

319
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,020
But you do.

320
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,500
The more money you give us, children,

321
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,720
not me,

322
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,120
not the Reverend Aaron Stang,

323
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,000
not St. John the Hierophant,

324
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,860
not Henry the Icon,

325
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,760
I mean us and the truest hands, children,

326
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,120
us,

327
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,820
all of us.

328
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,580
You're on the air?

329
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,860
Um, yeah.

330
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,400
Yeah.

331
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,140
Who's Bob?

332
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,660
Who is Bob?

333
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,640
That is the most profound and believable question

334
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,820
we've had the entire evening.

335
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,340
This man, like the Pope,

336
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,680
is not afraid to be infallible,

337
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,740
to admit he does not know where Bob

338
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,040
and the path of Bob lies.

339
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,600
Young man, Bob is, was, and ever shall be.

340
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,240
Bob is you.

341
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:21,880
Bob is me.

342
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,960
Bob is the Kana Sutra.

343
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,720
Bob is the id.

344
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,120
Bob is the light that glows

345
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,740
and the heart and mind of every free-thinking subgenius.

346
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,440
What?

347
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,900
Why not praise Rob?

348
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,140
Rob?

349
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:31,920
You can praise Rob.

350
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,640
But I'd prefer you praise Bob.

351
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
And send us your money, too.

352
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,560
How much?

353
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,020
Ten dollars.

354
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:37,720
Ten?

355
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,380
Ten.

356
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:38,620
Ten dollars.

357
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,960
Ten dollars will get you so many magazines

358
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,080
and books that you will not learn.

359
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,320
And slack.

360
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,760
And slack.

361
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,380
Before it was a dollar.

362
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,100
A dollar is only for the most minimal of member,

363
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,400
but you are the question of such profound profanity

364
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,080
needs more.

365
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,300
Y'all trying to get over?

366
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,420
Uh, I'm doing my best to get over it.

367
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,100
We're gonna get over this in about five minutes,

368
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,600
but if you want to get over it, young man,

369
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,420
you must end ten dollars, too.

370
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,080
The sacred P.O. box off.

371
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,900
I guess the change back.

372
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,160
Oh, change.

373
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,500
A change will come into your life

374
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,620
when the form is of slack.

375
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,240
You will.

376
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,020
You will change in a way you cannot believe.

377
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,940
Slackness will enter your life.

378
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,620
Slackness will make you see.

379
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,340
Slackness will set you free.

380
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,300
Slackness lives.

381
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,060
Slackness is.

382
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,680
Slackness waits for you and you're ten dollars.

383
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,960
It's time to be manipulated.

384
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,320
Brother, I want to tell you something.

385
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,800
The world is tired of dead preaching preachers,

386
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,020
dead preachers preaching dead sermons

387
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,420
to dead congregations.

388
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,240
They're tired of cold services and cold churches.

389
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,660
This world is hungry for reality.

390
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,420
They've had enough of Hollywood.

391
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,380
They've had enough of Nashville.

392
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,460
They've had enough of show business.

393
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,560
They're hungry for the mighty power of the man

394
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,980
that walked the shores of Galilee 2,000 years ago

395
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,840
and raised the dead and cast out devils

396
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,180
and healed the sick.

397
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,020
And I'm here to tell you tonight that Jesus Christ

398
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,200
is still raising the dead.

399
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,960
That's money!

400
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:06,620
Wow!

401
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,240
That's money!

402
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,620
Wow!

403
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,140
Wow!

404
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,700

405

408

Free pills!

412
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,140
Sex, money, Bob!

413
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,400
Free pills!

414
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:21,400


415
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:21,800
Kill me!

416
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,860
Sex, money, Bob!

417
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,820
Bleeding head of burning copper.

418
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,600
Kill me!

419
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,580
If the world ends tomorrow you may die.

420
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,600
Only a dollar for one of those?

421
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,980
One dollar for damnation.

422
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,800
One dollar for damnation.

423
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,980
One more minute.

424
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,800
He stands forever.

425
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,060
Forever.

426
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,380
Forever.

427
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:39,760
Forever.

428
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,040
Have your brains sucked out your nostrils.

429
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,740
Hear that sound that sounds like a chainsaw?

430
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,480
Free false sex.

431
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,080
It's brain cells.

432
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,960
Church air.

433
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,960
One soul per breath.

434
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,800
Have sex with anything.

435
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,580
Free pills.

436
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,340
Money, Bob, sex.

437
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,960
You can't go to hell without a pamphlet.

438
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,460
Bleeding head good.

439
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,020
Healed head bad.

440
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,660
Bleeding head good.

441
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,080
Healed head bad.

442
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,480
There he is.

443
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,420
I made a bargain with the cult to give me certain data that you had.

444
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,240
In return I promised to prove the essential truth of the creed.

445
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,780
There was no need to prove that.

446
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,360
It stands proven by the book of Revelations.

447
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,720
I offered scientific backing for you believers.

448
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,900
You made of the darkness and the stars a natural phenomenon and removed all its real significance.

449
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,820
That was blasphemy.

450
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,900
The facts exist.

451
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,080
You're a factor of fraud and delusion.

452
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,640
How do you know that?

453
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,300
I know.

454
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,160
I suppose you think in trying to warn the world against the menace of madness we are

455
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,640
placing souls in jeopardy, huh?

456
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,240
Well, we haven't succeeded.

457
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,380
If that makes you feel better.

458
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,420
Your devilish instruments must be destroyed.

459
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,320
Let me handle this.

460
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,460
Let her go, Bob.

461
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,360
I represent a group of scientists who work with but one purpose, to put an end to war.

462
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,040
Naturally, such a goal can't be attained without experts of superior ability.

463
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,440
Men of vision.

464
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,940
Men such as you, Doctor.

465
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,380
Gathered here, exchanging information daily, putting aside all thoughts of personal success.

466
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,280
We hope to achieve exciting new techniques, leap years ahead of the others.

467
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,480
I don't think I need tell you how effective our voices will be when the world learns of our achievements.

468
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,380
Well, there you have it.

469
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,940
Nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is?

470
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,880
However, let me assure you, Doctor, that we are dedicated men and women.

471
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,080
And as such, we can accomplish wonders.

472
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,000
My life has changed in many ways since I first saw this place.

473
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,320
I know that Bob will triumph with our friends from outer space.

474
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,380
And though we suffer needy, I know that it's all right, cause I know Bob and I.

475
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,060
Tell me what to think.

476
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,520
The church of the subgenius will spread across the land.

477
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,660
With pipes in place, we'll both, they march together.

478
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:09,120
Hand in hand, this dark fist of removal will strike a mighty blow.

479
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,460
And we'll be free of the normal and the pig.

480
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,800
So give to Bob, Bob, Bob, and you'll feel a whole lot better.

481
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,040
Sir Bob, Bob, Bob, send a dollar and a letter.

482
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,660
He will change all your behavior.

483
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,380
He's your short-duration savior.

484
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,980
He is Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

485
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,180
Oh!

486
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,620
Woo!

487
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,340
Woo!

488
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:45,700
Hey, it's the 60s again. Wow!

489
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,840
I can't see the face up to the facts.

490
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,380
I'm dumb and stupid.

491
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,640
And I let Smith run my grave.

492
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,000
He ain't here.

493
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,340
I'm a subgenius dummy!

494
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,980
I'm a genius subgenius dummy!

495
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,280
And I go…

496
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,140
…

497
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,360
I…

498
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,900
La la la, la la la la la la la la la la la la la.

499
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:26,740
Wow!

500
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:38,360
I spent all my money on crap and pills, I bought 30 copies of Star Fist, I thought that

501
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,880
I got all the cassette tapes.

502
00:21:49,580 --> 00:22:00,820
And I don't even know where the solo is to my own song.

503
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,700
Oh, now comes the French part.

504
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,260
Up there it went. And here, oh wait a minute, I think it's time for a commercial.

505
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,540
Bob Dobbs, he's no slob.

506
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,800
Bob Dobbs, he's no slob.

507
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,380
Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

508
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,800
He is the head of the subgenius church.

509
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,820
And that's why he's super cool.

510
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,080
Like glassies.

511
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,660
Bob Dobbs, he's no slob.

512
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,340
Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

513
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,680
He is the head of the subgenius church.

514
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,700
And he is super cool.

515
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,920
Bob Dobbs, he is the head of the subgenius church.

516
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:01,920


517
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,060
Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

518
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,620
Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

519
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,720
Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

520
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,840
Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

521
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,700
Bob Dobbs, he's no fool.

522
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:22,400
beer. To make me feel better, he offered a free root beer. I said, no thank you, and

523
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:32,300
cried out, praise God. The devil is on earth and doing his work beautifully.

524
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,460
What you propose is dominance, not salvation. Don't be governed by fear.

525
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,100
Who is J.R. Bob Dobbs anyway?

526
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,360
Who is this man Bob?

527
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:50,620
Who is Bob was and is the world's, the universe's, as we understand it, greatest salesman.

528
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:57,840
Uh-huh, that's what got him into the religion business to begin with. And Bob's role on

529
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:06,500
this planet is to see that the earth is not sold on that glorious or terrible day we call

530
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,860
X-Day in 1998.

531
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,460
When the men from Planet X arrive.

532
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,360
Yeah, now it may sound ludicrous. It may sound ridiculous to many unbelievers out there.

533
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,120
It may sound impossible.

534
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,300
All around the world, a splotch, a blotch, be careful, go, go, go.

535
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,360
Moving on?

536
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:25,920
Trang.

537
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,520
Oh, yeah.

538
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,260
Trang, well, it's tough here. There are too many sound effects and...

539
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,140
Look out, look out!

540
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,600
Paul, extend!

541
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,140
Hold your return.

542
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,640
Shit!

543
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,540
Stop him, stop him!

544
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,840
Keep running, keep running!

545
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,220
Okay.

546
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:42,520
Who are those?

547
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:54,420
Yes, we have a covenant with Wotan and it is the sacred grudge chore of the subgenius

548
00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:03,580
to smite the conspirators and their slavish dupes, the mediocratons, the stupid pink boys,

549
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,520
the hoi polloi, them, the normies.

550
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:07,520


551
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:07,520


552
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,120
The others...

553
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,440
Can I get any of the church, can I get any of the church, to search in the subgenius,

554
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:20,700
the search for the divine, has divine, divine rules, divine rules, orders, divine orders,

555
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,600
first rule of the subgenius church is too much, is always better than not enough, is

556
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,380
always better than not enough, can I get her too much, can I get her too much, is it always

557
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,580
better than, is it always better than?

558
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,540
Praise Bob, praise Bob!

559
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:34,040
give me food give me food give me snack give me food give me food yes it really is a question

560
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:39,320
What flavor Kool-Aid tonight?

561
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,620
Oh, it's the flavor of the inside of Bob's head.

562
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:53,820
It's a timeless flavor, as old as the mountains and as young as the streams.

563
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:00,140
And it is the Kool-Aid which you will see emitting from you.

564
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,640
You are the dispenser of the sacred Kool-Aid.

565
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,680
And it can only be dispensed into those blue boxes outside.

566
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,200
We're kind of stuck on that, I think.

567
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:19,900
Bob Dobbs said, why do you have to go in a little box to shit?

568
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,580
Why don't you be a man, just pull down your pants and shit in the wood?

569
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,780
He'd go through those construction sites, kicking down those chemical toilets,

570
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,320
ripping the doors off them, yanking the men out and saying,

571
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,000
Grow up!

572
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,140
Grow up!

573
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,120
Be a man!

574
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,440
Be a natural man!

575
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,120
But don't shit near my tent!

576
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,820
Now I ask you, I ask you, sir or lady,

577
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:52,560
Thank you.

578
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,000
What brand, what brand did Jesus smoke?

579
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,980
Hey, you didn't know that one either.

580
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,000
Did your preacher know that...

581
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,880
Jesus smoked Chesterfield?

582
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,260
Did you know that smoking was a sin unless it's Chesterfield?

583
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,960
Now Jesus, Jesus, Jesus smoked them.

584
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,640
Yet, they did not exist 2,000 years ago.

585
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,140
We must accept this on faith.

586
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,660
There's no logical explanation for it.

587
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,620
There's no logical explanation for it.

588
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,340
You don't use your mind!

589
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,020
You don't use your mind!

590
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,940
You don't think about your religion.

591
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,340
So you must ask, so you must ask yourself,

592
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,080
Do you have slack?

593
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,880
Do you have slack?

594
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,020
Now Bob teaches the full gospel of slack.

595
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,840
The uncut, X-rated version of slack.

596
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,700
You have your book of the subgenius.

597
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,280
Would you please turn to Prescripture 715.

598
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,560
Prescripture 715.

599
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,000
Prescripture 715.

600
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,000


601
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,200
That's what the question, the question posed is.

602
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,640
How do you know you have slack?

603
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,200
How do you know?

604
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:18,060
How do you know your eternal check balance is ready to meet God?

605
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,960
Two months ago the observatory issued a press statement that the world was coming to an end.

606
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,120
That's the same story the cult of the Book of Revelations had been preaching.

607
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,400
Now when a scientist backs that up, its news.

608
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,300
Our conclusions have nothing to do with the cult.

609
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,980
Well today we did the same.

610
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:33,980


611
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:40,760
with Bible prophecy. But the word of God tells us we can expect nothing but trouble and turmoil

612
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,840
in the Middle East until our Lord returns to be the Prince of Peace.

613
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,000
Bob?

614
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,740
It's been known for some time that the fossil record contains several very pronounced mass

615
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,980
extinctions, when large numbers of quite unrelated species from all kinds of habitats appear

616
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,020
to die out during a relatively short period.

617
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:08,520
You have, say, an asteroid about 10 kilometers across impacting on the Earth at a speed of

618
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,540
about 40 kilometers a second.

619
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:17,160
Did you hear what he was saying? Did you hear what he was saying?

620
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:25,200
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999? Perhaps in the form of

621
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,700
an atomic holocaust? Such a forewarning of ultimate doom could generally be dismissed

622
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,340
out of hand.

623
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,000
The White House will not be able to answer your questions.

624
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,240
We will confirm an order to use the atom bomb. And our first target will be the initial

625
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,880
landing place outside Los Angeles.

626
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,520
Those missiles have all gone off. They pushed all the punches.

627
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,580
You know what that means, don't you? Either we fired first and they're going to try to

628
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,040
hit what's left, or they fired first and we just got our missiles out of the ground in

629
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,120
time. Either way, we're going to get hit. So what are we still standing around here

630
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,340
for?

631
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:58,280
Of course, since all human life has been under the surface of Earth for 16 years, there was

632
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,960
no actual loss of life in the sense we know it.

633
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,640
What you think of what you get? What the hell do you expect?

634
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,400
Pretty red roses. White puppy noses.

635
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,300
Man with proper hoses is more like it.

636
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:22,220
The strange worshippers pull at their faces. Despite himself, a strangled cry escapes Brent

637
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,140
as he sees the ghastly heritage of atomic radiation.

638
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,940
Hey Tony, let's have some.

639
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,940
Get me out of here. Get me out of here.

640
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,120
I mean, hell, this turn the other cheek thing could be carried a bit too far, you know.

641
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:43,960
Hey neighbor, let me give you some advice. The Russians are about to pulverize us if

642
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:49,320
I sleep tonight. That is if the crazy Arabs for the rights don't get us first and the

643
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,820
fire will rain down from the sky. The fire will rain down from the sky.

644
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,340
People die. People die. People die. People die.

645
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,220
Speed.

646
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,860
6A, take one.

647
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,120
Roll camera. Slate it.

648
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:15,420
Bob, sometimes it gets so hard to talk, Bob. It gets so hard.

649
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,640
Scene seven, take one. Camera.

650
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:27,680
Eat joke.

651
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,720
Follow the gold profits of slime.

652
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:36,700
Yep, in his hour of need, we will provide the manna.

653
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:48,580
But, Bob, I still hear these, these, these voices, you know, these voices that bang,

654
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:55,360
bang, bang on the wall and bang on the inside of my head, Bob, you know. They're always

655
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,460
a bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

656
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:16,580
On the inside of my head, Bob. And, and, you know, and they can be real weird, Bob.

657
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:22,460
I am a subgenius and by that virtue I am in touch with forces greater than man. I dare

658
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:27,580
you to kill me. I am not a dupe of the conspiracy. I know more than they do. I am a subgenius.

659
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:33,460
That's all I need to be. Fuck, I'm one of the good guys. I shall prevail. Let out the crazy man inside you.

660
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,980
He knows what's what. Smile when you call me a fanatic. Me, primate. Me, overman.

661
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:43,060
I say to the pigs, give me your money. You won't need it. The future offers you not for destruction.

662
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,520
Heal to Bob.

663
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,160
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

664
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:56,380
Bob is a rock and Bob is a tree. Bob is a bear and Bob is a bee.

665
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:03,060
Bob is truth and Bob is lies. Bob is cakes and fruits and pies.

666
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:09,760
Bob's my hacksaw. Bob's my watch. Bob's my sandwich. Bob's my crotch.

667
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:16,100
Bob's my toothpick. Bob's my brain. Bob's an ugly, yellow stain.

668
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,720
Bob's a cactus. Bob's an itch. Bob is take off every stitch.

669
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,080
Bob's my master. Bob's my slave.

670
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,380
Bob will rob me. Bob will save.

671
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:36,180
Bob's my toaster. Bob's my fridge. Bob's my little sister and midge.

672
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,500
Bob will cost you. Bob is free. Bob's a lock and Bob's a key.

673
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:49,080
In short, Bob Dobbs is the man who used your leg as a frying pan.

674
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,780
If your mind is a jar, you can pour it out of a sink.

675
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,380
And the subgenius church is the missing link.

676
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:56,740
Damn it!

677
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:23,700
In the world of mating habits, I have seen it all and more.

678
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:29,340
I see the 98 year old couple lock their walkers right on this floor.

679
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,980
I've seen communal carnal traditions nearly turn into a mob.

680
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:40,600
But for a truly unique sensation, you get to turn to Connie and Bob.

681
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,460
Oh!

682
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:49,200
It's the miracle of the 90s. It's the talk of all the abyss.

683
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,680
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie in the church of some kind.

684
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,140
It's the love genius.

685
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:10,000
I've seen the mating of the iguana. On the rocks is what they prefer.

686
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,400
While the sloths just like to hang around, hoping something will occur.

687
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,300
And though the rabbit is most unsteady, he is always ready once more.

688
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,560
But when it comes to Bob and Connie, there's no way of keeping score.

689
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,460
Oh!

690
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:35,240
It's the miracle of the 90s. It's the talk of all the abyss.

691
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:40,220
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie in the church of some kind.

692
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:44,120
It's the love genius. La la la la la la.

693
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:44,980
Ay!

694
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:56,320
A dragonfly has balance. A black widow has the nash.

695
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:02,020
But Bob and Connie got their hands on each other's personal stash.

696
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:07,620
And anaconda has got constriction. And a crocodile has her grin.

697
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,560
But Bob and Connie are the one true origin of sin.

698
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,340
Oh!

699
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,220
It's the miracle of the 90s. It's the talk of all the abyss.

700
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,280
It's the one. It's the talk of all the abyss.

701
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,760
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie in the church of some kind.

702
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,360
It's the hell out of it.

703
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,880
La la la la la la.

704
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,840
Ay!

705
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,680
And Connie.

706
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,800
La la la la la la.

707
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,260
La la la la la la la.

708
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,480
La la la la la la.

709
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:41,940
T-Bob.

710
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,740
La la la la la la la.

711
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,880
La la la la la la la.

712
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,500
T-Bob.

713
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,020
Brown-eyed Bob.

714
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,400
Brown-eyed Bob.

715
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,040
The ostrich do it in circles with her head stuck in the ground.

716
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:04,380
Why the lemmings like to get it done with lots of folk around.

717
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,400
So many combinations. The results are always the same.

718
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,700
So prepare to get it done in Bob and Connie's name.

719
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,380
Oh!

720
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,540
It's the miracle of the 90s.

721
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,000
It's the talk of all the abyss.

722
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:28,980
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie in the church of some kind.

723
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:29,680
But, Cookie Monster, yes.

724
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,780
It's the miracle of the nine-ties.

725
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,240
But,ρο pergi .

726
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,280
This is good while it's too late.

727
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,360
It's the talk of all the abyss.

728
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:40,260
It's the marriage of Bob and Connie in the church of some kind.

729
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,500
But, fellow pigdo, why is the world so sad?

730
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,080
Power and power Basketball Club.

731
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,360
We get all those stupid Nike معる 그만이나ертons are threads.

732
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:46,360


733
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:51,340
It's the marriage of Bob and Mary in the church of St. John.

734
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,560
It's the miracle of the night.

735
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,620
It's the dark of night.

736
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,560
It's the marriage of Bob and Mary in the church of St. John.

737
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,940
Love and Connie Love.

738
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,260
I know the man by Mr. Fletcher in Dallas, Texas.

739
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:39,180
And he's a good man, except that he don't buy me two glasses of beer.

740
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,900
And I said, I love you, boy.

741
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,500
And I'm going to tell you, if I can't whoop it,

742
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,360
I'm going to kill you.

743
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:46,360


744
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,440
Go down.

745
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,000
All right, man.

746
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,320
I love it.

747
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,360
He's going down.

748
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,000
Miracle wisdom coming through from all the levels.

749
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:05,800
We want people to know that the Patriotic Subgenius Church has no age barriers and no limits.

750
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:14,740
And we've saved many friends that were in the bondage of alcoholism and drug abuse and homosexuality and lesbianism.

751
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,200
Yes, we've taken them in.

752
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,280
And now they're making more money than ever.

753
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,860
Hello, younger bear.

754
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:20,620
Goodbye.

755
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,320
There was a boy whose life I'd saved.

756
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,840
It was mortal embarrassment.

757
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,220
Did you catch a rabbit on your hunting trip?

758
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,140
No.

759
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,080
Then don't give the rabbits you didn't catch to Buffalo Wallow Woman.

760
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,700
You see, younger bear had become a contrary.

761
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,360
The most dangerous of all Cheyenne warriors because the way they live drives them.

762
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,100
Half crazy.

763
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,220
Except for battle, a contrary does everything backwards.

764
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,860
He says goodbye when he means hello.

765
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,780
Yes, when he means no.

766
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:03,740
Walks through bushes instead of on trails and washes with dirt and drives with water and so forth.

767
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,080
I thought you were dead.

768
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:14,740
That $30 to Bob proves that you consider your life to be worth $30.

769
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,440
$30.

770
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,920
You'll spend that much on prancing rock stars anyway.

771
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,240
Oh, but some people think, well, Bob might be lying again.

772
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,240
Oh, no.

773
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,640
Friends, Bob makes a million dollars every time he screws up.

774
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,700
By screwing up last time, he made $10 billion.

775
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:43,780
This next day, when the saucers do arrive, he won't lose that $10 billion because we already did.

776
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,860
We're out our $30.

777
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,040
His fuck-up already happened.

778
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:50,420
He has nothing to gain by us losing.

779
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,300
So this time, we will win.

780
00:41:54,840 --> 00:42:00,820
And, you know, even if next day doesn't work out, we'll go for sex day.

781
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,780
We want you people to dance into the new century.

782
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,280
Screw into the new century.

783
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:12,320
Sleep and eat your way into the new century.

784
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,460
Whatever you're doing in the moment of turnover.

785
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:15,840
We're out.

786
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:15,840


787
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,600
This is what you'll be doing forever.

788
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,840
So make sure you're not asleep.

789
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,020
Make sure you're not watching TV.

790
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,840
Make sure you're not listening to Pat Boone.

791
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,020
Make sure you're not reaching for an itch you'll never be able to scratch.

792
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,620
Friends, you're floating in a sea of pills.

793
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,980
A sea of Bob's pills.

794
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,620
But you're just too blind, deaf, and dumb to see them.

795
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,380
Oh, friends.

796
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,480
I know you're not here.

797
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,280
You're the dumb-asticated type.

798
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,740
I know you're the smart-asticated type.

799
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,440
Oh, but people say,

800
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,020
Reverend Stank, what is slack?

801
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,560
I want you to tell me what slack is.

802
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,640
You know, friends,

803
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,980
the television doesn't have to watch you

804
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,180
as long as you are watching the television.

805
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,700
And a lot of people,

806
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,140
a lot of people think that slack is that Miller beer commercial

807
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,120
where everybody's good looking

808
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,660
and you're rich and your team just won the game

809
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,200
and you're drinking Miller beer

810
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,020
and your favorite show is on.

811
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,620
And you know that's bullshit

812
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,120
because slack is not laziness, friends.

813
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,860
Slack is getting into the zone.

814
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,000
It's being awake and alert

815
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,080
and doing what you wanted to do

816
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,520
until your eyes snap open

817
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,000
and you're smart enough to realize

818
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,860
that you are God.

819
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,800
Life is worth living.

820
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,000
And everything is just as psychedelic

821
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,960
as an old T-shirt

822
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,020
that you can't fit into anymore.

823
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,460
Now, hold that thought.

824
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,040
Hold it in your head

825
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,600
because that is what slack is all about, friends.

826
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,880
Slack is something for nothing.

827
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,540
What is the law?

828
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,660
Not to endlessly intern the law.

829
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,540
That is the law.

830
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,280
Are we not men?

831
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,280
What is the law?

832
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,680
Not to endlessly intern the law.

833
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,540
That is the law.

834
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,140
Are we not men?

835
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,260
What is the law?

836
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,520
Not to endlessly intern the law.

837
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:30,240
That is the law.

838
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,960
Are we not men?

839
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,740
And me personally,

840
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,780
if I were to die all of a sudden

841
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,640
and find myself going through this tunnel of life,

842
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,560
towards this great openness of all understanding

843
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,100
that was too good to be true,

844
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,020
great!

845
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,480
I'll be very pleasantly surprised.

846
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,120
But if I die and I'm just dead

847
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,240
and nothing ever happens,

848
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,540
well, you likewise won't hear me complaining then either.

849
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:02,000
So, personally, I'm like everybody else,

850
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,300
I'm sure there's a side two to this tape.

851
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,660
If Bob remembers to flip the tape,

852
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,620
or if we make the tape into a movie,

853
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,520
it's interesting enough for him to want to flip.

854
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,900
What if Bob or God or Connie or whoever goes,

855
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,320
well, that wasn't a very good tape,

856
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,940
I'm just going to re-record over it with a new one.

857
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,980
That would certainly explain a lot, wouldn't it?

858
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,720
Now, if I died and went to hell,

859
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,540
then I'd certainly believe in Satan,

860
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:32,540
but I sure wouldn't believe it wouldn't prove God's existence to me.

861
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,320
Besides, I've always figured

862
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:39,740
that God character can probably do just fine without my help.

863
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:43,540
Many don't think so highly of their God or their Goddess.

864
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,920
For one thing, they have to give them sexes.

865
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,240
To some people, God or Goddess is like this little kid

866
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,740
who needs the help of those illiterate human believers,

867
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,920
or else it'll dry up and blow away like Tinker Bell

868
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,360
if the kids don't applaud loud enough.

869
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:03,800
Oh, you better believe enough or God's going to die.

870
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,100
Oh, if you don't believe,

871
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,480
friends, I think it's the other way around, isn't it?

872
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:14,520
I mean, vengeance is mine, saith the Lord.

873
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,960
I just don't understand these people

874
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,060
that seem to want to do all God's dirty work for Him.

875
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,780
If I was God, I'd be a hell of a lot more impressed

876
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,120
with the ones who take responsibility

877
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,500
for their own screw-ups and build their own ship.

878
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,160
And by that, we don't...

879
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:37,780
I know it's...

880
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,720
Some people are not real men.

881
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:39,720


882
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,620
They're real mechanically inclined.

883
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:44,080
And by build your own ship,

884
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,440
we don't necessarily mean that you have to achieve orbit velocity.

885
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,180
That's like 6,000 miles a second.

886
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:51,720
That's...

887
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,800
But some people think of it as build your own mental ship.

888
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,660
I'm sure Dr. Leary would agree with that.

889
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,560
And there's a lot to be...

890
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,580
You do have to do that.

891
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:04,940
You have to build your own spaceship in your head

892
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,260
to fly above this.

893
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,780
You have to inflate, rise above it.

894
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,560
You have to...

895
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,060
But as soon as you stub your toe,

896
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,020
you know, it kind of pops the balloon.

897
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:21,080
So, but friends, whatever it takes to get you through the day,

898
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,280
the Church of the Subgenius says,

899
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,180
believe in everything.

900
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,340
Believe in that Spider-Man comic book while you're reading.

901
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,660
Just don't shove it in our faces.

902
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:31,680
You know?

903
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,180
And so...

904
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,100
Don't get me wrong.

905
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:39,100
I'm not...

906
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,080
I often end up sounding...

907
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:41,620
I've been...

908
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,080
I told people a lot...

909
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,000
Two years ago,

910
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,180
look, if the aliens from Planet X,

911
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,100
they were going,

912
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,380
Stan, what are you...

913
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,520
What are you going to do if them aliens don't show up

914
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,740
for your Bob Church religion, huh?

915
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,980
And I said, well, if they do show up,

916
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:03,340
then you'll see me on the deck of my escape vessel planet

917
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:06,160
preaching the wonders of magic and religion.

918
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,080
And if I...

919
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:13,520
If I find myself still preaching from bars and pulpits at Starwood,

920
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:17,860
then I might be preaching the wonders of logic and rationality.

921
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,520
So, you know, to each his own.

922
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,820
I've heard the voice of the sand.

923
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,380
I've seen the white light.

924
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,660
And I've ridden the snake.

925
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,380
And that was all before I even took any LSD.

926
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,220
And...

927
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,920
But really, I kind of...

928
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,780
It's the old idea of keeping your head in the clouds,

929
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,320
and your feet on the pavement.

930
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,920
It's not too bad of an idea,

931
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,840
especially if you can, like,

932
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,860
while you got your feet on the pavement,

933
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,140
build a spaceship.

934
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,700
Help us boldly go where no human has gone before

935
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:54,280
and fill space only with subgeniuses.

936
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,080
Yeah, hell yeah.

937
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,800
Let's declare war on God and all the other planets.

938
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,340
We will take the great weapons we once turned against each other

939
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,980
and turn them against Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Earth first.

940
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,800
Earth first, my friends!

941
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,120
If Bob cannot have it all,

942
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,320
then we will destroy it all!

943
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,980
Ah, yes.

944
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,700
Is Bob saying like Heisenberg did 40 odd years ago

945
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,900
that we can never know what the hell is really going on?

946
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,520
I think not.

947
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,400
Bob, however, is cognizant of the fact

948
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,480
that besides the shabby little lies we feed ourselves from day to day

949
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,220
as we struggle to cope with technoborgon,

950
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,960
we're all being forced to do the same.

951
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,360
We must spread a gross problem of our truce,

952
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,680
sensationalize statistics and downright propaganda

953
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,240
by a vast monolithic network

954
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,460
operated by and for the conspiracy.

955
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,300
They are pulling the wool over our eyes.

956
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,500
Constantly.

957
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,940
Bob is saying if we must be lied to and cheated for reasons,

958
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,560
let us do it to ourselves for our own reasons.

959
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,140
Let us realize where the real deceit lies.

960
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:07,460
Let us have a choice in how we're being screwed.

961
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,240
Some ways are fun.

962
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,460
For many of us there is no physical escape from their clutches

963
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,720
or any hope of it until the exes come

964
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,060
and the followers of Yahweh One prevail.

965
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,200
But until that day,

966
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:24,180
the power and wisdom of Bob can help us break their mind control

967
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:28,080
by activating that mutant gland that we all have within us.

968
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,960
This allows us to control our own reality,

969
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,440
gives us the clarity of perspective

970
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,580
to be able to sit back and look at it all,

971
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,760
and I mean all,

972
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,120
and simply say fuck them if they can't take a joke.

973
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:44,060
Then and only then will slack begin to drop gently

974
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:46,440
like a soothing dew into our tortured lives.

975
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,600
After all, it should be every person's choice

976
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,180
to curse God and die if that was what they wish.

977
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,220
We all have the right to spit in the eye of the collective gods,

978
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,400
did we not create them?

979
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,500
Where indeed would Yahweh One be

980
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,800
without the human race to torment and pest them?

981
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,380
I'll put it to you,

982
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:05,240
the old chiseler would be pretty damn bored with it all

983
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,400
if there was nothing more entertaining than

984
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,780
cherubins and seraphims and numby-pumby flaming angels

985
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:14,000
sitting around up there on damp clouds and arping and trumpeting

986
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,700
all 24 hours a bloody day,

987
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:16,820
and you can bank on that.

988
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,260
Why should we be any different to that?

989
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,740
Why shouldn't our lives be more entertaining and more real

990
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:26,960
than any glowing three-color phosphor image on the television screen?

991
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,360
Why shouldn't we grab reality by the throat

992
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,700
and shake it until it does what we want it to,

993
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,360
until once again we find slack?

994
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,740
Oh yeah, I was here on the last tape.

995
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:47,160
This is where the little people come out and take your wallet.

996
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:51,360
Oh well, I didn't have much in my wallet that year anyway,

997
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,000
but I tried.

998
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,080
My family knows I tried.

999
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:59,800
They imported all of their insides to this side of the nation.

1000
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,660
And you know what happened?

1001
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,160
The bottoms fell out on them. Yep.

1002
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,860
They was coming across the great divide,

1003
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,900
and the bottom fell right out on them.

1004
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,140
It was like Death Valley in 81.

1005
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,040
Clogged up and choked up.

1006
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,560
They elected to stay in a burned out, burned out motel

1007
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,140
south of Icewater.

1008
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:24,500
Well, they was flying over, uh,

1009
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,080
Armpit, yeah, that was that place,

1010
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:27,860
and

1011
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,200
the bottom fell out again.

1012
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,300
But this time, because they had that previous experience,

1013
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,060
they were able to use their survival guide

1014
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,320
in such a way to as not to, uh,

1015
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,320
to as not to as hurt anybody.

1016
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,500
As you can see here on this slide,

1017
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,840
as they arrived at the Kewater International Airport,

1018
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,940
with the entire party attacked,

1019
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:52,400
except for the dog who was eaten three days out.

1020
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:54,720
Whoa!

1021
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,460
And do you know what happened?

1022
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,900
And do you know what happened?

1023
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,620
Uh, yes, dear friends.

1024
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,580
Can you believe that I made it through Hour of Slack number 1107

1025
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,680
without saying anything or giving credits?

1026
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,620
But that's just what I've done, because,

1027
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,360
baby, we're at X-Day now.

1028
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,780
By the time you hear this, we'll be off planet,

1029
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,040
or possibly, I suppose, just recuperating

1030
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,540
from a good party, one or the other.

1031
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:29,580
Uh, so, I'm, this has been a best of the old subgenius,

1032
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,220
uh, tapes show.

1033
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:36,420
Yes, we cranked out ten tapes called Media Barrages

1034
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,920
and a number of Bob's Song cassettes,

1035
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,240
which we sold all through the 80s.

1036
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,900
And, uh, what you've been hearing is a,

1037
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,520
to tell the truth, it's a completely random selection

1038
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,720
of, uh, some old favorite cuts that I just pulled

1039
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,820
from all of those in a big hurry.

1040
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:59,080
And, uh, I, I, it was impossible to go through and give credits.

1041
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,700
So I'm going to do a little bit of a quick recap

1042
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:00,700


1043
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,080
So, uh, I'm going to read you the names of the people

1044
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,920
you heard here on the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1045
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,180
Uh, from the first song by James Watson,

1046
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:15,520
uh, to, uh, uh, Dr. Howell, Puzzling Evidence,

1047
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,720
Philo Drummond, uh, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon,

1048
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,680
uh, it'd be the Pope David N. Meyer,

1049
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,840
the great Jimmy Swaggart.

1050
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,800
And, um, some chanting from the Austin Clinch

1051
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,440
in the early 80s, including Poon Flang Dammerung.

1052
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:40,760
Uh, the band that dare not speak its name

1053
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,600
did the Subgenius Dummy song.

1054
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,100
Uh, Glass Madness sang the Sweet Songs.

1055
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,900
We heard a tiny bit of John Cage in there.

1056
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:52,300
There was a lot of editing by St. Byron Werner

1057
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,400
and Puzzling Evidence, and yours truly,

1058
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:58,620
Reverend Ivan Stang, who you also heard yelling and screaming, uh,

1059
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:00,900
in various, uh, segments there.

1060
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,680
Uh, Roberto de la Rosa talking about the pills.

1061
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,080
That's, uh, the late Reverend David Boone.

1062
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,640
That was, uh, Lonesome Cowboy Dave in the background.

1063
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,800
We also heard Dave on the guitar in different places there.

1064
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,180
Brother Cleve, Brother Bleepo Abernathy,

1065
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:21,740
uh, Sister Melodious Chops, and Princess Wee and M.A.

1066
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,580
did the Marriage of Bob and Connie.

1067
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,340
Um, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1068
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,900
That just about covers it, I think.

1069
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,780
I think that about, that, I've probably left somebody out

1070
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:38,420
in a, an act of, uh, evil.

1071
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,480
Pope Sternodocs must have been in there, I'm sure, somewhere.

1072
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,680
Anyway, friends, uh, thank you for listening.

1073
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:49,080
Yes, that's, uh, that old, uh, material is, uh,

1074
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:51,100
like, there's just tons of it.

1075
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,420
There is tons of it.

1076
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:57,180
And if you want to know more, you can look at subgenius.com.

1077
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:02,820
Have a happy post-X day wherever you are,

1078
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,540
and praise Bob.

1079
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,180
I'll get us a contract we'll never forget.

1080
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,920
Wild thing, man.

1081
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:14,880
Single guy.

1082
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:20,820
I know that Bob, I know that Bob is a good cause.

1083
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,520
Bob took me inside his heart.

1084
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,420
And I accepted him into my life.

1085
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,020
And I'm here to testify, friends,

1086
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,520
what that man has done for me.

1087
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,640
If you can really call him a man.

1088
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,520
Many people say he's almost like a god.

1089
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,600
I don't think so.

1090
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:51,240
Of course, I don't know Bob, but I do know Bob in certain ways.

1091
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,840
And I think you understand what I'm talking about.

1092
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:01,360
Yes, Bob, he filled me with the sort of the spirit I never knew I had.

1093
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,920
I knew it wasn't coming from him.

1094
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,980
It was coming from inside me.

1095
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,760
Bob was giving it to me.

1096
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,320
He was laying hands on me from afar.

1097
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:16,380
He might have been up in that great big jet plane,

1098
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,660
or he might have been down on Skid Row giving some bum a haircut.

1099
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,820
But all I know is,

1100
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:25,580
it was Bob.

1101
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:28,080
It was Bob.

1102
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,420
Bob.

1103
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,380
Yeah, he's smiling.

1104
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,620
You never see Bob frown.

1105
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:41,360
You know that behind that amazing smile,

1106
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:44,340
there lies a mind like a steel trap.

1107
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,780
I'm sure he makes mistakes like

1108
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:51,500
what he did with those young women that time.

1109
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,560
But I think the newspapers exaggerated that.

1110
00:57:55,340 --> 00:58:00,440
I know that Bob will do all of us fine in the long run.

1111
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:06,320
In fact, I think I know that we really need Bob in our lives.

1112
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,240
In our lives.

1113
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,700
In 1981.

1114
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,840
And in 1984.

1115
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,780
Hi, little brother.

1116
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,220
And in 1991.

1117
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,220
And in 1995.

1118
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:27,660
When they bring the conspiracy to its heels.

1119
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:35,480
And in that wondrous year that we know is going to come all too soon upon us.

1120
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,580
And we'll leave our earthly things behind.

1121
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:45,960
And we'll go and join the exits from God only knows what strange planet they come from.

1122
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,200
If they really even come from a planet at all.

1123
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:48,200


1124
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:52,860
And not some energy star beaming away in the darkness.

1125
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:56,920
Lighting our lives with the technology.

1126
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,480
And the spirituality.

1127
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,720
And the mentality of Planet X.

1128
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:07,120
Planet X coming down to take care of us subgeniuses.

1129
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,820
And see that there's a place for us in the world.

1130
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:15,320
And give us our rightful seat at the right hand of Bob or the left hand of Bob.

1131
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,180
Depending on whether we're rewardians or mediocrities.

1132
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,260
But I don't want to get lost in the dogma.

1133
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,340
I want to tell you something that blesses my heart.

1134
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,220
And it's Bob.

1135
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:26,440
Bob.

1136
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:28,820
Bob.

1137
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,560
Yeah, I can hear him.

1138
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,800
I can hear him talking off there in the distance.

1139
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:33,260
Saying.
