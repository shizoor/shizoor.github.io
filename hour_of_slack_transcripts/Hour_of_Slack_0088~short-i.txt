I'm from under the walls. This is the suburb where the walls crack.
My voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice, my voice.
Am I really coming in?
Crank my voice.
Yes, there we go.
Oh, praise Elvis, dear friends.
And praise George.
More sugar, dear friends.
We're really going to miss George and those mellow oldies.
You know, after a couple of weeks when he goes on to New York City.
Because we needed that softer sort of carpet underfoot.
It's a slackless environment.
Before we, you know, we needed that before it got trod upon by the sheer ugliness.
The ugliness, dear friends, of the arrr slack.
Slack.
The horror of Bob.
Pity.
Oh, pity the subgeniuses.
They deserve to be treated with respect.
Right.

You know it's looking

We don't want to hurt you
We just want to

Oh no!

Oh, hey!
Oh, praise!
Oh, yes dear friends, this is Reverend Gordon Truby.
The end times are near, but there's nothing to fear.
If you just send us a dog.
If you just send us a dog.


And we get set.
Prepare for the launch of the bleeding head of a pulver.
Remember the motto, perform the salute.
Smack off and study the pamphlets.
And if you should falter, then look to the right.



To the sky.
Cuz Bob's always somewhere nearby.
There's a pipe in the sky.
And the father won't move anywhere.
Through the suffolk, the global, eh.
Through a hurricane tide.
That's a Mount Yankee.



Through a hurricane tide.
That's a Mount Yankee.

So, genius people, why, there's a salt of the earth.
If you'd like to rub elbows with it,

Yes, you rub it between the forefinger and the thumb.
You take the pinch of salt,
you rub it between the forefinger and the thumb,
walk with your shoes around
a burning, decapitated child's head,
and then jump into the grave and say,
hop on my thumb, hop on my thumb,
this is a problem I must overcome.
Play in a dead cat,
or a live cat that's not feeling well.
Then cover with the sod,
and when the birds chirp on the third Saturday after Micklemas,

That's jumping up to your...
And so, Bob Dobbs founded his church
upon a sandy beach of common sense,
sense of humor, and...
dollars and cents.
A likely story, you say.
But it's simple, really.
Bob is lucky, not smart.
In fact, by the perverted conspiracy standards of intelligence,
he's gifted with incredible,
incredible stupidity.
He lives in a perpetual state of contracted consciousness.
This enables him to act without thinking,
to effortlessly surf the luck plane,
to float down the fabled path of least resistance,
to, in fact, make a million dollars each time he screws up.
Thus, it is not his wisdom, but his divine follies,
his holy blunders which we emulate.
The miracle is not in what Bob does to you,
but in what he allows you to do to yourself.
He brings the student to the realization that
everything you know is true.
Pull the wool over your own eyes, he admonishes,
and you may finally relax in the safety of your own delusions.
Under the conspiracy, you're being ripped off every day,
but you can learn to enjoy it.
You can choose the way you're gonna get screwed.
Some ways are fun.
Dobbs journeyed to Tibet, and under ancient holy men,
he perfected the arts of glandscaping and acubating.
He also began modeling for hundreds of magazine ads,
leaving early clues of his presence.
These old ads are the only known photos of Dobbs,
for he otherwise remains elusive.
Shunning both the spotlight and the authorities.
In 1979, he recruited two randomly selected nobodies,
Dr. Philo Drummond and Ivan Stang,
to begin a public outreach arm and spread his seed word of slack.
The church is now subjected to constant harassment
and attacks from every corner,
which only serves to illustrate how much they fear his message.
Some call us Satanists, or the Mockers,
as prophesied in the Bible as harbingers of the end times.
Still others dare to deny that Bob exists at all.
But if that were so,
who posed for all those magazine ads in the 50s?
The feminist dupes of the conspiracy charge
that not enough members are women.
Bob would agree to that.
Indeed, he would say,
there will never be enough women,
but at least the ones we have are all women.
And Bob?
Bob is all man.
The James Bond of sin masters,
the most dashing religious leader of his time.
Yes, Bob Dobbs is a sex god.
He has come and keeps coming,
again and again,
not to forgive your sins,
but to rationalize them,
to justify your sins.
Let me tell you the story of J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Bread of man and yet he,
he walked with the gods.
He wore a silly grin,
and he smoked a stupid pipe.
He fought the conspiracy every day of his life.
He lived the stench of many a man.
Fathered many children with his mighty glance.
He founded the religion in which we all believe.
Brought us all the slack that everybody needs.
Bob was the greatest sailor,
the world's man the world had ever seen.
He could sell the farms after he ate all the beans.
He could sell a pile of sh-
Bad stuff.
To a lonely fly.
All of us who knew him figured he would never die.
Bob Dobbs.
Bob Dobbs.
Bob Dobbs.
Bob Dobbs.
Bob Dobbs.
He was a real man and brave.
Bob Dobbs.
Bob Dobbs.
Is lying dead in his grave.
Without Bob what are we gonna do?
With the men from Planet X go marching through.
The armed world racist stuck in jail.
But only Bob who has not failed.
But now he's dead.
So we're doomed.
What to do?
What to do?
He founded the city known as Dobbs town.
Deep within Malaysia it was rarely found.
There he studied forbidden science.
Until that fateful day.
When he came unto his flock in the city by the bay.
Few had ever seen him.
Few had ever dared.
And most had no occasion.
Others just plain scared.
Hundreds came to Frisco for the event of the age.
When the only smiling one would step out on the stage.
It's a hit.
It's a hurt.
A hurt.
A hurt.
Hopped to the left and he looked to the right.
They stepped out with confidence in two eyes.
But he was a hero.
The cheering fans as he strode up to the light.
It's a hit.
He would have hurt an assassin's bullets.
It's a hit.
He was bold enough to shoot the last one.
The battle was unfair and plain.
The entire race was a spectacle.
The combat went itsmade eerie.
He went through a

We have put in a fear
As we swiftly approach that final year
For in 1998 he would have set the record straight
But now he's dead, so we're due to a deer
Well, this has been the story of J.R. Bob Dobs
Some call him Messiah, others call him fraud
I hope that before 98, that the word gets out
That Bob Dobs was the only guy we couldn't do without
The end times are upon us, and things don't look so good
Bob Dobs had the answer, but was seldom
But now he's dead, so we're due to a deer
We're in a heap of trouble, our books are in the red
There is no joy in Mudville, now that Bob is dead
So we pray to Bible Jesus to do battle for Bob's soul
To put dog in a peanut, for strengthening our rule
We pray to he who needs the name of Jesus
That we may need no slack
And we pray to God and we send our money back
Bob Dobs, Bob Dobs
Our lives are worth shit without you
Bob Dobs, Bob Dobs
Oh dear, what we've done to you
What will we do?
Without Bob, we are in a time fix
When the exes come to kill us, just for kicks
If they were not in his grave, all these sub-geni would be saved

And that's what the Hour of Slack sounded like 10 years ago.
Here in 1998 on show Hour of Slack number 656.
We're playing a rerun of Hour of Slack number 88.
From, oh, I reckon it to be about 1987.
Sorry I had to do a rerun, friends.
But first off, I've had.
Two.
Or I'd get in even worse trouble with the other realms of church outreach.
And secondly, you know, there's some aspects of these ancient shows that might be better
than some aspects of modern day subgenius a-go-go shows.
I don't care.
Because this is the way Dobbs has willed it to be.
And everything is okay.
The new Stark Fist magazine is out.
Both of the X-Day video productions are looking.
Looking great.
We have a devival.
Oh, yeah.
We've got a devival coming up December 4th and 5th in Austin, Texas.
Where this show is never heard.
With Robert Anton Wilson, Negative Land.
And yours truly.
And Jesus Christ Church and Subgenius crew here.
Reverend Nikki, Deaf Chick, so forth.
Sponsored by Fringeware.
That's December 4th and 5th.
Robert Anton Wilson, Negative Land.
Church and Subgenius.
At Fringeware.
I don't know where, actually.
I don't know where.
See www.subgenius.com for details.
That may be my doctor.

You can say what you want to.
Yeah, you can put her down.
But one thing you better remember...
They were soft and creamy,
and I really couldn't have done better myself.
Oh, me neither, friends.
What you're listening to, by the way, is Mashed Potatoes.
This is a compilation, like a compressed version,
of the entire Potatoes folk music album
from Ralph Records, edited by Negative Land.
Once again, Mark Hosler. Thank y'all.
I can see that he has a strong hold on this family.
Who do your wife and children turn to?
Bob.
With their problems?
Always Bob.
They turn to him.
They always turn to Bob.
Don't they?
Of course they do.
They don't trust you.
They don't trust you or Norm anymore.
But they trust Bobby.
You fear...
is that you're not man enough.
You're not man enough, are you?
Are you this family?
Get out.
Oh, Bobby.
Bobby.
Bobby.
Of course.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Uh-huh.
And I'm your friend.
But Bob's my friend too, and he passed her.
Don't make me drive across that creek now.
Not with all that heavy rain.
No.
Well, all right.
Let me in.
All right.
If Jesus said so, I'll...
Let's talk.
I'll do it, Mark!
I'll do it, Mark!

But, you know, one thing, friends, is be sweet to your old hometown.
Yeah.
But, you know, there's no excuse when they tell you not to go across there.
It doesn't matter if Jesus says to or not.
I don't care.
I don't care.
As we end another broadcast, let me say that you ain't got nothing and he's got it all.
And your miserable self is against the wall.
The only thing you have not tried is the sport of chumps.
That's suicide.
That's suicide.


You say there ain't no use in living.
It's all a waste of time.
And you want to throw your life away.
Well, people, that's just fine.
Go on and get it over with then.
Find you a bridge and take a jump.
Make sure you do it right the first time.
Because nothing's worse than a suicide chump.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.






Oh, yeah.
You say there ain't no light to shine in through the bushes up ahead.
And we're all going to be so sorry when we find out who was it.
So we get rid of now.
Go on and get it over with then.
Find you a bridge and take a jump.
Just make sure you do it right the first time.
Because nothing's worse than a suicide chump.
Oh, yeah.
Now, maybe you're scared of jumping.
And poison makes you sick.
Oh, yeah.















And you want a little attention.
And you need it pretty quick.
Don't want to mess your face up.
You won't know if it's you.
Oh, there's just so much to worry about.
Now, what you going to do?
Go on and get it over with then.
Find you a bridge and take a jump.
Just make sure you do it right the first time.
Because nothing's worse than a suicide chump.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.















Now, maybe you're scared of jumping.
And poison makes you sick.
And you want a little attention.
And you need it pretty quick.

Hey, tonight's hour of slack is underwritten by the Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company.
The Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company features Dobbs-approved church wear, including T-shirts and buttons and junk.
And that's the Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company, serving the public since God knows when.
The post office box is five...
Not there anymore, unfortunately.

Thanks, Weeping Cyclops Insignia Company, for supporting K&ON.
Bye-bye.
Oh, and, uh...
We do have a little bit of news to cover here, my children.
Just a few places we'd like to invite you to.
A few little webs, I mean, parties that we'd just love to have your presence at.
And number one up on the agenda here is Robert and...
Well, actually...
Bucknackin' and Robert Anton Wilson at the same time, you might say, but not in the same place.
And actually, not entirely at the same time.
On August 7th, 1987, this Friday coming up...
You know, it's funny, folks, because even though that was 1987, here in 1998,
there is a subgenius Robert Anton Wilson show coming up in Austin, Texas, on December...
4th and or 5th.
Check with www.fringeware.com.
Mr. Robert Anton Wilson, he's a subgenius, it's okay.
And as a matter of fact, he's a subgenius without whom there would probably be no defined subgeniuses.
And that's the truth.
I mean, had it not been for the amazing books of Robert Anton Wilson,
you know, I don't know if Bob would have gone ahead and decided to release his...
his word to the public.
But when he saw that the Illuminatis trilogy and some of those other things sold,
why, he thought, well, I guess it's about time.
We will let at least a few of these people into it, if they can take it.
Eight-track stereo, color TV in every room.
The blues are the truth.
But friends, I keep having to cut in here in 1998,
over this 1987 subgenius show.
If I'd known how much old, specific-to-Dallas crap there was on here,
I'd have just done an original show.
It's taken me so long just to cover up the old useless...
Well, anyway, so it looks like we're going to have some new stuff anyway here,
for at least until we get to 47 on the counter.
Here is Bill T. Miller's beautiful piece,
a TV addict from his new CD.
Color TV in every room.
Rules.
The blues are the truth.
Let's watch something entertaining.
The blues are the truth.
You're not anybody in America unless you're on TV.
So, tell me what you think.
Oh heavens!
It's a beautiful little TV, isn't it?
That open, beautiful TV.
It's such a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful room.
It's a lightspeed torture room.
I want to get to have one such thing in my 2000s.
This side, and also pull out a little bit.
People pull out all these gears.
Get some out and ustedes,
this is basically a puddle rack.
All about isolationism.
Nosfer 레 .
All right.

Oh yeah.
You have been watching way too much TV.
You know I must confess,
I'm a television addict.
I just need constant stimulation.
Too much is never enough.
You know I'm dreaming in color,
but I'm living in black and white.
And I believe everything I see.
It's gotta be a conspiracy.
Oh, nonsense.
Anyone who looks at a screen
will instantly become a best-buy zombie.
Try to keep a low profile.
Avoid human contact.
Watching my TV.
And playing my guitar.
Oh yeah.
I'll be wearing socks.
And thuicいる.

I'm not mad.

Oh, yes, dear friends, that's the Debo's.
Yes, those rogue subgeniuses, the Debo's.
Oh, what do they call it? Debo, I guess. I don't know.
Why don't you own a copy of that one?
Well, because you're not a subgenius yet.
Because you haven't paid your dues.
I could play this song for you.
But I won't.
Good and bad told me I had to go.
Me and my help.
Me got to go pull the pillow down the bottom.
My Yvonne, sweet as one.
Me and my help.

I just don't know about, you know,
dozens of cheap sound effects
are not going to keep these people away.
They're going to go right down into your back pocket,
and they're going to go right into that wallet,
and they're going to pull out that card,
and I'm afraid that's it.
Look, look, okay, okay.
I've been in the...
Now, Doug?
Just keep my daughter out of it if you possibly can.
I can't help it. I can't help it.
They followed you to the boat.
They got photos.
Very consensual.
They know that person never came back with you on the boat,
even though they were seen leaving.
Well, what are we supposed to do?
Just let the older dog...
This is important.
You're going to have to come up with a better story than that
when we go before those cameras tomorrow.
Don't you think there's a way to convince them
that these sacrifices really are necessary?
Well, I can't do it without your cooperation.
What do you think you're paying me all this money for?
Well, I'm trying to cooperate.
No one believes us.
You won't even cooperate with me.
I'm your own doctor-lawyer.
Now, what's going to happen when you're up before Senator Hal?
Hello, you're on the air.
I stayed to watch those broken instruments,
and I saw a thing so strange,
I should not dare to mention it without more evidence.
But that my own clear conscience strengthens me,
and that good companion that a hold of a man
was in the armor of impurity.
I saw it there.
Is this some sort of a threat?
A body without a head,
that moved along like all the others,
that it spew and spill.
I held that severed head by its own hair,
swinging like a lantern in its hand.
And the head looked at us and wept in despair
and made itself a lamp of its own.
And they were two in one and one in two.
Yes, one of today's troubled Malaga going with it, Tony.
It's a good thing we sealed him up here in this spaceship
and shot him into a permanent orbit,
high above our lost, dark planet.
