1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All right, let's do it!

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,460
Activate interlock!

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,180
Dynatherms connected!

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,020
Infracells up!

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,200
Megaprestors are go!

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,840
If anyone dies, move the body to another room in the house.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,400
Label the body with name and address.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,780
And cover it as tightly as possible in polythene, paper, sheets or blankets.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,080
What a horrible death.

10
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,980
It won't kill him.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,120
It couldn't.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,620
When mankind falls into conflict with nature, monsters are born.

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,560
I'm just trying to...

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,640
send him home.

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,280
Uh, scientists have now identified several genes.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,640
Designer genes that contribute to this crucial sensory system in insects.

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,660
Yeah, we're in here, we're doing the show.

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,040
Designer genes.

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,400
Yes, they're very tiny, but the insects can wear them.

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:00:59,940
This is a yes.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,640
How do they make them that small?

22
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,260
They have assembly lines in sweatshops.

23
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,320
In foreign countries.

24
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:16,460
Tiny children with extremely good eyesight manufacture the Jordache genes for the Orthoptera, Choloptera and Edentia.

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,120
Everybody's welcome in here, all persuasions and ethnic origins.

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,420
Making a customized pair of designer genes for the centipede, which has so many pant legs it causes an entire...

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,980
It takes a while to get one of those pair of pants back.

28
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,680
...made, I believe.

29
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,880
You know, something you have to concentrate on.

30
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,180
Spend a lot of time, sometimes it takes several generations to generate.

31
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:37,540
...the virus.

32
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,560
...seems to hang on...

33
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,480
At any rate, you see the salt.

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,320
No problem.

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,400
...bombing.

36
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:43,980
All right.

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,620
Here we go.

38
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:46,960
...we...

39
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,540
...Ion Channel.

40
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,100
...we...

41
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,100


42
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,620
...we...

43
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:52,620


44
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:52,620


45
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:52,620


46
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:52,620


47
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:52,620


48
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,000
...we...

49
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,320
...we...

50
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,880
...we...

51
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,300
...we...

52
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,160
...we...

53
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,600
...we...

54
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,600


55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,600


56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,600


57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,600


58
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,600


59
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,600


60
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,600


61
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,600


62
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,600


63
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,600


64
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,600


65
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,600


66
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,600


67
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,600


68
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,600

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:05,860

WE D esteem it U Zim decision per m Makev VZGoed to be undestanda자 wodja.

73
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,620
You think you're pretty bad with your pretty trophy wife

74
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,880
You drive a pretty car through your polo trophy life

75
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,400
I got a robe and a pretty nice ring

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,420
You bet that brotherhood's a wonderful thing

77
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,040
Guess what, I'm amazing now

78
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,320
And you better take care if you wanna stay on the good side

79
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,040
Of the guy who's got the secret handshake

80
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:07,260
Should we talk about the governments that I control?

81
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:13,180
Should we talk about the ants who fade the dice they roll?

82
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,840
The secret things you'll never see

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,040
The secret man you'll never be

84
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,500
The secret room that has no windows

85
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,000
Too late to make amends cause the wheel's in motion now

86
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,020
So get up off your knees, try to carry on somehow

87
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,720
You can't escape it so you better not try

88
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Now there's some friends of mine who'd like to say hi

89
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,420
Guess what, I'm amazing now

90
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,300
And you better take care if you wanna stay on the good side

91
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,920
Of the guy who's got the secret handshake now

92
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:56,300
Guess what, I'm amazing now

93
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:25,820
And you better take care if you wanna stay on the good side

94
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:54,340
Guess what, I'm amazing now

95
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:26,120
And you better take care if you wanna stay on the good side

96
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:55,920
Guess what, I'm amazing now

97
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:23,880
And you better take care if you wanna stay on the good side

98
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:55,340
Guess what, I'm amazing now

99
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,140
Thank you, Dr. Howell.

100
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,300
And now, the show begins its descent

101
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,780
toward the lunar surface.

102
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,400
Tracking.

103
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,840
Everything's going fine.

104
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,620
As we land on the moon.

105
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,840
The source of the soul.

106
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,180
Psyche.

107
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,920
The realm of night.

108
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,560
The queen of dreams and darkness.

109
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,360
This is our goal.

110
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,460
Now the retro rockets are turned fully up

111
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,480
and everyone seems to be doing fine.

112
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,760
I think perhaps we'll pull this mission off after all.

113
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,700
After all the uncertainty.

114
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,260
Equipment issues.

115
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,160
There are always equipment issues.

116
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,080
Not being able to find things at the right time.

117
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,320
I'm well.

118
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,780
The laws of physics are brutal.

119
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,080
You have to pay attention.

120
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,500
And now, the lunar surface swings up.

121
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,620
The dust of the lunar regolith blows away

122
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,960
under the jets of the rockets

123
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,120
and the limbs are pressing

124
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,020
into the strangely clay-like soil

125
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,380
of Earth's curious satellite, the moon.

126
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,220
The moon.

127
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,440
Yes, it is remarkable, is it not?

128
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,440
What humans can do

129
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,860
when they put their occupants together.

130
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,240
When their craniums sweat and perspire.

131
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,440
And above the dairy lane.

132
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,660
And those nine generations of the feds long.

133
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,640
Fish, flesh, or fowl.

134
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,700
Every inch of it.

135
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,460
And now the news.

136
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,900
The Center for the Study of Existential Risk warned,

137
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,860
lest humanity become,

138
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,920
become complacent about a robot uprising.

139
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,280
Physicists designed a computer simulation

140
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,420
whereby it may be possible to determine

141
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,480
whether we are living in a computer simulation

142
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,760
designed by our post-human descendants.

143
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,440
And scientists established that humans with circadian rhythm,

144
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,380
genotype AA or AG, tend to die just before 11 o'clock AM.

145
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,140
The robot council has been a little crazy for the Andersons.

146
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,060
You may recall we had some trouble last year.

147
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,640
The robot council had us banish to an asteroid

148
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,820
that hasn't undermined our holiday cheer.

149
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,580
And we know it's almost Christmas

150
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,820
by the marks we make on the walls of the building.

151
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:55,820


152
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:55,820


153
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:55,820


154
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:55,840
by the marks we make on the walls of the building.

155
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,160
That's our favorite time of year.

156
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,000
Merry Christmas from Chiron Beta Prime.

157
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:10,260
Where we're working in a mine for our robot overlords.

158
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,000
Did I say overlords?

159
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,500
I meant protectors.

160
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,700
Merry Christmas from Chiron Beta Prime.

161
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,060
On every corner there's a giant metal Santa Claus

162
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,100
Who watches over us with glowing red eyes.

163
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,880
They carry weapons and they know if you've been bad or good

164
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,860
Not everybody's good but everyone tries

165
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,760
And the rocks outside the airlock

166
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,580
Exude ammonia-scented snow

167
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,320
It's like a winter wonderland

168
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,680
And the rocks outside the airlock

169
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,600
Are the best in the world.

170
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,000
Merry Christmas from Chiron Beta Prime.

171
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:58,280
Where we're working in a mine for our robot overlords.

172
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,000
Did I say overlords?

173
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,480
I meant protectors.

174
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,740
Merry Christmas from Chiron Beta Prime.

175
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:27,600
Where we're working in a mine for our robot overlords.

176
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:27,600


177
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,960
Not everybody's good, not everybody's good.

178
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,580
I meant protectors.

179
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:29,580


180
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:29,580


181
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,100
That's all the family news that we're allowed to talk about.

182
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,260
We really hope you'll come and visit us soon.

183
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,120
I mean we're literally begging you to visit us

184
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,120
And make it quick before they get a message redacted.

185
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,480
Now it's time for Christmas dinner.

186
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,660
I think the robot can't wait.

187
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,900
sent us a pie.

188
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,600
You know I love my soil

189
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,260
and green.

190
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,420
Merry Christmas

191
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,080
from Chiron Beta Prime

192
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,600
where we're working

193
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,620
in a mine for our

194
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,380
robot overlords.

195
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,140
Did I say overlords?

196
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,600
I meant protectors.

197
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,160
Merry Christmas

198
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,880
from Chiron Beta Prime.

199
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,480
In Glastonbury,

200
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,000
England, a strange

201
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,620
archaeological discovery

202
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,700
seems to hint

203
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,080
at the possibility of the

204
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,800
discovery of the burial place

205
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,820
of the near legendary wizard

206
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,940
Merlin the Magician.

207
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,180
The subterranean cell

208
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,900
was found to contain

209
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,440
what investigators call

210
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,220
telling signals

211
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,080
that the holy man of

212
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,880
Arthurian times had

213
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,100
been there even recently

214
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,180
but was not now

215
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,840
on the premises.

216
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,180
Further investigation?

217
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,880
Is continuing under

218
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,220
international auspices.

219
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,180
A peanut-shaped

220
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,860
asteroid was headed toward

221
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,780
Earth. The Cretaceous-Paleogene

222
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,980
extinction event was found

223
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,140
to have killed the Obamadon.

224
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,820
No new poisons

225
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,900
were found in Tycho Brahe's beard.

226
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,840
German scientists used

227
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,200
satellites to track 1,500

228
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,800
crab days of activity

229
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,080
among giant roaming robber

230
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,220
crabs. Australian scientists

231
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,460
observed that innocent,

232
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,240
fish wander out of their

233
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,680
reserves into a 150-meter

234
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,320
naivete radius.

235
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,000
And fluid dynamics

236
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,280
researchers concluded

237
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,200
that huddling penguins,

238
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,880
though self-interested,

239
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,340
share heat equitably.

240
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,320
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

241
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,080
it's a new night and a new show.

242
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,220
A special show.

243
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,600
And here in the studio,

244
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,480
I have an embarrassment

245
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,100
of riches. I have Ivan Stang

246
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,840
right here, the head of my order,

247
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,840
the church of the subgenius.

248
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,740
Is that not so?

249
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,380
What's that smell? I smell moon

250
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,480
cheese. You smell moon

251
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,080
cheese?

252
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,840
Well, I...

253
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,120
Somebody said he was going to bring back some of that

254
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,120
green cheese for you. I guess it

255
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,400
finally happened. I don't know how to explain it

256
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,160
except that.

257
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,880
You know, we've been listening to that same signal all these years.

258
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,120
He said he would bring you back some of this

259
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,580
lunar cheese. But, doggone it,

260
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,640
how do they make cheese on the moon

261
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,940
without rennet?

262
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,920
Sounds like he's finally done it.

263
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,880
And milk.

264
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,380
They must use milk for moon calves,

265
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,900
but where do they get the rennet?

266
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,700
Are there lunar sheep?

267
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,180
Or...

268
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,460
Well, it's just one of the mysteries.

269
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,000
Sure, lunar sheep.

270
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,860
You know, they count sheep at night.

271
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,880
Jumping over the moon, the whole thing.

272
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,320
That was a cow.

273
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,080
Try it again.

274
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,500
Jumping cows, mean moon

275
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,480
feet, stinking feet.

276
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,000
Stinking sheep feet.

277
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,340
I just don't understand how it is, Philo, but you've got

278
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,340
the best broadcast voice among us tonight.

279
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,140
Give us more of your wisdom.

280
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,620
But I tell you,

281
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,920
I just don't know about that.

282
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,920
Well, sir,

283
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,160
that's just lying with us.

284
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,140
I think...

285
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,080
And then I stop.

286
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,780
Well, that's the way we all are,

287
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,540
sort of stop-and-go mechanisms.

288
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,640
Yeah, that was a stop-and-go point there.

289
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,940
Did anything stop, or did anything go?

290
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,820
Everything stopped.

291
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,300
Everything stopped.

292
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:27,960
Yes.

293
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,880
So I won't go there.

294
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,000
Don't push that button.

295
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,120
That's the stop button.

296
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,240
Actually, you see, it's the cue button

297
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,380
for when we're playing billiards in here.

298
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,720
It doesn't really have much to do

299
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,060
with the flow of radio.

300
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,920
Uh, it's ceaseless ebb and flow

301
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,300
up the high strand,

302
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,440
begins and ceases,

303
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,240
and then again begins

304
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,420
with tremulous cadence slow.

305
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,420
And we just stand around here.

306
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,740
What are you looking for?

307
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,300
What are you looking for in a radio program?

308
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,480
What happened to Reverend Stans?

309
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,060
Reverend Stang was here,

310
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,660
but overcome with bashfulness.

311
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,860
His microphone doesn't seem to be working now.

312
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,760
There's only two mics working now.

313
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,520
That's the best.

314
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,120
There's only two mics working now.

315
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,120


316
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,120


317
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,120


318
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:13,960
There's only two mics working,

319
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,680
and yet there's about 17 mics here.

320
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,480
How about now?

321
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,240
Those are decoy mics.

322
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,340
I'm quite confused,

323
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,760
and it also creates a tsunami of reverberation,

324
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,340
which is...

325
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,640
I think that's a decoy.

326
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,400
It's not healthy for children

327
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,480
and other living things.

328
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,720
That's not a mic.

329
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,820
Well, I beg to differ.

330
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,460
Why don't we give Reverend Stang another mic, then,

331
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,080
since his doesn't seem to be connected

332
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,200
to any level of reality?

333
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,160
None of them, except this one.

334
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,040
Philo, yours is booming and bellowing

335
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,760
in loud and clear.

336
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,960
That's mic number two.

337
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,560
Mine is the only mic that seems to be working.

338
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,260
And it's booming and bellowing,

339
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,640
even though I'm trying to speak

340
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,680
in my best little girl voice.

341
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,380
Why don't you cede your spot momentarily

342
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,800
to Ivan Stang and Philo?

343
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,440
Perhaps even in the fullness of time,

344
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,740
we'll be able to figure out this complex problem.

345
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,520
I think we can share.

346
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,020
I think we can all share.

347
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,540
Don't you think we can share, Dr. Drummond?

348
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,380
Sharing is what it's all about.

349
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,560
It's fine with me.

350
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,300
The church's subgenius is really all about sharing.

351
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,100
However you boys...

352
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,300
We always share mics.

353
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,200
It's not a commercial thing.

354
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,600
You can fight it out over there.

355
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,260
We use a mic condom

356
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,360
so we can share without fear

357
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,540
of getting some kind of communicable disease.

358
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,120
Mic condom.

359
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,900
Subgenius secret agent.

360
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,680
Watch.

361
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,800
Watch where you're putting it.

362
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,440
I'm putting it in my knee.

363
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,560
Hey, I have money problems too.

364
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,660
Just look at that.

365
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,880
We're talking about your money.

366
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,120
Stang and Philo are tight like that.

367
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,280
You're putting my knee too close to your package.

368
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,680
Tight like that, ladies and gentlemen.

369
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,960
Now look, here's what we can do.

370
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,820
I'd rather have my knee in your package.

371
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,560
Oh, this horrible microphone moving noise

372
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,340
that you hear at home

373
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,800
is one of the many special effects

374
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,540
put in for your entertainment.

375
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,400
Reverend Stang is going to try to hog the mic now.

376
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,460
I'll have to use the power of my voice.

377
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,720
You have to lean in.

378
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,440
I have to use my effort.

379
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,700
If she cannot use the power of persuasion,

380
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,740
he will use the persuasion of power.

381
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,140
I'm going to use my bellowing bellicosity.

382
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,420
I, on the other hand,

383
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,920
will lean in close and

384
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,060
download my baby.

385
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,300
Hey, I hear you or me back there already

386
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,200
in the background

387
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,400
blabber-jibbering about something.

388
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,840
We're the only ones on time.

389
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,780
Now there's no point in speaking in such a fashion.

390
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,220
You know, I had a crisis of time control today.

391
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,460
A serious, serious...

392
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,340
How did that occur?

393
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,380
Well, I didn't know it,

394
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,140
but I guess my watch battery was running down.

395
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,420
My watch was running at one-third speed

396
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,200
and it caused disastrous misjudgments

397
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,060
in time control, dosage, times.

398
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,400
This is a crazy station with only two microphones.

399
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,700
I woke up thinking it was nine o'clock in the morning

400
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,120
and I hadn't had enough sleep.

401
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,040
And it turned out it was really two

402
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,400
and I'd slept too long.

403
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,480
But I didn't find that out

404
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,120
until I took all of the pills

405
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,520
that you're not supposed to take.

406
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,580
I woke up in the morning

407
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,000
and it just...

408
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,080
Everything snowballed.

409
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,180
Time control slipped away

410
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,320
all because of my watch.

411
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,660
My damn watch ceased to work.

412
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,020
It threw everything off.

413
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,560
You're hurting my ears.

414
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,300
It's going to take...

415
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,480
You need to attenuate your vocal genuineness.

416
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,460
My sense of time control

417
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,780
was thrown off by five hours.

418
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,700
Five hours were taken from me

419
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,940
by a watch battery running down.

420
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,100
Because you slept too long.

421
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,320
They were taken from you

422
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:40,800
by the light.

423
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,200
By Morpheus.

424
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,200
No, because I looked at my watch

425
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,260
and thought I've only been asleep

426
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,160
for three hours.

427
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,140
I need to sleep more.

428
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,500
I'll be messed up for Dr. Hal's show.

429
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,140
I couldn't believe you were sleeping.

430
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,440
That's it.

431
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,900
I'll sue the watchmaker.

432
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,440
I am so sorry.

433
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,700
The little Swiss watch...

434
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,780
The last little Swiss watchmaker.

435
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,320
And I'm going to sue him.

436
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:58,880
I'm a bit...

437
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,560
He's a little bit of a Chinese

438
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,040
Swiss watchmaker.

439
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,540
I'm an American.

440
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,620
I can sue that Swiss bastard.

441
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,320
He's a Chinese Swiss watchmaker.

442
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,320
Put it in one of his banks.

443
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,040
Working in a sweatshop.

444
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,800
Trying to make the best of it.

445
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,940
Best watches he can.

446
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,260
Actually, I know just how...

447
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,840
You're trying to hold it against him.

448
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,900
You know, the thing is

449
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,420
I know just how the last

450
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,560
Swiss watchmaker feels.

451
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,200
Because I'm the last

452
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,980
16mm film editor.

453
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,100
Yeah, that's true.

454
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,380
Like being the last

455
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,400
Swiss watchmaker.

456
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,780
Can you imagine being

457
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,200
the last Brontosaurus?

458
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,280
Yeah.

459
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,500
I can't even imagine

460
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,540
being the first one.

461
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,780
Or the last...

462
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,860
Well, the first one

463
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,880
would have been something...

464
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,260
I had the wrong head.

465
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,560
It's a lonely life.

466
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,320
Wrong-headed.

467
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,620
Don't make too much

468
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,820
of that silly, wrong-headed story.

469
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,440
The Brontosaurus

470
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,920
was a massive, wrong-headed beast.

471
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,020
There are people who believe

472
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,760
that Brontosaurus

473
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,300
is still a valid genius.

474
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,820
But what was wrong

475
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,900
with his head, supposedly?

476
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,740
The head of Camarasaurus supremus

477
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,800
was used by Professor O.C. Marsh.

478
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,920
I, Othniel Charles Marsh,

479
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,180
shall be world famous.

480
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,540
I shall call it

481
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,600
the Brontosaurus,

482
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,460
or Thunder Lizard.

483
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,800
He was a good scientist,

484
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,780
but he was just anxious

485
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,920
to get that dinosaur

486
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,040
up there.

487
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,040
And they didn't have a head,

488
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,660
so they said,

489
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,880
well, what about that Camarasaurus

490
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,520
that was found

491
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,500
several miles away?

492
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,100
It's basically

493
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,120
the same kind of creature.

494
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,000
Let's just use his head.

495
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,180
Nobody will know the difference.

496
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,380
I will make a fool

497
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,300
of my rival,

498
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,760
Edward Drinker Cope.

499
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,060
That pathetic,

500
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,960
that Quaker nut,

501
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,260
that crazy man.

502
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
Cope was also

503
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,840
a good scientist,

504
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,860
and recently,

505
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,180
crazy scientists

506
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,380
unearthed his skull

507
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,480
and took it on a ride

508
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,720
around the American southwest

509
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,480
to very...

510
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,500
In fact, his whole head,

511
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:38,940
I think,

512
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,340
What?

513
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,500
Yeah, they took Cope

514
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,100
around some slackers

515
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,740
that some millennial idiots

516
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,820
thought it would be cool

517
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,080
to dig this guy up

518
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,860
and carry his head

519
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,420
to special sites

520
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,080
congruent with the history

521
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,260
of paleontology.

522
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,460
Now, ladies and gentlemen...

523
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,360
Speaking of heads

524
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,260
being carried around...

525
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,840
Hey, we've got a whole

526
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,140
new religious ritual

527
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,360
we can do now.

528
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,200
We have a problem

529
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,980
with only two active microphones

530
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,760
in the studio,

531
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,220
even with all channels on,

532
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,300
and I don't know

533
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:05,880
any other way.

534
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,000
The only channel

535
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,520
that isn't on

536
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,880
is the phone channel,

537
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,880
if someone should call.

538
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:09,960
Oh, I see.

539
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,060
Oh, well, we can call it,

540
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:11,580
I guess.

541
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,140
But why should I complicate

542
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,400
the already twisted

543
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,840
and tangled matters

544
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
by inviting

545
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,800
a raucous phone call

546
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,900
to interrupt us?

547
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,780
That, I would prefer,

548
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,740
would not happen

549
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,140
at the moment

550
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,880
until perhaps we can...

551
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,920
Yeah, I had a great question

552
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,260
to ask,

553
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,160
and I forgot it now.

554
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,240
Well, it may come

555
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,380
bubbling up

556
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,740
to your mind.

557
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,500
You know, I do hear thumps

558
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,640
when you thump

559
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,040
the microphone that way.

560
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,920
I still smell

561
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,060
that green cheese

562
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,920
from the moon.

563
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,340
I smell the moon landing

564
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:40,600
earlier.

565
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,860
We have all the windows open

566
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,560
and the door.

567
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,820
Lean down

568
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,040
by those microphones

569
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,280
and make more sounds,

570
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:47,960
and perhaps

571
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,180
it is possible

572
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:49,740
that we're...

573
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,320
Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

574
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,420
Hey, baby.

575
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,420
Can't hear a thing,

576
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,000
so this is no help.

577
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,780
Try the other one.

578
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,180
Hey, baby.

579
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,900
I hear bumps,

580
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,800
but of course

581
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,760
one should never bump

582
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,060
into your...

583
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,400
Hey, baby.

584
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,360
Hey, baby.

585
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,220
This microphone's working.

586
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:02,960
Well, how about...

587
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,500
This is the one

588
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,680
that has always worked

589
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,740
and will always work.

590
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,560
Yes, that one is cooking

591
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,220
with gas.

592
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,200
The rest of them

593
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,920
are slackers.

594
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,900
A bunch of slackers.

595
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,180
Slackers.

596
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
These microphones

597
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,340
are simple decoys.

598
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,180
They're here to attract

599
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,620
other, better microphones

600
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,020
into the room.

601
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,580
Maybe they're not

602
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,940
turned on or plugged in,

603
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,700
but how about you?

604
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,620
Are you turned on?

605
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:19,720
Microphones like

606
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,280
the congregate and flocks

607
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,060
and various other...

608
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,100
Ah!

609
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,620
Uh-oh.

610
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:25,920
No, no, no.

611
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,780
Get out of here.

612
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,240
We're fine.

613
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,380
We're fine.

614
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,540
We're not...

615
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,480
Peppy happens.

616
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,320
Hey, what's that scary noise?

617
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,460
It's the...

618
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,820
presence of, uh...

619
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,220
tiny cherubim, uh...

620
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,000
on the staircase.

621
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,120
It's ghost music, man.

622
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,740
Is that my teeth chattering

623
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,380
or yours?

624
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,160
That's my teeth chattering.

625
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,540
That's your teeth chattering

626
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,820
on top of my teeth.

627
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,020
If that's my teeth chattering

628
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,880
and your teeth chattering...

629
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,600
You're way too close.

630
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,740
Then whose teeth

631
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,120
are those that aren't chattering?

632
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,620
Those are Hal's teeth.

633
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,700
Whose teeth are those

634
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,960
over there on the table?

635
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,980
That's Peppy's teeth.

636
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,500
Oh.

637
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,460
They're all chewed up.

638
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:14,940
You see, yeah,

639
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,680
they've been chewed up.

640
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,400
And the dog chewed on them.

641
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,600
And the dog chewed Peppy's teeth up.

642
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,780
The dog liked the flavor

643
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,680
of Peppy's saliva.

644
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,580
Yep.

645
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,420
That's the master's spit.

646
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,480
Old Peppy.

647
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,360
If you was a dog,

648
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,680
you'd lick up that spit.

649
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,580
That makes me want to sing

650
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,940
a song about old Peppy.

651
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,140
Peppy got some spit

652
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,980
that tastes good to a dog.

653
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,060
That's about all

654
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,140
I can think of that song.

655
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,860
That's the essential part.

656
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:38,780
And a chicken diddler

657
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,880
went to bed.

658
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,780
Went to town one day.

659
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,880
Chicken diddler

660
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,800
said to get fiddler.

661
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,960
Where can we find a good lay?

662
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,600
Good old chicken

663
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,600
will get the chicken diddlin'.

664
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,880
And the fiddler

665
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,900
went to fiddlin' and fiddlin'.

666
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,540
That's so euphoric.

667
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,360
We drove everybody out.

668
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,000
Yeah, we,

669
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,360
they're chicken diddlin'.

670
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,520
No, no, no, no.

671
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,340
Chicken diddlin'

672
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,700
is only metaphorical.

673
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,660
Get fiddlin' and chicken diddlin'.

674
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,800
No animals were harmed

675
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,860
in the making of this

676
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,660
diddlin'

677
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,780
All animals consented

678
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,200
were of 18 weeks or older

679
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,760
and were of consenting age

680
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,720
in the animal world.

681
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,560
I agreed to host the show

682
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,180
That was how this whole thing started

683
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,880
I was out there

684
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,340
I was out there

685
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,820
I was out there

686
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:43,820


687
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:43,820


688
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,520
I would end up

689
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,900
so brokenhearted

690
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,180
We had one night

691
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,200
That's all it meant to you

692
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,380
Now I'm alone

693
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,140
And I'm wishing

694
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,660
I could stop

695
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,960
thinking of you

696
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,300
I am in love

697
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,780
But it's only a fantasy

698
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,440
to see

699
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,020
I'm in search of

700
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,560
that hairy creature

701
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,420
who cared for me

702
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,860
under the pies

703
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,640
tried so hard to play it cool

704
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,580
didn't want to overdo it

705
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,400
wasn't I the lovesick fool

706
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,180
sending you a big bag of suet

707
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,140
and a red rose

708
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,260
I thought at least you'd call

709
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,540
was I so wrong for expecting

710
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,840
something more

711
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,100
nothing at all

712
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,420
I am in love

713
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,880
but it's only love

714
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,120
it's only a fantasy

715
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,160
I'm in search of

716
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,740
that hairy creature

717
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,520
who cared for me

718
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,020
under the pies

719
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,800
close my eyes and I see you there

720
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,680
musky smell of your madden

721
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,120
and your eyes

722
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,340
I'm in search of

723
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,460
that hairy creature

724
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:56,480
who cared for me

725
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:56,480


726
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:56,480


727
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:56,780
didn't want to overdo it

728
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,160
wasn't I the lovesick fool

729
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,320
tried so hard to play it cool

730
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:07,440
didn't I the lovesick fool

731
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:07,440


732
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:07,440


733
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:07,780
tried so hard to play it cool

734
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:09,880
musky smell of your madden

735
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:09,880


736
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,820
just living day to day

737
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,160
crushing the heads and the hearts of small things

738
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,440
going away

739
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,900
I am in love

740
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,680
but it's only a fantasy

741
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,700
I'm in search of

742
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,080
that hairy creature who cared for me

743
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,700
under the pies

744
00:29:42,700 --> 00:30:04,880
I am in search of that hairy creature

745
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,060
under the pies

746
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,920
an anodyne to the restless

747
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,080
spirits than to give

748
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,580
an ear to this program.

749
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,860
The soothing strains

750
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,420
of Dr. Howell's voice

751
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,300
will comfort you

752
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,080
and lead you off

753
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,960
into the bosom of Morpheus.

754
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,300
Well, ideally

755
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,200
you want to take a detour

756
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,100
before you go there, but the idea is

757
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,980
that one should be open to

758
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,340
all possibilities and sensations.

759
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,040
Soon you'll be suckling on

760
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,260
Morpheus' nipples.

761
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,200
Once again, that's too close.

762
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,000
Too close.

763
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,540
The milk of slumber.

764
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,420
Ha ha ha.

765
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,420
Nor Morpheus

766
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,500
but distended

767
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:51,960
nipples.

768
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,540
They're so old

769
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,520
and yet so stout.

770
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,500
The god of sleep

771
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,500
being mocked by Philo.

772
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,520
Perhaps when you toss and turn

773
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,080
on your restless couch,

774
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,540
your regret inflaming.

775
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
I'm sorry, Morpheus.

776
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,540
I didn't mean to make fun of your nipples.

777
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,220
They're not really that big.

778
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,860
A sleeping pill fatter than Fat Man

779
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,760
or Little Boy in order to

780
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,000
sack out after the god of sleep

781
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,360
withdraws his feathery wings.

782
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,620
I guess you can't

783
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,700
stop a guy who's determined

784
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,400
to do what he's gonna do.

785
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,900
I'm just trying to get something back there.

786
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,360
I think maybe I can recover

787
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,180
if I think of the right combination.

788
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,800
If only I could nestle in the

789
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,240
moobs of Morpheus.

790
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,300
But it has denied me

791
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,060
for I mocked him.

792
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,900
Just how much

793
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,460
do you want to?

794
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,680
Do you really, really want to?

795
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,500
I'm not sure.

796
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,200
I've been dreaming of

797
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,340
and I'd like to swim beside you

798
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,500
getting dizzy in your way

799
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,380
getting close enough to touch you

800
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:37,780
getting close enough to touch you

801
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,800
getting brave enough

802
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,480
to take you into my arms

803
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,720
and bring you down

804
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,840
to be with me.

805
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,800
But I can't do that thing anymore.

806
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,900
I can't be the thing I was before.

807
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,940
Maybe I am better off alone

808
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,300
because I crush everything

809
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,760
and I crush everything

810
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,580
and I crush everything.

811
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:22,360
and I crush everything.

812
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,100
My body's strong

813
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:31,220
My will is weak

814
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,400
I got pretty nice arms

815
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,740
I got pretty nice arms

816
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,760
but I hate my being.

817
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,460
And the dolphins are all phonies

818
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,740
they seem nice enough at first

819
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,320
but they pretend to be your friend

820
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,900
until they see you at your worst

821
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,460
and then they leave you

822
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,900
without a word

823
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,180
they swim away.

824
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,060
So I can't do that thing anymore.

825
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,720
I can't be the thing I was before.

826
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,180
I can't be the thing I was before.

827
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,220
I can't be the thing I was before.

828
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,180
Maybe I am better off alone

829
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,540
because I crush everything

830
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,020
and I crush everything

831
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,780
and I crush everything.

832
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,420
And everything I want I take

833
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:34,820
and everything I love I bring.

834
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,700
And everything I love I bring.

835
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,540
I lie away.

836
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,080
Did the stars come out?

837
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,300
Did the world spin round?

838
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,120
Does it matter that much

839
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,600
When you're ten miles down

840
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,220
In the light that filters down

841
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,700
Into my giant yellow eye

842
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,180
I can see the sails unfolding

843
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,740
Stretching wide against the sky

844
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,500
And I forgive them

845
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,120
I forgive and I let go

846
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,000
Cause I can't do that thing anymore

847
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,060
I can't be the thing I was before

848
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,120
Maybe I am better off alone

849
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,480
Because I crush everything

850
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,940
And I crush everything

851
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,760
And I crush everything

852
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,100
I lie below

853
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,120
You float above

854
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,380
In the pretty white shit

855
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,800
That I am dreaming of

856
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,960
I went to a new place

857
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,400
Named after the devil

858
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,300
Or that is owned by the devil

859
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,860
That's part of a hobby

860
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,980
I've had lately

861
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,720
Visiting

862
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,660
The devil's place?

863
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,400
The devil's staircase

864
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,720
How late is it open?

865
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,560
Let's go there

866
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,320
The devil's backbone

867
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,540
The devil's punch bowl near L.A.

868
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,000
The devil's navel

869
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,540
The drummonds took me to

870
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,340
Mount Diablo

871
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,100
This place?

872
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,600
This is nice

873
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,420
The devil's mountain

874
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,040
So this is Satan's kingdom

875
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,040
We went to Monte Diabolo

876
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,540
They named the best places

877
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,460
After the devil

878
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,620
To scare away the wimps and hanks

879
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,820
The devil's kneecap

880
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,300
Remember that?

881
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,260
The earnest Christians

882
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,160
Won't go to

883
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,500
Won't flock to the

884
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,200
Place names of the devil

885
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,420
The devil's elbow

886
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,700
And that leaves more room for us

887
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,840
There's privacy trails

888
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,080
Wherever you see

889
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,560
A canyon

890
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,740
Named after the devil

891
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,100
Or a city

892
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,600
Or a sex toy

893
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,680
Or a cavern

894
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,200
Or a devil's testicles

895
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,900
Or a flesh like canyon

896
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,060
Or mountain dildo

897
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,460
Those are always good places

898
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,340
Because the

899
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,240
The hoi polloi stay away from them

900
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,140
For superstition

901
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,320
Obvious superstitions

902
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,740
We go to those devil places

903
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,720
That kind of devilish hole

904
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,060
I don't want to go to that devil's hole

905
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,160
I'm going to that devil's golf ball

906
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,000
That old crack hole

907
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,500
The fact is that we're far too down

908
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,240
On the devil

909
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,100
And the devil has a lot of

910
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,520
A lot of

911
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:00,700
Of

912
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,020
Case

913
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,600
All these places named after the devil

914
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,640
In various locations

915
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,020
Yes

916
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,400
Like the devil's hop yard

917
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,180
Well they're tricky though

918
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,540
The devil's golf courses

919
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,820
Would be the worst place

920
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,100
To play golf

921
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,280
The devil's anchovy bowl

922
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,440
And the devil's punch bowl

923
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,740
Would be the hardest thing

924
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,000
To drink punch out of

925
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,920
You'd think

926
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
Unless the devil wanted you

927
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,720
To have some punch

928
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,420
How about that?

929
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,280
What about an impulse of benevolence

930
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,560
From old Nick?

931
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,520
Old Saint Nick

932
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,660
That was poison punch

933
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,520
The devil's poison punch bowl

934
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,980
Well now you see

935
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,920
You aren't antinomian enough

936
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,800
You're still thinking

937
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,720
In terms of the Christian dualism

938
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,540
Between light and darkness

939
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,920
But in fact

940
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,880
That is an imposition

941
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,640
Of a weird oriental religion

942
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,200
It's Jesus that made the devil bad

943
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,020
Before Jesus

944
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,120
The devil was just a fun-loving imp

945
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,840
Jesus was just a prankster

946
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,960
That's not exactly true either

947
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,900
Satan I don't like you

948
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,820
Running around with that boy

949
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,100
Jesus

950
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,680
I think he's a bad influence on you

951
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,380
I think he's gonna bring you down

952
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,680
Well on one occasion

953
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,900
Satan pointed out

954
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,020
That he and Jesus

955
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,180
Were really brothers

956
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,180
Jesus could be the end of you Satan

957
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,820
You always liked him better than me

958
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,400
Copyright

959
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,080
I think if you run around

960
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,560
With that

961
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,780
That Joseph and Mary boy

962
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,820
What's their last name?

963
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,440
Carpenter?

964
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,580
I can't remember

965
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,900
Bar David

966
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,760
They're the Bar David family

967
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,380
Oh yes, Bar David

968
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,380
Didn't

969
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,740
Last year

970
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,660
There's little Yeshua

971
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,100
Dr. Halperin

972
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,740
You were saying

973
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,000
That someone had dug up

974
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,960
Jesus' parents' graves

975
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,560
And found their names on them

976
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,540
They not only found that

977
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,440
They found a body for Jesus too

978
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,080
They found a lot of bad stuff

979
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,700
But you know

980
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,660
People are

981
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,200
There was a lot of confusion

982
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,960
I thought Jesus' body was buried in the ground

983
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,600
Hey, your Edward Cope head

984
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,060
Fell in my Jesus head

985
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,560
I think Jesus' body

986
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,360
Is in Joseph of Arimathea's grave

987
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,540
Your peanut butter

988
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,940
Got covered with my chocolate

989
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,080
Who's buried in my chocolate?

990
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:00,800
It's buried in Grant's tomb

991
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,820
Othniel Marsh

992
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,440
That would be the art of Winston Smith

993
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,320
Oh, Othniel Charles Marsh

994
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,060
You say that?

995
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,660
It's buried in Grant's tomb

996
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,480
That's the trick answer to the trick question

997
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,820
You know my son

998
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,540
Oh wait, I can't

999
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,360
I shouldn't give it away

1000
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,000
He's got a screenplay idea

1001
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,120
No, not your son's idea

1002
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,080
I shouldn't jinx it

1003
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,480
About Cope and Marsh?

1004
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,480
Nothing, nothing

1005
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,980
I read an interesting cheesy paperback

1006
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,820
Written in the year of 1992

1007
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,720
In the year of 1998

1008
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,800
About Cope and Marsh fighting

1009
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,640
Having to join together in the Montana desert

1010
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,820
To fight aliens

1011
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,820
Who were snatching dinosaur bones

1012
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,260
Well that's what it would take

1013
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,340
To get those two together

1014
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,640
They were once friends

1015
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,980
They were even colleagues

1016
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,000
But they did have their differences

1017
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,700
As you know

1018
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,680
The paperback was called Bone Wars

1019
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,300
And I'm sure that the author must have done flips

1020
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,300
When he saw that movie

1021
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,000
Cowboys vs. Aliens

1022
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,640
The movie's coming out

1023
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,420
Because it was very similar

1024
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,620
Someone mining the same territory

1025
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,280
Thank you

1026
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,420
Did you find anything?

1027
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,800
Stealing dinosaur bones from the same territory

1028
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,300
But nothing

1029
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,000
We can't revive any micro

1030
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,080
It feels strange on this show

1031
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,180
There's something in this atmosphere Dr. Hal

1032
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,500
I'm afraid ladies and gentlemen

1033
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,400
All we can do is have teams

1034
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,480
Take turns at the other microphone

1035
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,220
Or at mine

1036
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,340
Someone can come and stand near mine

1037
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,980
Sure we can pass this mic here

1038
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,060
off to the next... No, you don't need to pass anything.

1039
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,980
It makes terrible thumping

1040
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,380
sound. Instead, others.

1041
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,340
Mohammed must come to the mountain.

1042
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,980
Michael Pepe, you can come to my side of the

1043
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,800
desk, and then we could

1044
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,840
both be using this

1045
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,880
one microphone, which does have a spit guard,

1046
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,220
so no matter how much we expostulate

1047
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,720
and pop our peas,

1048
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,420
no spit will sully... Puzzling evidence.

1049
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,460
You can take my spot here.

1050
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,940
Oh, whatever

1051
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,880
you do, do whatever

1052
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,860
you want with me, but just don't

1053
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,700
throw me in that puzzling evidence patch.

1054
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,260
Don't

1055
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,300
throw me in that puzzling evidence patch.

1056
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,260
Well, uh,

1057
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,580
no one's going to do anything

1058
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,860
coercive here.

1059
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,880
I know you're a bunch of wimps.

1060
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,300
San Francisco

1061
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,960
wimpy. Everything's

1062
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,000
equal. Everybody's nice to each other.

1063
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,000
Give me a hug.

1064
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,140
Spare me.

1065
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,840
Hey, hugs, not drugs.

1066
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,040
I'm giving you a hug.

1067
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,920
And then when you get old

1068
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,320
and you want to give a hug, you start shaking.

1069
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,840
I'm giving you a big hug.

1070
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,960
Okay, this works? No.

1071
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,220
This works? Oh.

1072
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,900
That's some jazzy music you got there.

1073
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,420
Well, for Satan's nightclub,

1074
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,540
yeah, you've got to, but of course

1075
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,980
we are also considering

1076
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,020
the mysteries of life.

1077
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,800
Oh, and the devil's punch bowl, and the devil's...

1078
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,800
Where are we left off? I don't know.

1079
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,160
The devil's rutabaga

1080
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,660
seed-eating canary.

1081
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:02,020
Yeah, yeah, go down to all through the western U.S.

1082
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,120
There's devils everything to the point where I gave up

1083
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,000
trying to be interested in it.

1084
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,460
I just gave up, okay? I just gave up.

1085
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,900
I went over to Bruno's. Too many devil things?

1086
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,060
I got two 18-year-olds, and we're going to do coke all night.

1087
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,240
I'm cooler than that.

1088
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,540
I gave up on giving up.

1089
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,320
You're giving up?

1090
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,460
I gave up on giving up.

1091
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,980
A quitter, eh, son?

1092
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,400
I'm an ultra quitter.

1093
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,860
You know those losers that use drugs?

1094
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,020
Actually, I don't know any losers

1095
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:28,980
who use drugs.

1096
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,340
I know users who lose drugs.

1097
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,220
Oh, yeah.

1098
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,500
But, anyway,

1099
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,960
the whole thing rests,

1100
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,980
I think, on a theoretical construct.

1101
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,280
Michael Pepe wants to share that construct

1102
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:44,980
with you now.

1103
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,360
I would love to.

1104
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,160
Are you missing a document?

1105
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,880
I'm missing something which I have just found.

1106
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,940
Ah, great. I'm glad you found it.

1107
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,080
You should come to this side

1108
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,380
and share

1109
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,560
this microphone, since we are

1110
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,620
bound to two microphone

1111
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,360
sharing.

1112
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,160
Come through here,

1113
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,640
and we'll both lean into this

1114
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,560
microphone. It's the best I can offer.

1115
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,640
Just like John and Paul.

1116
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:12,920
The two

1117
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,540
great geniuses.

1118
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,220
Mick and Keith.

1119
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,580
Which one would be Mick and which would be Keith

1120
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:22,040
here, between Michael Pepe and Dr. Howe?

1121
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:22,640
And what about Mitch?

1122
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,780
That's hard to know. You know, I'd rather not be

1123
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,600
a Rolling Stone. I'd rather be

1124
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,340
a Beatle, if that's okay.

1125
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:29,660
Really?

1126
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,940
James, Paul, George, and

1127
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,140
Brock Morton.

1128
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,560
We all know the real question, of course, is

1129
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,800
Yoko versus Linda. And I have been

1130
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,600
one of the few Linda supporters

1131
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,680
in the sort of art

1132
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,780
avant-garde, sub-genius,

1133
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,660
weird person world.

1134
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,580
I thought I was the

1135
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,780
most of the world, I'm the only one

1136
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,920
who liked Yoko better.

1137
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,840
Yeah, I know. The new one-legged girl

1138
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,600
is good, though.

1139
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,400
Paul's the one-legged girl that he

1140
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,640
cast off.

1141
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,160
And he just kept the other leg.

1142
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,980
Right, exactly. I thought that was kind of

1143
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,780
mean, you know, give her back the leg anyway.

1144
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,500
Okay, now, if we were Star Trek characters,

1145
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,840
which ones, not which one

1146
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,020
would you want to be, which one are you really?

1147
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,140
I feel like Scotty

1148
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,900
myself. I'm always running around trying to

1149
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,760
fix things. How'd you say, oh, just

1150
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,900
give me some more dilithium crystals and we can

1151
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,960
get this job done. He's a cool

1152
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,980
guy. He'd always snort those dilithium

1153
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,000
crystals. Yes, he had a little

1154
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,820
bit of a problem there with his addiction,

1155
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,780
but, well, every man,

1156
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,280
man dreams of being Kirk.

1157
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,180
I, you know,

1158
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,580
I could never be Kirk.

1159
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,740
Well, I would, right, I suppose

1160
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,540
I wanted to be Kirk because

1161
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,540
he gets the most girls, but

1162
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,060
Spock

1163
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,740
obviously knows all and sees

1164
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,740
all, so as a grown-up, you would

1165
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,220
have to want to be Spock, right?

1166
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:51,460
Well,

1167
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,760
I mean, he knows everything. We're not talking about

1168
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,840
what you want to be. We're talking about which of these

1169
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,940
archetypes you ended up actually

1170
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,360
being. Oh, God, well.

1171
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,480
I wouldn't even get... You wanted to be Spock,

1172
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,960
but I ended up at best, so more like

1173
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,960
Scotty's assistant. No, I'd be one of

1174
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,980
the guys... Runs the parts room. I'd be one of the guys

1175
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,740
back on Earth, I'm afraid, yeah.

1176
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,020
I wouldn't have even made the team. I don't

1177
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,100
know how many people are on there.

1178
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,940
Bring us more dilithium crystals and dobsheads.

1179
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,020
Oh, I know where the dobsheads are,

1180
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,980
sir, but we're going to have to go down to the planet for those

1181
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,320
crystals. Well, there are dobsheads

1182
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,120
on every planet in every

1183
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,880
galaxy, of course. That's the problem.

1184
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,920
We've got all the dobsheads we need. We need the

1185
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,820
crystals. Right. And you've got to buy them.

1186
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,780
You've got to buy those from real seedy carriages down there.

1187
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,900
Yeah, exactly. Down on 6th Street. I don't want to beam down

1188
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,780
there. Like porn,

1189
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,560
I mean, pawn shops

1190
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,840
owners. Well...

1191
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,860
Beam me up, Scotty. There's no intelligent life

1192
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:42,720
down here.

1193
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,980
The dumbest people display that

1194
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,100
bumper sticker.

1195
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,440
What, beam me up, Scotty?

1196
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,140
Yeah, yeah. It's always... That's like

1197
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,860
a Rambo song. It's like people who say, who call other people

1198
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,880
sheeple. They all sound

1199
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,980
exactly alike. Do they know where to find a beryllium

1200
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,360
sphere, though? Yeah.

1201
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,640
You've got to know when to stop using a joke.

1202
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,880
That's a thing. It's like if a sheeple...

1203
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,560
Okay, talk, you say it a few times. That was real clever

1204
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,160
in 1995. Yeah, but let's, you know...

1205
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,940
You know... At this point, if you're

1206
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,740
calling everybody else sheeple, you fit

1207
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,360
the definition, Dave. You are a sheeple.

1208
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,540
Right. Make up your own

1209
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,480
derogatory word for

1210
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,980
everybody else. Right. If you're gonna be...

1211
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,840
We have dozens of them we can sell you.

1212
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,800
Yeah. Oh, there's so many

1213
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,760
words that are much better

1214
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,580
to say than anyone could say,

1215
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,620
like, you know, instead of saying

1216
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,620
somebody's loaded or bombed,

1217
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,140
you know, they're full as a tick.

1218
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,500
I mean, wow. I've never heard that before.

1219
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,540
That's the way people used to... I'm full

1220
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,860
as a tick. Full as a tick.

1221
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,120
I'm gonna have to go home now.

1222
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:42,460
Yeah, you're...

1223
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,920
Right, exactly. No, I'm not so full.

1224
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,680
Three sheets to the wind is another.

1225
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,900
It's... My mother used to say,

1226
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,660
and I would say, what are you talking about?

1227
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,520
What's all that? Three sheets to the wind.

1228
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,820
I'm 120 sheets to the tornado.

1229
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,980
Boys. What the hell is...

1230
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,280
You're gonna have to drag me home.

1231
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,320
So sheets, but I mean, sheets of what?

1232
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,640
Are these like, uh,

1233
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,140
you know, like string theory

1234
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,280
sheets of... What do they call them?

1235
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,000
Brains? Are these brains?

1236
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:10,800
The sheets?

1237
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:14,080
I can't see Stang unless I...

1238
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,740
Can you take this down?

1239
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,220
I can't see.

1240
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,300
I look the same as I did

1241
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,700
last time you looked at me, man.

1242
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,820
Yeah, but it's like hidden, so...

1243
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,240
It's like, I don't know who's talking.

1244
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,980
Well, think how the listeners feel.

1245
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,760
They can't see either of us.

1246
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,120
Hey, Michael, I think you're the right host.

1247
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:31,340
Lucky sunset.

1248
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,740
Oh, my God.

1249
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:33,480
You look like a host.

1250
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,400
Oh, my God, I'm the host now.

1251
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,380
You look like a host.

1252
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,420
Probably you folks out there can sense it.

1253
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:39,980
And now...

1254
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,640
And now...

1255
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,580
Oh, man, remember him?

1256
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:46,720
You can do a...

1257
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,640
You can be five or six hundred radio stations

1258
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,420
all by yourself, can't you?

1259
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:53,180
He was, you know, if I could do Carson,

1260
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,520
he was the greatest of them all.

1261
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,820
But none of the, you know,

1262
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,800
like if I do gestures or motions,

1263
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,300
it doesn't mean a whole lot to...

1264
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,660
A lot of these radio audiences

1265
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,700
don't get the video version of this show.

1266
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,420
That's maybe to their benefit.

1267
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:07,980
Well...

1268
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,460
You just have to work hard on the vocal part, Michael.

1269
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,500
Well, okay, but...

1270
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,520
I'll be your vocal coach.

1271
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,520
That's on purpose.

1272
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,780
They miss out on...

1273
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,000
Talk with expression.

1274
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,660
I will try.

1275
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,320
And wide grimaces.

1276
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,780
I will try.

1277
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,100
In a theatric hell way.

1278
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:24,580
Emotional.

1279
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,420
It was pronoun.

1280
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:27,440
Yes.

1281
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,000
Pronoun.

1282
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:28,780
Yes.

1283
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,800
Since your...

1284
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,680
Radio opera.

1285
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:35,040
We will do radio opera the Russian way.

1286
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,200
We will do Russian opera.

1287
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,720
It's funny in Russia.

1288
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,680
Everything, you know...

1289
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,740
You say that to anything horrible.

1290
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,420
You think up something horrible and then go,

1291
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,600
it's funny in Russia.

1292
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:45,940
Yeah.

1293
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,400
My son taught me that.

1294
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,460
Yeah, really.

1295
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,460
Yeah, because they...

1296
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,220
He taught me everything.

1297
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,020
It's just so...

1298
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,060
You know, they're...

1299
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:52,780
It's funny in Russia.

1300
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:57,820
But their soldiers are the most musical comedy ready.

1301
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:58,620
Really?

1302
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,800
They can sing all kinds of songs.

1303
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,240
And they...

1304
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,140
All the soldiers...

1305
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,560
Not all of them, but a great many of them

1306
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,020
can do incredible dances.

1307
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:09,760
Those Cossack dances where they kick and hop around.

1308
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:10,280
Yeah.

1309
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,360
Like on cartoons.

1310
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,280
That's for real?

1311
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,940
I think it's not just Cossack.

1312
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:14,540
The modern Russian...

1313
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,840
I think it's the Russian army.

1314
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,720
And they have a huge choir

1315
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,320
that sings very hushed, lovely,

1316
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,240
kind of feminine pieces of music.

1317
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:23,880
You know,

1318
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,860
you know,

1319
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,880
Dies Irae and that kind of...

1320
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,500
I wonder if the Spetsnaz...

1321
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:28,780
Spetsnaz.

1322
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,400
They have a choir.

1323
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,400
On the other hand...

1324
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,140
The secret police.

1325
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,540
Do they have a little...

1326
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:33,820
The Cheka?

1327
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:34,220
Yeah.

1328
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,580
Do they have a little secret choir?

1329
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,260
On the other hand,

1330
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,340
this is the same army

1331
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,780
that will just slaughter you

1332
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:39,760
if they take you prisoner.

1333
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,460
Like, you know,

1334
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,460
like they did the Nazis.

1335
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,520
They just killed them all.

1336
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,320
Just get it over with.

1337
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,300
Just, yeah.

1338
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:46,420
Or they...

1339
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,180
Or the American...

1340
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:47,620
You know, they...

1341
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,640
People were so terrified

1342
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,700
of the Russians.

1343
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,940
It's just scary to me now.

1344
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:54,960
But they're chivalrous, though.

1345
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,020
They know how to treat a lady.

1346
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:57,060
Yeah.

1347
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:57,900
Take it from me.

1348
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:58,180
Really?

1349
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:58,620
Yeah.

1350
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,160
Take it from me.

1351
00:50:59,160 --> 00:50:59,660
Give her vodka.

1352
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:00,680
Really?

1353
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:01,160
No.

1354
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,140
Actually, I...

1355
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,940
We're having Spy Emerson

1356
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:05,700
come on board.

1357
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,340
So, welcome, Spy.

1358
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,000
On the bridge.

1359
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,500
There's another seat over here.

1360
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:09,920
Hi.

1361
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:10,620
Vodka?

1362
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,480
Did somebody say

1363
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,380
you have vodka here?

1364
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,320
I fear not.

1365
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,820
Would you like to sit

1366
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:16,760
with Reverend Stang?

1367
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,760
He says there's a seat

1368
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,680
over by him.

1369
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,460
Oh, well.

1370
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,080
Excuse me.

1371
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:20,640
Thank you.

1372
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,400
Yes, of course.

1373
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,760
Oh, I'm in the phylo seat now.

1374
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,980
Soon I'll be rotated

1375
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:25,980
on out of here.

1376
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,660
Spang...

1377
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,500
Stang, this is Spang.

1378
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:28,680
It's been a long,

1379
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:28,960
a long war.

1380
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,020
A long war.

1381
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,400
Yes, Spy and Stang.

1382
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,140
Do you know each other?

1383
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,640
Hi, Spy.

1384
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:34,320
Hi.

1385
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,180
You know each other?

1386
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:35,800
You do now.

1387
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:36,940
Now you know.

1388
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,260
Oh, you have to hear you.

1389
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,620
We have to share this one.

1390
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,220
Oh, this one.

1391
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:41,740
Yeah.

1392
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:42,620
Oh, okay.

1393
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:43,640
That other one is...

1394
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,580
Repeat your statement, please.

1395
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,840
It's a sad dud.

1396
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:47,760
This is so close.

1397
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:48,680
I'm just meeting you

1398
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,600
for the first time yet.

1399
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,440
I feel so close

1400
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,100
to you right now.

1401
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,120
Well, you are physically close.

1402
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:52,700
I'm sorry I didn't

1403
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,860
brush my teeth earlier.

1404
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,300
Do you smell my peppermint oil?

1405
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:56,680
Yes.

1406
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,020
This is yes.

1407
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,400
Well, there's, you know...

1408
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:58,680
Good.

1409
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,800
I hope it overpowers.

1410
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:00,720
No, no.

1411
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,560
I like to surround us all

1412
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,680
in a cloud of peppermint and...

1413
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,760
It's pretty minty.

1414
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,500
Yeah, it is pretty powerful.

1415
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,460
It's just the S.

1416
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:09,040
It's the oil.

1417
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,520
The exact oil.

1418
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:11,740
The Earl.

1419
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:13,240
If you mixed up with patchouli,

1420
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,060
it would explode.

1421
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,040
It might.

1422
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,780
We don't want to try

1423
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:17,760
anything like that.

1424
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,080
I swore off that stuff,

1425
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,380
that patchouli oil stuff.

1426
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:22,880
It's too corny.

1427
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:23,600
Why?

1428
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:24,720
Attracted cops.

1429
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,440
You have to be

1430
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,480
a sensitive joker to...

1431
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,540
Attracted cops.

1432
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:29,160
Pops and flies.

1433
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,600
Oh, I like patchouli.

1434
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,520
Well, you know,

1435
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:32,860
they mix it with some special,

1436
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,160
fancy other stuff,

1437
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:34,980
and then...

1438
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,040
Ah, smells like

1439
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,900
a 1970 head shop in here.

1440
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,440
Mm-hmm.

1441
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,260
My head is spinning.

1442
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,300
I'm so dizzy.

1443
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,780
It's bong water perfume.

1444
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,380
Ah, I'll have another

1445
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,720
bourbon and bong water.

1446
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,300
How about you?

1447
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,720
Did anyone check out

1448
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,340
the refrigerator?

1449
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,420
It's bulging

1450
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,940
with alcoholic drinks.

1451
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:55,520
This time,

1452
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,060
it's not horrible near beer

1453
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,360
left by...

1454
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,700
anhedonic non-drinkers

1455
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,780
who like the repulsive taste

1456
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,040
of non-alcoholic beer.

1457
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,180
It's actual beer,

1458
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,940
though I don't know the brand,

1459
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,460
and it might not be fancy enough

1460
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,540
for some tastes.

1461
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,200
I came for the near beer

1462
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,120
and senka.

1463
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,660
Ah, you're welcome.

1464
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,120
And we've got a...

1465
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:19,100
I don't know.

1466
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,560
K-Rob often brings in

1467
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,560
verboten snacks.

1468
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,660
He brings in the donuts

1469
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,760
and the Chinese food,

1470
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,600
lumpia,

1471
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,020
which lumps

1472
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:28,880
tend to roll

1473
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,760
along the carpet.

1474
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,060
We have to make sure

1475
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,620
that does not happen

1476
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,420
on our watch.

1477
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,120
I want the fat-free cream

1478
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,200
and the caffeine-less coffee,

1479
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:40,880
please.

1480
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,560
Yes, the rock juice,

1481
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:43,560
the tree bark,

1482
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,440
the stillborn bean sprouts,

1483
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,600
and pure rainwater.

1484
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:49,960
Oh, but rainwater

1485
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,940
has acid in it.

1486
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:51,740
The acid rain.

1487
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,560
I wouldn't drink rainwater.

1488
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:54,460
Too late.

1489
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:56,560
I'm feeling the acid now.

1490
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,580
I even fear it

1491
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:58,140
on my skin.

1492
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:58,660
It burns.

1493
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,520
It burns.

1494
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,100
It burns.

1495
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,320
The horrible run

1496
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,740
is a stench

1497
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,200
of malign burning flesh.

1498
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,160
Oh, this is terrible.

1499
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:10,820
Terrible.

1500
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,040
Well, seriously,

1501
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,340
I've been sitting here

1502
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,040
for a long time.

1503
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:16,200
I'd be happy to let

1504
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,100
somebody else share

1505
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,900
the one extra microphone.

1506
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,560
Stang, I'm so sorry.

1507
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,200
I don't know how

1508
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,860
I can adequately convey

1509
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:24,860


1510
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:25,960
We plugged in three

1511
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,320
other microphones in first.

1512
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,760
Well, I just wish

1513
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,360
I knew how they might

1514
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:31,760
be attached,

1515
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,120
and we've had top minds

1516
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,080
working on it,

1517
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:34,740
and they have been

1518
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,740
unable to fathom

1519
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,740
the answer.

1520
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,840
It would take

1521
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,080
a young, budding

1522
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,060
Nikola Tesla

1523
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,380
or Pete Goldie

1524
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,340
to unsnarl

1525
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:45,920
this Gordian knot

1526
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,500
of Alexandrine proportions.

1527
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,540
We need to have

1528
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,360
like a fundraiser

1529
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,620
and hire ourselves

1530
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,440
a super wizard,

1531
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:54,400
you know,

1532
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:55,720
chord master.

1533
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:56,820
You know,

1534
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:57,320
there are...

1535
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,160
Let's just hire ourselves

1536
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,300
and leave it at that.

1537
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,480
A lot of things

1538
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,540
on the chat thread

1539
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,440
about equipment issues

1540
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,400
in the studio.

1541
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:05,220
Don't talk about them.

1542
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:05,720
I'm afraid

1543
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,200
we're experiencing

1544
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,600
equipment issues

1545
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,580
in the studio.

1546
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,920
Yes, it's true.

1547
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:13,640
For as long

1548
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,600
as equipment exists,

1549
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:15,860
there have been issues,

1550
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,220
and as long

1551
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,520
as studios have existed,

1552
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,060
equipment has malfunctioned

1553
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:22,800
in those studios.

1554
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,360
And so you see

1555
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,240
we're part of a

1556
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,200
proud tradition

1557
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:26,800
of radio

1558
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,300
going on.

1559
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:27,460
Going back

1560
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,340
to radio's

1561
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:29,020
very beginning

1562
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,200
here at

1563
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,480
RadioValencia.fm

1564
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,080
the crowd of

1565
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,640
philosophers

1566
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,980
doing its best.

1567
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,280
Tom Cruise

1568
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,740
is so in love

1569
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:51,460
with Katie

1570
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:55,940
At least all his people

1571
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,160
tell him so

1572
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,320
And while he thinks

1573
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,000
that she's a very special lady

1574
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,400
It's probably not the way

1575
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,880
he'd choose to go

1576
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,320
But a lifetime

1577
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,900
of longing looks

1578
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,460
would cause too much

1579
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:16,200
distraction

1580
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,700
Good thing that he's

1581
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,340
not gay anymore

1582
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,620
Tom Cruise is

1583
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:25,640
Tom Cruise crazy

1584
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,760
Just be glad

1585
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:27,120
it's him

1586
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:27,720
not you

1587
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,080
If you had

1588
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,520
Tom Cruise's troubles

1589
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,460
You might be

1590
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,240
Tom Cruise crazy too

1591
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,480
You'd flash your

1592
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,180
big white shiny smile

1593
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,300
You'd buy expensive shoes

1594
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,900
But you'd be

1595
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,040
the only man on earth

1596
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,340
Couldn't enjoy

1597
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,300
Tom Cruise

1598
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:45,880
Oh no

1599
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:47,340
You couldn't enjoy

1600
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,240
Tom Cruise

1601
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,200
Tom Cruise is

1602
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,020
always getting older

1603
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,700
He knows he'll never

1604
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,600
be that young again

1605
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,320
And when Tom Cruise

1606
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,700
looks back over his shoulder

1607
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,340
He sees a thousand

1608
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,220
younger leading men

1609
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,300
And he knows

1610
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,340
someday he'll have to play

1611
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,100
an old retarded

1612
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:21,600
grandpa

1613
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,940
While someone younger

1614
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,900
plays his sexy son

1615
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,100
And he knows

1616
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,340
the world is

1617
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:29,340


1618
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:29,340


1619
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:30,060
Tom Cruise is

1620
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:31,100
Tom Cruise crazy

1621
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,220
Just be glad

1622
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:32,580
it's him

1623
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,200
not you

1624
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,460
If you had

1625
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,980
Tom Cruise's troubles

1626
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:37,920
You might be

1627
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,700
Tom Cruise crazy too

1628
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,320
You'd flash your big

1629
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,580
white shiny smile

1630
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,760
You'd buy expensive shoes

1631
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,520
But you'd be the only man on earth

1632
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,740
Who couldn't enjoy Tom Cruise

1633
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:51,340
Oh no

1634
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,680
You couldn't enjoy Tom Cruise

1635
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,100
Tom Cruise is

1636
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,100


1637
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,100


1638
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,100


1639
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,100


1640
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,100


1641
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,100


1642
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,100


1643
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,100


1644
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,100


1645
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,100


1646
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,100


1647
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,100


1648
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,100


1649
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:03,240
Tom Cruise hopes somewhere there's a place for him

1650
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,720
Cause he's not of this world anymore

1651
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,980
Somewhere in some secluded castle

1652
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,780
Poor Tom Cruise sits staring at the wall

1653
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:25,780
And the outside world is always such a hassle

1654
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:31,520
Sometimes he won't go out at all

1655
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:36,520
There are millions who know his name

1656
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,980
Everybody loves him

1657
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:43,000
Why is it that he feels so alone?

1658
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,180
Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise crazy

1659
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,340
Just be glad it's him, not you

1660
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:54,120
If you had Tom Cruise's troubles

1661
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,760
You might be Tom Cruise's friend

1662
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:56,760
Tom Cruise crazy too

1663
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,680
You'd flash your big white shiny smile

1664
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,820
You'd buy expensive shoes

1665
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:05,600
But you'd be the only man on earth

1666
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,860
Who couldn't enjoy Tom Cruise

1667
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:10,900
Oh no, you couldn't enjoy Tom Cruise

1668
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,120
But look at the enjoy Center

1669
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,120
Look at the only place you can buy CR 대한

1670
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:33,720
Here you got perfect poster

1671
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:40,700
A generous went to the Academy

1672
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:40,800
And all of the people in Earsdale

1673
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:40,900
Trickled his way back home

1674
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,340
So God gave him the ha Bright

1675
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:44,120
But he valley would be handed to him

1676
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,320
Who could bring think that Tom Cruise

1677
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:46,320


1678
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,500
And ни one scarf would change

1679
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:47,500


1680
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:47,500


1681
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,780
And no one ever gets that

1682
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:52,980
Bonus on your day
