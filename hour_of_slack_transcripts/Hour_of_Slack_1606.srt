1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,380
Who's there?

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,420
The Self Genius Power of Squatting

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,240
Now I know all about everything.

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,260
What? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,280
You see a farmer's got to go crazy.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:22,980
Me?

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,100
Uh-huh.

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,100
Thanks, Grandpa.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,120
Maybe I wish I was.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,520
Yeah, I can lick anybody says a farmer's got to go crazy.

11
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:40,640
So we kind of think the fancy brass tacks causing anybody any dad-rattatin farmers a tep-eatin' bin-a-tan.

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,940
How are ya?

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,660
I'm crazy, Grandpa.

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,540
I guess all that's pretty dumb.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,760
Recording, everything's going fine. No trouble. That's it.

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,020
I think we're in deep trouble because I just heard Spicer's comment.

17
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:57,100


18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,240
And I didn't even know he was a fruit or an aromatic fragrance to begin with.

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,180
And yet at the same time, he barks like an animal.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:12,640
Which particular comment? That's the new president's hate secretary, right? Secretary of hate?

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,820
Secretary of hate, yeah.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,100
Which was, which statement?

23
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:27,100
Well, it started with a statement where he said some place near the fish pond or the wide angular pool in downtown Los Angeles,

24
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,000
on Delacoura, in D.C.

25
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,860
In Washington, D.C. during the war.

26
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,740
In Washington, D.C.

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,660
The Medicine Fish Pond?

28
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,280
We do know some people who actually went to the ladies' march, which was half-mans, it turned out.

29
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,300
It was a hermaphroditic march, I guess, on Soviet style.

30
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,140
Why not both?

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,660
Why not both?

32
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,020
That's right.

33
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:54,940
And she said she didn't have exact numbers, but it seemed like close to a million or, you know, a very, very large amount.

34
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,460
Mm-hmm.

35
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:01,980
And supposedly there was not so much of an amount the day before for the presidency inaugurals.

36
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,900
And yet, so Spicer came in and was real feisty and was going to beat up the press corps.

37
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:17,080
Well, they invented, the Trump people invented a new term, alternative facts.

38
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,900
Yeah, alternative facts.

39
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,820
Because they were going, we had more people here than the Obama inauguration, of course.

40
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,980
And they were going, no, here's some photos comparing the two.

41
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,480
Obviously, the Obama turnout was much larger.

42
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,720
And they went, no, that's an alternative fact.

43
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,400
This is the other alternative fact.

44
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,000
You know, the one that's not true.

45
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,800
But it's an alternative fact.

46
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,140
So, what are you, oh, you Democrats are all such hypocrites.

47
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,300
Yeah.

48
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,820
You want to have your own facts.

49
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,800
You don't think anybody else can have other facts.

50
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,780
Yeah, there are no more real facts.

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,260
They're clouded by sentiments.

52
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,860
And feelings.

53
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,940
There are alternative facts.

54
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,720
That's old news, though, Dave.

55
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, it's old fake news.

56
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,480
The whole idea of what constitutes reality is coming in.

57
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,140
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

58
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,760
Question, question, I'm sorry.

59
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,580
Of course.

60
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,840
A good thing I had so much.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,440
I peed in the bottle.

62
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:12,880
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,660
I wondered what that sound was and that odd smell, like asparagus.

64
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,360
Yeah, asparagus.

65
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:22,940
Well.

66
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,800
A metallic vegetable.

67
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:32,060
You know, I guess there's always been a bit of a problem with what's real news and what's

68
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:40,500
news news and what's real new news and what's just a bunch of malarkey, baloney, hogwash.

69
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,740
And what's enter newsment.

70
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,700
Yeah, enter newsment.

71
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,980
Infotainment.

72
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,140
Yeah.

73
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,060
Infotainment.

74
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,720
I love infotainment.

75
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,000
What was bleepo?

76
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,400
Porn-tainment.

77
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:52,780
Infotainment.

78
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,840
Infotainment.

79
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,300
I came up with infotainment.

80
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,440
Remember?

81
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,360
Infotainment?

82
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,080
I believe that.

83
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,640
Back in the early versions of my novel, my 300-year-old novel.

84
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,080
Yeah, that's right.

85
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,800
Yes, bleepo's trans-porn-tation.

86
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,360
Because it was infoscan then and anything that I said infoscan, I could put info in

87
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,460
front of anything like even infostain.

88
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,300
Right.

89
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,660
Or, and then you put scan on the back of anything like we scan.

90
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:18,760
Yeah.

91
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,500
Dave scan.

92
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,640
Yep.

93
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,800
Bob scan.

94
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,380
Oh, that's been taken.

95
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,960
Scan Bob, Bob scan.

96
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,140
Stinky Bob, Spum Pants.

97
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,400
God.

98
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,340
Bob is cool.

99
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,620
The endless rip-offs.

100
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,480
Good Lord, man.

101
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,460
Good Lord, man.

102
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,880
And all warranted and suitable in different colors and uses, you know, and suitable sizes.

103
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,880
Hey, but there's good news though for Cleveland people.

104
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,880
Good news?

105
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,380
Yeah, there's good news for Cleveland people and we can talk about it because we don't

106
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:50,620
stand for it.

107
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,980
We stand to make a penny off of it.

108
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,820
Good news everyone.

109
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,320
Yeah, the Winter Star Ball.

110
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:54,940
Yes.

111
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,740
Charity event.

112
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,380
Yes.

113
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,020
Is happening in Cleveland with Reverend Baby Bear preaching.

114
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:00,920
Yes.

115
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,100
And I think she'll be kind of early in the evening.

116
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,520
It's at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland on February 12th, I believe, isn't it?

117
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,540
Yes, it's a Sunday night or it's a Sunday, it's a whole day festival.

118
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,420
It starts, I think at 11 in the morning and there are classes, it's free.

119
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,620
They ask for a love donation.

120
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:19,880
Yes.

121
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,800
And you can get a donation, but you don't have to pay.

122
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:30,080
It's just a charity thing for ACE to raise money for to keep the Starwood Festival going.

123
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,360
ACE being the Association of Consciousness Exploration.

124
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,920
Association for Consciousness Exploration.

125
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,820
Have you heard what they intend to do with the old Winter Star site down there in Delroy?

126
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,520
I think the old Winter Star site is a goner.

127
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,180
Well, they sold it to some cult and it wasn't us.

128
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,600
I mean, have you heard what they've done recently with the Lollipop?

129
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:49,600


130
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,760
They've done lawsuits involving gas and mineral rights.

131
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,060
I don't know anything about that.

132
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,780
The whole country's going to be under gas and mineral rights, OSS control bond,

133
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,760
with Schnapp and Stig and Co in there.

134
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:11,780
Hey, speaking of that kind of stuff, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, I got the scariest letter on Monday,

135
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,780
the first day the president went to work.

136
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,640
I got a scary letter on Friday that said, or a phone call that said,

137
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:26,340
our insurance rates on our house here had been rescheduled and that it's going to be more than twice as much.

138
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,460
But on Monday, I got a certified letter and you know those are bad.

139
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,500
They're never good.

140
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,360
No, just the green sticker is enough to make you feel paltry in the L.A.

141
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,460
Well, and this was from the local tax man.

142
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,120
Oh.

143
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,280
And they were saying...

144
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,500
Pink paper.

145
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,420
When...

146
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:54,240
When this was your father's place, it was taxed as agricultural use,

147
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,500
but now you have to prove that it's still agricultural use.

148
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:05,160
I'm like going, now I understand why Pappy had those poor wretched rabbits in that hutch.

149
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,420
I never could understand that.

150
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,620
And the deer feeder that sprayed me with corn every time I tried to fix it.

151
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,480
Well, I did fix it, but it now sprays me with corn every time I approach it.

152
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,220
Get one cow.

153
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,060
Get one cow and two female goats and maybe one male goat.

154
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,080
Oh, I've got...

155
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,460
I've had all kinds of ideas.

156
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,500
And sell cheese in Dallas.

157
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,800
Sell cheese in Dallas.

158
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,800
It's like everybody can do it, supposedly.

159
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:39,840
All you need is a Roosevelt or an Alpine goat and you can make goat cheese and you can sell it to hoity-toity people in the nearest big town like Cleveland or Dallas or New York City.

160
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,280
Well, you know the funny thing is, Dave...

161
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:42,640
Cuddle lamb.

162
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,280
I know.

163
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,360
I actually did look it up.

164
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,200
And you have to have seven cows.

165
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,160
Seven goats for this amount of area.

166
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:49,800
Uh-huh.

167
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,300
And that...

168
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,820
But everyone in life is required seven goats.

169
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,920
Does not Allah understand the firmness of the fruit cakes that we present to it?

170
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,380
I'm sorry.

171
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,880
Well, you know, we have rabbit...

172
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:12,780
I was literally about to start tearing down the dilapidated rabbit hutches out in the deep yard.

173
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,240
Yep.

174
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,080
Just getting ready to...

175
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,460
And I got this certified letter.

176
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,360
It said, oh, we're going to charge you a lot more money unless you can pay for your agricultural.

177
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,020
I'm going, well, it's a monarch butterfly sanctuary.

178
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,660
And it kind of could be.

179
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,060
Yes.

180
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,760
But it's not enough acreage to qualify.

181
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,440
Oh, no.

182
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,800
And I was going, we don't have to raise rabbits.

183
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:40,080
We could raise mermots and meerkats and lemurs and sloths, tree sloths, some kind of exotic animals, you know.

184
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,580
My sister used to have ostriches.

185
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:44,660
But...

186
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,780
Those things are a lot of trouble.

187
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,360
And I don't want to keep an animal in a cage unless it's a bug.

188
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
And I got to thinking I could have a roach farm.

189
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,960
Princess and we produce...

190
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,860
And we and I have more roaches than we know what to do with.

191
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,420
We can produce roaches like you wouldn't believe.

192
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,460
We would propel it, like make the batteries charge from it.

193
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:14,100
Well, and, you know, Bob prophesied in Dateline for Dominance back in the 80s that in the year 2000, everyone would be eating roach crap steaks.

194
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,180
And so I was thinking, you know...

195
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,960
Wasn't that the premise of Stanislaus Lems Futurological Congresses?

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,960
Yes, it was.

197
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,460
The same guy that wrote the one about the star that changed every boy who would think it was reality.

198
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,620
Yeah.

199
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,220
But Lems Futurological Congresses.

200
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,500
Everybody thought they were dining on beautiful steaks when it was actually mouse turds.

201
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,740
Well, Bob said it was going to be a bummer.

202
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,300
And that prediction came true.

203
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,240
So all of his predictions are going to come true.

204
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,300
And that means maybe I should invest in the roach farm.

205
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,160
But another thing he predicted was that teenagers in the future would...

206
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,760
And the future being now or immediate probably tomorrow, would...

207
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:06,560
There would be a fad of wearing broomsticks up your fundament, literally sticking out through a hole in your pants.

208
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,540
And poor kids would...

209
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,280
Wouldn't be able to afford the really good broomsticks.

210
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:18,320
They'd have these splintery ones, but they would hang a lot of heavy jewelry from them.

211
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,320
What a painful concierge you've become over the last few short minutes.

212
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,340
Not me.

213
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,740
This is something Bob predicted.

214
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,480
And I'm thinking, okay, investments.

215
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
You're reporting on them.

216
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,800
We've got to do...

217
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,900
We've got to become like Mr. Green Jeans somewhere or another to get the tax rights now.

218
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,240
Right.

219
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,020
We've only got five acres to do that with.

220
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,420
Right.

221
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,940
We have to be like Ed Geinz and...

222
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,980
Pet rocks.

223
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,260
Pet geese.

224
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,640
Pet rocks.

225
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:43,480
And a farm.

226
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:43,920
And hang...

227
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,880
We've got ants.

228
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,660
And hang around in the garage.

229
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,340
Oh, okay.

230
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,320
We could have an ant farm.

231
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:47,860
We could have...

232
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,660
We've got rocks.

233
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,880
We could sell pet rocks, although that's...

234
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,360
I don't know what the market for those is anymore.

235
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,880
And we have...

236
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,500
They have to glow in the dark to make any dough.

237
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:03,200
If you want to claim them to be Brazilian stalactites, you have to get them to make like a purple or a pink glow.

238
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,800
Wait a minute.

239
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,140
Wait a minute.

240
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,300
I just thought of something.

241
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:06,540
Wait a minute.

242
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,880
I got a new idea.

243
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,360
Okay.

244
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,200
Okay.

245
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,280
You know that we're trying to establish a roadside attraction.

246
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,280


247
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,280


248
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,280


249
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,280


250
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,320
To compete with the Creation Evidence Museum across town.

251
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,320
Yeah.

252
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,740
That we're gonna...

253
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,480
We may call it the Destructionist Evidence Museum.

254
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,180
I don't know.

255
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,740
We've got...

256
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,200
And we've been working with...

257
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,160
We've been moving our skeletons, Dave.

258
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,280
We've been actually...

259
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:40,740
You know, we excavated a devil skeleton, an alien skeleton, and two cave subgenius skeletons.

260
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,040
And we have a cyclops skeleton.

261
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,600
A skeleton kind of scattered around.

262
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,300
We're working on that.

263
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:46,760
It's heavy.

264
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,280
So, we're working on the displays.

265
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,240
And I'm thinking we could become...

266
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,220
We're gonna be having Yankee tourists show up.

267
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Skull farming.

268
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,820
It has to be leaded.

269
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,420
It can't be...

270
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,300
Skull farming.

271
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,000
We could be skull farmers.

272
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:03,980
Yeah.

273
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,160
That's beautiful.

274
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,840
We'd have Yankee tourists showing up, you know, on a whim.

275
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,460
No way...

276
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:09,720
No...

277
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,540
You know, it's like...

278
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,660
You just passed...

279
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,240
You know, it's like the Stang's Roach Ranch.

280
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,620
Ghost fossils.

281
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,380
...where the human flesh can protrude from the underpants.

282
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,920
Man-eating chicken.

283
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,760
Five dollars.

284
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,420
Turn back.

285
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,120
Yeah.

286
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,840
Turn around.

287
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,580
See the...

288
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,780
See the...

289
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,160
See the murder trail.

290
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,600
That was an old vaudeville joke from the 1920s.

291
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,480
Man-eating chicken.

292
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,260
Right.

293
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,320
Well...

294
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,360
It wasn't a chicken that ate humans.

295
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,900
It was a man eating a chicken.

296
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:38,520
Never mind.

297
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:38,780
Right.

298
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,020
But today's post-literate audience, road travelers, don't know that.

299
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,020


300
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,020


301
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,020


302
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,020


303
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,020


304
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,020


305
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,080
They don't know about the gag.

306
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes, but post-literate travelers do understand it because it's already...

307
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,680
Now it's class A.

308
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,860
Well, yeah, because we just said it on the radio, so we gave the gag.

309
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,120
Well, no, we haven't yet.

310
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,420
Yeah, friends.

311
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,260
Well, not blended in Blender.

312
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,460
Not blended, right?

313
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,900
When we have our Abusement Park, the Subgenius Abusement Park open here in Glen Rose, Texas,

314
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,380
we're home of the Safari Park and the fossil ranch and everything.

315
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,600
You can come and see the man-eating chicken.

316
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,260
$5.

317
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,000
One mile.

318
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,620
And the ghost fossils.

319
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,100
Right.

320
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,580
But we could get these...

321
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,340
The tourists come in and we make them kind of sign in or something.

322
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,420
Just this little disclaimer in case the murder well is acting up.

323
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,840
They have to sign the waiver.

324
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,580
Right.

325
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,100
The waiver.

326
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,280
We prod them to see whether anyone knows they're there and how long they're going to be away

327
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,360
from home and where they're going to be.

328
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,360


329
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,360


330
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,360


331
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,360


332
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,360


333
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,360


334
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,360


335
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,360


336
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,360


337
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,360


338
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,360


339
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,360


340
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:40,360


341
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:46,640
And then we farm their skulls.

342
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,280
And you called that videotape as well.

343
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,380
We farm...

344
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,300
You can't call it videotape anymore because it's a different thing entirely.

345
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,840
Can you record somehow?

346
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,100
Can you take that stuff down?

347
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,660
Well, we do that all the time anyway with the drones.

348
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,540
Those are always...

349
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,760
The little bitty drones are always recorded.

350
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,760
It's a pretty crappy picture, but, you know...

351
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,680
Yeah, but not...

352
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,980
Yeah, not the ones from France, the ones littered by Napoleon and the Grand Tsoirs,

353
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:10,360
you know, the ones that were...

354
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,360


355
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,360


356
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,360


357
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,360


358
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,360


359
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,360


360
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,360


361
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,360


362
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:10,920
What?

363
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:21,320
The grand dugeois, like the Templars of the Napoleonic Code used to wear bear skin rugs and argue with each other.

364
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,940
Well, we're ready for them.

365
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,840
Freezing rain.

366
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:24,980
Yeah, bring them on.

367
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,940
I'm looking at a bear skin right now, believe it or not.

368
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,480
Well, a bear head.

369
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,840
When I'm editing this, I'll be looking at a different bear head with a skin attached.

370
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,360
A bear head with bright, shiny, white teeth.

371
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,280
I never thought of that, but that's another thing we could do for the attraction.

372
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,200
The cave bear dance.

373
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,360
We'd reenact.

374
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:50,440
We'd get Dr. Legume to put the bear skin over him, and he'd use this music in the background.

375
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,340
Like King Kong.

376
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:59,620
It'd be like the natives dancing for King Kong to draw his attention to the blonde.

377
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,760
That would be quite spectacular.

378
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,540
Yeah, the mating dance of the cave subgeniuses.

379
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,680
You know, reenactment.

380
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,880
And he would have a big club, and he'd club the cave woman subgenius.

381
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,580
Who would that be?

382
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,000
I don't know.

383
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,100
Oh, she quit the church.

384
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,160
We can't use her.

385
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,540
Oh, well.

386
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,540
Some kind of false impression in his mind.

387
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,020
If not an actual, you know, ingrovement in his brain or area.

388
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,360
That's when you know you've got him, laddie.

389
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,500
When you can see the creases in their brains.

390
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,260
I wonder if you...

391
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,540
I wonder if Texas...

392
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,860
Or the feds or whoever offers a cult use exemption.

393
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,220
Like, I can easily...

394
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,660
Well, we don't actually have any minions out here at all.

395
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,860
We could.

396
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,300
Oh, we could fill it up with minions.

397
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,040
They'd all be dead in a few days.

398
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,460
Snake bites and blinded by cactus spines.

399
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,340
Shot by redheads.

400
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,440
Yeah, well, why don't we tell them that as an experience?

401
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,040
But we could.

402
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,320
We could briefly...

403
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,240
We could have them from Otterstile Inn right in the middle of the whole entire manuscript.

404
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,620
Of course, you know, I can't help but wonder...

405
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:08,740
I saw.

406
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,840
Why I suddenly got these two doubles...

407
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,220
Doubles in amounts we have to pay.

408
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,080
Did they...

409
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,020
Is somewhere in town...

410
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,640
Is there somebody who goes,

411
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,820
There's a cult in town, Sheriff.

412
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,400
But don't worry.

413
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,140
We all know about it.

414
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,920
And we're gonna make it tough on them.

415
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,140
You know, old partner down there at the...

416
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,700
Street office, he's gonna raise the taxes on them.

417
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,420
We gonna double up everything on them.

418
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,820
The road office, he's gonna...

419
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,280
He's gonna change their ag use tax rate.

420
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,420
They won't be...

421
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,280
They're gonna have to run back to Cleveland Heights.

422
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,260
Freeze to death up there.

423
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,160
Well, you could pay them all off.

424
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,100
This is the way things work.

425
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,320
It's a cult.

426
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,740
Usually every place else in the world, you could just, you know, show up with an envelope.

427
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,080
That's the problem.

428
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,040
We don't actually...

429
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,700
This is a pretty low-grade cult, man.

430
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,420
We don't have a single crazy millionaire.

431
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,020
Do you know that?

432
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,580
We almost had one.

433
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,540
But we blew it.

434
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,620
That reminded me.

435
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:13,660
I was gonna tell you that the town where I'm in right now, Howard Hughes, was a big honcho back in the 30s here.

436
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,500
And I remember some of his...

437
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,760
President Howard Hughes.

438
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:26,760
...partner's descendants, his partner's descendants had kids that when they weren't hanging out slumming with the, you know, regular high school and elementary school kids,

439
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:34,120
elementary kid students, that they would be going to some sort of preparatory academy like you and we both went to.

440
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,420
More science high.

441
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,480
We had to pay money to visit the mortuary.

442
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:52,700
But anyway, Howard Hughes and also the makers of the first molded fiberglass were all millionaires minted in this unholy grove of insanity right near here.

443
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:02,360
People are still buried like raisins in their head, you know, in their individual heads and parts of their skulls.

444
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,760
And, you know, I think that's what's really interesting about this.

445
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:04,760


446
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,880
In your town, Dave, have they built any Trump stops?

447
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,880
Well, Trump did appear.

448
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,580
No, I mean the Trump stop convenience store combined with the privately owned prison.

449
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,420
Like where the prisoners have to work to buy their food from the convenience store.

450
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,260
Or anybody else can go in the convenience store.

451
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,740
But Trump stops, yeah.

452
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:32,260
And they live behind the convenience store in a quarried off area where there's a special pond or retainer.

453
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
Well, they're mostly in...

454
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,640
Or a little Billy Swimming Pool or something.

455
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,980
No, no, they're in poor neighborhoods.

456
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,200
Well, I heard about the one in Cleveland Heights.

457
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:47,680
Mr. Sister told us that that big old building used to be, it was a liquor store and it was a blockbuster video and it was a theater and it was all these different things.

458
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,240
And it was empty for a long time.

459
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,760
Well, they tore it down and they're building a Trump stop.

460
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:00,300
And I've heard that those things are going up in pretty much just about every neighborhood, usually in the poor section.

461
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,120
Because that's where they gather the...

462
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,080
People to fill the privately owned prison.

463
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,400
And university areas and stuff where there's, you know, smarty pants, people with glasses, readers.

464
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,500
A lot of experimentation going on behind their backs and in their fronts.

465
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:28,140
You know, it won't be long before, well, let's call them terrorists, play games with those Trump stop signs and switch the words.

466
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,080
They'll switch the words around.

467
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,400
So, you know, the words are reversed.

468
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,740
And then they'll end up in the Trump stop.

469
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,880
It'll only be called Stop Trump for about a day.

470
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:46,680
Then they'll be caught and then they live in the Trump stop for the next seven or eight months, which they have to pay rent for, even though it's a prison.

471
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,420
You know, because they vandalize, they terrorize the Trump stop.

472
00:19:51,520 --> 00:20:02,340
You know, if you're serving 1% as a viable snack for overeaters, for crying out loud, why can't you explode the whole manure tower, or tower city as they like to call it right now.

473
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:10,180
And did you know that Chief Pocahontas' blue corn grave is not too far from the old Erie Street Cemetery?

474
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,300
What?

475
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:11,680
What?

476
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,660
What?

477
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,540
Hey, there's an echo in here.

478
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,020
I forgot his name.

479
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,860
Hey, whatever he's taken, I don't want any.

480
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:23,380
Yeah, really, because my brain is, but he was, oh, corn planter.

481
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,640
Was it corn planter?

482
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:31,740
But a real famous revolutionary of the tribal militias who fought the encroachment of the Euro.

483
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,520
Strangers.

484
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:40,100
He's buried there and people keep on bringing blue corn this far east, just because they do.

485
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,780
They bring blue corn, they bring flowers and other things.

486
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:51,060
Well, didn't President Howard Hughes send the cavalry against that tribe and pretty much wipe them out?

487
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,720
1879, to this day in history, yep.

488
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:55,520
Yep.

489
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,260
It's the anniversary.

490
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,380
President Hughes, the first of the great billionaire megalomaniac.

491
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:01,180
Uh.

492
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,800
OCD, mentally ill presidents.

493
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,220
Yeah.

494
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,200
President Hughes.

495
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,380
The other 400 pounds, Mr. Taft style.

496
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:16,160
Well, there's President Rothschild and President Roosevelt.

497
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,380
President Rockefeller.

498
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,520
President Rockefeller.

499
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:19,980
President Morgan.

500
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,960
President Bilderberg.

501
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,280
Vanderbilt, you know.

502
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,940
President Schicklgruber.

503
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,820
So, yeah, yeah, President Morgan.

504
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,280
I remember all those great.

505
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,760
Insane millionaire despots, dictators, tyrants.

506
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:42,420
They just had an anniversary of where I live around here where there was a great train disaster in the 1870s.

507
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:55,820
And it was in the same year and all these people got died and they couldn't put out the fire because there wasn't company policy because they wanted to keep the tracks clear and let the fire burn out and stuff even if there was human bodies in it.

508
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,400
And I guess Vanderbilt was worth like billions in today's money.

509
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:10,780
He owned the railroad and there was all this stuff and they all committed suicide except for the ones who were really killed by Pinkertons or Wells Fargo guys, whatever they are.

510
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,160
The Pinkertons are often the bad guys in.

511
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,000
Cowboy movies.

512
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,940
Yeah, cowboy movies and shows.

513
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:17,400
Yeah.

514
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,520
In Penny Dreadful, there were Pinkerton bad guys coming all the way from America to arrest the Wolfman in England.

515
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,700
Yeah.

516
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:30,380
In Jim Jarmusch land, even the competitive Austrian ones and stuff.

517
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,020
They're allowed to fight too as long as their feet are big enough.

518
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,820
The Hussians or what are they called?

519
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,740
The Hessians.

520
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,960
Yeah, right.

521
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,000
I couldn't quite get that.

522
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,000
Smelly, big smelly.

523
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,680
The Headless Horseman was one of those.

524
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,780
Yeah, he was a Prussian though.

525
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,880
That's why he gave his boots the order to lick himself clean.

526
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,880
Ah, yes.

527
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,080
Ah, yes.

528
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,360
You know, one thing about Tarzan's radio station, you can drink coffee.

529
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,360


530
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,360


531
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,860
Right at the board.

532
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,600
I got a big old mug of Merc here in a Tinkerbell.

533
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,840
It's my Tinkerbell, my lucky Tinkerbell mug.

534
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,340
If this mug ever shatters, I'll die at that moment or within a day.

535
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,100
Don't say that.

536
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,060
I know that happened to our friend who had the Marvin the Martian mug.

537
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,500
Right.

538
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,400
It broke and he died.

539
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,460
No, he got it.

540
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,680
He got a replacement for the one that broke the day before he died.

541
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,240
Right.

542
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,760
Right.

543
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,260
You can't blame it all on him.

544
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:30,660
You can't blame it on the boss.

545
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,260
So it's okay if this Tinkerbell mug breaks, but I better not get a replacement.

546
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:35,900
Don't get a replacement.

547
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,460
Right.

548
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,100
Well, some of them were actually juicy young children before they strangled their heads

549
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,420
with like they had pus thermometers back then.

550
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,420
They were very, very wicked and extremely insightful.

551
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,760
He said pus thermometers.

552
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,260
Pus thermometers.

553
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,260
That's what I thought he said.

554
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,900
I believe that's what Dave just said, pus thermometers.

555
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:53,720
Yeah.

556
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,760
Yeah, well, it has to do with infarctious disease and rapid encroachment.

557
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:58,480
You know.

558
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,780
I was reading about some kids are so neglected by their emotionally frozen moms that the

559
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:10,520
only time they feel any real tenderness from their mom is when they're sick and she sticks

560
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,900
the pus thermometer in.

561
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,040
Oh, of course.

562
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,800
And that's their idea of love.

563
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,480
And that's why they grow up wanting pus thermometers all the time.

564
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,500
Did you read Psychopathic Journal?

565
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,380
Gross.

566
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:24,700
Extremely gross.

567
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,220
Craft Ebbing.

568
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:26,780
Yes.

569
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,920
I've subscribed to that.

570
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,540
Sure, man.

571
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,540
I get the Coetzee news.

572
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:35,860
That's the Theosophical Journal if you're looking for a felonious assault charge or anything

573
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,800
with academia involved in it.

574
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,820
That's the paper that everybody reads like a rapid evacuate and toilet paper.

575
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,020
Now, which one are you talking about?

576
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,780
The old Soviet humorist.

577
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,680
I forgot what his name was.

578
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,480
Oh.

579
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,340
Oh, no.

580
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,760
I thought you were talking about the Atlas of Sexual Depression.

581
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:56,760


582
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:56,760


583
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,120
The Atlas of Sexual Depression.

584
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,120


585
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,360
Which is a pretty funny read.

586
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,760
I forget even what's the name of that.

587
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,160
We've got a copy of it here.

588
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:11,140
I have read from some of those, not that one, but another book of aberrant sex practices.

589
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:20,580
Some of which are perfectly fun, you know, if you're a subgenius or from New Guinea tribesmen.

590
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,160
Yeah.

591
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,920
Why not both?

592
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,680
Yeah.

593
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,680
What you have to do is you have to like prepare your body with liquid oils.

594
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,760
You have to do it with liquid oils and ointments and stuff.

595
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:34,000
And then you just press the paper, the diagram or the, actually the diaphragm when we're joking

596
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,340
around and stuff like that against the penicillin and stuff.

597
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:41,360
And you actually secrete the sebaceous glands.

598
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,480
You suck the pus right out of the endo-durometer and there you are just like the same as you

599
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,320
started off as.

600
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,820
I like the whistle it makes when you do that.

601
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,000
As it bubbles, the air hissing past the pus.

602
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,660
I think that all the stuff is a little bit of a joke.

603
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:56,660


604
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,780
It's being drawn.

605
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,880
Talk of pus sucking is disgusting.

606
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,840
Well, don't become a, don't, don't get a job at the pus clinic then, hon.

607
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,340
I'm not.

608
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,480
Oh, sure you're not.

609
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:12,820
Like we haven't heard all the news on Facebook and Twitter and any other previous engagement,

610
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,980
like tweets at three o'clock in the morning saying, I'm going to go work at St. Mary's

611
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,040
tomorrow afternoon at six o'clock and I'm going to be there at B square.

612
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,940
And you are.

613
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,720
Okay.

614
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,700
It's vicious, man.

615
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,660
How can they continue?

616
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,440
I'm going to do that stuff to you.

617
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,040
Don't ask me about it.

618
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,120
My father was a lawyer.

619
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,860
He's an actual plutocrat from a planet Pluto.

620
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:33,660
You know what I mean?

621
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,180
Your dad was a loiterer?

622
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:41,040
He was a loiterer and an ingestator of false drugs, which is why they had to throw him

623
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,240
out of the moronic church of San Gabriel mountains.

624
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:54,620
They were all married, you know, pilgrim people, so they used to call them, but none of them

625
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,500
were actually related to any of the people.

626
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,860
We used to train them in law Spider, nieuweouse

627
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:12,280
are in New청 교육 and��르� Usually said, like, But I didn't mind them interested

628
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,580
with any of the Polish legal issues.

629
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,340
Well, oh dear.

630
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:26,040
Oh dear.

631
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,860
Dr. Hal was there.

632
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,480
He's going, Stang, why are you telling me secrets?

633
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,840
This guy we don't even know.

634
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,820
And I go, oh, we know him.

635
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,300
And the guy's like thinking to himself, what's Stang on?

636
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,820
How do they think they know me?

637
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,420
This is my first X day.

638
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,480
Right.

639
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:42,780
Yeah.

640
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,840
It's like, and that used to even happen in Sherman, too.

641
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,380
He's a subgenius who also.

642
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,020
It used to happen years and years ago, even.

643
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,460
Yeah.

644
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:58,860
It was like a monogram activity where these two people who would each think that they knew each other and didn't or did,

645
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,260
but through a totally different circumstance, would hash it out on the comms,

646
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,980
just like the British and the Soviet sex machines, you know.

647
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,600
Then that's how they get the.

648
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:15,120
Spunky, funky, spunky, funky, funky rhythm and so forth.

649
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,240
That was pretty good imitation you did of those.

650
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:20,720
Speaks.

651
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:21,720
Yeah.

652
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,380
I would have thought it was a recording.

653
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,420
Yes.

654
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,160
It is a recording.

655
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,260
Well, it is a recording now.

656
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,960
May not be a good one.

657
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,860
I wouldn't worry about that.

658
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,220
Oh, we don't worry about that.

659
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,560
Who's listening anyway?

660
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,980
A bunch of subgeniuses.

661
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,600
They'll listen to anything, obviously.

662
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,720
You can just tell.

663
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,900
Listen to them listening.

664
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,160
They're listening to this.

665
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,060
Yeah, case closed.

666
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,740
I rest my case.

667
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,440
Why do you think they call them subgeniuses?

668
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,340
Oh, I already used that joke this week.

669
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,220
Well, it never wears thin.

670
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,920
It's like a piece of bad parchment.

671
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,920
We'll be here every Sunday night, folks.

672
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,180
Sorry.

673
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:13,480
Hey, I saw a funny sign as I was driving through the small Texas town.

674
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,760
It was apropos of nothing.

675
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,380
Somebody just had a sign that they could put words on.

676
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,980
So the words they put on it was,

677
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,780
If it crawls, it bites.

678
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,840
If it grows, it sticks.

679
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,600
Yeah.

680
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,940
And at first, I didn't quite understand.

681
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:39,160
And then I went, oh, that describes all the flora and fauna of our beautiful North Texas cross-timbers area here.

682
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,380
Yes, neatly described.

683
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,160
Everything that crawls, bites.

684
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,000
And everything that grows has spines.

685
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,000
And all of them have some form of venom.

686
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,120
It doesn't have to crawl to bite.

687
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,560
If it flies, it bites.

688
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,100
If it swims, it bites.

689
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,500
I think they left a lot of stuff off.

690
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,680
If it crawls, flies, or swims, it bites.

691
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,440
And if it grows or...

692
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:01,680
It bites.

693
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,120
It bites.

694
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,020
Yeah.

695
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,140
Goat heads.

696
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,740
That's because...

697
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,140
Goat heads.

698
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,940
Just like the goat heads of New Hampshire and Vermont and all the Great Lakes region.

699
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:20,360
Did you know that in your adopted homeland, in the Great Lakes region there, near Cleveland,

700
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,100
Cleveland,

701
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,100


702
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,200
there's a whole little baby hill?

703
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,880
It's a solid Ontario quartz crystal.

704
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,060
Isn't that weird, man?

705
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,080
A hill?

706
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:31,920
A baby hill?

707
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,800
I'm leaning into the mic to hear him.

708
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,180
That's a solid quartz crystal.

709
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,000
It doesn't work.

710
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,580
Where is that?

711
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,320
It's near Kirtland.

712
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,880
Not far from Kirtland.

713
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,380
Actually, Thompson.

714
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,560
Thompson.

715
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:47,880
No.

716
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,260
It's in Thompson.

717
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,980
And what are you planning to do?

718
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,860
What are you going to do with this gigantic jewel?

719
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,760
I was going to use it to mine control everybody in the entire Great Lakes region and get as

720
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,200
far south as North Carolina.

721
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,800
That's how they did it in Atlantis until the great crystal inevitably exploded.

722
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,480
Used for evil.

723
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,700
They always end up using it for evil.

724
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,720
And you would too, Dave.

725
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,380
Once you get that great crystal working, you know it's going to go to your head.

726
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,860
You know the power's going to go to your head.

727
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,880
Next thing you know, you'll be building...

728
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,100
You'll be saying, I'm going to build a wall and make them pay for it.

729
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,580
Now give me a billion dollars because I just said that.

730
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,000
And it's true because I said it.

731
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,380
And by the way, that other guy over there, he's a loser.

732
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:31,840
It's sad.

733
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,980
That's when you're supposed to grab your crotch and pull it up and down and stuff like that.

734
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,280
You can just walk right up and grab them by the country.

735
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,240
I used that one two months ago.

736
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,120
Did you really?

737
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,100
I didn't recall.

738
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,100


739
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,100


740
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,540
I don't recall it.

741
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,040
Oh, yes.

742
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,760
I said it more slowly.

743
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,600
I don't recall the commercial in the actual...

744
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,020
Referring to female cats.

745
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,440
Ah, geez.

746
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,780
Shut the front door.

747
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,440
No, I meant our great land.

748
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,000
The home of the...

749
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,060
The mega lab.

750
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:14,380
The first and final of the official reasons for committing tumorous extradition.

751
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:21,100
Actually, I must say, even though the regime has completely changed overnight, it's still

752
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,100


753
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,100


754
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,100


755
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,100


756
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,100


757
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,100


758
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,100


759
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,100


760
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,100


761
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,100


762
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,900
a moment in life of

763
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:23,900


764
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,120
Calm down.

765
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,840
There's no room for doubt.

766
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:42,840


767
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:42,840


768
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:42,840


769
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,600
Something seems more and more obvious to me, and no one really knows about it, because

770
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,080
I couldn't charge from my side.

771
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,080
Why are people trying to determine my side and who I'm actually trying to challenge?

772
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:50,800
Hmm.

773
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,700
for the worst.

774
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,880
Unless we start raising

775
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,640
Dobbsheads.

776
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,640
If we can register this as a

777
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,240
Dobbshead farm, those things

778
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,620
are like rabbits. They just reproduce

779
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,260
out of control.

780
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,740
Thank Misericordium.

781
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,820
Well, with the assistance of a Xerox machine.

782
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,280
Yeah, they proliferate

783
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,080
insanely, Dobbshead do.

784
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,540
If we could get

785
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,520
agriculture

786
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,700
use qualification for

787
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,440
a Dobbshead farm,

788
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,940
or pipes.

789
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,280
I'll help. Pipe farm.

790
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,940
Where can we get

791
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,860
pipe seeds? Because they don't take up that much

792
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,800
room. They're fairly small. They take a long

793
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,460
time to grow.

794
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,700
When you talk about

795
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,900
branding, I think that what you just

796
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,560
said was ideal. We should just

797
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,440
encapsulate the entire whole movement

798
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,980
into one kind of easily

799
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,700
saved spermatozoa

800
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,600
thing. Really? What was it I said

801
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,420
that was good? Well, no, I

802
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,260
forget because I'm all frothed up and everything.

803
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,180
But it was beautiful.

804
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,400
Well, a pipe farmer...

805
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,320
Pipe farmer? No, no.

806
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,220
We could replace all our century

807
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,280
plants with pipe seeds

808
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,460
because they

809
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,460
take about that long to grow. Just a

810
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,520
little six-inch long Dr. Grabow

811
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,980
pipe can take

812
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,040
years. That's right. It was

813
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,460
a Dobbshead. That's

814
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,140
right. That's where we left off.

815
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,100
Yeah, the Dobbshead farm.

816
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,320
Yeah.

817
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,800
They've been growing the Dobbsheads out there.

818
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,420
Look at all the...

819
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,500
All them pipes sticking up out there, catching the sun,

820
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,740
waving in the breeze,

821
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,280
smoking.

822
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,380
When the moon comes out is when they do their

823
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,420
dirty work. You should see them fornicate

824
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,880
like evil, foul creatures.

825
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,540
You saw them so soggy and smelly

826
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,180
like a moist potato or something.

827
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,780
You have to let them run underneath your sink.

828
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,240
Medical jalapeno.

829
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,260
We could make a medical jalapeno farm.

830
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,160
Medicinal jalapeno.

831
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,740
Is that legal in Texas yet?

832
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,200
Because I was thinking, man, we've got

833
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,180
the perfect place to grow medical

834
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:49,980
jalapeno.

835
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,020
Well, if you can get down to...

836
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,340
It's obvious they're waging

837
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,160
warfare on you, Stan.

838
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,840
They're trying to get you out of that house.

839
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,300
They want to divide it up for their own purposes.

840
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,500
Oh, yeah. If they ever

841
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,360
chase us away, I know at that moment

842
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,460
Walmart would suddenly

843
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,160
buy the property we just

844
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:09,620
faked out.

845
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,260
They're thinking about even

846
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,220
hunting camps and things like that.

847
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,980
We've already gotten...

848
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,900
We have a hunting camp here.

849
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,100
Yeah, but they're supposed to pay you

850
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,300
under the system they're going to come up with

851
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,760
once they get rid of you.

852
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:26,940
They'll make all the money from

853
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,880
people coming from Wyoming

854
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,240
to hunt the aboriginal bear species

855
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,520
of Glen Rose, Texas.

856
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,740
Which is a

857
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,460
Willie... a Waylon Nelson song,

858
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,900
not a Willie Channing song,

859
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,340
but a Waylon Nelson...

860
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,300
Never mind.

861
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,740
A Willie Nelson song.

862
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,200
Willie Nelson.

863
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,240
The...

864
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,760
The...

865
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,660
Hey, we could become beekeepers.

866
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,000
We could grow honey.

867
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,060
Actually, that is something that qualifies you.

868
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,400
I did look over a website

869
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,120
real fast just a little while ago.

870
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,520
And beekeepers was one of them.

871
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,440
Doesn't my ex-wife

872
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,500
raise bees?

873
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,580
Now I understand why she raises the bees.

874
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,340
To get...

875
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:11,820
She has beehives

876
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,480
and stuff. The kids were telling me about it.

877
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,880
Plus, you can also get...

878
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,020
I'm proud of my ex-wife.

879
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,540
She led a...

880
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,460
one of those women's marches in Beaumont, Texas.

881
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,700
She organized it herself.

882
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,860
She was on the news.

883
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,360
Yes, my stepdaughter said that she had tried to find one.

884
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,640
I think some of the people that we know,

885
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,360
like Michelle and all the people,

886
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,220
are pretty heroic for actually doing that.

887
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,540
Yeah, everybody's ex-wife was heroic.

888
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,020
Michelle is Chaz's ex-wife.

889
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,600
My mammy didn't go.

890
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,240
My mammy wife didn't go.

891
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:47,180
She's busy talking about how great she was.

892
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,380
Well, my daughter didn't go.

893
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:49,980
Oh, I'm just kidding.

894
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,340
My daughter didn't go on one of those women's marches

895
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,120
because she would have had to take her kids

896
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,580
and she was afraid to take her kids

897
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,780
to a place that might be violent.

898
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,480
Dallas, Texas Women's March,

899
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,000
the day after the inauguration,

900
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,840
or the day of the inauguration.

901
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,580
I don't know that there was riots in the streets or anything.

902
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,800
Did any of them take their shirts off?

903
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,820
That's what I want to know.

904
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,380
Were any of them?

905
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:17,920
Topless.

906
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,680
Oh, I'm such an animal.

907
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,580
I'm such a beast.

908
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,060
Right, right.

909
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,060
One-track mind.

910
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,260
These are very mature protests nowadays, Stang.

911
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,700
Like I said before, they're half male

912
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,440
or whatever the proper proportion is

913
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,400
of males to females on planet Earth.

914
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,740
It's very close to that.

915
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,400
It's mostly women, but by just a hair.

916
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,580
I'm sorry.

917
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,000
Close.

918
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:40,700
Yes.

919
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,960
That must have been his last hair.

920
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,760
I'm sorry to hear that, Dave.

921
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,420
I know you don't have that many left.

922
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,740
I know how it is.

923
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,040
I've only got real long ones,

924
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,640
but there's only seven or eight of them.

925
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,940
But you don't have nearly as many brightly colored dents

926
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,120
in your head as I do.

927
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:57,540
No.

928
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,440
In the bald spots.

929
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,140
No.

930
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,320
And that's how you know you're a real man,

931
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,740
a real macho hombre.

932
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,120
Well, I have what looks like dents,

933
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,320
but they're optical illusions

934
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,280
because they're really just, you know, patches.

935
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,000
Well, nobody's perfect,

936
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,400
except for me.

937
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,660
Except the president.

938
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,240
Now, you know, the women's marches in New York State

939
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,360
could have gone topless.

940
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,320
You just said so three times so you'd remember.

941
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,160
It's legal in New York State,

942
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,940
but it's not the right temperature

943
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,300
to go topless these days.

944
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,160
It's a little chilly.

945
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,600
See, that's a conspiracy for you.

946
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,600
Yeah, let's make it legal for women

947
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,320
in the frozen north to go topless.

948
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,540
There's summertime there.

949
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,220
It's just not, that's not when the march was.

950
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,900
Sex is something you do with a hired person in a hotel room.

951
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:45,900
Yeah.

952
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,920
And don't talk about it.

953
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,960
You know, that's the new,

954
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,060
that's the new,

955
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,580
that's what it says on the new White House website, right?

956
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,320
That they've replaced the transgender page

957
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,700
with the motel room sex page.

958
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,680
And golden showers and the trickle-down theory.

959
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,940
Oh, yeah.

960
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,300
Those jokes, by the time this show gets out,

961
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,620
those jokes are going to be a million years old.

962
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,400
Oh, yeah.

963
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,280
They'll be tremendously millions of years.

964
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,480
Because we're in a dromedary zone

965
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,900
where each 25 seconds or something like that

966
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,360
is the equivalent of a minute's time

967
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,360
of actually, you know, overshoes over time.

968
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,080
We're not that far in the black hole yet.

969
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,520
Yeah, but you have to think of what the incision point is,

970
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,500
where one part goes north

971
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,000
and the other part goes southwest.

972
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,080
Well, the way it is now, I think it's like,

973
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,140
it's for every, say, 10 seconds here,

974
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,320
it's three minutes outside.

975
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:46,680
Right.

976
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,560
That's what I thought, too.

977
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,820
Yeah, it was usually,

978
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,920
well, what you said was a lot more than that.

979
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,700
It was a much bigger discrepancy.

980
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,320
Oh, okay.

981
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,120
Time discrepancy.

982
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,380
Well, I can't exaggerate a little bit.

983
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,380
You can point across,

984
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,300
especially when I'm dealing with hard-to-code faction science.

985
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,420
Well, it's kind of a pointless argument

986
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,600
because the people outside the black hole event horizon,

987
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,660
well, the ones that were there when we went in,

988
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,640
they're all dead now.

989
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,840
And they ain't.

990
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,700
When we come out,

991
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,220
they're underpinned.

992
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:16,380
They're underpinned.

993
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:16,380


994
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:16,380


995
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:16,380


996
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:16,380


997
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:16,380


998
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:16,400
They're underpinned.

999
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,220
There might not even be a human race left.

1000
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:18,560
Yeah.

1001
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,160
Just the people like us that were in the black hole

1002
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,240
during Mr. Rush.

1003
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,380
Yeah, or a dog race.

1004
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:23,840
Right.

1005
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,020
Until the next election

1006
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,240
when we'll come out of the black hole.

1007
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,520
Like zombies with our heads frozen

1008
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,300
and our eyes glistening red in the dark.

1009
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:36,780
But no, really,

1010
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,780
if you want to hide and avoid a long, bad time,

1011
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,340
black hole's the way to do it.

1012
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:42,960
Go in there.

1013
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,860
If five minutes pass for you,

1014
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,400
you come out.

1015
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,160
And it's like 100 years later.

1016
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,740
And it's become either worse or much better.

1017
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,580
Right.

1018
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,620
Go back in the black hole if it got worse

1019
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,780
and wait for it to get better.

1020
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:56,940
Yeah.

1021
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,860
When you finally come out of the black hole

1022
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,980
and it's like Morlocks and Eloy,

1023
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,860
then you know you timed it just right.

1024
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,200
Those Morlocks know how to party.

1025
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,680
And man, they can throw a barbecue

1026
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,200
like you would not believe.

1027
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,660
Yeah.

1028
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,020
If you've never had an Eloy face sandwich,

1029
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,300
boy, you ain't lived in the far,

1030
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:16,780
far future.

1031
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,420
That sounds like the name of a band I almost joined.

1032
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,580
Eloy face sandwich.

1033
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,560
Eloy face sandwich.

1034
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,800
He's trying to be like Charles Madison.

1035
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,560
Wrap your liquor in something good.

1036
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,180
I don't understand.

1037
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,380
Mmm.

1038
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,140
Yum.

1039
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,060
But I could...

1040
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:37,940
Sinterkles.

1041
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,240
That's what they don't have in Holland anymore.

1042
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,500
They have St. Bosco or Aunt Juicy

1043
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,160
or Three Cream Loretta or something.

1044
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:45,840
I don't know.

1045
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,200
These people are just trying to market everything

1046
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,720
but now they've got trumpet on style.

1047
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,280
And that guy's never told the truth in his entire life

1048
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,300
and yet he's got people going,

1049
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,500
they think he's like the new messiah or something.

1050
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,080
Of what?

1051
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,740
I mean...

1052
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,220
It's not the new messiah.

1053
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,580
It's the new-ma-new messiah.

1054
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,100
You're right.

1055
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,140
The new-ma-new messiah.

1056
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,000
Right.

1057
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:07,720
Yeah.

1058
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,120
Yeah, that's about right.

1059
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,920
That does add up.

1060
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,360
Hey, we came up with a new funny name for you, Princess.

1061
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:15,860
Oh, yeah?

1062
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,380
Oh, yeah?

1063
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:16,720
Yeah.

1064
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,700
The phrase I wrote down was,

1065
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,680
my wife is a slack pile.

1066
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:21,860
Yes.

1067
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,820
My wife is a slack pile.

1068
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:26,660
I believe that I sprouted that last night and said,

1069
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,500
I am nothing but a slack pile.

1070
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,980
And you liked it.

1071
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,960
You're a doctor behind it.

1072
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,340
Well, I've been doing a photo essay on our piles,

1073
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,580
our family piles.

1074
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,380
I'm not kidding, by the way.

1075
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,340
I really am working on a photo essay on our family piles.

1076
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:42,240
Don't be disgusting.

1077
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,220
That's guilty.

1078
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,880
I'm talking about piles of...

1079
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,140
You have a dirty mind.

1080
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,940
You're thinking about piles of something else.

1081
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,080
I'm talking about piles of rocks.

1082
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,040
And trees.

1083
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,080
And trees, dead limbs, piles of fence posts.

1084
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:55,600
Yes.

1085
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,260
Piles of bones.

1086
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,120
You have many of those, do you?

1087
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,880
Piles of wild materials.

1088
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,260
Mostly piles of rocks.

1089
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:02,880
Yes.

1090
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:03,700
And trees.

1091
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,540
So you actually have organic material organized...

1092
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:07,880
Sawdust.

1093
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,140
Piles of sawdust.

1094
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,140
Oh, you've got to get rid of that.

1095
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:11,680
I haven't photographed it.

1096
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:12,780
It'll be fine.

1097
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,380
It'll explode.

1098
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:15,740
Yeah.

1099
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:17,140
Yeah, they get hot and explode.

1100
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,260
They're going to start cooking pretty soon.

1101
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,720
If you don't have any rain down there real quick and everything,

1102
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,960
they're going to start cooking pretty soon.

1103
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,560
You can just plunge your hand fiercely like a mighty Viking warrior,

1104
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,560
which is where they got the name for wine mariners,

1105
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,340
or like the Wehrmacht or something.

1106
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,380
Oh, that's what I wanted to write down.

1107
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,680
I almost forgot something about the...

1108
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,660
The other thing about the Morlocks bars,

1109
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,080
their rock and roll is...

1110
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,820
Morlock rock?

1111
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:48,400
Uh-huh.

1112
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,840
Kicks ass.

1113
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,360
Really?

1114
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:50,900
It's great.

1115
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:51,400
Kicks ass?

1116
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:51,920
Yeah.

1117
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:54,120
Morlock hip-hop.

1118
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,260
Yeah, well, you came to kick, so to speak.

1119
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,020
As they speak in modern...

1120
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,680
Morlock death rock.

1121
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:02,760
Yeah.

1122
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,360
They have very strange voices.

1123
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,720
Very soft and sweet and giggly

1124
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:12,740
for such a huge, hulking, blue-skinned, long-haired thing.

1125
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,920
They sing like little girls.

1126
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:15,880
Yeah.

1127
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:16,480
They grunt.

1128
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,860
If they're chasing you, they're all like...

1129
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,920
They're huge, monstrous.

1130
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,980
But when they sing, it's kind of sounding like yes.

1131
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,640
They're like the birds.

1132
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,620
Around the lake.

1133
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:27,680
Yeah.

1134
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,600
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand down.

1135
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,740
Did you hear the echo?

1136
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:34,640
Yes.

1137
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:37,180
With my hearing aid, I heard the little echo in here.

1138
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,140
So we got the opposite of one of those paneled sound studios.

1139
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,840
We're doing this in what might as well be a cave.

1140
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,840
It is full of rocks now.

1141
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:48,720
Yes.

1142
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,600
Have you done any cave paintings yet?

1143
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,700
Or are you just still working on mostly sophomore humor and anal reptilian?

1144
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,180
Oh, I heard the puppy dog.

1145
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:57,740
Well, yeah.

1146
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,780
That's dammit.

1147
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,560
You see?

1148
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,500
In the big echoey cave.

1149
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,260
I'll turn the music off so you can hear that.

1150
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,000
Get him to bark some more.

1151
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,100
Let's torture him.

1152
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:06,940
Come back and sit down.

1153
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,620
See if you can get him to walk on the brown part of the floor.

1154
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,440
He won't do that.

1155
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,980
The dog has some strange autistic...

1156
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:21,760
He will not walk on the new floor here.

1157
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:31,660
About ten years ago, Pappy had the light-colored floor replaced with a dark-colored floor.

1158
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,760
It's like fake wood tile.

1159
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:41,820
It's probably a fake type of wood that's kind of yucky that dogs know about and humans don't know about.

1160
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,820
No, he's just nuts.

1161
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,200
He's just nuts.

1162
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:45,540
No.

1163
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:47,460
Well, you never can tell.

1164
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:51,300
Because my dog had a bunch of similar, especially when he got older,

1165
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,360
he had similar, like, aversions to places and things and stuff.

1166
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,500
And I would find out later, oh, there was a chemical spill there.

1167
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:04,820
Oh, that's where they ran the honor blue spicing, the spicer drills, and the thermometers.

1168
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:12,720
Well, for all I know, the reason dammit won't get in that utility vehicle is that Pappy abused him once in there.

1169
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,560
You know, groped him or something.

1170
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,520
I don't know.

1171
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,120
Now, that's...

1172
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,220
He acts like he's traumatized by that vehicle.

1173
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,320
You hear him over there?

1174
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:20,840
Did you hear that?

1175
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:21,540
He was agreeing.

1176
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:22,460
He's going, that's right.

1177
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,600
Pappy abused me.

1178
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,260
He touched me there.

1179
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,120
He touched me there.

1180
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,680
Actually, he'd love it if somebody would touch in there.

1181
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,540
We have to pay the vet extra to touch in there, actually.

1182
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,980
Because I don't want to use the rubber glove.

1183
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,720
You're causing me damage here right now.

1184
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,000
We're going to have to drag that guy back to Cleveland.

1185
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,100
This giant hound dog.

1186
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,900
I can tell he's dying by the sound of his roof.

1187
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,040
Yeah, yeah.

1188
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,760
He'll bring the roof down all right.

1189
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,260
I can't because...

1190
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:05,380
Yeah, he's like an acrobat on the rugged cliffs around here, but he refuses to go up a staircase.

1191
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,560
And he won't walk on the brown floor.

1192
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,260
We have to have runners all over the house so the dog can get from room to room.

1193
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,100
It's like we're slaves to this.

1194
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,140
He's a big animal.

1195
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:25,700
He also won't walk along a hallway where there's a rail and a room a floor down from him.

1196
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:30,700
Yeah, there's like a balcony, a second floor balcony indoors that looks like...

1197
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,080
That's the same room that you can suck the blood out of the walls.

1198
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,700
Like there's some painting or something.

1199
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,040
Hey, you don't talk about that.

1200
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,000
I'm going to have to cut this part.

1201
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,500
I'm going to have to edit this part out.

1202
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,480
Remind me to do that.

1203
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,460
Don't let me leave this part in the show.

1204
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,180
Because they'll play it back and listen closely to what he said.

1205
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,480
There was a room in your house that like if you moved the painting, you could suck the blood out of the wall.

1206
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,360
We're just going to have to cut that part.

1207
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,860
Why would you want to cut it?

1208
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:03,420
I think it would be entertaining and informative, at least in the very most demeaning way.

1209
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:03,960
It's enlightening.

1210
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:05,760
It's enlightening is what it is.

1211
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:15,140
It helps people understand the inner workings of Stang Ranch, Dockstock Mountain.

1212
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,000
It helps people understand the inner workings of Stang Ranch, Dockstock Mountain.

1213
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:27,460
It makes me want to join the SS or the DD or the FF or the KKK or the PTN or the CIA or the MOSAD.

1214
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:30,020
It makes me want to do a little dance.

1215
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,180
A little folk dance.

1216
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,960
Kicking and skipping and jumping around.

1217
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,420
See, he can't even hear the music and yet he sings right along with it.

1218
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,560
He's singing along with it perfectly.

1219
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,920
I have chimpanzee-like arms and beautiful.

1220
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,040
Beautiful lady's feet which I wear in high heels, but even old.

1221
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:55,220
Of course, sometimes the underpants are larger than me, but I know how to do the job.

1222
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:56,900
Oui, oui.

1223
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,520
Mais oui.

1224
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,480
Mais oui.

1225
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,000
Mais oui.

1226
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:01,560
Mais oui.

1227
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:02,460
Mais oui.

1228
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:02,560
Mais oui.

1229
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:02,740
Mais oui.

1230
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:03,620
Mais oui.

1231
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:03,620


1232
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,580
Hey, man.

1233
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,860
Yeah, we should be playing Texas music.

1234
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:13,360
I've got a cassette over there of Sons of the Pioneers.

1235
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,580
Oh, really?

1236
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:14,880
Yeah.

1237
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,380
I love that.

1238
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,040
Well, my dad left all kinds of cool stuff around here.

1239
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:27,240
Most of them he bought CDs to replace his old cassettes, which he had bought to replace the LPs, which I still have.

1240
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,540
Well, I bet I would be better.

1241
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,660
Marty Robbins, Hank Snow, Hank Williams, all them Hanks.

1242
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,640
He had all the Hanks.

1243
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,600
See, with today's vinyl revival, you could make some dough.

1244
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:52,460
Or you could at least put them in a very special place where you've, you know, got them on CD, but they're stored in like a liquid container.

1245
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,660
One in Detroit or Mount St. Helens.

1246
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,260
What is it?

1247
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:02,600
That town that, yeah, one in Detroit I would go to.

1248
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,660
What's the name of Reverend Angry Larry's store?

1249
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,340
It's so obvious.

1250
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,000
It's right in the name of my tongue.

1251
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,580
Now I'm going to have to edit that back in.

1252
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:13,800
Again.

1253
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:14,840
Wordsville.

1254
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:15,480
Wordsville.

1255
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:16,120
Yeah, of course.

1256
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,020
Wordsville Records.

1257
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,320
Wordsville Records.

1258
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,000
God, how could we?

1259
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,040
We've been there.

1260
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,640
It's my name, for goodness sake.

1261
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:23,820
Yeah, right.

1262
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,580
Yeah, Weardsville.

1263
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,080
Yeah, Weardsville.

1264
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:29,800
Records in Detroit.

1265
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:35,400
My book are many, many mentions of Wordsville, which, you know.

1266
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,020
That actually, God, how could we forget that even for a second?

1267
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:39,500
You know why?

1268
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,200
It's the only, what do they call it?

1269
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,560
Feet on the...

1270
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,740
Feet on the ground store that sells subgenius ministerships.

1271
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:47,360
Brick and mortar.

1272
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,580
Yeah, it's the only...

1273
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:49,780
Brick and mortar.

1274
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:50,460
Yeah.

1275
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,000
Yeah.

1276
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,280
Store in the whole world that sells subgenius membership.

1277
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:56,720
Ordinement kits.

1278
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:06,440
Well, see now, it's already, you're already like marketing two different brands because in the book that we're, that you're doing of my book in there.

1279
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:06,960
Yeah.

1280
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:13,040
I mentioned Weirdsville is a place where the weirds live and we know that it's an actual location now.

1281
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,600
At least you can smell it sometimes.

1282
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:15,460
You know what I'm saying?

1283
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,320
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

1284
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:25,000
Well, I just think that Angry Larry named his store after that, even though he had never heard of it.

1285
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:26,500
Yeah.

1286
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,380
Yeah, he named it after your book he hadn't read.

1287
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,080
Right.

1288
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:29,780
Yeah.

1289
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,180
It was later, but you know, the book is over 30 years old.

1290
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:34,580
So...

1291
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,800
Well, and if you go to Weirdsville Records, you get the autograph of Reverend Angry Larry.

1292
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,200
Well, he used to get my autograph and a piece of his.

1293
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,020
And a piece of his.

1294
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:43,020


1295
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:47,040
And a piece of his consignment piece along with three bags of thunder pants.

1296
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:47,860
Right.

1297
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:48,820
There you go.

1298
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,280
See, it's a good deal for all around.

1299
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:52,540
All around.

1300
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:53,700
Yeah.

1301
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:54,820
Prosperity.

1302
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,300
See, prosperity has returned to America.

1303
00:51:58,300 --> 00:51:58,820
Yeah.

1304
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,360
We'll get all the working classes.

1305
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,400
We'll build them up again the way we want to.

1306
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:08,740
We'll have one half of the country staring at the other half of the country in a menacing gesture.

1307
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:12,580
Well.

1308
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:13,200
I don't know why.

1309
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:18,200
I'm glad people aren't as mean in real life as they are on the internet.

1310
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:25,200
You know, because sometimes these, like, I sometimes think after having a chat with someone,

1311
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:32,540
you know, in town at the post office or the store or whatnot, that they go home and I

1312
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:36,980
go home and say horrible, nasty things to each other anonymously on the internet.

1313
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:42,020
We don't know that that's the, you know, that I'm the libtard that he hates so much and

1314
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,480
he's the right tard that I hate so much on the internet.

1315
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,100
Not that I actually get into those kind of things, but a lot of people do.

1316
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,500
I do not use the internet that way.

1317
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:58,720
I use this radio show that way because it's a one-way street and those right tards can

1318
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,100
just simmer and go, I'm going to change the channel.

1319
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,520
I'm sick of this Bob stuff.

1320
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,600
I didn't know it was supposed to be libtards.

1321
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,560
I thought pinks.

1322
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,220
I thought, I know they hated pinks.

1323
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:11,240
I figured that meant queers and sissies, communists and stuff.

1324
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:15,960
Not people with white-colored pink skin and silly pink brains.

1325
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,380
Actually, it's not people with white-colored pink skin.

1326
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:20,560
It's people with pink attitudes.

1327
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:26,120
Anyone can be a pink, a simpering, cowardly pink.

1328
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:40,380
The pink considered a pink crawling along, whipped, abject, worshipping his boss, hoping

1329
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,920
to stay at work.

1330
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,220
Work longer so he won't have to go home to his pink, pink family.

1331
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,980
Pity the poor pink boy.

1332
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:04,600
Well, but you wouldn't be afraid to talk to me behind some internet screen.

1333
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,000
No, you just...

1334
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,260
No, it makes you quite brave.

1335
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,740
It makes you as bold as balls.

1336
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,560
So brave.

1337
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,820
Oh, people.

1338
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,300
People are so brave on the internet.

1339
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:13,860
I'm stupid.

1340
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,360
That's when their teeth start to hurt.

1341
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,980
You can tell, like, I'm stupid.

1342
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,380
I don't know, man.

1343
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,440
It bothers me sometimes.

1344
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,260
Nobody says, I'm stupid.

1345
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:25,840
They all say, you're stupid.

1346
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,720
And then they spell the word stupid wrong.

1347
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:31,160
And they use the wrong form of you're.

1348
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:36,820
And think of all the time that that puts you through wondering how people can be so stupid

1349
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:40,020
in today's modern America and why these days.

1350
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:40,760
Phenomenon.

1351
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,840
And then what's worse is...

1352
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,760
Then you go and do something just as stupid.

1353
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,160
Or I do, anyway.

1354
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,220
Well, you're saying...

1355
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:51,400
Just when I'm thinking somebody else is so stupid, then I do something so stupid.

1356
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,640
Like, pay attention to them, for one thing.

1357
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:01,260
Well, is it the responsibility of the medium or the argument or the artistic endeavor?

1358
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,480
Or what's, you know, what's up with that?

1359
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:09,940
Well, I had an obnoxious friend who thought that the reason that he couldn't get along with people

1360
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:10,480
was because...

1361
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,280
It was the internet.

1362
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,820
And it's not just the internet.

1363
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,000
It was Usenet.

1364
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,060
The old part of the internet was made people bad.

1365
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,580
Mm-hmm.

1366
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,740
I understand that.

1367
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,320
But it was just...

1368
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:31,820
I think it was actually that this particular individual had outlived his stay on that part of the internet.

1369
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:38,480
And just one too many people had kind of blown him off.

1370
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,280
It's a rough world out there.

1371
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:40,840
It's tough.

1372
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:41,540
It is.

1373
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,020
It's getting even rougher, too.

1374
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:47,880
I've lowered his Livermore Laboratory for all he knew.

1375
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:48,360
He's old.

1376
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,180
Yeah.

1377
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:49,800
Huh?

1378
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:50,820
Yeah.

1379
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:51,840
Yeah.

1380
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,160
Yeah, I don't know about this internet.

1381
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,380
It was supposed to be so...

1382
00:55:55,380 --> 00:56:03,220
It was really wonderful for when no one but smarty pantses knew what the heck it was.

1383
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,840
I didn't know what it was for the first 10, 15 years it was around.

1384
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,840
Couldn't understand what they were talking about.

1385
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,080
Philo.

1386
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,080
He was on the internet.

1387
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:17,720
I was on the internet.

1388
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:17,720


1389
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,680
And I was like, I'm gonna go to the internet.

1390
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:18,680


1391
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:18,680


1392
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:18,680


1393
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:18,680


1394
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,940
And then the scales fell from my eyes.

1395
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,240
And I was paying AOL a buck a minute for a week or two.

1396
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:27,740
Then I learned how to do it under the hood.

1397
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,340
Because I couldn't afford the early internet.

1398
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,980
So I switched over to Usenet.

1399
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:33,740
The basement.

1400
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,120
Cleveland Freenet, in fact.

1401
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,080
Yes.

1402
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,200
One of the earliest branches.

1403
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:40,600
One of the first ones.

1404
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,360
The ones, yes.

1405
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,240
Yeah, those were the days.

1406
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,660
It was an outlaw world.

1407
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:46,160
It was free.

1408
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:52,080
And I remember thinking, this is going to change everything, but in about 15 years, it's going to turn into television.

1409
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,800
And it did.

1410
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:54,880
And it did.

1411
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:55,580
It did.

1412
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:55,840
That's the problem.

1413
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:56,820
It turned into it.

1414
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:01,240
But, I mean, television has vastly caused more corruptigation of the brain.

1415
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,700
It's really bad stuff.

1416
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,360
I think the Internet has caused more bad stuff than television did.

1417
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,180
More ignorance.

1418
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:14,400
Because you can find any stupid thing validated by a million other ignorant people.

1419
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,660
And it wasn't that way before.

1420
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,000
Nope.

1421
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:18,740
Never was.

1422
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:29,620
You had to, in order to have your idiotic ideas validated, you had to go to special bookstores frequented by creepy people in long raincoats.

1423
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:33,780
That's right.

1424
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,620
Yeah, if you wanted to find your kook literature, you had to go to kook stores.

1425
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:41,280
Or, at the very least, the occult section of the used bookstore.

1426
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,040
Yes.

1427
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:48,620
But now, oh, I get all my news from Twitter and Tweeter and Pitter and Patter and all my friends.

1428
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,980
Look at this terrible, look at this awful article from this news source called The Onion.

1429
00:57:56,180 --> 00:58:04,020
It says here that they've got an abortion mall where you go and just have abortions all day long in a big shopping mall.

1430
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:08,040
That humor article was passed around.

1431
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,160
It was fact about 20 years ago.

1432
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:11,900
And now look.

1433
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,640
Yeah, also the idea of welfare queen.

1434
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,820
Now they really do have abortion malls.

1435
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:17,900
If only.

1436
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:22,980
That would be kind of interesting and strange and horrifying, nightmarish.

1437
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:28,200
Yeah, but it's one of those made-up icons that never existed, like a welfare queen.

1438
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,340
It turns out that was a big bunch of BS.

1439
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:37,360
And it was, well, this woman in St. Louis who had seven children decided not to go to work one day.

1440
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,100
Because, you know.

1441
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,860
She could get money from Uncle Don.

1442
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:46,300
Well, and it turned out that all those people that Hillary Clinton murdered with her bare hands, none of those stories were true.

1443
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,040
Isn't that weird?

1444
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:48,940
Can you believe it?

1445
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:57,000
I thought all that time, I thought that she had had that murder den and, you know, had kidnapped all those prostitutes and tortured them.

1446
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,580
And it turned out that she didn't do any.

1447
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,180
She hadn't even been accused.

1448
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,420
She hadn't been convicted of any crime.

1449
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,700
I don't think she's even been sued.

1450
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:07,800
Lock her up.

1451
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:08,840
Lock her up.

1452
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:20,060
My song that I'm writing right now, that I'm trying to get finished as quickly as possibly can, is going to have, is going to have, believe me, believe me, believe me.

1453
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:22,120
Trust me, trust me, trust me.

1454
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,460
Because as you know, if you say something three times, people will believe it.

1455
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,240
That's marketing theory.

1456
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,480
Price Bob, Price Bob, Price Bob.

1457
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:33,940
Oh, that's not something you believe.

1458
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,560
I don't really want everybody to believe that anyway.

1459
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:37,760
No.

1460
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,000


1461
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,080


1462
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,080


1463
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,080


1464
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,080


1465
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,080


1466
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,080


1467
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,080


1468
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,080


1469
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,080


1470
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,080


1471
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,080


1472
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,080


1473
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,900
Well, say that three times.

1474
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:44,920
Somebody once accused us of being elitists, as if that was an accusation.

1475
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,560
It's like, duh.

1476
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,100
We're the ultimate elitists.

1477
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,040
We're the most elite people on the planet.

1478
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:55,060
We're the people that sent 35 bucks to J.R. Bob Dobbs, I'll have you know.

1479
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,500
That's pretty damn elite.

1480
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:59,720
That's only like .01% of the population.

1481
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,660
And they can parachute, too.

1482
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,820
We have innate and inordinate skills.

1483
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:06,760
Innate.

1484
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:07,660
Parachuting.

1485
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,640
Underwater scuba fighting.

1486
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:12,340
Ninja materials and so forth.

1487
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,060
Only it's all on a mental plane.

1488
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:17,580
But I don't know how stupid you'd have to be to go there all the time.

1489
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:21,400
But they put it up like all a habeas corpus, you know.

1490
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:26,880
And then right next to the docket number, it said case number 12759.

1491
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,380
Stang goes nuts.

1492
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,240
Strangles weeds.

1493
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,800
Weed shoots stang in foot.

1494
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,360
Stang collapses in a pile of manure.

1495
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,040
Well, but one thing we can be glad about.

1496
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,020
We now know that.

1497
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:46,380
That any boy can grow up to be president no matter how ignorant, foolish, and insane he is.

1498
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,000
If his daddy is rich enough.

1499
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,800
Any boy can grow up to be president.

1500
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,540
Any idiot can grow up to be president.

1501
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,100
Take care of yourself.

1502
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,640
We'll get a million more if not.

1503
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,260
You're cut off for a week.

1504
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,480
And half the people will vote for it.

1505
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,060
Well, just a little under half of the voters.

1506
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,380
The more smug the idiot.

1507
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:07,060
A billionaire populist.

1508
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:08,460
Right.

1509
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:09,160
There you go.

1510
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:09,620
That's it.

1511
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:13,000
It's a world of oxymorons now.

1512
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,900
And I don't mean subgeniuses neither.

1513
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,680
Or fetal alcohol syndrome.

1514
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,800
Although that probably has a lot to do with it.

1515
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:23,860
Or jumbo shrimp.

1516
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:24,660
Yeah.

1517
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,600
We have to end the show now.

1518
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:33,160
Or at least we have to do the stuff that we say at the end of the show in case we're near the hour.

1519
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,860
Because it's like this thing says 103.

1520
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,880
But we didn't start immediately.

1521
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:39,060
When I recorded.

1522
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:39,720
Yeah.

1523
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,420
So, friends.

1524
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,820
You're listening to Hour of Slack number 1,607.

1525
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:56,520
And you can get more information about everything from subgenius.com.

1526
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:58,920
Percolate and tickles ink.

1527
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,800
You can write to our post office box in Cleveland.

1528
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,240
Or our post office box in Texas.

1529
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:07,920
Right.

1530
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:13,080
In the wintertime and early spring, it's in Texas.

1531
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:17,820
In the blistering summer, it's in Cleveland Heights.

1532
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,560
But I don't know how much longer we can do that.

1533
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,560
At subgenius.com.

1534
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:28,120
What a brilliant PSA and runaway slot for the naked.

1535
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:37,520
Those few among us who have to reach out and pull that same old fanny whistle every afternoon at 345 p.m.

1536
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:37,860
You know?

1537
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:42,220
It's like, God, we're like a scientist or something.

1538
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,480
Shall we give those P.O. box numbers or?

1539
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:46,820
Yeah.

1540
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:49,240
Oh, okay.

1541
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:50,260
Right.

1542
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,880
I didn't do the P.O. box number.

1543
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:53,420
Okay.

1544
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,260
P.O. box 807.

1545
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:59,680
Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1546
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,360
Or in Cleveland Heights area.

1547
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,200
Which is sort of like Cleveland.

1548
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,500
But higher.

1549
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:08,000
But higher.

1550
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,000


1551
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,000


1552
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,000


1553
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,000


1554
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,000


1555
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,000


1556
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,000


1557
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,000


1558
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,000


1559
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,000


1560
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,000


1561
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:11,420
Most office box 181417.

1562
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,740
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1563
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:20,880
And that's the end of this show.

1564
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:25,320
But now is the part where we do the internet only ad.

1565
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:28,360
Oh, the special internet ad.

1566
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:29,380
Well.

1567
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,740
This is an advertisement right now?

1568
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:38,000
Well, yeah, because there's a lot of people that just don't understand that we're not kidding about this.

1569
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,420
This subgenius ordainment kit that we sell.

1570
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,080
It really does ordain you as an ordained minister.

1571
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:47,420
And if not, then.

1572
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,200
I have gained personal pleasures from it.

1573
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:49,260
Huh?

1574
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:49,660
What?

1575
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,420
I have gained personal pleasures from it.

1576
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,700
And privilege is beyond my wildest orgasm.

1577
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,920
Well, yeah, come to think of it, Dave.

1578
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:00,160
What was it now?

1579
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:04,360
26 years ago or no, 16 years ago.

1580
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,500
Lonesome cowboy Dave married you and me, Princess.

1581
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Using his subgenius ministership.

1582
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:10,900
Yes.

1583
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:15,520
And I was able to get on your health insurance at that moment.

1584
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:17,480
Yes, thanks to Dave marrying us.

1585
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,540
That was a secret marriage.

1586
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,780
Only the insurance company knew about that.

1587
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,980
And we had a public marriage about two years later.

1588
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,040
About one year later.

1589
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:30,160
There was like people putting champagne bottles in their rectums and stuff like that.

1590
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:33,400
And here's to the bride and the one guy had a gun.

1591
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:33,980
No, no.

1592
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:37,980
You're thinking of Reverend 808 and Giggle Puss's wedding in New York.

1593
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:42,800
I thought Reverend Adolf Hitler was what you were going to say at first.

1594
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,820
But everybody knows he didn't have that kind of thing.

1595
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:45,360
No.

1596
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:45,920
Oh, man.

1597
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,600
There was an incredible daisy chain at the 808 and Giggle Puss's wedding.

1598
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,500
And it got so frenzied, the power went off.

1599
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,620
It like blew a fuse.

1600
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:01,560
The orgasmic radiation actually blew the power fuses in the building.

1601
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:02,020
Yes, it did.

1602
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:02,760
Just by rays.

1603
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:04,120
Just by their rays.

1604
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:05,700
That was an amazing.

1605
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:06,460
Anyway, friends.

1606
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:14,380
Friends, if you get online or send in your 35 bucks that we can't talk about on the college radio stations,

1607
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:19,740
well, you get to do that kind of crazy stuff.

1608
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:21,540
You get to be the preacher at the marriage.

1609
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,800
Or you can come to X Day and actually get married.

1610
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:26,340
We've had a wedding at almost every X Day.

1611
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,580
Sometimes two.

1612
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,720
Sometimes they're actually human beings marrying each other.

1613
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,180
Twice.

1614
01:05:32,180 --> 01:05:32,760
They're special.

1615
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,880
Twice we've had weddings at X Day where.

1616
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:43,720
The couple had gotten married before as regular man and woman with their families.

1617
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:47,220
But they came to X Day to get married as woman and woman.

1618
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:48,380
Or man and man.

1619
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:48,920
Right.

1620
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:58,500
So, you know, it's like one was wearing a groom costume and one wearing a bride costume at their family wedding.

1621
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:02,380
But then they're both wearing brides costumes at the X Day wedding.

1622
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,360
Subgenius.

1623
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:05,020
You know, as Bob said, friend.

1624
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,800
Watch two girls making it.

1625
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,560
I'd rather be two girls making it.

1626
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:19,100
I think that that line is what made the transgender type.

1627
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,020
The X Day was a little septangular.

1628
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,080
What are you talking about?

1629
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:27,440
I'm just wondering if you didn't perhaps find it a little septangular.

1630
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,360
A little sexy.

1631
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,180
A little, sure.

1632
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:31,860
It's like, isn't it?

1633
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:35,000
I think that that line about being two girls making it.

1634
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:35,000


1635
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:43,040
I think that's the line that makes the transgender people know, hey, they understand.

1636
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:44,060
Right.

1637
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:46,320
And they'd be right.

1638
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,100
I'm home.

1639
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:47,880
They actually would be.

1640
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,240
I'm home.

1641
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:49,960
I wouldn't go that far.

1642
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:50,700
No.

1643
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,300
I wouldn't go that far.

1644
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,800
Church of the Subgenius is not your home.

1645
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:01,600
It's not going to take care of you in your old age.

1646
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,280
And it's not going to.

1647
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,920
Well, it will tell you you're right even when you're wrong.

1648
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:07,540
That's what old Bob will do for you.

1649
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,180
You've got an excuse for everything.

1650
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:13,580
You'll have a big doctorate on your wall and a giant frameable excuse.

1651
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,260
So many doctors and lawyers have those.

1652
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:21,220
That comes with your $35 membership kit along with the usual thing.

1653
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:29,340
Vinyl, not paper, bumper stickers, Bob sticker, propaganda of all kinds to help you propagandize.

1654
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:31,400
Decoder pin.

1655
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:37,640
You have to decode how to use it as a decoder pin because it appears to just be a membership,

1656
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,760
you know, Bob pin.

1657
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:41,140
Well, it's worth the effort.

1658
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:46,620
At least to those people involved in scientific inquiry and mining and natural resources.

1659
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:53,600
As you know, the king of Ogwurt, Jack, who is now in a Philadelphia hospital for the

1660
01:07:53,600 --> 01:08:01,380
meddling depraved, has ordered all of his columns of his fifth columnists into the steel

1661
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:01,380


1662
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:02,660
of extraordinary behavior.

1663
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:06,320
We are in some deep doo-doo right now.

1664
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:07,200
Hmm.

1665
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,200
Well, you know.

1666
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,860
What does that have to do with your subgenius membership act?

1667
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,500
Oh, that's right.

1668
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,520
It protects you from such occurrences.

1669
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:18,820
I guess that's what it says.

1670
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,240
Yeah, Bob's a lucky talisman that will keep you out of the patriot camps.

1671
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:29,440
Although you might not want to actually use the bumper sticker on your car if you want to stay out of the patriot camps.

1672
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:35,880
Or the drug camps or any of the other camps that they think Bob is a bad flag, red flag.

1673
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,360
That's actually true.

1674
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:49,680
The New Jersey Turnpike Authority, for one, had the picture of Bob in their handbook of suspicious bumper sticker type elements.

1675
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:57,440
And the Cleveland police were informed in a slideshow that Bob was a gang symbol that

1676
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:59,420
meant Bob is what?

1677
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:00,200
Watching you.

1678
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,100
Now, whatever the...

1679
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:02,480
It does mean that, but...

1680
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:03,580
Gang?

1681
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:04,840
No, we're a cult.

1682
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:06,420
They can't...

1683
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,760
Police can't even tell the difference between a cult and a gang.

1684
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:10,500
A cult hides...

1685
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,900
Our initiations are totally different.

1686
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:12,600
...a gang advertiser.

1687
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,820
Like, that's the data.

1688
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:20,340
It's like, you don't have to, like, drive up and kill a pink person to join our gang.

1689
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,500
You have to convert one.

1690
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:23,520
Well, you can with a squirt gun.

1691
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:23,940
You convert them.

1692
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:24,860
A drive-by with a squirt gun.

1693
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,240
Ugh.

1694
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:29,000
Gangs.

1695
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:29,200
Yeah.

1696
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:29,400


1697
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:29,400


1698
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:30,360
The church...

1699
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:31,900
Yeah, the gang of the subgenius.

1700
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:32,400
Oh, that...

1701
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,860
As Dr. Leguien pointed out...

1702
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:36,160
Yeah, and all of our special handshakes.

1703
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,340
We don't have any special handshakes.

1704
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:43,300
At least, I have my hands just shaking just because I'm around, you know, my artificial

1705
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:43,940
lens.

1706
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:48,120
But if I'm kept in an impure environment, I'm gonna go...

1707
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,760
Well, most of the...

1708
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:57,660
...most of the subgeniuses are really not that scary, like gang members.

1709
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,640
I recall...

1710
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:05,960
I saw Dr. Leguien inform a cop who's leading a brigade of other cops...

1711
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,420
Oh, I actually asked the cop a question.

1712
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:08,480
He goes, look at these people.

1713
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,060
Do they really look dangerous to you?

1714
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:16,220
And the cop goes, hmm, come to think of it...

1715
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:22,140
And Leguien goes, this all has to do with that Ken Reeves guy, the ex-mayor.

1716
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:26,940
And instantly, the cops were our friends and provided floodlights and microphones.

1717
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:27,640
Yes.

1718
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:34,240
As we did our devival on the steps of the Baptist church because we'd been kicked out

1719
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:40,760
of the Middle East Club because Papa Joe Mama had done a prank on NPR by calling into an

1720
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,240
NPR show and said that...

1721
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,700
The subgenius called.

1722
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:48,640
They're gonna have a devival that I'm starring in at the Middle East Club in Boston.

1723
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,180
And they were involved in the Columbine slaying.

1724
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,300
So everybody knows that.

1725
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:55,180
And somehow that prank got...

1726
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,820
The NPR host...

1727
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,940
I think we know about Church of the Subgenius.

1728
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:00,400
Thank you.

1729
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:00,980
That was a hoax.

1730
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,080
But somebody told...

1731
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,400
Fake news is what it was.

1732
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:11,980
Well, it was fake news enough that some do-gooder called his friend, the ex-mayor of Cambridge,

1733
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:20,760
and had him call the bar and shut down our show that Friday Jones had spent about $1,000 on.

1734
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:26,560
And of all people, who took us in and let us use their facility?

1735
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:27,820
The Baptist church.

1736
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:28,780
The Baptist church.

1737
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,800
Now, these were the real good guy Baptists, right?

1738
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,100
That they had Unitarian meetings in the Baptist church or something?

1739
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:36,500
This was the Baptist church that Titus Andromedus goes to.

1740
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:39,580
In fact, I met Titus Andromedus there.

1741
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,000
This is the community supportive Baptist church.

1742
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:53,940
In Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Baptist church is full of flaming queens and cross-dressers of all kinds.

1743
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,800
It was really a different type of church.

1744
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:56,800


1745
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,760
It was not what you'd call a Southern Baptist church.

1746
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:01,680
No, super good guy Baptist church.

1747
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,820
Well, I wouldn't go that far either.

1748
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:04,580
I would.

1749
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,960
I'd like to see them put in a gymnasium and then...

1750
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,460
They allowed us...

1751
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:09,200
...put each other out.

1752
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:14,460
So, like, you've got the homosexual Baptist and you've got the Southern cross Baptist,

1753
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:22,040
you know, just beating the living hell out of each other with Bibles and snakes and other religious armatures and stuff.

1754
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,280
Snakes, yeah.

1755
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:24,780
Wouldn't you like to see such a thing?

1756
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,700
Yeah, they're whipping each other with snakes.

1757
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,560
The snake handlers would be whipping the...

1758
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,460
Yeah, yeah, whipping each other with snakes.

1759
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,980
...the homosexuals with snakes.

1760
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:32,640
And what would the...

1761
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,700
Oh, I know what the homosexuals would be whipping the snake handlers with.

1762
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:37,800
Yeah.

1763
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:42,820
I know those snake handlers would not like you be whipping anybody with a snake.

1764
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:46,100
Or sniffing them with the, you know, like with the armpit spray.

1765
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:47,660
They didn't mean a snake.

1766
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,760
But I don't know where this is going.

1767
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,000
Actually, I do.

1768
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:56,440
And I'm going to put a stop to it right now.

1769
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:56,780
Okay.

1770
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,260
In the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs and the listeners' eardrums.

1771
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:03,480
Are you going to press the stopper all the way in?

1772
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,540
The stopper will invite him.

1773
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:09,100
All the way in.

1774
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:11,140
Oh.

1775
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,880
I don't know if I've ever done that at the end of the show.

1776
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,240
All the way in.

1777
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:18,240
Press the stopper all the way in.

1778
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:18,500
All the way in.

1779
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,240
Nearby corrected.

1780
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,000
I wonder what that...

1781
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:21,760
I'm going to try it.

1782
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:22,220
Okay.

1783
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,040
Here goes.

1784
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:23,680
I'm pushing.

1785
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:24,680
I'm pushing.

1786
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,880
I'm pushing.

1787
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:31,000
I'm pressing the Lord for Bob.

1788
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:36,360
The Lord is so juicy and for screaming.

1789
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:42,080
Well, we'll have to insert a soundtrack, sound effect there.

1790
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:43,480
The Lord...

1791
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,360
The Lord Bob...

1792
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:51,140
The...

1793
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:51,860
The...

1794
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:59,020
The Lord Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob

1795
01:13:59,020 --> 01:13:59,040
Wow.

1796
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:00,300
I see it.

1797
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:03,620
There's more than vision here in this part of town.

1798
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:08,260
Well, I guess we did about a show and a half.

1799
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,320
I guess we did do about a show and a half.

1800
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:10,580
Mm.
