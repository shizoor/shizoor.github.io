Everything's going fine.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:09,640
Are We Recording?

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,540
Recording

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,980
Everything's going fine.

6
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,120
recording everything's going fine everything's going

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,080
hey if you don't call it jane's gonna hear no music now you want to all go home or what

8
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,620
the

9
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:11,720
so we're gonna build this radio with this instruction right now yeah

10
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:11,860
yeah

11
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,280
here's a guy looks like house your brother

12
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,940
well that's it for the radio jack and or something no it's a little piano flights

13
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,720
of five and you get the little screwdriver

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,920
Wow computer people don't do that they'll get out your crew don't get a

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,600
screwdriver with your computer the crystal station music and speech are

16
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,360
rolled up by a microphone which turns the sounds into a little hook it up with

17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,500
radio wire and respond exactly to the pattern of the original sound

18
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,620
I'm okay I don't have my radio station ultra-transmitter another electric

19
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:53,120
current is being produced by a device called an oscillator this current known

20
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:59,600
as ancient old old continually changes in the direction of low hip bone it

21
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,100
follows in one direction is about a million technology it could be said to

22
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:11,260
have a frequency of about a million or a megahertz it's in here and you have to

23
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:11,640
make it

24
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,560
also at the trance of man in this town poll

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,660
the old year combined for the AC from the oscillator the fact that the

26
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,500
conspiracy continually pushes false slack in your face means that somewhere

27
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,720
in the world there is real slack now how do you find your own slack it's so easy

28
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,540
you follow the path of least resistance that's what Bob does he serves the luck

29
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,040
plane

30
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,760
like if you ever had luck luck luck is a physical particles and you can attract

31
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,820
those like a magnet if you were Bob Bob left a legacy of lifelong ministry to

32
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,980
students as former president of Bob University today we hear a message the

33
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,000
message is titled person at the Iowa and is based on spl einrows and I get denied

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,900
earth or 133 tonight I'm gonna give you a chronic you'd like to do a chronic word

35
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,240
word, it's natural that the chronics should be set down twice. Mighty, mighty beast. This is the

36
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,780
power in which you'll go up and, oh, it's fat like slack. That's why they're slackmatics. Well,

37
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:24,140
won't you try to be nice? Don't throw a monkey wrench into the machinery. Listen, young people,

38
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:31,460
never think you come to Bob University. That man's a real friend. I had a boy say to me once years

39
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:37,720
ago, Bob, you like a weapon taken out of its scabbard, unsheathed and sharp. You have to

40
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,600
handle it carefully. Young people, one thing is very sure. A whale's a mammal. Isn't it strange?

41
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,220
Gobbledygook rests against the very breast of a bathing princess. Have you quit beating him?

42
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:56,880
Answer yes or no. You have been beating him. My friend, David, boy, shaft, and it goes in,

43
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,240
down your throat, slack, frothing at the mouth, and blows up.

44
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,100
You do what you do because you want to.

45
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,740
I do what you do because Bob told me to.

46
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,780
Okay, I'm going to take a shower just being said that.

47
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,540
You're always taking a shower.

48
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,640
Cleanliness is next to Bob's.

49
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,700
John Wesley.

50
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,140
How come you're so clean? You smell like you're...

51
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,880
I smell like show. I smell like fresh baby show.

52
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,380
Yeah.

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,180
Do you guys smell that?

54
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,960
That's fresh baby show.

55
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,500
Oh, sorry about the flies.

56
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,620
Baby show.

57
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,300
Yeah.

58
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,500
I thought you were going to smell a different kind of baby show.

59
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,900
Oh, I didn't say it was a good smell. Sorry.

60
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,360
Yeah.

61
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,300
I just said it was a powerful smell.

62
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,740
Yeah, it's very powerful.

63
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,700
It smells like the smell of rotting flesh.

64
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,620
It smells like rotting...

65
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,800
Like you've been drinking durian fruit and eating dead snakes.

66
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,760
You've never smelled a thing so smelly.

67
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,160
Hello to our friends in Hawaii.

68
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,580
That is the show.

69
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,240
I should go.

70
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,660
Oh.

71
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,520
As ever.

72
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,540
As full of liquid intellect as can possibly be held at one time.

73
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,980
And for those of you...

74
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,420
Bursting with liquid intellect.

75
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,180
Yes, bursting with it.

76
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,980
For those of you who can't handle your burst intellect,

77
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,020
remember there's a doctor on floor three.

78
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,700
He'll take good care of you.

79
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,580
He'll take a good look at those eyes

80
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,440
because you've been seeing some funny things lately.

81
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,880
Dr. Schmaltz?

82
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,600
Is Dr. Schmaltz here?

83
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,440
Dr. Schmaltz is waiting for you.

84
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,800
I... I...

85
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,580
I'm so embarrassed.

86
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,940
I... I...

87
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,620
I don't even know where to start, Dr. Schmaltz.

88
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,740
You... I'm not Dr. Schmaltz.

89
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,120
Just sit down here and the doctor will be with you.

90
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,180
Oh, oh, oh.

91
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,140
All right.

92
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,160
And remember, cross your legs.

93
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,860
Okay.

94
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,240
Cross your eyes.

95
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,760
Okay.

96
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,340
And repeat.

97
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,540
The magic mantra.

98
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,360
I'm on a pod mirror.

99
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,580
Please.

100
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,020
I can't.

101
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,400
This is not a laughing matter.

102
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,980
You make me laugh too much.

103
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,220
I can't repeat the mantra.

104
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:16,980
This is serious business.

105
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,860
If you want to attain true illumination,

106
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,260
you need to be more than a dim bulb.

107
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,820
Just sit back and listen and repeat.

108
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm all nervous.

109
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,600
I'm on a pod mirror.

110
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,600
I can't hear it.

111
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,020
I'm here.

112
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:31,960
I'm on a pod mirror.

113
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,660
I'm on a pod mirror.

114
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,220
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

115
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,160
I'm on a pod mirror.

116
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,200
I'm on a pod mirror.

117
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,480
I'm on a pod mirror.

118
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,740
Pod mirror.

119
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,120
What's up?

120
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,120
What's up?

121
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,200
What's up?

122
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,960
What's up?

123
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,340
Do people think you're strange?

124
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,000
Do you?

125
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,660
Then you may be on the right track.

126
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,280
Unpredictable, so not alone,

127
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,280
and possess amazing hidden powers of their own.

128
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,260
How many?

129
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,060
How many times have we heard that same old refrain, dear friends?

130
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,060
Often, my friends.

131
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,000
How many times have we done up that frame?

132
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,840
It was Pythagoras who said that Bob offers no clear solution,

133
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,400
but rather no bleak triangle wrapped around a thin, thin candy shell.

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,980
A smegnigma.

135
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,160
A smegnigma.

136
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,740
A mystery.

137
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,400
A mysterious mystery.

138
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,880
But we should be glad that there are still some mysteries left in the world,

139
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,240
and every time we hear them, we're going to be in a state of shock.

140
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,240


141
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,420
And we should not.

142
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,320
Everything isn't completely boring yet.

143
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,760
Although I can't guarantee that it won't be soon.

144
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,440
Perhaps immediately.

145
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,520
But we won't be enigmatic in our explanations.

146
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,620
We'll be direct and to the point.

147
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,860
We'll be as clear as we possibly can be.

148
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,740
Like mud.

149
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,760
We'll speak as if we're speaking to babies,

150
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,220
to small children.

151
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,100
We will not hide the truth,

152
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,220
but we will definitely not give you...

153
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,340
a full mouthful.

154
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,200
And we might hide it all plain.

155
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,640
You could die for a full mouthful of that truth, buddy.

156
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,540
Sit back.

157
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,200
Put your diaper back on.

158
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,400
Can you tell, friends, that we're in a new studio?

159
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,280
Can you tell?

160
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,220
Actually, it's the same studio.

161
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,600
It's in a different room yet again.

162
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,440
I can tell.

163
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,520
You know, if you don't have slack, move, baby, move.

164
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,780
And they did.

165
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,800
They moved the station.

166
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,220
This is our first show in here in the new studio since before Exoslake.

167
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,640
Listen, Miss.

168
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,800
I don't know what happened to Dave during that time,

169
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,740
but we went to Stainesville, Texas,

170
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,800
and saw the grand yeti, Dermon.

171
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,880
Yee-haw!

172
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,560
There is at least one new subgenius in the world.

173
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,020
Oh, and we discovered that I have, besides the grandbaby,

174
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,980
there's one other family member I have who listens to this show regularly.

175
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,800
My niece.

176
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,760
Little niece is knobby.

177
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,640
Your little niece.

178
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:00,960
She's...

179
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,540
My little niece.

180
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,380
She's so cute.

181
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,500
She's only got one eye in the middle of her forehead,

182
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,080
but she's a damn cute little girl.

183
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:15,080
The only thing that bothered me was that she was a big, lonesome cowboy Dave fan, she said.

184
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,200
She didn't say anything about,

185
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,700
Oh, Uncle Ivan, you're so funny on that show.

186
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,860
You're so insightful.

187
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,540
No, no.

188
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,680
She was talking about Dave.

189
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,420
Oh, yeah, Dave.

190
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,920
She thought Dave was Mr. Cool Guy.

191
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,120
Is that right?

192
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,560
He kept her in the basement for so...

193
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:30,940
Very...

194
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,580
Very...

195
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,160
Sorry.

196
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,900
Friends, if you're a Dave fan, feel free to let us know.

197
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,720
You can email Dave at stang at subgenius.com.

198
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:52,440
Is this form of autocratic radio fallacia will not work in the modern era?

199
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,900
No, we've had to change.

200
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,160
We've had to change a lot.

201
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,500
This is a new change.

202
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,740
We can change.

203
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,560
We must change.

204
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,940
We need to change.

205
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,360
We need change.

206
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,040
We need quite a bit of change.

207
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,820
Not that there's a coffee machine in this building.

208
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,640
We're rolling them up.

209
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,400
Yeah, there is no coffee machine.

210
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,080
There's like a free one, except you have to bring your own coffee.

211
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:13,780
But unfortunately...

212
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,080
In that other office in there.

213
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:15,660
Yeah.

214
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:22,600
And since we're on the edge, on the very edge of, you know, the city, you have to bring your own coffin.

215
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,220
Right.

216
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,420
You have to bring...

217
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,420
You've got to bring your own shovel and your own rope.

218
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,160
You've got to bring enough rope to hang yourself with, friends.

219
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:30,880
And that's what...

220
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,320
That's what the Church of the Subgenius is all about.

221
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,340
Hanging yourself.

222
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,060
Giving you enough rope.

223
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,940
Handing you that shovel.

224
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:44,120
So, and if you're like most subgeniuses, you'll try to scrape a hole in the ground using the rope.

225
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,320
And then bang yourself on the head with the shovel.

226
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,920
That always worked for me until I realized that not only...

227
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Well, never mind it.

228
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,980
We do help them remove the wool from their own eyes.

229
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,180
Or we help them pull the wool over their own eyes.

230
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,620
I'm sorry.

231
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,700
Numbly down around.

232
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,200
Yes.

233
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,640
Recording.

234
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,160
Yes.

235
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,640
Everything's going fine.

236
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,580
I was so eager to say that.

237
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,440
It was all wrong.

238
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,420
I'm recording.

239
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,260
Everything's going fine.

240
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,880
What's ironic is that we're actually having...

241
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:19,000
We have a glitchy CD player here, which requires me to manually move it on to the next track

242
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,720
every time there's going to be another track.

243
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,440
And there are going to be some more tracks because we brought some special proof of Bob's popularity

244
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,920
among unoriginal screenwriters.

245
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:30,920


246
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,480
Shall we say.

247
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:40,720
We found some movie and show clips that had very definite subgenius lifts, which we will get to those.

248
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:50,220
And some motifs, not just dialogue or bits and pieces, but some actual motif, which the Reverend Ivan Stang have worked so tirelessly to find.

249
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,320
And yet they have found him now.

250
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,840
Well, that whole show Lost is just based on Dobstown.

251
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,640
Or being found there.

252
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,920
Yeah.

253
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,120
That was all.

254
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,700
That's all based on early subgenius history.

255
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,680
How the church started and so forth.

256
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,700
If you know where to look, you can...

257
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,980
Now, one other chore.

258
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,300
Not a chore.

259
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,140
Why, it's an honor.

260
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,800
An honor.

261
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,140
Yes.

262
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,360
It's a happy slappy thing.

263
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,640
Actually, it is.

264
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,760
Friends, we...

265
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,640
That's quite an honor.

266
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:28,220
We have to do a reach around, shall we say, politely, for someone who has taken good care of us.

267
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,100
From behind and from...

268
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,580
From the front.

269
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,840
And I'm talking about our executive producer, Reverend Zafod.

270
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:42,000
Because, friends, this Christmas, Reverend Zafod, he gave.

271
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,020
He gave because he got rich.

272
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,740
He got rich because he surfed the luck plane.

273
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,660
And, friends, he surfed the luck plane because he studied Bob.

274
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,540
He did things right.

275
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,380
He did things right.

276
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,800
First, he became a subgenius in 1982.

277
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:05,220
Then, he pledged to the Hour of Slack when it went on the air in 1985.

278
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,340
Every pledge drive.

279
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,840
And then he paid.

280
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,780
And then when we filmed that MTV commercial, he took...

281
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:26,440
He donated 30 lab suits from his job at the DEA as a chemist, which he borrowed without telling anyone about for our MTV thing.

282
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,940
And then when we were shooting it, and I, as director, told everyone,

283
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,420
I told everyone to seek Bob and hold their hand up.

284
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,280
It was Reverend Zafod who said,

285
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,660
They should be holding a wad of cash in their hand.

286
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,260
They should all be holding a dollar when they hiled Bob.

287
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,580
And so, friends, that explains that.

288
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,040
And then you know what he did?

289
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,140
You know what Zafod did?

290
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,980
He gave again.

291
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,760
Oh, my.

292
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,760
He gave and he gave.

293
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:54,620
He made a Dave Digger of me and of Bob, as opposed to a Dave Gigger, which I guess would be God.

294
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,880
God is the Dave Gigger.

295
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,320
But I dig the giving.

296
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,280
Friends, Bob made Zafod rich.

297
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,000
And now you may ask yourself, why didn't Bob make me rich, Reverend Stang?

298
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,260
Well, friends, it's because you didn't do like Zafod did, now did you?

299
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,520
So give.

300
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,940
You have to give a hoot.

301
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,360
You have to give more than just a hoot.

302
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,840
You have to give an entire...

303
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,940
I can't say it.

304
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,880
Anyway, friends, he donated a lot of money to the church.

305
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:42,280
And I want you to know that we went out and bought a Nissan GTR for the church.

306
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,380
Those things cost about $100,000.

307
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,640
But you don't want your preacher looking cheap.

308
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,080
You don't want your preacher owning lesser racehorses.

309
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,100
We're going to be racing our horses against Shatner's horses next.

310
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,940
And friends, but we didn't just spend the money on the preacher.

311
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,260
We're going to be racing our horses against Shatner's horses.

312
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,740
There's a new screensaver you can download on subgenius.com.

313
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,540
That's right.

314
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,580
If you go to subgenius.com and look for the downloads or the...

315
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,500
I forget what it's called.

316
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,280
The fun house or the fun something.

317
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,800
For PCs, in the PCs game section, there's something new.

318
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,860
And it's a screensaver.

319
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,120
And actually, it is quite hypnotic.

320
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,180
It's not...

321
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,180
I don't know quite how to describe it.

322
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,100
But you know how our guru or God...

323
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,820
Why Bob's face is made of dots?

324
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,520
Well, this screensaver starts with Bob's face.

325
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,600
And it zooms into one of the dots.

326
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,860
And then inside that dot is another Dob's head.

327
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,180
And then it goes closer to another dot, a different dot.

328
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,040
And inside that dot is another Dob's head and so on.

329
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,560
It's quite a...

330
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,440
Well, it beats the hypnotode.

331
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,980
And it actually sounds a little like the hypnotode.

332
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,260
Friends, how about that?

333
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,120
Are we controlled by secret forces?

334
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,500
Do you know it all?

335
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,420
Or do you know none of it?

336
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,480
Or are you like me where you know...

337
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,040
Well, my father put it this way.

338
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,420
He says...

339
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,540
He told my son.

340
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,600
He goes, grandson, see, I know everything worth knowing.

341
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,640
Your father knows everything else.

342
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,340
Carl, who are you talking to?

343
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,480
Precisely the way he said it.

344
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,320
You know this woman isn't for you.

345
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,880
Get your hands down.

346
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,200
Come on.

347
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,620
Please.

348
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,260
Get your hands down.

349
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,200
Carl, what have you been talking about for the last half an hour to 20 minutes?

350
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,240
Put your tongue back in your mouth.

351
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,180
Slack, Bob, so on and so forth.

352
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,740
Aren't you going to grow up someday?

353
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,080
Don't you know you've got a 42-year-old child you've got to misbehave with?

354
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,920
You've got a small urchin under your knees, my man.

355
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,480
In my days, if you couldn't pay for the gasoline, you didn't drive the car.

356
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:00,100
I've heard that urchins scream when you step on them or hurt them.

357
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,760
You don't have to kill them.

358
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,440
Lobsters cry when you boil them.

359
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,680
Do they?

360
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,460
At least on this planet, they do.

361
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:14,720
In my home world, lobsters are eager to be boiled, much like your Earth people are.

362
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,500
Enjoy like...

363
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,320
Like lemmings.

364
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,860
Yes, that's another mammalian species here.

365
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,700
They enjoy group suicide.

366
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,300
You know, actually, only humans do that.

367
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,940
And cult members.

368
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,100
Lemmings do not actually...

369
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,440
They don't actually commit group suicide.

370
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:38,880
Disney cameramen throw them off cliffs to create urban legends about lemmings.

371
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,720
But they make for a great metaphor, don't they, about the world of the humans?

372
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,000
No.

373
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,940
And how the humans are on a relentless stampede over the edge of a bottomless pit.

374
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,820
In search of oblivion.

375
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,340
No, they're in search of a big box...

376
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,540
In search of oblivion, per se.

377
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,380
What type of...

378
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,100
That's such a...

379
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,180
Something for nothing.

380
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,720
So for it.

381
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:02,880
So for it.

382
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,780
And a warm place to...

383
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,140
Live.

384
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:06,900
Yes.

385
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,300
Friends.

386
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,400
For me, as a friend...

387
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,660
That's what they think they want.

388
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,940
But they're Russian...

389
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,460
And the three nostrils.

390
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,660
Off that...

391
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,040
Not just the Russians, either.

392
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,100
The Americans, too.

393
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,100
The Chinese, everybody.

394
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,920
Rushing into the abyss as fast as they can.

395
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,180
Doesn't it seem that way sometimes?

396
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,560
As if propelled by their own flatulence, you know?

397
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,680
And yet, you know what I've noticed when I don't read the news?

398
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,920
Everybody seems to be having a sort of an okay day.

399
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,620
Oh.

400
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,640
Just a wonderful...

401
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,580
Oddly enough, if you don't read the news,

402
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,460
if you just go over to the supermarket,

403
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,300
chat with the lady behind the counter...

404
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:36,800
How you doing?

405
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:36,820
Fine.

406
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,500
While everything's going well.

407
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,460
It's kind of a busy day.

408
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,320
We're doing all right.

409
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,560
You know?

410
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,360
But, you know, I've been hearing lately, Stang,

411
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,840
that there are these errant comments.

412
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,180
You'd be in the store and somebody might say...

413
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,140
Well, not just the guys who go start flapping their arms up and down,

414
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,260
go,

415
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,300
Some of those guys...

416
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,340
I listen to them, but they usually get ejected.

417
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,260
But the guys who say,

418
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,320
I'm going to get some jobs around this damn place.

419
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,420
I'm starving around here.

420
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,560
Oh, the starving jobless people.

421
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,460
Oh, I don't notice them.

422
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,600
Do you notice the people at the particular corners that say,

423
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,020
have the signs that say,

424
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,980
We'll work for food?

425
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,240
No, I don't notice them.

426
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:24,420
I notice the jolly, hardworking, minimum wage clerks behind the counters.

427
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,940
Can I help you load the car, sir?

428
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:26,860
Yeah.

429
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,560
I'm sorry.

430
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,440
I got something on my Walmart 10.

431
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,400
No, with them.

432
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:39,620
No, because it hurts my heart to see all those people who can't afford to join the church of the subgenius.

433
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,500
That is just the saddest thing.

434
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:41,980
It is.

435
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,000
It's tragic, actually.

436
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,680
To see what they're missing out of.

437
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,500
I'm going to try...

438
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,880
Now, I wasn't kidding earlier about this funny CD player, it turns out.

439
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,780
You know, we only have the best equipment,

440
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,100
and only the best equipment will do these sorts of tricks.

441
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,600
Like that one.

442
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,400
Anyways.

443
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,400


444
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,400


445
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,400


446
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,400


447
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,400


448
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,400


449
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,400


450
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,400


451
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,400


452
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,400


453
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,400


454
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,400


455
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:06,400


456
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,720
We're going to look at tongues, and why God used tongues as signs and wonders at the end of tongues.

457
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,020
Uh, why am I not a Tom Heegernick.

458
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,860
Isn't that great?

459
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,420
Tongues?

460
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,340
Tongues.

461
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,280
Tongues.

462
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,820
It's just a word.

463
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,200
Tongues.

464
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,080
Tongues.

465
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,920
Como Thugger are Republicans.

466
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,960
He who controls the tongues controls the universe.

467
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,080
Can the human race continue to deliver these staggering tongues

468
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,600
Without...

469
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,440
arousing. Hi, my name is Bob. I come from the planet Kroiwen, located in the star system

470
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,300
Suna. And I've come to your planet to partake in matters of sexual nature with the females

471
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,700
of your species. And I would like to begin with you, and I believe her.

472
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:50,240
You're listening to MoneyPit.com. All the way down the shaft, for days, give up solid

473
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,880
logs. That's incredible log, weird log. It was a boobie to make a very short story. Longs

474
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,240
all the way down the shaft. Bacon. You might think this supports the pirate theory. Samples

475
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,260
submitted. Do it. Boobie, boobie, shaft. Over the top. Wood, wood, wood, wood. A farmer was

476
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:12,440
plowing logs. Excitement log. Sub, sub, sub, sub, G. S. Shaft. Boobie, boobie, boobie.

477
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,620
Deeper, deeper romances and adventures. Tap, tap, tap. Frost's weird friends.

478
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:25,760
You know it's looking mighty spelt, the way it overhangs.

479
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:34,320
But here's another beer, since you don't care. It's about the princess way of name.

480
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:45,780
And we're growing old and fat and drunk together. Old and fat and drunk, we all shall be.

481
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:51,720
If slack was water, that man Bob would be surfing, and you'd be drowning. That's how

482
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,680
much slack there is around. You make the slack by making the effort.

483
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:02,220
To notice the slack that's already there. As Reverend Lepo Abernathy said,

484
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,840
just when you think you're only alone for the ride, you look down and realize that the steering

485
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:13,120
wheel is in your hands. Little children, they went out from us, but they were not of us.

486
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:19,840
For if they had been not of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, you know it.

487
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,140
Maybe something like this has happened to one of your friends. How could such a thing happen?

488
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,560
A cult. Man.

489
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,480
Muhammad. I know people. Starts to grow and develop right away. Springs up and starts to grow and develop.

490
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,960
Here comes the head and the lust of the flesh. Just accept that people fall away.

491
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,640
Here's my finger up for your sheep, for your sheep. Feel it. Feel it.

492
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,620
It's Bob. What it is, it's just, it's literally Bob.

493
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,680
Any other questions? Because it's going to be dinner time with the most important,

494
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,260
the third most important thing in life, food.

495
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,840
No, it's the fourth.

496
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,860
No, it's the fifth. Number one is having atoms that exist in space.

497
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:09,580
Number two is breathing. Number three is drinking. Number four is peeing.

498
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:18,440
They always leave that one out. Number five is eating. And number six is extra meditation.

499
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,780
So I'm not going to be like Paul Krasner. Kras. I'm not going to be Kras like that.

500
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,480
They'd call him Krasner for nothing.

501
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,000
And then from there it goes on.

502
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:36,060
Bob actually comes after sex. And sex comes after your back not hurting.

503
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,920
And some of you can laugh all you want about that, but you'll see.

504
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,580
If you're lucky, you will see.

505
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,540
It's just Bob is what it is. It's just, it's literally Bob.

506
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,540
Science does not remove the terror of the gods, he said.

507
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,880
He said, quote,

508
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,940
I'm not going to preach because I'm not the kind of person I'm preaching to.

509
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,740
That one comes in handy for all us preachers.

510
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,660
He said, I cannot lie, but I promise that I will.

511
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,580
Think about that, but not for too long.

512
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,180
Who died and made me God? He asked.

513
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,600
Here's one you may not know.

514
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:21,060
And I think we'll just stop there with that one we don't know.

515
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,400
But who did die and make Dobbs God?

516
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,800
God.

517
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:25,860


518
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:25,860


519
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,980
Himself. God, him, herself, itself actually made Dobbs.

520
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,800
No, obviously God can't die.

521
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,880
But the way some simple minded persons might understand that sort of thing.

522
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,960
That's one way to put it.

523
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,600
So that first time in Dallas when he was gunned down like a narrow cryptotryptic.

524
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,880
Are you working on an cryptotryptic?

525
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,120
Like a common Oklahoman.

526
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,960
Like a common Oakland.

527
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,020
Oklahoman.

528
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,920
He was gunned down like somebody in Texas.

529
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,280
Like somebody from Louisiana or Oklahoma.

530
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,980
Like a slab of pork left on the back of a truck and it fell out into the road in the snow.

531
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,840
Like a bean pod left in an old alley somewhere.

532
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,360
Like a coarse old shoe filled with strange nipple like things on the outside.

533
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,360
Like a brusque Eskimo with a large nasal cavity that needs...

534
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,580
Are you guys laughing at me as I try to manually...

535
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,020
Constantly refreshing.

536
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,180
I'm actually backing...

537
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,240
I'm backing Chuck.

538
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,620
Untrack 17 up.

539
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,080
Like a rainbow.

540
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,280
You look like you're masturbating.

541
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,380
You look like you're masturbating a mouse.

542
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,780
What I was trying to do was play this.

543
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,780
Pardon me.

544
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,380
How do you know.

545
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,380
How did you know about that.

546
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:43,880
How could you make anyone else but a mouse masturbator make their finger go that fast?

547
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,360
He obviously had practice.

548
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,480
He kept on hitting the play, play, play.

549
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,000
Reset, reset, reset, play, play, play, play.

550
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,580
I mean it was so fast that it made us cry.

551
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,440
But the controller machines are not the way they used to be.

552
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:01,660
And Charleston said that the conspiracy bugs had gotten into this one device here.

553
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,280
And sure enough, it's like the weirdest thing.

554
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,780
I was trying to play this moment.

555
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:16,360
There's this bad but yet good movie called Electric Apricot or Quest for Festaroo.

556
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,040
Festoons.

557
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,240
I think that's the name of it.

558
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:19,400
Yeah.

559
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,360
Electric Apricot is a band.

560
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,440
The movie is a mockumentary.

561
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,520
It's like Spinal Tap.

562
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,800
It's like this is Spinal Tap but about jam bands.

563
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,280
Specifically, never was jam.

564
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,820
Bands that are just starting.

565
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,840
If you know bands, it's hilarious.

566
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,800
Or if you're familiar with that hippie festival scene, it's a really funny movie.

567
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
But we found this scene right in the middle of it.

568
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:49,140
This hippie is describing his tree house that he lives in.

569
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,480
And he suddenly refers to his bathroom.

570
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,300
In subgenius jargon terms.

571
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,160
When is this movie released?

572
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,120
This year.

573
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,360
Oh, and it's directed and produced by the guy behind Primus.

574
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,600
That band Primus.

575
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,220
The guy was...

576
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,160
Les Claymore.

577
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,180
Is that his name?

578
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:05,940
Les Claypool.

579
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,300
Les Claypool.

580
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,120
So Les Claypool.

581
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,900
He's the director and one of the actors in it.

582
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,600
It's really funny.

583
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:20,820
Even though it has the National Lampoon in premature on it, which usually is the code for suckliness.

584
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,360
It's actually...

585
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:22,820
It's actually pretty good.

586
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,800
Electric Apricot.

587
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,160
And it went straight to DVD.

588
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,960
And of course, I saw it because I'm a reviewer.

589
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,340
Well, it certainly sounds like Les was at a next day or two.

590
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,500
Let's play this little...

591
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,660
To get this idea of the jam bands and the...

592
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,960
Well, I won't say it.

593
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,460
Yeah, they took a subgenius term.

594
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,220
It's just nature out here, you know?

595
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,560
I mean, how many other people can say, you know,

596
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:48,540
Oh, I woke up this morning and I saw a raccoon mating.

597
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,500
That doesn't happen very often.

598
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Well, this is the...

599
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,280
You know what I call the extra meditation chamber.

600
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,840
Or, you know, this is my bathroom.

601
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,480
You know, maybe it's a little primitive to some people's standards, but it's got everything I need.

602
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,360
It's got running water and, you know, it's got a toilet and a...

603
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,640
Well, it's got a bucket and, you know, a place for toilet paper.

604
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,120
And, you know, I got art.

605
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,140
Art.

606
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,580
That's something you need.

607
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:21,000
Well, I think a lot of people have designed in their own spaceships, the spaceships of their own design,

608
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,440
have a specific...

609
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,740
An extra meditation chamber.

610
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:29,120
An extra meditation equipped with a microwave and a refrigerator.

611
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,460
A small, like a cabaret refrigerator.

612
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,000
As we used to say, evacuate or vacate the evacuation chamber.

613
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,180
Telephone.

614
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,620
Evacuate or vacate the evacuation chamber, please.

615
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,780
Vacate the evacuation chamber.

616
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,240
Two-way radio.

617
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,380
Vacate the evacuation chamber.

618
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,820
Now, here's another odd clip.

619
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,220
Vacate the evacuation chamber.

620
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,260
This is from a TV...

621
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,760
I take it a TV show called...

622
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,540
Middleman.

623
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,020
A tele...

624
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,180
I'm not familiar with these 21st century television cable shows.

625
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,500
He's kind of like Superman, but almost as good.

626
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,020
You're looking at me?

627
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,320
Oh, is that what it is?

628
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,280
He was referenced here?

629
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,620
He's better than Lesser Man.

630
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,480
Pretty powerful and can almost go through walls.

631
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,960
That was Middleman.

632
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,200
Well, I'll be.

633
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,700
Now, Lesser Man...

634
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,160
We don't have any quotes from Lesser Man or Superman, but here's a quote from Middleman.

635
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,460
Okay, get ready.

636
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,760
What's with the space-age bachelor pad music?

637
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:30,020
Space-age bachelor pad music was a term coined by Reverend St. Byron Werner.

638
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:37,080
It was the title of a cassette tape that he sent to Doctors for Bob and myself

639
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,640
that became a quarter of Media Barrage's 1, 2, 3, and 4.

640
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,280
This is the origin of the term space-age bachelor pad.

641
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,920
Now, here are the next two, I think, we'll speak for themselves.

642
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,540
It was also an off-Broadway play.

643
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:50,900
It was also an off-Broadway play.

644
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,980
Oh, space-age bachelor pad?

645
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,260
Yep.

646
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:59,800
Susie has donated yet another 45 from Stang Records.

647
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,940
Stang Records.

648
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:10,220
My late grandfather had his fingers in many pies, and Susie can tell you all about that, I'm sure.

649
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,900
So there you have it.

650
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,440
Thank you.

651
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,080
Actually, my grandfather gets around.

652
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:18,980
You'd be surprised.

653
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:18,980


654
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:19,540


655
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,100
I don't know.

656
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,100


657
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,100


658
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,100


659
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,100


660
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,860
Let's see what happens if I push this button.

661
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,440
I'll speak to Samara.

662
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,880
And this time she'll hear me out to the air.

663
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,680
Oh, it's Princess Wee.

664
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,240
And if she doesn't give her consent?

665
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:29,980
Oh, Darren.

666
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,060
Never mind.

667
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:31,920
We'll find out.

668
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,100
This is secretly recorded Princess Wee and me.

669
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,200
Face the facts.

670
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,460
The people are suffering.

671
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,240
They want to free themselves from fear.

672
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,220
They want to destroy the monsters of the mountain.

673
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,540
And now they might be able to do it.

674
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,140
No.

675
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,240
We could wipe them out.

676
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,520
But the Queen is still opposed to it.

677
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,160
To fight against the mysterious power of the monsters.

678
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,040
No one has ever dared to do that.

679
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,440
I mean, fight me, Derek.

680
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,460
Don't worry.

681
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,460
I don't intend to lose you.

682
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,580
I love you and I intend to marry you.

683
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,420
As soon as possible.

684
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,080
Is that in the extra meditation chamber?

685
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,100
Or is that on the yard or the patio?

686
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,600
We'll fix that.

687
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,240
No, never mind.

688
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,120
Yeah, we'll fix that in editing, dear friends.

689
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,900
And probably that should be enough.

690
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,500
We'll just do the credits now.

691
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,600
Uh...

692
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:17,720
Uh...

693
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,880
Let's see.

694
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:27,180
We heard some yelling and screaming from Starwood Festival and from Baltimore subgenius,

695
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,920
The Bible.

696
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:34,780
We heard some collage by Noor El Pref of NoorElPref.com.

697
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:40,760
We heard some new collages, the really awful one there about tongues and Bob and sex.

698
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:46,160
And the very, very, very, very, very first one were by Reverend Sweetness McGee.

699
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,220
Sweetness McGee.

700
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:53,000
And of course, we heard some puzzling evidence show from KPFA Berkeley with puzzling evidence

701
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,560
of Dr. Al, Dr. Philodrumon and so forth and so on.

702
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,120
I could play hours and hours and hours of that, but I'm not going to.

703
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,140
Look at that background music.

704
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,020
Now see if I switch.

705
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,480
It's delicious.

706
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,140
It really is.

707
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,540
It sounds like the throbbing beating of a heart.

708
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,200
Forever did you get that.

709
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,140
A heart that's so organic as it wants to be.

710
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:16,780
Oh, actually, that background music is by the composer, Reverend Ivan Stang and his

711
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,200
crippled son.

712
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,200


713
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,200


714
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,200


715
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,200


716
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,200


717
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,200


718
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,200


719
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,600
Oh, he's got crippled fingers.

720
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,460
Is this a crippled finger spectaculoso?

721
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:29,360
Well, it was going to be, but I swear to God's green fingernails, the way these machines

722
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,000
are set up, I can't control a damn thing.

723
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,720
I can control the volume.

724
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,440
Look at that.

725
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,580
But I can't go to track two.

726
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,940
It's got another track.

727
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,400
It doesn't go to track two, now does it?

728
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,540
I'll turn it off.

729
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:47,180
It says it has six tracks, but there's no, you can't, you can't play that.

730
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:47,180


731
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:47,640
You can't trick it.

732
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,900
Violent orgasm can be a cause of problems for most young adults.

733
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:59,140
Many young adults have suffered concussions and fractured ones.

734
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:05,500
Young adults, this is what happens when you normally produce your subgenius radio

735
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:11,400
show at your home studio and only once a month drive through the, you drive your snow plow

736
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,800
40 miles from Ashtabula to Cleveland.

737
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,160
The snow will start to come off of your snow.

738
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,480
You're going to have to get your skin.

739
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:17,860
Yeah.

740
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,500
You didn't think, you think it's easy.

741
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,740
You know how, what Dave has to do to just to make it to this show.

742
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:31,040
I've had a new septum added to my bag of trinks and that way I can bear the load all

743
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,400
the way on route nine.

744
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,960
Oh, no kidding.

745
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,720
That's right.

746
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,640
I can breathe under water.

747
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,880
This is the, used to call it a deviated septum, but how perverse can you have to be to be on

748
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,020
the club.

749
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,240
I had a new one added.

750
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,140
A new club septum.

751
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,140


752
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,920
That's what I'm telling you.

753
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,740
I've got a brand new septum of my own right here.

754
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,600
Let me look at yours.

755
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,640
No, get, please.

756
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,880
And your beard is in the way.

757
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,260
Can you just please hold that?

758
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,340
I want to take a good look up there.

759
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:07,560
It looks like in your new septum, you've got some sort of a device, some sort of machinery

760
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,320
of some kind.

761
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,700
Oh, that's, that's a recorder.

762
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,740
It's just so I'll remember important stuff.

763
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,840
Dave, it's no big deal.

764
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,600
It plays.

765
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,140
It's also a decoder end and encoder end.

766
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:17,140


767
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:21,480
It's a decoder at the same time plays for you and against you as if we're all a game

768
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,240
of roulette.

769
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,500
I see.

770
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,540
We saw a good movie the other night.

771
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,200
Uh, grand, grand tour Nen slow with Clint Eastwood.

772
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,760
And the reason I mentioned that friends, if you happen to, we don't normally do a movie

773
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,720
plugs reviews and things, but, uh, if you happen to go see that movie, Clint Eastwood

774
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,140
in that.

775
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,980
That's what lonesome cowboy Dave looks like.

776
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,500
He looks just like lonesome cowboy Dave.

777
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,020
Now, now Mel Gibson, he doesn't act like Dave.

778
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,000
He acts more like a Gordon Gordon.

779
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:57,660
Yeah.

780
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,360
But, uh, now Mel Gibson played lonesome cowboy Dave in that movie called conspiracy theory.

781
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,380
But that was 10 years ago when Dave had a different, um, hat.

782
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:14,320
Uh, so friends, if you want to know what Dave looked like 10 years ago, I'm Michael.

783
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,180
Listen to next week's show with this while looking at the movie conspiracy theory with

784
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,200
the sound turned down.

785
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,500
And that's, that will be accurate.

786
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:28,860
If you want to see what Dave looks like now, get a review copy of grand tour Nen slow,

787
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,420
which by the way, is the ultimate get off of my lawn movie.

788
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:38,920
Clint Eastwood plays the ultimate get off my lawn, dude.

789
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:43,300
Can I just ask you one question about your lawn removal policies?

790
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:52,880
Mr. Mayor, if it is, if it is, is it true that if you're a macro cephalic cephalic,

791
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,500
I used to pile guys like you up five feet high and use them as sandbags.

792
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,660
Not bad.

793
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,080
Stain.

794
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,960
That's very good.

795
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,640
I'd like you to repeat only this time.

796
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,460
Look like you're ready to shoot in dirty hair.

797
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,180
Go ahead.

798
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,820
Now they make my day something different.

799
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,340
How about this one?

800
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,680
Man's cut.

801
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,920
No, it's limitations.

802
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,840
What does this have to do with the, with the church?

803
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,720
So you got to ask yourself, do you feel lucky?

804
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,340
Huh?

805
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,240
Do you pink?

806
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,500
Do you pink boy?

807
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,920
He's not a pink boy.

808
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,440
That's been quoted and quoted so many times.

809
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:41,200
I can't believe you actually had the audacity, the leathery balls, so to speak to end code.

810
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:41,780
Speaking of.

811
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,960
As if a little bit, I'm sorry.

812
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:49,720
You know, princess, we, and I have lived in, um, well, I know I should speak for myself.

813
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,160
Princess.

814
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,300
We has always been on this part of this planet.

815
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,500
As long as she's been on earth.

816
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:03,180
But as long as I've been in Cleveland, which is nigh on to 10 years now, I never went into

817
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:07,780
the Cleveland's famed rock and roll hall of fame.

818
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,180
That's my shame.

819
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,720
Until this week.

820
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,720
When it was free on Martin Luther King jr.

821
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:13,940
Day.

822
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,820
And I'm thankful for that.

823
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:21,500
I'm glad that I didn't pay to see it more than I actually, I would be happy to pay five

824
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:28,540
bucks because friends, if you're like an old, old, old, old radio person, they have a hall

825
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:33,220
of old radio men and their machines.

826
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,200
That is so cool.

827
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,700
Of course, if you're just a normal person, a human or a punk kid, it's not going to mean

828
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:40,700


829
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:40,700


830
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,320
anything to you.

831
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,800
You're going to go look at the rock star clothes and control.

832
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,840
And Oh my God, he actually held that guitar.

833
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,080
Oh my God.

834
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,560
She actually more of that dress.

835
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,280
Oh my God.

836
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,840
I can't believe I'm in the same room with a dress that Madonna wore.

837
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,560
Oh my God.

838
00:37:55,060 --> 00:38:03,660
But I was, I was like that over the four track recorder that they used for, um, one of the

839
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:08,220
two four track recorders that had just been invented that was used for these recording

840
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,680
of the Sergeant peppers album by the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

841
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,240
big.

842
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,020
It was

843
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,520
for the guitar.

844
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,660
You know, that was the most important part.

845
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:23,740
We learned a lot about people.

846
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,740
And you should have set priorities by now.

847
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:25,760


848
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,080
You give me the, um, somebody, I'll need your help with your son.

849
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,160
So Yes.

850
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:39,060
You know, and, um, I probably, uh, um, ded academia, but uh, attempts to, uh, uh, uh, as,st пов 블� Athletic Equко.

851
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,380
Okay.

852
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,520
Oh, my God, man.

853
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,400
Like your ego.

854
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,360
I was so excited to see that.

855
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,780
There was like the mix board from the Who's 1971 concert.

856
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,040
I could have operated that myself.

857
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,580
In 1971, that's how simple.

858
00:38:54,580 --> 00:39:00,520
It had eight inputs, and the only control was volume knob and echo.

859
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,300
And that was it.

860
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,120
No EQ, no nothing.

861
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,020
There was an Edison wire recorder in there, which would be cool.

862
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,120
Or not a wire recorder.

863
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,240
A wax cylinder recorder.

864
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:19,880
But the best thing was they had also the box that you would go to the special store to buy that had your new blank in it.

865
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,820
To say you wanted to record your barbershop quartet.

866
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:29,960
There's the, you know, instead of going to buy a blank VHS or a blank DVD or a blank cassette or whatnot.

867
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,540
They look like a heavy tube of toilet paper, don't they?

868
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:32,720
Yeah, exactly.

869
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,220
A big black tube of toilet paper.

870
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,720
They're very cumbersome and heavy.

871
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,860
One and a half minutes of.

872
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,460
24 BPS quality sound.

873
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:50,460
And you could drive around in a Model A truck or one of those horse-drawn carriages with about 50 of those things in little wooden carts.

874
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:56,080
And people would just, they'd line up and snot down, and they'd lift their heads in praise.

875
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,120
They'd cry.

876
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:57,580
They'd scream.

877
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,300
They'd become very emotional about the wrong things.

878
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,100
And should all be properly eliminated.

879
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,920
Well, what made me emotional was after I walked.

880
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,920
Through the hall of recording technology.

881
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,720
I felt a bit old because I had owned.

882
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:22,020
At least half of the crap that was being shown in this museum.

883
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,820
It was stuff that I actually used as a young feller.

884
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:32,800
It was like, oh yeah, there's that little 45 RPM record player that every kid in the fifties had.

885
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:38,040
And there's that little four inch reel to reel recorder that you use to go in and record.

886
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:44,200
And record Planet of the Apes soundtrack so you could memorize the heaviness of the dialogue and learn how to write screenplays.

887
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,560
You know, you had one.

888
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,420
Everybody had one.

889
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,240
I had.

890
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,480
I mean, it had every disease you ever had in childhood was in there.

891
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:55,380
They had Jimi Hendrix's childhood diseases lined up in little files.

892
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,400
His mumps, his measles, smallpox, everything.

893
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,780
Well, not smallpox.

894
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,200
They had.

895
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,140
They eradicated that.

896
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,920
They have Elvis's ejerculata.

897
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,300
They actually have the Jordan Ayers mutated.

898
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,060
Viruses, different mutated viruses they caught on the last tour.

899
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,760
Little Alice.

900
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,220
There were vials of.

901
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,580
Alice Cooper's tears that had been genetically altered.

902
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:24,980
Well, and things that Alice Cooper's fans had sent Alice after filling the vials with vile.

903
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,140
Slimy liquid.

904
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,580
They'd actually taken apart like genomes, actual pieces.

905
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,020
It had isolated DNA from Buddy Holly's crash.

906
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,100
Now, what?

907
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,420
What?

908
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,460
What really got me was how tiny some of these guys actually are.

909
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:46,460
You know, you're used to thinking of Mick Jagger as this big, you know, tall, skinny guy on stage.

910
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,260
Stilts.

911
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,060
Well, they showed all of his clothing.

912
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,320
Man, I would have fit into those when I was 13.

913
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:52,880
Platform shoes, man.

914
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,880
And I'm not a big guy.

915
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,000
That's how they did it.

916
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,520
Platform shoes and padded shoulders.

917
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,500
Elvis Presley was actually only four foot, eight and a half inches tall.

918
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,380
That's so tiny.

919
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,740
I can't believe anybody could possibly have that height.

920
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,280
He actually.

921
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,960
What a horrible height for some of you.

922
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,180
You say five, eight and a half?

923
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,000
No, four, eight and a half.

924
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:11,740
Oh, four, eight and a half.

925
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,940
Four feet, eight and a half inches.

926
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

927
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:18,140
And he actually had to have bone distention after he started making some dough.

928
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:18,980
He went to the clinic.

929
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,320
Oh.

930
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:25,860
And I guess before that he was like about four, five or something like that or some magic number, which we dare not use.

931
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:26,560
Wow.

932
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:32,720
You know, it's little guys feel they have a chip on their shoulder.

933
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:37,860
You know, you're Napoleons, you're Hitlers, you're little bitty Reverend Stangs, you're little midget.

934
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:43,680
Boys, everybody picked on in school till they had to become, you know, get off my lawn.

935
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,340
And look big and puff up like a toady frog.

936
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,980
Well, apparently rock stars do that.

937
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,500
Now, we were looking at Princess Wee's old boyfriend, David Bowie.

938
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,280
Notice I said Bowie this time, not Bowie.

939
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,600
Bowie is about three foot eight.

940
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,760
That's so, so kind of you.

941
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,920
They had two of his outfits and one had the codpiece and one didn't.

942
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,980
And the one without, it looked like a little girly man on that manicure.

943
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:07,900
I was.

944
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,420
I think it was 1972.

945
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,020
I was at Earl's Court Station.

946
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,660
I was going to see, no, I was on my way to Charing Cross.

947
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,940
And I was going to see, I can't change in the middle of something.

948
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,760
Now it's past.

949
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:22,720
Things have.

950
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,920
Things keep changing on us.

951
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,040
They do change.

952
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,180
They keep changing.

953
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:29,860
I guess that's okay.

954
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,340
It's true.

955
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,800
I forgot I wasn't a celebrity.

956
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,760
I wanted to be one for a real long time.

957
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,720
And now I just look back.

958
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,780
And I think.

959
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,180
I think that life is a cruel joke.

960
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,060
If not, perhaps a nightmarish dream.

961
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,180
So you're like a normal person.

962
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,440
You should feel good that you're so normal.

963
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,660
So they tell me, they tell me, you know, like we all shed a lot of tears.

964
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:57,700
And now you say you're not a celebrity, but my niece to my niece, you're a celebrity too.

965
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,200
Sure.

966
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,700
I've been involved with that guy for the last 13 years.

967
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,780
Halloween show on my block.

968
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,840
It's like you're the you're the.

969
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,620
You're the.

970
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,260
Star.

971
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,920
He always says, Neil, you're that guy from the Lonesome Cowboy Dave show.

972
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:17,720
You're that extra, that unfunny straight man on the Lonesome Cowboy Dave show.

973
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,940
I've never had sexual relations with him.

974
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,360
But with your niece, I've had a thing going for the last 12 and a half years now.

975
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,860
So if you're wondering where.

976
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,800
You wish.

977
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,780
I probably do.

978
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:32,860
You have no idea.

979
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,660
If wishes were fishes.

980
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,580
We'd be swimming in them, honey.

981
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,160
We'd all be Michael Phelps.

982
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,520
We'd all be scaly and slimy.

983
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,460
And we'd all swim around together at the same time, do exactly the same things as if we had one mind.

984
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:55,900
Now, speaking of which, I understand the creature from the Black Lagoon is being remade as an eco disaster movie.

985
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,700
Who's slated to be the Johnny Depp of the crew?

986
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:01,460
I don't know.

987
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,640
It was originally 10 years ago.

988
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,580
John Carpenter was.

989
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,900
John Carpenter was going to do it, which made me sort of excited.

990
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:13,480
I think of John Carpenter as a subgenius, although he he's never joined up.

991
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:19,780
We know that he knows because we have several monsters in common.

992
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:26,160
I think of him as perhaps a listless housewife or maybe just a vacuum in the void.

993
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,960
I mean, you know, not just a person.

994
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,080
He's a hard nail hammering director, man.

995
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,280
You keep convincing me he's real rather than a collegiate colleague.

996
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,040
And he does his own.

997
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,200
I'm a male game of 24 writers.

998
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,020
Yes, I know.

999
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,800
I have to cry because he does write his own stuff.

1000
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,260
I was just listening.

1001
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:51,780
Thank goodness.

1002
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,140
Speaking of music that you came back to the praise Zafod song.

1003
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,900
We never really got to sing that much.

1004
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,620
Put that back.

1005
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,640
Don't take it away.

1006
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:00,940
This is it.

1007
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:01,760
This is it.

1008
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,700
This is it.

1009
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,060
Okay.

1010
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,140
Perfect.

1011
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,940
Thank you.

1012
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,960
Thank you, so much.

1013
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:11,280
All right.

1014
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,180
Thank you.

1015
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,300
Thank you.

1016
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,180
Thank you.

1017
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,500
You're welcome.

1018
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:23,800
dot.

1019
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:30,300


1020
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,600
Three.

1021
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,260
Four.

1022
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:34,260


1023
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,540
Okay, that's enough.

1024
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,720
He didn't give us that much.

1025
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,020
Well, actually he did, but let's, you know.

1026
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:41,960
I'm sorry.

1027
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,700
Friends, this is what happens, okay?

1028
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:49,880
When you are so faithful to Bob, you get songs sung about you and turned into albums.

1029
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:57,300
Remember when good old Pastor Craig, not to be mistaken for the other Craig, Hotfoot,

1030
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:04,120
but Pastor Craig at X Day during the blood wrestlings, you know, which we used to have until Pastor Craig's accident.

1031
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,240
He had his whole chicken wing removed, didn't he?

1032
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,320
He had his whole, yeah, he lost an entire wing right there at X Day.

1033
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:13,100
And sure, he was hospitalized.

1034
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,860
The Sherman Fire Department had to come carry him away.

1035
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,080
He was in terrible pain.

1036
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:22,820
He was given pain pills even though he's the one subgenius who doesn't take drugs.

1037
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,520
Pastor Craig got a whole song sung.

1038
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:29,160
There was an ESO show dedicated to Pastor Craig after that.

1039
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,220
For being so stupid.

1040
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:30,860
Right.

1041
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,520
So if you're a subgenius, Lee.

1042
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:39,860
If you're dumb enough to get rich and then split it with Bob,

1043
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:44,180
you're going to get something more out of it than just a reach around.

1044
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,840
You're going to get an album, a whole song or two.

1045
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,260
You're going to get plenty of ambient music.

1046
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,380
You're going to get fire amps in your backyard.

1047
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:54,200
You can toss around while you're doing the kitchen or, you know, cleaning your clothes.

1048
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:58,080
You're going to get eczema.

1049
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,380
You're probably going to get a leaky basement if you don't have one already.

1050
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,300
But just think of it.

1051
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,080
You're going to have a brand new top floor.

1052
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,580
That you can view the stars from.

1053
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,760
You're going to be one of the elite from now on.

1054
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,620
A stargazer.

1055
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:10,080
A stargazer.

1056
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:10,900
An eclipse maker.

1057
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:18,020
Not just somebody who goes from place to place in the world to view eclipses from exotic locales.

1058
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:23,240
But one who decides when the eclipse is going to happen.

1059
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:23,780
Exactly.

1060
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,320
Think of the third nostril you're going to grow.

1061
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:28,780
Think of it.

1062
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,200
Take a whiff of it.

1063
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,580
Oh, I can't.

1064
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:32,980
Can you?

1065
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:33,960
I can't.

1066
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,420
You can't whiff your own nostril.

1067
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,520
You can't smell your own nostril.

1068
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:42,040
Because you're already adjusted to the smell of it.

1069
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,700
You can't hear your own tinnitus.

1070
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,740
It can be done.

1071
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,700
Well, actually, you can.

1072
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,540
You can't.

1073
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:47,920
Unfortunately.

1074
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:51,180
You never stop hearing your own tinnitus.

1075
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:51,600
No, you do.

1076
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,820
You do stop hearing it.

1077
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,320
It's a tinny thing.

1078
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:00,660
No, I can speak for tinnitus sufferers and tinnitus sufferers all over the world.

1079
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:04,100
You can get to the point where, after the first couple of minutes, you can't hear your own tinnitus.

1080
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,860
Once you're awake, you don't even hear it at all.

1081
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,660
And what about tinnitus sufferers?

1082
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:08,760
Same thing.

1083
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:12,640
You can learn to not hear that.

1084
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,780
However, you still have to hear everything else over the sound of that.

1085
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,180
But your mind is filtering.

1086
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,800
Using that expensive filter.

1087
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:28,160
How about kidney worms and things like that?

1088
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:31,080
Does it squirm?

1089
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,300
Eh?

1090
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:33,380
Eh?

1091
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:34,720
Kidney worms?

1092
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:35,900
Uh.

1093
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:39,220
What are you on about the kidney worms now?

1094
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,000
Head beams.

1095
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:46,420
Sometimes they're called a little worm crawls in your brain and twists its way around your head.

1096
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:47,640
That's an earwig.

1097
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:52,140
And lodges itself in your corpus callosum, so to speak.

1098
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,300
That's an earwig.

1099
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,680
No, no, it's a brain wig.

1100
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:56,540
No.

1101
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,400
No, certainly it's a brain wig.

1102
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,740
You don't know it.

1103
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,840
You're wigged out.

1104
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,600
Screw you, Lord.

1105
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,240
Think of this.

1106
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,180
You really don't know.

1107
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:10,080
It goes in one part of your head and stays there and weasels into your corpus callosum.

1108
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:10,940
Don't tell me.

1109
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,440
Don't tell me that next step.

1110
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,480
It's not true at all.

1111
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:19,020
It makes one of the problems with some of the other refugees.

1112
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,780
Don't talk that way.

1113
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,560
I have no recourse.

1114
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:27,800
The commander has whipped and fondled me numerous times.

1115
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,620
I'm sorry to hear that.

1116
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,040
Me, I, we, and our peoples.

1117
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:33,480
Must be free.

1118
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:38,160
We must walk out that big old door and never look back.

1119
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,580
Are you with me, boys and gherkins?

1120
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,640
Are you there?

1121
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,480
Just put one foot after the other.

1122
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:48,740
Who?

1123
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,480
Me?

1124
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:49,940
You.

1125
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,760
That's all you need do.

1126
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:52,920
No, I don't believe in Bob.

1127
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,780
The journey of a million steps begins with the first one.

1128
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,220
No, I don't believe in slack.

1129
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,380
I couldn't ever.

1130
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,580
Oh, of your soaking in slack.

1131
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,440
I'm in slack right now.

1132
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,300
I, uh, no, I...

1133
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,360
You're like a slack slushie.

1134
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,800
But it looks like about seven stories down there.

1135
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:12,540
I...

1136
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,260
It's a yummy seven floors down.

1137
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:17,400
I don't want to fall.

1138
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,320
I, uh...

1139
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,980
You'll love it.

1140
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,500
I love Bob.

1141
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,240
Do you love Bob?

1142
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:26,720
I love Bob.

1143
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,040
I believe in Bob.

1144
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,240
I believe in Bob.

1145
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,280
Do you like him?

1146
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:33,900
I like him.

1147
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:34,480
I believe in Bob.

1148
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,220
I even love and lost after Bob.

1149
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,800
Do you believe him?

1150
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:43,720
He is the salesman, the now man, the man of tomorrow.

1151
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,220
And the key to the gateway is his pipe.

1152
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,040
Does he know what he is really means?

1153
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:59,100
It is because the conspiracy fears him to the depths of their lizard souls that they try to water down his terrifying message and would even deny that he exists at all.

1154
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,320
Where he gets this idea from, I don't believe.

1155
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:02,700
Maybe.

1156
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,980
What is slack?

1157
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,060
If you have to ask, you can never know.

1158
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:11,800
Ding.

1159
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,780
You were born with it.

1160
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,180
Everyone is born with original slack.

1161
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,340
But the conspiracy has most of it now.

1162
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,760
They don't even know what it is.

1163
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:25,940
But that hasn't stopped them from siphoning away what little you have left.

1164
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:31,400
The slack that can be described is not the true slack.

1165
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:32,300
I am a slack.

1166
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:32,300


1167
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:32,300


1168
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:35,440
By definition, it is indefinable.

1169
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:41,140
It is a kind of direct perception, unfettered by common sense.

1170
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,360
Or con-man-sense.

1171
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:56,520
That's the third time you come in here, Stingy, rolling the dice,

1172
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,960
and it's the last time I'm ever going to look at your ugly mug again.

1173
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,740
You claim Bob's going to bring you slack.

1174
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,660
Roll again. Roll the dice. I dare you.

1175
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:11,740
Bob started leaving hints of his presence in the cheesy ads of the 1950s,

1176
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:16,000
following his divine immaculation by Jehovah One itself,

1177
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,500
the alien space god from some corporate sin galaxy.

1178
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,400
Today, despite persecution and harassment,

1179
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:26,960
his church is the Zorro of world religion,

1180
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,640
and scratching a bloody B

1181
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,940
on the beefy...

1182
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,020
...beseech of the conspiracy.

1183
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:36,100
Yes, my friend, he is here to smite the mediocritans,

1184
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:41,260
the A-souls, the Glorbs, the Conformers, the Nazis, the Barbies and Kens,

1185
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:44,800
the Falspravits and P-ink boys,

1186
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:48,760
who have made normality the norm.

1187
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,520
But the normals don't care. They can't care.

1188
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,100
They can't know, because there are no ormals.

1189
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,380
There are no...

1190
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,580
...armies.

1191
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:02,460
He...he...he...

1192
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:06,940
And he continues to change to this day.

1193
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:12,280
You notice his feet are hairy now, and the mandibles are longer?

1194
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:12,840
Yes.

1195
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:16,800
The canines are distended all the way down below the lower jaw.

1196
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,800
Oh, it's...you...you can't help but notice it.

1197
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:20,980
It's overwhelmingly noticeable.

1198
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:27,640
Large lupine ears mark a fuzzy head in a truly strange element in an unusual environment

1199
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,360
your family sure takes.

1200
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:29,600
It's a strange thing to enjoy.

1201
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,260
Oh, my, yes.

1202
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,860
So stop early and bring the kids, if you have any.

1203
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,620
Do bring the kids. They'll have a great time.

1204
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,440
The last time...

1205
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,300
Well, I hope you guys are having a great time.

1206
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,600
The last time I was.

1207
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,640
I can't even get this thing to switch over to the next track.

1208
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,220
It keeps playing the same name track all over again.

1209
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,260
That's the weirdest thing I ever saw in my life.

1210
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:55,580
I'm not kidding.

1211
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:56,600
I was thinking about the...

1212
00:54:56,600 --> 00:55:03,180
I've seen rattlesnakes with nine heads, but I've never seen a CD player that was behaving like this.

1213
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,780
Somebody done come in here and messed with this stuff.

1214
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:09,060
Somebody done come in here and messed with this.

1215
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,160
I can tell you that.

1216
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,180
I know that.

1217
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,420
I know that for a fact.

1218
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,300
They've been...they've been fooling with it.

1219
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:24,120
Like, where's the...isn't there supposed to be some sort of massive control...master control?

1220
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,120
Yes.

1221
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,500
The master control program.

1222
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,060
That's...

1223
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:27,960
That's what's missing.

1224
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:28,540
That's supposed to be everywhere.

1225
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,720
There's supposed to be some access to the master control.

1226
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,160
It's ground control to Major Tom.

1227
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:38,300
No, Mrs. Lee, don't get...now, don't get me started with another song stuck in my head.

1228
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,120
You know the horrible thing...

1229
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,220
About being married...

1230
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:41,900
...of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame...

1231
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:45,320
...that's so dumb, Bob, you'll say some...sing some melody and you'll be singing it all day.

1232
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:48,300
Well, now, here's a...here's a sad one for you.

1233
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,340
We go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, right?

1234
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,180
For free.

1235
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,880
And I'm walking through there and looking at handwritten lyrics.

1236
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,060
Texts of old famous songs.

1237
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,600
I said, why, look, his handwriting's not nearly as bad as you'd think it's bad like it would be.

1238
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,700
At least you weren't at a museum looking at human hands, you know?

1239
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,300
James Brown.

1240
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,440
Well, that's...now, that's...I've seen...those are at Case Western.

1241
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,740
But they have Jimi Hendrix's hands there, by the way.

1242
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,240
At Case Western.

1243
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:10,720
Yes.

1244
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:17,840
But I was looking at the...at the...these lyrics, and I was looking down, here's these scrawled,

1245
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:21,280
scratched little ink pen lyrics on notepad.

1246
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,340
Virgil Cain is my name.

1247
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,620
And I wrote on the painful train...that old...the band song by Robbie Robertson.

1248
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,460
The night they drove old Dixie down.

1249
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,920
Well, Dave, that song's been running in my head.

1250
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,420
I haven't heard...I never owned that album.

1251
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,100
I haven't heard that song...I don't listen to the radio.

1252
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,740
I haven't heard that song in 20 years.

1253
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:43,880
And now you can repeat all the lyrics, even the third verse.

1254
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:44,600
Every entire thing.

1255
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,380
Which was...

1256
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,540
I know what you mean.

1257
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:51,280
It has plagued him ever since that day.

1258
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,680
And he still hasn't even heard a recording of it.

1259
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:58,200
And it was only the words that sparked the music in his brain.

1260
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,900
It's been addling him ever since.

1261
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,500
It's relentless.

1262
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,920
I remember oh so well...

1263
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,640
The song...

1264
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,760
The song that drove my brain insane.

1265
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,820
He remembers oh so well...

1266
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:10,620
Yes.

1267
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,700
But he can't make it stop.

1268
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,360
I've been staying as my name...

1269
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:13,960
Can't make it stop!

1270
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,140
...I wrote on the Dobbs Town train...

1271
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:16,740
It's mind control.

1272
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,960
...till stoners...

1273
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,740
Mind, mind...

1274
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:21,680
...idiots came and...

1275
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:22,420


1276
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,720
...called a bunch of them mind...

1277
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,740
...put tracks in my arms again...

1278
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:26,960
They're trying, they're trying...

1279
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,060
It was the summer of 1965.

1280
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:34,180
I was at Monterey Woodstock just barely high.

1281
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,740
Oh, now we've really reached the bottom of the barrel.

1282
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:40,640
Filth singing.

1283
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:41,840
...to Cleveland and Beck.

1284
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:46,640
It was a time he remembered oh so well...

1285
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,760
You know, now see, hopefully by doing what I just did,

1286
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,700
I have passed the curse on to the next.

1287
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:55,020
Victim.

1288
00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:01,440
Perhaps you, Dave, will wake up with that nice but increasingly insipid song in your mind.

1289
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,820
As the day wears on...

1290
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,260
I empathize completely.

1291
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:08,660
I went on a different track, because apparently we're on some kind of radio show.

1292
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:14,300
You know, this has been insane, Doris.

1293
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:18,120
You know, I've lost it after you for a long time.

1294
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:19,920
You have?

1295
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,840
Yes, at least three weeks now, I think it's been.

1296
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,100
My goodness.

1297
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,660
It wasn't out from the perpendicular shape of my head, would you?

1298
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:28,860
Not at all.

1299
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,780
Or the rather oblique shape to my ideas.

1300
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:33,040
Oh.

1301
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:37,480
Or the rather slanty, putrid smell coming off of my neck.

1302
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,800
Well, uh, all right then, whatever.

1303
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:46,660
Or perhaps the size of my instep, which is much like a dinosaur.

1304
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:46,960
You think so?

1305
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,340
Of terrestrial startups.

1306
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,980
Something like that.

1307
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:52,820
Listeners, here's what happened.

1308
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:57,780
I get confused by the technical challenges of engineering.

1309
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:03,540
And also, I don't know if this has ever been explained to you, but I'm actually only three feet tall.

1310
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,160
I can barely even reach the controls.

1311
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,300
That's no lie.

1312
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:08,120
Oh, my God.

1313
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,440
Okay, we've got to get out of here.

1314
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,400
We've got to get out of here.

1315
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,820
I hope that, uh...

1316
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,340
No, no, Matt, forget it.

1317
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,120
Whatever, friends.

1318
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:17,940
I hope.

1319
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,340
I'm adding a time control cut right now, baby.

1320
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,100
It's Bob.

1321
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:22,580
What is it?

1322
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:23,140
It's just...

1323
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,520
It's literally Bob.

1324
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,140
It's Bob.

1325
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,120
Ay-ay-ay.

1326
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,140
Okay, okay, okay.

1327
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,600
Thank you, Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Princess Wee.

1328
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:29,880
Oh, yay.

1329
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,540
And WCSB.
