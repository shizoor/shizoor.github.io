1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,300
Yeah!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Ah, Chase!

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,080
Here they come now!

4
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,260
I surrendered.

5
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,640
Blow your speakers out!

6
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,540
It's the Buzley Evidence Show!

7
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,020
Welcome to the show.

8
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,340
Come on down, Buzley Evidence!

9
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,020
Come on down, Dr. Howe!

10
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,640
Come on down, Milo Drummer!

11
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,720
And our special guest star, Evan Sainz.

12
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,180
Come on down, Caller 1, Caller 2, Caller 3, Caller...

13
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,160
Oh wait, no Caller.

14
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,900
I just want to say I love what you crazy, wonderful, beautiful kids are doing.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,320
When those women in those tube tops run down the aisle, it's just crazy!

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:45,980
Showtime.

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,400
Got some friendlies on the show this morning.

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,300
True religious figures of the Church of the Sub...

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,100
Old bones creaking from the grave.

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,320
Makes people sit in their cars out in the cold to listen.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,760
That's what kind of show it is.

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,000
From another place, from another time, from another dimension.

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,380
The Buzley Evidence Show.

24
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,060
It's almost Hitler's birthday, but it's...

25
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,560
Time to wake up.

26
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,200
I want to hear from you guys, because I'm weird.

27
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,980
I'm not sure if you guys are incredible creative geniuses or just criminally insane.

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,580
However, I'm always game for weird things.

29
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,080
A pirate radio's plunder.

30
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,640
You can't do this to me! I'm in control, not you! Get out of my head!

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,880
I can hear a game.

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,380
So, yes, we're back on the show, and this is a religious show, I've got to remember.

33
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:58,800
Right.

34
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,440
I understand.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,380
Dr. King, Dr. Howell, the Obermans.

36
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,240
Don't leave, I can't hear nothing!

37
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,660
I can hear Reverend Stans.

38
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,360
I'm looking into the chamber, the star chamber, and Ivan Stang is starving in there.

39
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:13,920
He can't...

40
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,880
Stans?

41
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,840
Stans.

42
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,060
Oh, my God.

43
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,100
There he goes. We've just...

44
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,040
I use these buttons.

45
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,400
This is coming in.

46
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,140
CR is listening.

47
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,160
I thought I had lost my hearing, and it was only the headphone was unplugged.

48
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,980
What?

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,620
Who would unplug a headphone?

50
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,400
Who would do such a thing?

51
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,820
No helpful person could countenance such an act.

52
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,160
What could motivate a person to unplug a headphone in a radio station?

53
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,800
A true believer motivated by his conspiratorial ideology.

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,680
That's who.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,860
Someone contaminated by ideology.

56
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,260
I was talking to Dr. Howell just like we weren't on the air, because I thought we weren't on the air.

57
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,740
And now I'm afraid. I'm afraid.

58
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,380
I think we were.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,500
Because I said things that I might not say on the air.

60
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,000
Talking about the Chiricahua Mountains of southern Arizona.

61
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:15,420
Princess, we and I have been on a long road trip for over a month now, almost two months.

62
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,200
We left December 1st with a terrible disease.

63
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,360
Did you protect yourself from that steady beating sunshine?

64
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,660
Visiting certain barely known ruins in...

65
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,780
By using your hat and your sunscreen?

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,360
We did two things.

67
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,980
We spread the Cleveland Flags.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,160
We flew and successfully up until we got to Texas.

69
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,840
Were you able to propagate it?

70
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:43,240
Then from Texas to here we investigated numerous of the more rocky and twisted,

71
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,420
torturous state parks and national monuments.

72
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:58,860
And which culminated in the cops almost busting bombs at Vasquez Rocks just north of Los Angeles.

73
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,600
Oh my goodness.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,680
Vasquez Rocks where so many great movies have been made.

75
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,240
Like Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey.

76
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,300
Iron Man and Transformers were most recently shot there.

77
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,220
Episodes of the original Star Trek.

78
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,420
In fact, Dr. Hal, the main feature...

79
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,940
And Jesus Christ Superstar.

80
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:25,140
The part of Vasquez Rocks that opens Werewolf of London and stars as Japan.

81
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,840
That is now called Kirk's Rock.

82
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,540
Because so many...

83
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,600
So many Star Treks were shot there.

84
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,760
And as we were exploring it, I was thinking Shatner himself walked here.

85
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,480
Yes.

86
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,060
Shatner.

87
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,880
Shatner walked.

88
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,300
Shatner walked among us.

89
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:41,400
And the spot that I'm walking on.

90
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,280
And so I pulled the terrible big rubber bob mask.

91
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,480
Not the good one.

92
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,520
But the terrible one.

93
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:48,660
Yeah.

94
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,980
Well, the one I wouldn't...

95
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,240
It's just terrible, ladies and gentlemen.

96
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,560
I wouldn't risk losing.

97
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,080
It is.

98
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,040
It is terrible.

99
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,200
And it smells bad too.

100
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,900
And as I was posing and waving...

101
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,340
Waving and...

102
00:04:59,340 --> 00:04:59,520
As Dobbs and...

103
00:04:59,520 --> 00:04:59,620
And Bob was...

104
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,280
Winking at the crowd...

105
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,920
That's when the Vasquez Park Ranger and the local town sheriff showed up.

106
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,240
And you could tell they'd heard somebody was smoking.

107
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,980
But then they looked at Bob.

108
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,580
We...

109
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,700
Bob looked at him as if to say, nobody think anybody's smoking something in this fake plastic

110
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,120
pipe.

111
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,140
And so they were happy when Bob left their car.

112
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,120
You're just lucky, Stan.

113
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,800
They drove to the left and we drove to the right.

114
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,000
And everyone was happy.

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,600
You're just lucky I was happy.

116
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,160
Did you stand up?

117
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:29,940
You're just sitting down?

118
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,860
As Pozling pointed out, they really just wanted to go to lunch.

119
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,700
Here's my version of what happened.

120
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,900
We went to Vasquez Rocks.

121
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,720
I come over the hill.

122
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,700
And there's Bob.

123
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,020
So I call my guys over.

124
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,180
And we just start pouring fire into the area.

125
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,400
The rangers were treated.

126
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,120
Because we had so much stuff to do.

127
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,840
I can't hear you over the background noise.

128
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,320
Because I'm deaf.

129
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,800
Because we're fighting the fight.

130
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,240
They're fighting...

131
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,300
I'm fighting the radio fight to try to hear what my fellow live people are saying over

132
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,500
the air.

133
00:05:59,500 --> 00:05:59,500


134
00:05:59,500 --> 00:05:59,500


135
00:05:59,500 --> 00:05:59,500


136
00:05:59,500 --> 00:05:59,500


137
00:05:59,500 --> 00:05:59,500


138
00:05:59,500 --> 00:05:59,500


139
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,260
We're trying to keep these dead people off of us.

140
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,020
I hate the dead people who hurt my ears.

141
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,520
No, I hear dead people.

142
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,720
I hear dead people.

143
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:08,980
Stop!

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,180
They won't shut up.

145
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,060
Right now, Prince...

146
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,660
But my leavening ghostly spirit...

147
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,260
Are there callers on this show?

148
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,120
Is it possible...

149
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,260
There may be, in the fullness of time, some callers.

150
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:19,980
Let's...

151
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,820
The one caller gave up.

152
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:27,480
Remember, our call number, Vafus Rofofyofyik, in the 510 area code.

153
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,440
That's, once again, the 510 area code.

154
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:29,460
That's the 510 area code.

155
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:29,480
That's the 510 area code.

156
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:29,480


157
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:29,480


158
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:29,480


159
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:29,480


160
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,520
Vafus Ro learned Hungarian Modern Yourura.

161
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,360
Go on.

162
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,500
Boy, that'sakteria.

163
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,360
To understand it's compared to Mobile SAP internet communication linear currency,

164
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,360


165
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,780
As Vafus Ro i invite you to learn Vafsbeat,

166
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's try.

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,480
To do is change this mix of views.

168
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,720
That's vesranze,

169
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:56,740


170
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:56,800


171
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:56,800


172
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,740
A show dumped from a market.

173
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,880
That doesn't mean that listeners aren't there.

174
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,300
They're just in the dark, sad.

175
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,640
There's going to be a weird show now on the college radio station.

176
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,180
There's no show upstate.

177
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,100
Just silence and darkness.

178
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,060
Please call the show right now and start the show on your own college radio station.

179
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,920
In Greensboro, North Carolina.

180
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,560
That's a secret message to this future.

181
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,740
And start the show on your own show.

182
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:28,320
In Greensboro, don't miss the spectacular sight of beautiful Venus and the crescent moon close together in the southwest after sunset.

183
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:39,360
After they set, mighty Orion the hunter strides on center stage high in the south as the red planet Mars rises in the east.

184
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:47,220
Venus sets at 8.37 p.m. while Mars rises at 9.04 p.m.

185
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,720
Great Jupiter sets at 12.24.

186
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:57,000
Venus sets at 9.39 a.m. while aged Saturn rises at 12.07 a.m.

187
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,580
You were editorializing those a little bit, weren't you?

188
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,440
Simply giving credit where credit is due.

189
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:16,120
Say, I visited a disease upon many subgeniuses that you guys know on my way down here and made them all really sick with a chest cold.

190
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,820
Oh.

191
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,980
Here's how it started.

192
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,240
First, I got a flu shot.

193
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,720
Then a week later, I got a test.

194
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,600
Terrible cold after a Thanksgiving party.

195
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,420
A cold that causes hallucinations in some people.

196
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,600
The cold flew into your body.

197
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,120
Yes.

198
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,840
And I couldn't sleep laying down.

199
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,960
I had to sleep sitting up like the elephant man.

200
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,260
And I made paternostril and petal sick.

201
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,560
Then we made Pisces and suds ill.

202
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,280
Sneezing and wheezing.

203
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,540
Oh, it was horrible.

204
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,280
But Charlottesville was fun to explore because it's full of occult symbols.

205
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,340
It's so ancient.

206
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,340
It's paraphernalia.

207
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,500
All those masons were there.

208
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,180
Thomas Jefferson carved eyes in pyramids and swastikas everywhere in Charlottesville.

209
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,360
And put secret things for national treasure.

210
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,660
Then we saw Dr. Leguim and Reverend Pockets in Greensboro, North Carolina.

211
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,980
Pockets had suddenly heard her own self on the radio for the first time and realized,

212
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,740
Oh my God, our slug's been on in this city all this time.

213
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,080
And two weeks later, they canceled it.

214
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,300
From that city.

215
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,300


216
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:27,640
Then we drove to Atlanta and stayed with Reverend Susie the Flusie.

217
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,780
Although we were not on her show.

218
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,000
She just did show for us the whole time.

219
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:41,960
And slathered us with presents and showed off her new house and her new lizards and all of her bulldada.

220
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,660
Her house, like Philo's, is one huge bulldada altar.

221
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,960
And Dr. Howe's.

222
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,740
Did she?

223
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,660
And Potterknob.

224
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,000
And the last one.

225
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,820
Lou's a lizard or something?

226
00:09:53,120 --> 00:10:01,340
Her favorite lizard died and she has replaced it with a couple of new plated African Sudan lizards.

227
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,920
Well, those are handsome creatures.

228
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,180
Little Johnny-come-lately's, huh?

229
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,060
We went to doctor after making everyone sick.

230
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,940
We went to Sterno's.

231
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,740
Sterno has a radio show that plays just Frank Zappa, rare Frank Zappa, every Sunday night.

232
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,980
And I asked him, when I got there, I said,

233
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:29,240
Now, even though I like Frank Zappa for the most part, is it okay for me to say Zappa sucks on your show?

234
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,300
And both of them went, no, you can't.

235
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,380
I said, so you're in a cult now, right?

236
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,620
You're in a cult.

237
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,480
I'm not allowed to say Zappa sucks, whether I mean it or not.

238
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,600
You said it on KPFA.

239
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,820
And Sterno's reply was, no, Stang, I'm in two cults.

240
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,100
But in the Bob cult, you have to say Bob sucks.

241
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,840
Or else we'll kick you out sooner or later.

242
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,360
That's the way we are.

243
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,600
Well, now you guys.

244
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,280
After sickening everyone, we visited a doctor.

245
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,900
Dr. Cooler in Oklahoma, who's an emergency room doctor.

246
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
Sickenings and healing.

247
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,680
And a cattle rancher at the same time.

248
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,280
And a subgenius collector.

249
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,420
He actually subscribes to our Slack home service.

250
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,100
How about Kweezybo?

251
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,880
That is the way it goes.

252
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,080
No, the Kweezybo.

253
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,440
The Kweezybo cartel moved to New York.

254
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,240
New York?

255
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,600
Yeah.

256
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,280
And is shot up with reverence.

257
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,680
They're all caught up in New York.

258
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,740
You can't have things, huh?

259
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,520
Still producing the magazine.

260
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,740
Probably not, because he's got a life now and a girlfriend.

261
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,360
Ah, well.

262
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,680
A worthy girlfriend.

263
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,860
Anyway, we went and saw Pappy out at Stang Ranch and all my siblings.

264
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,280
And everybody was fine.

265
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,080
The cactus crop was coming along real well.

266
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:57,120
And I don't know if I can stand to live there.

267
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,560
Really?

268
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,160
Why?

269
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,040
What is it that's sad?

270
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,380
Because the Pate Transportation Museum is completely gone.

271
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,040
Texas has sort of changed and they're kind of nosy now.

272
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:13,380
And I'm afraid that I would have to pretend to be Mr. Smith instead of Reverend Stang all

273
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:13,880
the time.

274
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,580
Yeah.

275
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,780
I do that on the road.

276
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,860
I put on a disguise.

277
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,080
It's nice Mr. and Mrs. Stang.

278
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,080


279
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,040
I'm going to call Mrs. Smith from Ohio.

280
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,060
Smith, is that your real name?

281
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,840
Is the light blinking for Mrs. Smith?

282
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,520
I haven't seen it.

283
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,540
Where is Mrs. Smith?

284
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,820
She fell asleep in the car.

285
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,860
I hope not.

286
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,300
Mrs. Smith?

287
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,160
What the hell are you talking about Mrs. Smith?

288
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,140
Well, she, you know, she makes those pies.

289
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,960
She called out, you know, simple pleasures are worth dying for.

290
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,380
Call her back, Reverend Stang.

291
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,960
That's what Mrs. Smith's pies are all about.

292
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,500
On your secret super cell phone.

293
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:49,820
I don't know.

294
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:49,940


295
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:49,940


296
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:49,960
I don't know.

297
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:49,960


298
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:49,960


299
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:49,960


300
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:49,960


301
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:49,960


302
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:49,960


303
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,220
Oh, the secret super secret cell phone.

304
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,800
There she is.

305
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,580
I never say hello.

306
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,580
Is that Princess We Are Doe?

307
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,360
No, this is the little match girl.

308
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,540
No, it's some homeless lady sitting in a car.

309
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,940
A match girl, eh?

310
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,120
Well, I never would have thought there was a match for that girl.

311
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,480
Trying to be quiet so they don't hear her in Texas.

312
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,140
How many matches do I need to give you for you know?

313
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,340
She's matchless, I can tell you that.

314
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
I'm at the end of my rope.

315
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,940
That's not the top of the line.

316
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:19,940


317
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:19,940


318
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:19,940


319
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:19,940


320
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:19,940


321
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:19,940


322
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,080
That's not who I thought it was.

323
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,320
She's at the end of the rope.

324
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,780
Well, don't.

325
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,360
Well, hang on.

326
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:23,980
Hang on.

327
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,960
Don't let go.

328
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,800
Don't let go.

329
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,720
Well, now it is.

330
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,480
If you're swinging above a vertiginous abyss, don't let go of the end of the rope.

331
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,680
I don't know how.

332
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,740
Okay, good.

333
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,280
Because you've been living in UFOs all your life near kpfa.org.

334
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,060
And that's sort of on the hour of slack whenever somebody cuts it into little pieces.

335
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,620
Slack.

336
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,700
Bob Nelson.

337
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,180
Hour of slack.

338
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,700
Give me some slack.

339
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,840
And that's what this is, dear friends.

340
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,540
Hour of slack number 1347 made of three other shows.

341
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,340
Princess, we and I have been on a trip.

342
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,560
Obviously, we did six shows and a bunch of location recordings.

343
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,340
And it's a lot of stuff to be edited.

344
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,320
And we're still on our way back, right?

345
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:13,680
Right?

346
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,160
Right.

347
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,120
Right.

348
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,820
Yeah, we're not still in California.

349
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,440
You're not really living here in my garage.

350
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:19,720
Right.

351
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,560
I'm not really living in Philo's garage.

352
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,940
But I've got to get this show out real quick.

353
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,740
And that means I had to do it the simplest way, which is really complicated.

354
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,040
So there aren't many cuts.

355
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,720
But it is the very best stuff of several of the shows.

356
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,600
Which one?

357
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,180
Those shows being The Buzzing Evidence Show on KPFA.

358
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,460
Radio Synesthesia on WCSB Cleveland.

359
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:48,980
And now, Ask Dr. Howell from RadioValencia.fm.

360
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,440
Thank you.

361
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,820
And now, Dr. Philo Drummond, which we now hear introduced by Dr. Philo Drummond.

362
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,380
Thank you.

363
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,920
That cuts to you going . . .

364
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:10,320
And so the cry from the minaret of the muezzin summons the faithful to prayer here on the

365
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,160
Ask Dr. Howell Show.

366
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,920
It's funny how the enemy changes every year.

367
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,980
As the long shadows steal over the dusty street.

368
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,960
It's the Muslimics this year.

369
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:18,960


370
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:18,960


371
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:18,960


372
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:18,960


373
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,620
When I was growing up, the enemy was Yankees, Nazis, and Japanese.

374
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,180
And now, it's . . .

375
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,060
It's also this funny how . . .

376
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,180
. . . it's the Muslim Yankees.

377
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,700
. . . a different foreign group is starving when the child doesn't . . . American child

378
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,960
doesn't eat their dinner, too.

379
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:33,860
Did you notice that?

380
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,280
When I was a kid, it was Armenians.

381
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,620
Yeah, me too.

382
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,440
What about China?

383
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,960
And now, it's like Ethiopians.

384
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,480
No, now it's . . .

385
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,280
No, it was Ethiopians when I had kids.

386
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,220
Eat your dinner.

387
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,440
Think of the starving Americans.

388
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,260
Now it's the Americans again.

389
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,940
Think of the starving West Virginians.

390
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,200
Yeah.

391
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:48,540
Yeah.

392
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,000
Think of the starving Ashtabulians.

393
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,740
They hardly have enough money for cigarettes.

394
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,600
If you don't want that oatmeal . . .

395
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:54,620
They can't buy cigarettes.

396
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,380
. . . some po-bucker probably wants it.

397
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:56,680
Some poor little kid . . .

398
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,960
You know, cigarettes actually are a form of self-dosing for anti-depressants.

399
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,320
Well, they also keep bugs away.

400
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,760
So, when you take . . .

401
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,120
. . . you have to stay away.

402
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:11,320
When you take a depressed person's cigarettes away, you're just taking away his last ability

403
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,280
to give himself a dose of an anti-depressant.

404
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Well, that's . . .

405
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,320
It's so sad.

406
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,900
It's so sad when that happens.

407
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,940
It's a rather complicated remedy for some people.

408
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,160
It's something that may be quite simple.

409
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,460
And, you know, you can find a smoker to an area where they can stand around with a bunch

410
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,920
of other smokers . . .

411
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,760
Pure bliss, isn't it?

412
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,920
. . . breathing that secondhand smoke.

413
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,280
That's the bad smoke.

414
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,380
The firsthand smoke is not so bad.

415
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,820
But that secondhand smoke is . . . that'll kill you.

416
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,660
Have you noticed that smokers are now the healthy looking ones?

417
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,640
Because they're always outdoors.

418
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,520
They're always . . .

419
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,180
They're spending a lot of time.

420
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,340
They've got these nice tans.

421
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,680
Yeah, they have to . . . they're outdoors.

422
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,940
And they've got their tans without using a tanning machine.

423
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:46,260


424
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,660
They can't sit at the office.

425
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:48,920
They can't sit at the office.

426
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:48,920


427
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,040
They've got their desks smoking.

428
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,180
Chains smoking.

429
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:51,340
No, you can't do that.

430
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,340
So you've got to go outside.

431
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,780
And now . . .

432
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,500
You can't even cuss.

433
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,200
A lot of them are a lot stronger because they have to take their laptops with them.

434
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,780
And they have a Wi-Fi connection.

435
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,100
They just sit out there and they work the whole time.

436
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,960
This is that weird mashup of Bob Don't Ever Change.

437
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,800
Wilhelm Stahlhelm.

438
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:08,980
Right.

439
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:17,740
He created . . . Wilhelm Stahlhelm created one of the greatest Bob Robins that was ever

440
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,900
burned in Africa.

441
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,260
I think he was a . . .

442
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,520
Did you see the videos of that?

443
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,460
Yeah, that was great.

444
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:29,260
Of the Bob robot that burned and emitted fire from his fundament while he roasted in agony?

445
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,920
Yeah, you could see his soul emerging from him and the Bobbies would inhale it involuntarily.

446
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,100
Yeah, it was burning plastic.

447
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,700
They were just sucking it around.

448
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:48,200
So, that was . . . that was so much fun back in those days.

449
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,900
I'm gonna go back to the . . .

450
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:48,900


451
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:48,900


452
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:48,900


453
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,560
You know, these are the good old days.

454
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,320
Did you know that?

455
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,480
I'm afraid they are.

456
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,680
That's a sad thing . . .

457
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,620
Because any time you look back, it's always the good old days.

458
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,060
So, while now, while we're not looking back, we're not thinking this is the good old days,

459
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,800
tomorrow, we're gonna look back on tonight and say, you know, that was the good old days.

460
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,120
But what is the point of this observation made now?

461
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,080
Because that actually degrades the present moment, which is the good old day, and make

462
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,040
it less of a good old day.

463
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,180
That's just the point I wanted to make, because we don't ever talk about this is the good old moment.

464
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,720
Well, yes.

465
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,500
This is the best of all . . . right now is the best of all . . .

466
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:35,900
And yet, making the suggestion kind of puts us on the track to sadness, thus degrading the quality of the moment,

467
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,720
which would otherwise be ebullient and just as good as you say it is.

468
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,860
Well, there's no way to not degrade the quality of the moment under any observation, or anything.

469
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,220
Well, you're right about that.

470
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,660
I'm damned if you do and damned if you don't.

471
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,020
You won't hear me do it.

472
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,060
Because the moment . . .

473
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,580
. . .

474
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:48,580


475
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,480
. . . it degrades itself by its own act of not observing itself.

476
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:57,780
Well, at least we're not those slaves banging away on those railroad tracks heard in the background.

477
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,560
Well, they thought it was their job.

478
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Actually, a human observing the moment actually elevates the moment to a higher plane.

479
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,260
I always thought of that song as like a chain gang song.

480
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,660
It might be. How they . . .

481
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:18,060
I don't necessarily think that the human degrades the moment by remembering the moment.

482
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:26,620
Remembering the previous moment during the current moment, it augments the current moment in a way that can't happen until after the previous moment has already occurred.

483
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,420
Do you understand?

484
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,480
I believe that I do apprehend your meaning.

485
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:39,260
And sometimes you say it in an obvious, a super obvious way, just to make a point.

486
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,540
When I was younger so much . . .

487
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,260
Why not obfuscate when one can, just to show off?

488
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,860
That the unspoken is misunderstood, goes without saying.

489
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,160
They'll misunderstand you if you speak, too.

490
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:56,960
Yeah.

491
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,580
You have to think on . . .

492
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:00,580


493
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,060
That's a . . .

494
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,840
That's something to think about.

495
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,700
That kind of perplexes me.

496
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:17,060
It's like a self-interpolating feedback loop that eats itself like the worm oroboros.

497
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,040
Well, not necessarily.

498
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,640
Well, you know, the best subgenius lines are that way.

499
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,780
They're paradoxical, but yet they're like Mobius strips of meaning.

500
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,700
They're an opposite paradox.

501
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,520
They're hard to... Only Bob can come up with them.

502
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,360
And they're channeled...

503
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,820
They bubble out of his followers at the most unexpected moments.

504
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,920
How embarrassing.

505
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,740
The funerals.

506
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,620
They're like juxtaposed paradoxical corollaries.

507
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,660
Well, these are special moments, of course.

508
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:50,760
And what to call on except one's deep subgenius faith.

509
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,960
Ah, yes.

510
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,440
Did you say deep subgenius face?

511
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,060
Well, that too.

512
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,140
But I meant faith.

513
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,040
But, of course, the face is what one gets deeply into, isn't it?

514
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:10,060
I'm sorry the radio audience can't see this hand airbrushed Dobbs head that was done by some...

515
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,500
Terrifying.

516
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,160
...known artist, a subgenius male.

517
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,820
He emailed this to me.

518
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:21,060
He'd paid a street-busking airbrusher to do a Dobbs head real fast on a t-shirt.

519
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,380
And he sent it to me.

520
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,360
Fascinating.

521
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,780
And I shamefully can't remember the name of the person.

522
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,060
Horrible, but fascinating.

523
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,740
Nor the artist.

524
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,460
But I know that it's a distorted Bob face.

525
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,320
A distortion of the old Bob face.

526
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,720
That is horrible, but fascinating.

527
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,760
It's a...

528
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,240
Yes.

529
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,760
You recognize that quote in the classics.

530
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,660
It's fascinating.

531
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,740
It's distorted a little bit.

532
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,140
Extraordinary.

533
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,140


534
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,460
Extraordinary.

535
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,040
Because of the way my torso has changed.

536
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:48,640
It's undignified.

537
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,620
It's undignified, but still fascinating.

538
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,880
You want to see my Dobbs head, little girl?

539
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,660
No, no, no.

540
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,520
Reverend Stang, please.

541
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,120
It's embarrassing.

542
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:58,860
It's just...

543
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,620
Take your medication.

544
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,440
But it's still fascinating.

545
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,340
You want to see my pipe all lit up?

546
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,200
Here, I'll get your pipe for you.

547
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,020
Look, it's got eyes on that thing.

548
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,880
Get him his pipe.

549
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,440
Hey, tamp this thing for me, would you?

550
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,500
Now they're tamping Ivan's pipe, ladies and gentlemen.

551
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,140
They're obnoxious.

552
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,740
The eyeballs are crossed on that thing.

553
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,840
This is remarkable.

554
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,680
I wish you could see.

555
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:24,040
This custom-made pipe was provided by the Wilhelmina Spreckles Girls School of Carnover, Pennsylvania.

556
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:34,340
It is carved in the exact likeness of J.R. Bob Dobbs and produces the mind-boggling tautology of a pipe smoking a pipe.

557
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,160
This tiny pipe that sticks out and actually, see, at the moment, is emitting smoke.

558
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,980
Now, see, that would be a good design for a bong.

559
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,300
For the young people.

560
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:45,920
Bong.

561
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,800
It would be a Dobbs head bong.

562
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,160
And the pipe would...

563
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:56,180
You could use the pipe or you could use the pipe attached to the bigger pipe.

564
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,700
It's never...

565
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,320
My vocabulary.

566
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,600
That's all right.

567
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,220
Just take your time.

568
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,560
We'll get there.

569
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,720
Don't worry.

570
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,100
Don't sweat it.

571
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,500
Sorry I distracted you with my coffee.

572
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,240
Easy.

573
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,140
It's going to be all right.

574
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,960
On top of every pipe, there's a smaller pipe.

575
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:20,700
Exactly.

576
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,480
That's the thing.

577
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,180
It's a progressive series of tiny, ever-teensier pipes.

578
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,460
The pipe is composed of tiny pipes.

579
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,860
And ever-larger ones.

580
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,800
Well, that is implied.

581
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,120
A pipe is like a...

582
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,920
Bob's pipe is like a fractal.

583
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:37,600
If you take an image of it at a super-microscopic level, you just see more and more pipes.

584
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,100
Well, we can see the little ones because they are much smaller than we are.

585
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,800
But we can't see the big ones because they are so...

586
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,000
Much bigger than we are.

587
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,460
It's like what we call superliminal projection.

588
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,480
It goes past you, past your notice, because it's just too big to see.

589
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:00,380
Well, we are what's burning in the uber-pipe of our universe.

590
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:07,820
That's the tragic mistake most people make, is thinking that the pipe is actually being smoked,

591
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,440
as opposed to the pipe doing the smoke.

592
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,120
That is surely a matter of...

593
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,560
A matter of faith.

594
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,020
The pipe is actually smoking Bob.

595
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,340
Well, I'll be jiggered.

596
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,200
That's also been argued over the years.

597
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:29,760
Some even claim the pipe is a living organism of some kind with deep roots in Bob.

598
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,240
That's pretty much been proven.

599
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,560
I hate that idea, though.

600
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,320
Help me.

601
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,340
I die now, my son.

602
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:44,040
But soon there will come, on the mountain, a sacred fire.

603
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,140
From a pipe.

604
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,260
A man will...

605
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:55,600
A man will come among you with one sandal and one pipe.

606
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,820
Followed by a man with one testicle.

607
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,620
And one morsel of frop.

608
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,700
And followed by another man with one ear in the middle of his forehead.

609
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,780
How come all these guys only have one thing where they ought to have two?

610
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,660
Well, what about the people?

611
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,300
Who only have one when they should have dozens?

612
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,040
What about a guy with only one nostril?

613
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,020
Think about that.

614
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
One nostril.

615
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,160
In the center of his forehead.

616
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,520
Full of red hair.

617
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,320
Full of red hair.

618
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,200
Yeah.

619
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,020
Nice.

620
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,560
Matted red hair.

621
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,300
Matted red curly pubic hair.

622
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,100
In a nostril?

623
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,240
That's all wrong, Dr. Drummond.

624
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,200
And silly and juvenile.

625
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,340
And I think it's...

626
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:49,780
It lowers the general common denominator of public discourse.

627
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:50,280
Oh.

628
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,460
Oh.

629
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:52,880
Oh.

630
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,260
You made the show hurt, Doctor.

631
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:57,760
Yeah.

632
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,580
Yeah.

633
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,500
Look at that.

634
00:25:59,520 --> 00:25:59,900
I'm sorry.

635
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,300
I'm going to rub some homeopathic ointment on you.

636
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,620
I'm going to rub some salve into the show's show.

637
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:05,920
No.

638
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,100
Oh, I forgot.

639
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:07,860
The bag bomb.

640
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,920
You have to use bag bomb.

641
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,480
I'm going to rub some bag bomb on the show's bag.

642
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,120
Not that kind of bag.

643
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:14,340
The bag bomb.

644
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,700
Hey, man.

645
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,160
That's not funny.

646
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,580
Terrible.

647
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,220
The show's...

648
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:22,960
The show's...

649
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,120
The show's...

650
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,280
Okay.

651
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,300
I'm palpating the show's bag right now with this bag bomb.

652
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,860
While you were discoursing, we did have a call.

653
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:37,920
And the question was asked, which I'm going to throw open for discussion from this caller.

654
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,740
Just what is a prairie squid anyway?

655
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,160
Well, it's an animal that...

656
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,640
A creature.

657
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,960
It's a cephalopod.

658
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,040
It's a cephalopod.

659
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,200
Like a squid or an octopus.

660
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,220
Yes, but...

661
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,580
However, it is a land-dwelling...

662
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,480
A land-dwelling mollusk.

663
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,300
It has developed a kind of primitive lung.

664
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,000
They lay their eggs in the water, but they are amphibious type of squid.

665
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,940
And they spawn to their home grounds.

666
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,340
So sometimes they are seen walking back to their native...

667
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,740
Country boys, you know.

668
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,140
And they're harmless, isn't it right?

669
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,140
Perfectly harmless.

670
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,180
In the Midwest, they're quite tasty, except they can be...

671
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,720
They can provide a painful bite delivered through their beak.

672
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,700
That's the thing, you see.

673
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,080
The thing about the beak.

674
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,760
And they have to be de-beaked.

675
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,460
Yes.

676
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,920
If you want to eat them or do something with them, like...

677
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,900
Well, that's the thing.

678
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,800
That's what I was getting to.

679
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Country boys do something...

680
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,660
Country boys...

681
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,240
A little more...

682
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,700
Less seemly than eating.

683
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,120
You know, they don't want to get in trouble with...

684
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,040
Dad's...

685
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:48,960
Not cattle or goats, but a prairie squid, you know, a kid will come upon one.

686
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:49,860
How so?

687
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,840
Or come up and have its way with it if he knows how to de-beak it.

688
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,100
Because the way they're shaped, a boy...

689
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:55,420
Or a girl.

690
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,920
A country boy or a country girl.

691
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,080
A country girl.

692
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,720
Now, city folks, the only time they see a prairie squid is wrapped up in cellophane in the slave way or someplace.

693
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,380
No, no, no.

694
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,900
They have to go to, like, the Asian market in the...

695
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,640
Oh, yeah, but it's still...

696
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,220
Where they have the weird, weird animals.

697
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,240
It hasn't been...

698
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,820
The cell cats and the frogs.

699
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,040
...seasoned the way it should be.

700
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,300
Because you know what you do.

701
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,240
You catch your squid.

702
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,500
You de-beak it.

703
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,040
You do your thing.

704
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,820
And then you cook it up for your friends.

705
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,120
Because when they're fresh...

706
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,060
You might want to wash it a little after you...

707
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,880
And brought to your table, there's nothing better.

708
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,640
A prairie squid is just too mounted, cooked.

709
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,480
They don't have to cook them for long.

710
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,600
You know, it tastes like chicken.

711
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,680
Just like chicken.

712
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,660
But chicken is...

713
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,900
It's like a calamari, but...

714
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,260
But a calamari of the land.

715
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,000
You can't make physical love to it.

716
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,000
It's not a calamari or an octopus.

717
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,180
It's more like a calateri.

718
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,000
They'll drown.

719
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,700
They'll die.

720
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,680
They'll suffocate.

721
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,200
That's right.

722
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,800
That's where the prairie squid can help out.

723
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,520
The prairie squid can actually breathe air.

724
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,500
And it's not painful for the prairie squid to de-beak.

725
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,300
It's not painful.

726
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,520
It doesn't hurt the squid.

727
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,720
That's the important thing.

728
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,020
We wouldn't promote this kind of thing if it hurt the animal.

729
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,000
The prairie squid actually...

730
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,760
The beak grows back in two days.

731
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,400
And not only that.

732
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,040
The prairie squid has a protective...

733
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,440
Antibody that keeps it from...

734
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,160
Bob said we could.

735
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,180
Bob said we had to.

736
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,040
Anesthetic antibody.

737
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,480
He didn't...

738
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,420
It wasn't an option.

739
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,280
Bob said...

740
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,020
He said we had to.

741
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,440
Bob...

742
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,280
He said God put the prairie squid here for a reason.

743
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,180
It's obvious by its shape and crevice and that head on the end.

744
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,360
And it surpasses the knowledge of why.

745
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:31,800
For everybody.

746
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,720
It's for everybody.

747
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,340
We don't ask why.

748
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,500
We just do it.

749
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:34,600
No.

750
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,840
You don't ask Bob why.

751
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,640
Well, that's the craziest thing I've ever heard.

752
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,600
Ask Bob why.

753
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,620
Now, that question is getting...

754
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,980
Reverend Stang is going,

755
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,660
into the spirit.

756
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,340
Let's start asking Bob why.

757
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:46,740
I think he's going into the spirit.

758
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,880
Why is too much boys better than I know?

759
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,440
These are the binding spirits that have been bound to Reverend Stang at an early age.

760
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,540
Why are you the highest?

761
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,120
Sometimes he can fall into the spirit.

762
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,640
Why do you say X day is going to be July 1998?

763
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,200
Questions such as prairie squid and some of these early questions will trigger...

764
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,200


765
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:00,780
And then say Bob...

766
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:01,880
Bob...

767
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,420
Before you tell us why, why don't you tell us what?

768
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,360
...caused Reverend Stang...

769
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,220
I'm afraid this subject has upset Reverend Stang.

770
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,500
He's starting to calm down.

771
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,140
Calm down, Reverend Stang.

772
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,220
I've got the tassel.

773
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:12,900
Tell me what I'm going to get in girlfriend.

774
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,000
Doctor, will you give him...

775
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,680
I'm rubbing his chin with the tassel.

776
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,080
All right.

777
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,240
We're very sorry that we set him off.

778
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,680
The tassel works.

779
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,040
The tassel.

780
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,720
You know, in his salad days, he was quite...

781
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,280
Here, Reverend Stang, stroke the tassel.

782
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,960
Hey, Bob, why?

783
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,800
This issue was important to him when he had his memory and recollection.

784
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,260
That's one of the reasons why we don't like to take questions.

785
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,660
We never know when we might get one of those ones that will stimulate that response.

786
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:41,240
Well, I can understand the impulse because no one would know any more about the prairie squid

787
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,980
than this particular radio guest.

788
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,700
But, of course, it's all long ago and far away.

789
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,580
Dr. Drummond and I are both from...

790
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:54,420
Well, we both spent our childhoods in Fort Worth, Texas.

791
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:59,260
We didn't know each other, although we did go to the same theater every Saturday to watch

792
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,640
monster movies.

793
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,000
Monster movies.

794
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:09,780
My brother and his brother and us and Doc Frop all used to throw taffy at each other

795
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,980
in the Haltom Theater in Haltom City, Fort Worth.

796
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:13,980


797
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:13,980


798
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:13,980


799
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:13,980


800
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:13,980


801
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,820
And that's why we know about prairie squid, because they were very common.

802
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,740
Horny toads.

803
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,420
Yeah, outside.

804
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,460
They're in a similar vein.

805
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,840
Out in the back, in the ditch, in the culvert where we'd hang around, you know.

806
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,260
I used to fear that horny toads were wiped out by 12-year-old boys.

807
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,000
Say this.

808
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:32,800
It might.

809
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,360
They're certainly victims.

810
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,080
The last...

811
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,860
I've looked into it, and apparently it was an invasive species of ant that pretty much

812
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,520
ate the prairie squid.

813
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:43,520


814
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:43,820
Yeah.

815
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:43,820


816
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:43,820


817
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:43,820


818
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:43,820


819
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:43,820


820
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:43,820


821
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:43,820


822
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:43,820


823
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:43,820


824
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:43,820


825
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:43,820


826
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:43,820


827
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:43,820


828
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,140
It ate up all the horny toads' preferred food, which is a smaller ant.

829
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,180
And both fire ants and something...

830
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,800
Could it be an Argentinian ant?

831
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,220
Yeah.

832
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,480
The Argentinian ants...

833
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,660
But there's still some horny toads.

834
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,300
I've seen a few.

835
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:58,920
There are horny toads in Arizona.

836
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,420
Their range has changed and has diminished.

837
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,480
But yes, in Arizona...

838
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,200
They used to be everywhere in the suburbs of Fort Worth.

839
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,220
I mean, they were...

840
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,500
You'd see 20 a day.

841
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,280
Of course, they are a lizard.

842
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,900
We used to collectively play with it.

843
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,460
It's technically the horned lizard.

844
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,820
We put them in a box and play with them, you know?

845
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:18,460
We know it's not a toad.

846
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,080
In a shoebox.

847
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,460
And they're not really horny.

848
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,160
It's the horned toad.

849
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,580
Yes, they have two little horns.

850
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,660
That's a colloquialism.

851
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,760
Dr. Howell, have you ever seen one spit blood from its eyes?

852
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,780
Yes, I have.

853
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,200
You have?

854
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,660
You have to be prepared for it.

855
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,780
Because I never did.

856
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,940
I read that they could do that, but the ones...

857
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,500
They'll do that if you're really being offensive to them.

858
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,020
It makes you drop the toad when suddenly...

859
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,140
The blood squirts out of its eyes.

860
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,280
And as you point out, it is not so much a toad as a reptile.

861
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,740
A lizard, in fact.

862
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,460
They're very slow.

863
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,980
And they seem to...

864
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,340
If you pick them up, they'll wee-wee on your hand.

865
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,240
But otherwise...

866
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,560
An actual toad will do that, of course, Lalo.

867
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,080
That's another one of the ways...

868
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,240
That's the way they show their love.

869
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,520
Nature's noblemen ask...

870
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,900
Well, they demand independence.

871
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,480
They say, if you want me, you're going to have my pee.

872
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,780
I never...

873
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,000
There were so many around, I never tried to keep one as a pet.

874
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:23,000
Toads do wee-wee on your hand, but on the other hand, they're probably not able to be continent anyway.

875
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:29,020
When they have to go, they just do, being the simple children of lost amphibia.

876
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,800
Satan hadn't gotten to them yet and told them it was wrong to be naked.

877
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:39,420
Actually, toads are supposed to consort with Satan and his gang, according to popular lore.

878
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,800
Yeah, but not horned lizards.

879
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,720
The horns on their heads are true horns.

880
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,800
Not in Texas or Arizona.

881
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,760
Not in Texas or Arizona, horned lizard.

882
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,780
Whereas the horns on their body are modified scales.

883
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,300
The horns on their head are actually true horns with cores.

884
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,180
The horns on their cloacas are really, really hot.

885
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,900
If you can get a good magnifying glass, check it out.

886
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,240
There goes Philo again, off on another erotic frenzy.

887
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,740
Some of them call him Fernosoma.

888
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,500
He's looking for those hemipenii of the horned toad.

889
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:08,880
Well, who is...

890
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,700
They're horned lizards.

891
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,960
I know they're down here somewhere.

892
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,500
There's two of them.

893
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,980
We're all down with them.

894
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,760
Get down with my sickness.

895
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,360
That's funny.

896
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,280
So there we go.

897
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,200
It's going to be simultaneously institutional.

898
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,500
What a hysterical history.

899
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,760
Yeah, as soon as I translate your comment through the decrazyizer.

900
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,300
The decrazyizer.

901
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,080
Oh, man, I wish...

902
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,820
You can't decrazyize what we say, man.

903
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,800
You might as well just annihilate it.

904
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,560
It's like trying to dehydrate water.

905
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,700
What are you doing today, Reverend?

906
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,580
They've got your sunglasses and they live.

907
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,400
It's like trying to dehydrate water.

908
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,060
You point the decrazyizer at the person that you want to decode,

909
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,260
and everything makes sense after that.

910
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,220
Although they're still crazy.

911
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,360
Unfortunately, it's not much of a therapeutic tool.

912
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,640
It works good, though.

913
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,660
Yeah, the decrazyizer was suggested by Pete Goldie.

914
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,520
It actually, you can get it when you,

915
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,940
if you drink enough Ovaltine,

916
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,000
you can send away for the decrazyizer decoder ring.

917
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:10,980
Yeah.

918
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,640
And understand show after show,

919
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,300
show after show.

920
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,380
No, I always wash mine down with a handful of beans.

921
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,700
It's all we could afford.

922
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,140
The magic beans?

923
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,500
Magic beans.

924
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,400
And that would soil my magic underwear afterward.

925
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,700
Just think what you could do with a Lonesome Cowboy Dave and a decrazyizer.

926
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,260
They would negate everything.

927
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,460
Well, you could understand Lonesome Cowboy Dave for the first time.

928
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,600
Yeah, but nothing else would exist.

929
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,620
It would be...

930
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,800
Hey, come on, you can't be a little harsh.

931
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,620
It would be a bunch of...

932
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:43,620


933
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,320
It would be like a phase, like a phase canceling.

934
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,640
You know, I've heard some theories about how the universe might end,

935
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,880
the universe as we know it might end.

936
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,780
You know, I've heard some argue that the expansion of the universe

937
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,180
will eventually stop and it'll collapse upon itself.

938
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,540
I've heard others argue about, you know, the heat death,

939
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,500
whereas, you know, eventually all the heat and all the energy in the universe

940
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,600
will become perfectly evenly distributed,

941
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,360
which will basically make everything stop.

942
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,380
But, you know, the decrazyizer Lonesome Cowboy Dave combination,

943
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,400
that's actually how the universe will be destroyed.

944
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,720
That would be rather...

945
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,800
Is everything more than just one brain cell?

946
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,260
No. I'm sorry.

947
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,460
And the decrazyizer.

948
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:23,440
And the decrazyizer is one simple eunuch living with sheep.

949
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,220
You know, if everybody...

950
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,120
You know, eunuchs are pretty good at operating computers.

951
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,940
...shut down, nobody uses it at all.

952
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,140
Indeed.

953
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,020
I hear it's a very stable operating system to be a eunuch.

954
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,140
Who needs a wiener when you've got a computer?

955
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,400
When you've got a laptop.

956
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,340
Aye, aye.

957
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,200
Ubuntu eunuch.

958
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,300
Who needs a laptop if you've got a lap?

959
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,740
A functioning lap.

960
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,280
Now that gives you...

961
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,960
Who needs a lap if you've got a cop?

962
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,480
...a way down deep inside?

963
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,120
If you've got a big enough gut, you might not have a lap anymore.

964
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,280
Who needs?

965
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,920
I'm thinking of laptop dancers.

966
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,200
Oh, man.

967
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:01,560
And e-tons.

968
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,860
Yeah, this club swings, man. Where's Bob?

969
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,840
This club swings. It's a nine iron.

970
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,020
Bob is... Where is Bob not? Where is Bob not? That is the question.

971
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,220
Yeah.

972
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,500
Where is Bob now? Are you asking that a serious question?

973
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,320
Where is he not? No, well, where is he not is what I'm saying.

974
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:23,800
Oh.

975
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,180
That's... I mean, he's...

976
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,400
Where is he not more than a poor elfin boy?

977
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,760
And he'll...

978
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,820
...that no one believes in?

979
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,560
He's not really there to help.

980
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,980
There's certainly no fairy.

981
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,580
Slack is just around the next bend.

982
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,900
That is always true.

983
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:47,060
It's kind of like that old trick where you put a dollar bill on a fish hook and you, like, drag it along.

984
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,100
Make it look like it's blowing in the wind and get someone to chase it.

985
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,560
That's kind of like what slack is.

986
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:56,060
It's like the carrot dangling from a stick that you put in front of a donkey.

987
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,000
You walk forward and it doesn't get any closer.

988
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:05,380
It's more like the stick that you leave in the closet with a carrot hanging from it that you forgot you were going to use to do something with.

989
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,080
It's like the carrot after a few weeks.

990
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,840
Sitting in a tropical, hot, steamy environment.

991
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,140
And it starts to rot.

992
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,880
It's maggots.

993
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,040
Turns all black and shiny.

994
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,120
Well, you guys don't know about the time machine, I can tell.

995
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,720
Because a carrot is a one-celled critter.

996
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:26,780
And if we could replicate going back in the past as a one-celled critter, we'd be carrots.

997
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,440
Ergo, all carrots are going back in the...

998
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,680
They're getting back to their roots.

999
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,600
I lost it.

1000
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,400
You have to get back to your roots.

1001
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,800
Yeah, they'll have to get back to your roots.

1002
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
Everybody talks about getting back to your roots, but what's all this multiple...

1003
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,220
...vegetables up is plural. You're going to go back to your root. That's the whole point, right?

1004
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,380
Yeah, you could be a rutabagas and still know what you were doing in your previous life.

1005
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:50,320
What are you going to have... What's root? If you've got multiple roots, which one is the important one?

1006
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,780
I don't know that I've ever eaten a rutabaga.

1007
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,460
Well, one thing you...

1008
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:58,620
People only go back to their roots. And what they really mean is just going back to their root. Solitary root.

1009
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,720
The root.

1010
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,900
I am rooting around back here in Twyla's backyard.

1011
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,040
It's like the wisdom of the ages has been condensed into like solitary bark.

1012
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,220
I'm looking for some carrots and stuff to eat.

1013
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,500
There might be a carrot back there.

1014
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,740
So you're the scum that's been sealed from my vegetable garden.

1015
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,420
Well, if your experience about carrots is I am about parrots, we'll all be singing in parrots together.

1016
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,860
La la... la la lee.

1017
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,540
All of the answers are available on the Ask Dr. Howell show.

1018
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,420
And well, everything that's worth knowing is available on the Dr. Howell show.

1019
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,580
The rest is on subgenius.com.

1020
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:38,700
February 11, Verascochia. 9pm.

1021
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,620
9 p.m., Viracocha, February 11th, 998 Valencia.

1022
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,020
The Ask Dr. Hal Show.

1023
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,480
It's back.

1024
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,460
And you'll like it, especially if you're on my list.

1025
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,640
I'll send you something.

1026
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:01,260
It's transmitted through the Jungle Telegraph, the grapevine, you know, over hundreds of miles.

1027
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,060
Smoke signals.

1028
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:11,660
Yes, the multicolored parrots, the screaming monkeys, the hanging vines, and giant iridescent spiders.

1029
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,840
Man-eating plant facing north. Mean enemy on my...

1030
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,860
Thanks, Stolto.

1031
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:26,200
Well, I don't know if we're going to camp here or whether we should go a few more miles upriver, but the men are about done in.

1032
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,940
Men gone home.

1033
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,520
Well, that's awkward.

1034
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,080
Say they no enter Forest of Bob.

1035
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,080
Primitive superstition.

1036
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,000
Fear Dobstown.

1037
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,500
That old legend, nobody believes in that anymore.

1038
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:45,380
That's as old as the beard of Moses, son.

1039
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,220
There's no Dobstown, there never was.

1040
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,540
Temple of Devils, they call it.

1041
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:58,420
Yes, well, you know, you can't turn aside an important enterprise because of some old witch doctor superstitions from out in the bush.

1042
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,180
You go on. Stolto, go home, too.

1043
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,760
Very well, Stolto. You can pick up your jack from the bursar.

1044
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:15,920
Well, that's a bit awkward, down left in the middle of the valley jungle, having to carry all my own gear.

1045
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,240
It's hot, stinging tropical insects.

1046
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,020
Dr. Howell, Dr. Howell.

1047
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,600
These voices, only I can hear them, but they're not real.

1048
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,160
Dr. Howell, Dr. Howell.

1049
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:31,500
Dr. Howell, Dr. Howell.

1050
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:31,500


1051
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:31,500


1052
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,460
They're not real.

1053
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,360
That's what I must remember.

1054
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:43,100
Trying to lead me from the path, I'd better take some quinine, legacy of a lifetime spent in the tropics.

1055
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,780
Eat the beautiful flower.

1056
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:46,800
Eat the curare.

1057
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,440
Curare.

1058
00:41:53,560 --> 00:42:00,440
And a huge tropical, what do we call it, spider there, genus Phonutria.

1059
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,380
You know, I think both.

1060
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,540
I think both of you guys miss your calling as vocalists.

1061
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,220
It's crawling. It's coming closer.

1062
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,060
Popping vocalists.

1063
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:07,960
It's coming nearer.

1064
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,840
Hal and I are going to do a duet someday.

1065
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,880
It's crawling up the blanket.

1066
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,240
We're going to work on a duet.

1067
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,240
It's right there on the bed. Can't anybody...

1068
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,720
It's getting near me.

1069
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,780
Look at that thing crawling up Dr. Howell's leg.

1070
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,540
You bozos, knock him off.

1071
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,420
He's never seen a prairie squid before, has he?

1072
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,420
This is, uh, I don't know how to...

1073
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,440
If I shake my leg, it might make him mad.

1074
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:39,880
Yeah, that's right. Well, it's, uh, you know, let's just get it all over with in one final orgasmic moment.

1075
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:41,740
Blah.

1076
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,220
Here we go.

1077
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,260
My God, look.

1078
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:45,920
Silent, but deadly.

1079
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,240
Sorry, I have to do this.

1080
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,460
Look at the size of that thing.

1081
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:57,100
But these were said to be extinct 400 billion years ago.

1082
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,440
Well, they're extinct now.

1083
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,980
Well, that was a...

1084
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,260
zesty experience.

1085
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,880
Yes. Yes, indeed.

1086
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,060
What is that smell?

1087
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,840
Is it a dinosaur or whatever? It must have been rotting for years.

1088
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,400
I'm sorry.

1089
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,940
Beggars can't be choosers.

1090
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:17,060
Well, here we are, floating downriver once again on the Ask Dr. Howell show.

1091
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,620
Through the dense, tropical verger.

1092
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:27,120
Yes, uh, life, what is it but a dream, huh?

1093
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,040
I ask you. I kid you not.

1094
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,960
Life is a terminus.

1095
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,180
Terminal sexually transmitted disease.

1096
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,120
Papa Joe Mama.

1097
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,220
Yes, well, that's, uh, he's, uh, his opinions are well known.

1098
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,060
Well, but it's technically true.

1099
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,360
Sure.

1100
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,220
Life is a terminal sexually transmitted disease.

1101
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,640
But of what?

1102
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,620
Technically, you can't argue with that.

1103
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,540
That's true.

1104
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,960
There may be more than that for some.

1105
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:55,580
Not for most, certainly.

1106
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,860
Most are barely alive.

1107
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,340
But the question is...

1108
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:00,840
They know nothing of life.

1109
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,340
A disease of what body?

1110
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,240
Of what being?

1111
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,720
Of what?

1112
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,200
Well, that's true.

1113
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,620
I see a Dr. Howell's point.

1114
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,500
I doubt it.

1115
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:15,040
Dr. Howell is saying that you can't really have a disease without...

1116
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,400
You can't really have a disease without a body in which to...

1117
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,020
For the disease to inhabit.

1118
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,280
To inculcate a breed disease.

1119
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,380
And so it's not the disease...

1120
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,060
Well, maybe if you think, ascribed to the...

1121
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:30,540
The body is nothing more than a vehicle for the DNA to move it.

1122
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:30,760
Right.

1123
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,100
The DNA is not the one that moves it.

1124
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,480
It's the DNA that moves it chronologically forward in time.

1125
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,960
Yeah, but that's not just true of your DNA.

1126
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,360
It's true of the DNA of all your E. coli.

1127
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,740
And all those eyelash worms.

1128
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,040
And everything that lives between your teeth.

1129
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,780
Every DNA molecule.

1130
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:44,600
It's true.

1131
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,340
Those things, those crawling things in your crotch.

1132
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:51,200
Every DNA molecule that's able to replicate itself in time.

1133
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:53,640
Forward in time.

1134
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,500
Yeah, that's real cosmic.

1135
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,520
That's what it is, there it is.

1136
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,160
That's a seventh biology 101.

1137
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,820
You're just a gelatinous bag that's going to be able to go into the universe and go

1138
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:00,820


1139
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:00,820


1140
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:00,820


1141
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:00,820


1142
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:00,820


1143
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:00,940
back to the universe.

1144
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:01,240
You're just a bag, man.

1145
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,380
You're just a gelatin filled bag of fluid.

1146
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:08,620
Squashing bags of unfulfilled appetite.

1147
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:08,940
Squashing bags of unfulfilled appetite.

1148
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:08,940


1149
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,480
Why do you think they call him Doug?

1150
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,800
Squirming bags of unfulfilled appetite.

1151
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,400
You're just a host for your DNA.

1152
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,480
Didn't you know that?

1153
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,600
Oh, yes.

1154
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,700
You're just a worthless husk.

1155
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:16,380
Yes, yes.

1156
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,220
Who's no more than a host for your DNA.

1157
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,160
You can say you are a host.

1158
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,200
You are a husk.

1159
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,380
But why do you say you're just a husk?

1160
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,620
Why do you say you're a worthless husk?

1161
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:30,720
Without the husk, the germplasm itself, the sacred treasure, could not be transported.

1162
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:30,800
You're just a worthless husk.

1163
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:37,300
Must we be eternally unsatisfied with our lot in life?

1164
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,300
Can we not embrace the actual...

1165
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,220
Can't we just enjoy it for a second, right?

1166
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:49,920
Yes, and manage to extract each little drop of slack that might be present?

1167
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,880
Dr. Howe, that is the profound...

1168
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,160
That almost sounds like a segue to an ending.

1169
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:59,180
Only then can we cast the desiccated carcass away.

1170
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:00,260
Having...

1171
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:05,500
supped its slack from its formerly beating heart.

1172
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,520
Anyway, that's the way I see it.

1173
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,740
Oh, it is rather late.

1174
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,000
I wonder if I should begin the entire outro.

1175
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:23,600
Yes, our outro is complicated and well-known among certain circles, yes.

1176
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:28,400
This outro is often heard at the end of our shows.

1177
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,700
Yes, yes, yes.

1178
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,520
This is it. It's happening right now.

1179
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,680
Yes, we're about to end the Ask Dr. Howe show.

1180
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,840
A lengthy process that has its stages, has its events,

1181
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:52,520
like the going out of a human life, like a death itself.

1182
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,040
It has its rallyings, but always subsides

1183
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,500
and ultimately gives over to the...

1184
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:00,900
Earthy horror.

1185
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,240
The inhuman indignity of Robo DJ.

1186
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,760
He sure got a part of math down here.

1187
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:13,300
Yeah, Robo DJ will play, but only after I end the show as I see fit.

1188
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:18,980
But I just thought you might want to know that I'm bringing it to a close now.

1189
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:20,320
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

1190
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,000
We are honored to have been in these...

1191
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,080
Yes, we are indeed.

1192
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:28,840
No, no, pray tell, the honor is mine.

1193
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,240
Valencia, Radio Valencia.

1194
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,840
Valencia, and this show specifically.

1195
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,440
Well, I'm glad you sought fit to...

1196
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,940
Ask Dr. Howe in particular.

1197
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,760
...visit our little rinky-dink two-bit radio station.

1198
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,440
Will you be here in a week?

1199
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,260
I will not, but he will.

1200
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,360
But he won't be here, because I won't be here.

1201
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,680
I'll be putting in a rerun, I think.

1202
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,740
I'm going to have to be down in Santa Ana, California

1203
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:56,220
at the premiere of the Cacophony movie, Into the Zone.

1204
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,000
To get there, I will take a bus trip with a bunch of...

1205
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,500
...roguish rapscallions, such as myself,

1206
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,880
thirsting for life and liberty.

1207
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:11,160
And also, I and my confreres intend to stay

1208
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,180
at an incredibly horrible fleabag hotel,

1209
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,800
which is not even near the theater where the movie will be premiered

1210
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,880
and the stage show performed,

1211
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,740
but does have a burn barrel in the parking lot.

1212
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,420
And we need a burn barrel in the parking lot.

1213
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,940
It could be said that the Cacophony Society,

1214
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:29,900
having...

1215
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,960
...pranked so many for so long,

1216
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:36,120
was now about to perform the ultimate prank on itself.

1217
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:48,220
Them cacophonites have been around about near as long as the sub-demuses.

1218
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,900
It's true, they have, and they've been linked in a way,

1219
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,920
doing their own thing.

1220
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:55,640
They've got a lot in common.

1221
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,220
They've got a lot of them multi-penis fellers

1222
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,080
and them one-nutted fellers.

1223
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,740
Well, a variety, the spice of life, wouldn't you say?

1224
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,140
I wouldn't know anything about that personally.

1225
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,960
All these body types.

1226
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,800
Haven't we all had to have some sort of augmentation to pass for humans?

1227
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,300
I've had a bunch of stuff removed here, oh yeah.

1228
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,980
Well, then you understand the dilemma.

1229
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,140
We must walk among them.

1230
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,660
You want to see this one back here?

1231
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,780
We must appear...

1232
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:27,940
Where they took my tails off?

1233
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:28,720
...like them.

1234
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:29,200
Oh, my God.

1235
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:29,200


1236
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:29,200


1237
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:29,200


1238
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,140
Oh, God, they didn't do that until I was 14 years old.

1239
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,180
I can feel every stroke of that saw.

1240
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:39,580
I'm sorry to cause you to feel these terrible things once more.

1241
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:45,180
But in Dobstown, all sins will be forgotten and forgiven.

1242
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:47,820
Took six weeks to unwind that worm out of my leg.

1243
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:52,800
Ah, but that worm was very gratified to have had such genial a host.

1244
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,400
You did the pencil trick where you...

1245
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:54,900
You know what, though?

1246
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:58,620
When that thing was all wound up, yeah, we wound it up on a caduceus,

1247
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,400
and then we cooked it and ate it.

1248
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,860
Well, from great Mercury.

1249
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:02,240
I got most of it.

1250
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,760
Mercury carries that thing.

1251
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,340
They say that's what that symbol is based on, the guinea worm,

1252
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,860
which has to be rolled up on a stick as it emerges from the leg.

1253
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:18,120
Foolish, the sacred serpents of Aesculapius.

1254
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,180
We know that that's what they are.

1255
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:24,640
But parasitologists do like to tell that repulsive worm story.

1256
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:25,460
And who knows?

1257
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,140
Maybe it is true.

1258
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:28,480
Somewhere in the...

1259
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,640
In the labyrinth of the past,

1260
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:34,660
possibly more than one explanation is actually equally valid.

1261
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,880
Well, it could be Bob just had him a big old stick with two rattlesnakes stuck to it

1262
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,980
that he'd hit people with.

1263
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:40,580
Right.

1264
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,380
And hope it'd bite him.

1265
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,160
That's because it was written in the Book of Fate.

1266
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,940
Bob and his rattlesnake stick.

1267
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,040
But here's something...

1268
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:53,100
That was when he was pharaoh of Texas in 80,000 B.C.

1269
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,620
The bearer of the caduceus is...

1270
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,980
Texas was where Atlantis was based off.

1271
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,140
The son of Maya.

1272
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,200
That's the first country.

1273
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,520
Hermes or Mercury.

1274
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:00,980
First language.

1275
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,620
And the Roman religion.

1276
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,080
But...

1277
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:08,060
Rome is like a baby compared to Atlantis, which is Texas.

1278
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:12,120
Why do you see Apollo carrying the caduceus then?

1279
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:19,080
That is because this is a horrible mistake perpetuated by the U.S. Army Signal Corps,

1280
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,300
which in 1941, when it had to draw that symbol,

1281
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:27,180
drew Apollo holding the caduceus and not Mercury.

1282
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:33,840
As in sculptures by Giovanni de Bologna and other Renaissance prodigies,

1283
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,920
news of this incredible development is flashing around the world.

1284
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,980
Coming in from all countries.

1285
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:45,260
He's like a combination of Wikipedia and Fox News tone news.

1286
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:52,180
Also in the news, giant luminous jellyfish are scaring people in Soviet Russia,

1287
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,500
in former Soviet Russia, that is, and in the American heartland.

1288
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,640
And...

1289
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,120
Newsreels.

1290
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:03,580
A sad tale of a lost doggy and his tragic finish.

1291
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:16,160
But secretly, behind these other things, an ancient curse from England has settled over the land.

1292
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,040
I can't get my pipe lit, no matter how I try.

1293
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,140
It's as if a ghost blows it out every time.

1294
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,240
It's a curse.

1295
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,940
It's a curse on the village.

1296
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:27,400
On the whole world.

1297
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:27,800
And when you...

1298
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,340
On the whole land.

1299
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,300
Make sure you cover your yap, or else the ghost will fly in there.

1300
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,400
I've filled this zippo a hundred times, and it won't light.

1301
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,080
I can't get the pipe lit.

1302
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,460
It's my magic lucky charm.

1303
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,720
It's an evil miracle, I tell you.

1304
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:41,860
Hey.

1305
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,300
Keep your hands off me lucky charms.

1306
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,740
It's a conspiracy of witches.

1307
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,500
Yes, yes, the witches are at it again.

1308
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,920
And so here we are in merry old England,

1309
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,000
going down a traditional England lane to interview our first likely suspect,

1310
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,740
uh, she's been accused by the neighbors of witchcraft before.

1311
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:08,360
And I think her trial, uh, torture, and execution will be of great interest to viewers of Scanorama.

1312
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,740
So let's turn into this, uh, quaint old lane.

1313
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,200
Everything they say is a lie.

1314
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:21,680
My aromatherapy medicines is just as useful as their doctor's stuff and all their x-rays and everything.

1315
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,900
He says that my special scent number 12 will bring instant love.

1316
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,440
How now, thou foul beldame, thou hast convicted thyself out of thine own impure mouth.

1317
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,120
I'm a wiccan.

1318
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,960
Oh, well, she just said it.

1319
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,560
She's a witch.

1320
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,440
She's a wiccan witch.

1321
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:44,800
The only medicine I could find on the shelf at Walgreens was all homeopathic.

1322
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:47,060
Oh, well, my homies like that kind of stuff.

1323
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:47,340
Really?

1324
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,740
For this particular, I was looking for stye medicine.

1325
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,600
Time to relax.

1326
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,480
Pick off the shoes.

1327
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,180
Can't buy stye medicine without a prescription anymore.

1328
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,960
Settle back in the easy chair.

1329
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:56,620
I can't buy stye medicine without a prescription anymore.

1330
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:56,980
I can't buy stye medicine without a prescription anymore.

1331
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:56,980


1332
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:56,980


1333
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:57,680
The easy life.

1334
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,400
So you can buy five different types.

1335
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,400
Quinine is the same way.

1336
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:02,300
You can only buy homeopathic.

1337
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,720
Ah, this is living, I gotta tell you.

1338
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,780
What is going on here?

1339
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:06,540
Well, it's...

1340
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:12,240
And yet to hear the natural healer people, the conspiracy's all like, oh, big pharmaceuticals.

1341
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,460
Natural ward healers.

1342
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,140
They're not going to allow them to sell vitamin C anymore.

1343
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,380
It'll be like cocaine.

1344
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,840
People have to buy it from cartels and snort it.

1345
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,640
People buy cocaine.

1346
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,580
That's what I do with it.

1347
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,400
I snort it.

1348
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,820
People buy vitamin C.

1349
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,620
They grind it up and snort it.

1350
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,400
Yeah, they're buying it.

1351
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:29,920
Vitamin C.

1352
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,300
Vitamins will be like, they have to shoot them up.

1353
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,320
Like, uh...

1354
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,460
People watch these videos teaching people how to crack sace.

1355
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,660
I forgot about cracking sace.

1356
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,900
You're cracking safes, you say?

1357
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,620
No, cracking sace.

1358
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:53,780
People watching videos become criminals on TV by watching TV learn how to crack sace just by watching a movie.

1359
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,440
Thought crime.

1360
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,960
Yes, it doesn't matter whether or not you're a criminal.

1361
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,560
They do it.

1362
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:01,360
If they possess the ability to commit criminal acts.

1363
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:04,000
I watched that movie four or five times.

1364
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,340
I learned how to crack sace.

1365
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,560
Is that so?

1366
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:13,320
I can crack a sace in about five minutes now from watching a movie.

1367
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,020
I watched the movie about 12 times.

1368
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:22,460
Well, don't worry, because soon you will be in the kingdom of Morpheus, asleep.

1369
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,500
I'll be basking.

1370
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,940
I'll be sucking on...

1371
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,180
Morpheus's nipple.

1372
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,340
You'll be snoozing under a thick, warm coverlet in perfect tranquility,

1373
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:36,460
your head sunk into a down-stuffed pillow.

1374
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,020
I'm gonna be...

1375
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:39,020
Experiencing...

1376
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:42,740
I'm gonna be on Morpheus's bosom, crawling over towards the...

1377
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:42,880
Deep sleep.

1378
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,460
The milk of Morpheus is ambient.

1379
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,800
Calm, restful sleep.

1380
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,880
Generic name, Solpidem.

1381
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:55,340
Morpheus will be throwing sand in my eyes while I'm down there trying to nuzzle on his big old nipple.

1382
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:56,820
Sleep.

1383
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:56,820


1384
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:56,860


1385
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:56,940


1386
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:56,940


1387
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:56,940


1388
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:56,940


1389
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:56,940


1390
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:56,940


1391
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:56,940


1392
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:56,940


1393
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:56,940


1394
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:56,940


1395
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:56,940


1396
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:56,940


1397
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:56,940


1398
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,140
Nipple dispensers.

1399
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,500
Neproba make.

1400
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,560
Yes, well, um...

1401
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:03,300
Morpheus's mammograms.

1402
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,740
Mammie, mammie, mammary glands.

1403
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,780
Mammie, mammie, mammie.

1404
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:08,780
Well, uh...

1405
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:09,600
Mammary grams.

1406
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:12,160
Yes, a mammary gram to me.

1407
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:13,540
My past, also.

1408
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,760
I have received a flash.

1409
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,200
But, uh, so it is.

1410
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,480
Memory can handle these things.

1411
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,700
I guess we have to go now. It's like almost one.

1412
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,120
It's about time...

1413
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:23,920
to end...

1414
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,720
to end our broadcast day.

1415
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,840
Yes, that's right.

1416
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,960
It is the beginning...

1417
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,440
of the end of the Ask Dr. Hal show.

1418
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,460
We are about to cease.

1419
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:38,100
30 minutes to pass.

1420
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,600
Yes, to cease and desist.

1421
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,300
Yeah, we were ending 30 minutes ago.

1422
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,260
To stop, uh, completely.

1423
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,120
That was just the trailer to the beginning.

1424
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:45,580
That is to say, desist.

1425
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,240
That was the trailer to the beginning.

1426
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,960
And no more be heard on the radio.

1427
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,500
Simply to be a memory.

1428
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,940
And that so easily jostled out of place by the blare...

1429
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:56,940


1430
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:01,260
blarings of Robo DJ, our inevitable successor.

1431
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:08,080
Robo DJ is a service provided by RadioValencia.fm

1432
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:12,780
and set up by RadioValencia's own trade, Mark Gunderson.

1433
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:18,520
These selections are artificially programmed to provide the imitation,

1434
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,920
or simulacrum, of a radio station,

1435
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:25,940
even when no disc jockey, or DJ...

1436
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,760
Nobody's in control.

1437
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:28,000
...is physically present.

1438
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,620
They're out of control!

1439
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:36,280
And now you see in this file footage the light slanting through the trees

1440
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,120
and, uh, ducks in this scratchy film,

1441
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,540
bobbing on a lake because...

1442
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:44,720
Hey, that's not an American flag superimposed over that.

1443
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:45,680
What is that?

1444
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,420
No, that's, uh, just a light effect.

1445
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:50,680
That's a communist hammer and sickle thing.

1446
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,220
Now, come on, come on.

1447
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,480
We're just trying to do our standard outro.

1448
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,920
And so, on behalf of the staff and management of the, uh, radio station,

1449
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,180
the, uh, management of the, uh, building,

1450
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,180
the location of the radio station,

1451
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:07,840
which has to remain secret from the time being,

1452
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,860
and the people who will eventually start the transmitter up again,

1453
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,620
wherever it may be,

1454
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,100
so that this is real radio and not simply a podcast,

1455
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,360
into the hands of the almighty spirit,

1456
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,140
we place these things.

1457
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,460
And, uh...

1458
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:30,600
On behalf of the Ask Dr. Hal show,

1459
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,940
live on radio,

1460
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:42,980
we wish you a profound good night and good morning.

1461
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:07,800
Thank you very much for listening.

1462
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:07,800


1463
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,460
Thank you.

1464
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,000
Bye-bye.

1465
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:13,300
Bye-bye.

1466
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,140
Bye.

1467
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,780
Bye.

1468
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:18,100


1469
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:18,240
Bye.

1470
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:18,240


1471
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:18,240


1472
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:18,240


1473
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:18,240


1474
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:18,240


1475
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:18,240


1476
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:18,240


1477
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:18,240


1478
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:18,240


1479
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:18,240


1480
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:18,460
Bye.

1481
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:19,260


1482
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:19,260


1483
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:19,260


1484
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:19,420


1485
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,560
Bye.

1486
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,360
Bye.
