1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Let's go to the Gigolo Club over in Yancey.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,220
They got a...

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,200
Some genius power of...

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:06,980
What?

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,140
I say this calls for action, and now, nip it in the bud!

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,080
Ah, shut up!

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,600
What did Bob say about me?

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,740
Bob wants you to give me all your Star Wars action figures!

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,400
Bob wants pizza!

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,040
Bob wants burritos!

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,980
Gimme Bob, gimme Bob!

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,720
Bob wants you to move your car out of his parking spot!

13
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:38,600
Bob is concerned that you were in a turning lane, but you didn't turn right instead,

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,480
drove fast, and cut me off every afternoon on Barham!

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,080
Bob demands you use local references when you can!

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,520
Bob wants your children, Bob wants your children, Bob wants your children

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,840
to stop running round and touching my stuff at the laundromat!

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,080
Bob wants you to use local references when you can!

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,400
Hello, Connie.

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,260
Bob!

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,800
I'm so glad!

22
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,780
You're glad? How do you think I feel?

23
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,280
You're just as good as new again.

24
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,840
Stop kidding.

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,760
Why are you kidding?

26
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,060
In high society, I just ain't the type.

27
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,460
Folks all look so surprised when I lighten my pipe.

28
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:21,800
Yes!

29
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,220
Oh, yeah.

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,920
Do you...

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,400
smoke a pipe, too?

32
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,160
Oh, don't be coy. I like it, too.

33
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,960
What's it gonna get you, Connie?

34
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,600
All this business of filling my pipe,

35
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,100
pouring my drinks, corned beef, and cabbage?

36
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,280
I suppose I should pretend that I don't know what you mean by that.

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,460
But I won't.

38
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,400
Connie, look, for the past few days, all you've done is...

39
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,300
All I've done is what?

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,240
Well, is to tell a man in a thousand little ways.

41
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,080
To tell what man in a thousand little ways?

42
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,060
Well, not with words, maybe, but with looks,

43
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,980
actions, and...

44
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,860
Aren't you ashamed?

45
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,160
All right, maybe you say I'm wrong.

46
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,280
A partner in sin?

47
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,180
There was an influence there.

48
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,800
Sometimes there is a mood that just...

49
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,320
We don't know why.

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,700
You wouldn't get a pal, would you, Connie?

51
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,440
Or yourself, maybe?

52
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,880
I don't know yet, Bob.

53
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:23,820
Oh!

54
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:24,660
Oh!

55
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,500
Oh!

56
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,060
Oh!

57
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,460
Oh!

58
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,100
Oh!

59
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:28,300


60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,640
Oh, it just goes into tune.

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:28,640


62
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:28,640


63
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:28,640


64
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:28,640


65
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:28,640


66
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:28,640


67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:28,640


68
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,020
Two boys allen!

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,280
But this isn't essential, insulting, annoying.

70
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,320
And I'm touched because a single girl esas anyhow.

71
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,720
I'm dere terminate, and I mean it.

72
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,820
I mean, hey Babe.

73
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,300
I mean, my story is all, it's just based on your stupid mistakes and orphans

74
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,320
that power and sub creep sensingsike лю bild-

75
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,400
Did you hear that?

76
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,380
I'm happy you're in love.

77
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:54,600
I'm happy to be with that little hunk!!!!

78
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,820
V.D.?

79
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,200
You mean to say that Bob has actually had one of those horrible diseases?

80
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,200
That isn't true, Doctor.

81
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,400
Is that true, Bob?

82
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,660
All right, if you must know, I did have it.

83
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,120
But it's no worse than having an illegitimate child.

84
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,360
I think it is.

85
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,180
Why, I'd sooner marry a leper.

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,940
Thank you for letting me know about this in time, Dr. West.

87
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,540
And now I'm going out into the clean, fresh air.

88
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,740
Well, there went my happy wedding right out the door.

89
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,400
I'm terribly sorry, Bob.

90
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,300
Ah, dear Donald.

91
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,900
Just grab the right-of-scout shaker up and down a bit and chop off the slack.

92
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:39,860
Come on.

93
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,720
Damn, this streaking out pit, we'll finally blame it on God.

94
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,700
And there'll be some kind of church started called the Streaker's Church.

95
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:48,900
Yeah.

96
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,320
Yeah.

97
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,480
Yeah.

98
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:49,520
Yeah.

99
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:49,520


100
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:49,520


101
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,520
Oh, they'll just, they'll, they'll follow, try to make it religious.

102
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:57,020
But I want to tell you it's abominable, and it's filthy, and it's rotten.

103
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,120
And we ought to stand up against it.

104
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,380
Say amen, you know it's so.

105
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,960
The pipes, we need a jolly life, jolly life.

106
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,600
We're free from every garret stripe, garret stripe.

107
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,480
We drink the best of that.

108
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,440
We drink the best of that.

109
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,180
I'm glad that this gay life is mine.

110
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,180
In the name of fingers, waters, dirty birdie,

111
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,180
Holland, no sterling beef, or chemist, drink ye, drink ye.

112
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,300
In the name of mystic, Myron, Tucker, Tolan,

113
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,800
Baddus, O'Ringan, O'George, E3.

114
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,400
Oh, smiling.

115
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,720
No, Nick, Bob, Cobra, Bart, Nick, no, T.O.

116
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,420
Golden, throw to John A.D.

117
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:40,740
If you understand that we have all had a partner in sin, you really didn't do it by yourself.

118
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,320
There was an influence there.

119
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:42,940
Thank you, Bob.

120
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,140
Thank you, Bob.

121
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,180
Thank you, Bob.

122
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,220
Now we shop at Neiman Marcus instead of K. Martin Sears.

123
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,020
We go on Neiman Marcus, and as soon as they spotted us, and I was there last year, they

124
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,180
said, hi, Bob and Bonnie, how are you?

125
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:55,960
They remembered us.

126
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,420
And so on the back, they take you in the back and they have drinks for you, whatever it

127
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,980
is, scotch, whiskey, whatever you want, and I asked for the usual.

128
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,580
If you drink five gallons of Gatorade, you're going to expend five gallons of Gatorade somewhere

129
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,760
in one of these restaurants.

130
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,180
And I said, no, I don't want that.

131
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,180


132
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,180


133
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,180


134
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,180


135
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,180


136
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,180


137
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,180


138
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,680
You buy that, right?

139
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,760
Frankly, either way it's a little tough.

140
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,140
Let's get this on the other side.

141
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,040
We went 15% and did some crazy things, and we went direct.

142
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,420
And I can remember going direct, and I can remember standing up on stage and putting

143
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,360
the microphone up to my mouth, and nothing came out.

144
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,580
And I went, oh my God.

145
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,520
No, Connie, no!

146
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,860
We'll spice the flame out of my butt.

147
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,420
It really isn't all that bad.

148
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,980
Hope you understand that there's nothing more liberating than being able to pee and poop your own diaper.

149
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,780
I love a bob.

150
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,180
Yeah!

151
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah!

152
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,040
Come on.

153
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,980
Yeah, what's the matter with that?

154
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:04,920
Disgusting.

155
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,380
Don't ever ask me to do that again.

156
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,540
You just have to be careful.

157
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,020
You always think about, you know, getting poop on the finger, you know.

158
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,760
And I remember the first time it happened.

159
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,220
I couldn't believe it.

160
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,900
I mean, it's like, oh my God.

161
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,600
I've got poop on my finger.

162
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,820
And then I started thinking to myself, it could be worse.

163
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,560
I could have a job.

164
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,820
I don't think I can.

165
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,080
I just can't do it.

166
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,900
And I said to Bobby, please don't ever make me do that again.

167
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,360
Don't call me Bobby.

168
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,720
No!

169
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,400
No, Connie, no!

170
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,100
Call me, call me, dear.

171
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,800
Don't ever, ever go.

172
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,940
You're my God.

173
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,440
I need you, my God.

174
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,780
I need you.

175
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,320
Oh, my God.

176
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,340
No, Connie, no!

177
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:01,700
No!

178
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,160
Night and day, under the height of me.

179
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,680
There's oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me.

180
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,560
And the storm and warm be through.

181
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,560
Do you let me spend my life making love to you night and day?

182
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,300
Oh, day and night.

183
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,040
Night and day.

184
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,820
Night and day.

185
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,180
They won't believe that.

186
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,840
They will when they hear the things you and Bob said to each other the other night in Irene's apartment.

187
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,400
Test, test.

188
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:59,820
We're testing the windscreen, the new Subgenius Foundation corporate windscreen on the Zaphodian digital recorder.

189
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,120
And we're at Stang Ranch still.

190
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:12,940
In fact, we just finished excavating a little bit and then taking drone pictures of the dinosaur tracks.

191
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,620
Down here in Onion Flats Creek, we might call it.

192
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,220
Let's name that because there's wild onions growing everywhere you look.

193
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,380
Princess Wee has a bag of them that we'll have in our salad tonight.

194
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,060
I mean, it really, really, really stinks of raw onions down here.

195
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,620
It's great.

196
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,440
If you like raw onions, it's fabulous.

197
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,520
And I'm looking at some dinosaur tracks that belong to us.

198
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,660
They're on.

199
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,140
The cult compound property.

200
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,400
And this area is famous for dinosaur tracks.

201
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,780
And in fact, SMU came and took one away.

202
00:08:53,380 --> 00:09:00,180
It's easy to find a spot because there's a big square taken out of the middle of the creek rock.

203
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,400
What's SMU?

204
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,700
Southern Mesodist University.

205
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:04,780
Oh, okay.

206
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:12,660
And the dinosaur tracks are not huge, but they are three toed theropod.

207
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,260
There's no question.

208
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:22,200
There's a whole series of three or four clear ones and some mushy ones that are certainly tracks.

209
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,100
They just don't really look that cool.

210
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,940
The problem is there's still water in the creek just a little bit.

211
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,300
And the tracks were full of algae and scum.

212
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:39,340
And you could not tell they were there until I waded in barefoot for the first time in my life with a broom, which we carried down here.

213
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,440
We had to hike in with the drone.

214
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,520
And we had to hike in with the drone and brooms and all kinds of things.

215
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,800
And we hopefully brought a gallon of clean water.

216
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,000
We thought we might be able to just wash them out.

217
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,500
But there's too much water present in the creek.

218
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,980
Yeah, we were hoping it would be dry.

219
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:07,060
But I did, after brushing the dinosaur tracks out with the broom and getting the crud and pebbles out and clearing the area around them, you can definitely see them.

220
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,740
Even in photographs.

221
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,820
For sure.

222
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,060
For sure.

223
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:17,240
A big dinosaur trod here when it was a beach a hundred million years ago or so.

224
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,500
Acrocanthosaurus is the one that's famous for leaving tracks in the Paluxy.

225
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,540
Maybe this is the same guy?

226
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,340
Maybe.

227
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:27,900
But I don't know.

228
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,840
Could be.

229
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,220
Maybe they're fresher than we think.

230
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,440
And the beast of Hollow Mountain lives inside Dockstock Mountain.

231
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,720
Maybe the beast from 20,000 Fathoms.

232
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,240
Is really the beast from Dammit's hidey hole.

233
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:45,920
Could be.

234
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,480
Maybe the thing that would not die was really the thing in the woods here.

235
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,420
Yes.

236
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:59,500
The thing that you almost see, but it always vanishes just as you're turning around in the woods.

237
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,460
The Gaius Gudis.

238
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:06,760
That's the name of the creature that lives in the woods out here.

239
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,780
The Gaius Gudis.

240
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,720
You may have heard of them.

241
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,020
But you've never seen a picture of one.

242
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,300
Because no one's ever been able to get a picture.

243
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,880
You never quite see them.

244
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,040
They're just flashing behind a tree just when you look.

245
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,800
Fools think they're Bigfoot.

246
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,440
You know, oh Bigfoot's out here.

247
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,840
He's lightning fast.

248
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,160
He's camouflaged.

249
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,360
You never see him.

250
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,220
That's really it.

251
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,300
Well that may be so.

252
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,080
Maybe yes, maybe no.

253
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,900
But if Bigfoot was out here we'd smell frop real strong.

254
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,700
And I don't smell frop.

255
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,740
I don't either.

256
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,280
No.

257
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:43,760
No.

258
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,320
Although, there is a cure for that.

259
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:58,620
Well, I guess we'll have to sign off here at Onion Flats, the Dinosaur Tracks,

260
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,820
Stang Ranch, Stangsville, Stang County, Texas.

261
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,700
Price Bob.

262
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,300
Copy that over and out.

263
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,980
There we go.

264
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,320
Dearekh, there we go again.

265
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,320


266
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,320


267
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,320


268
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,320


269
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,440
President Stang KK Creepuip Psych registered it this Friday.

270
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:28,440


271
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:28,840
PolyGuys apologize.

272
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:28,960
Spill.

273
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,380
Filming says the actor isn't the afternoon 800 page entertainer.

274
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:31,380


275
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:31,620
The reagaves will contain images that'll beЛѓЛїВХЕasyma.wikideofscript for the studio's futureThe facts related to statements and are not on display during this recording.

276
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:38,580
The 28th The Big juntane the Top of Mind and monitor the absence for argument ligue that we've seen today a ton of change from city to city to city is up north 56.

277
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,640
Your information is not available for investigation yet.

278
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,220
guitar solo

279
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,660
guitar solo

280
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,620
guitar solo

281
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,840
Here I look there, I look everywhere

282
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,160
Oh, Footfoot, why can't I find you?

283
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,280
Footfoot, where can you be?

284
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,820
Footfoot, why won't you answer me?

285
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,980
Footfoot, where can you be?

286
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,640
Footfoot, I didn't like to roam so well

287
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,440
He would still have a place to dwell

288
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,520
Footfoot, please answer me

289
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,000
I know where you are, you're behind that tree

290
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,840
Footfoot, please come to me

291
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,440
Footfoot, now that you're here

292
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,660
What does it mean?

293
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,580
That you will never again roam

294
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,140
Footfoot!

295
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,640
Footfoot!

296
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,620
Footfoot!

297
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,080
Footfoot!

298
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,280
Footfoot!

299
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,300
Footfoot!

300
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,540
It's a modern day

301
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,760
It's the modern age

302
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,880
Footfoot!

303
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,580
It's the modern day

304
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,400
Footfoot!

305
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,940
It's the mind

306
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,320
It's the mind

307
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:07,340
It's the mind

308
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,600
It's the mind

309
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,280
It's the mind

310
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:04,280
It's the mind

311
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:10,980
It's the mind

312
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,260
It's the mind

313
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,080
It's the mind

314
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,400
The moment

315
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,240
It's the moment

316
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,680
It's the moment

317
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,240
Thank you.

318
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,680
It's done.

319
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:51,920
It's done.

320
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:58,920
It's done.

321
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,640
It's done.

322
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,140
Oh, yes.

323
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,940
That was Rural War Room, my friends.

324
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,020
Beautiful Rural War Room, our friends in Arkansas.

325
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:37,640
Before that, we heard the Rudy Schwartz Project covering a song by the Shags.

326
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,900
Can you believe that?

327
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,180
My pal Foot Foot.

328
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,380
There was also a quick little recording of our dog, Dammit, howling there.

329
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:55,940
There was a beautiful instrumental by Reverend Jimmy Ryan, who is doing instrumentals these days.

330
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,000
He always has, but he's doing them solo, and we have a zillion of them.

331
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,800
Obviously, we're not really still in Stang Ranch.

332
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,420
We're back in Cleveland here.

333
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,760
Oh, before all that music, we heard a song.

334
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,080
We heard a song.

335
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,080


336
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,080


337
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,080


338
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,080


339
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,080


340
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,080


341
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,680
We heard a collage of Bob and Connie clips.

342
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:20,480
All of that was put together by Reverend Susie the Floozy for her wonderful show from Atlanta,

343
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,060
WREK Atlanta, where she does Bob's Slack Time Fun House.

344
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,620
That collage was lovely.

345
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

346
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,440
Praise Susie.

347
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,480
Praise Susie.

348
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:35,660
And there was a new short Bob song, Bob Wants You, right there at the very beginning.

349
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,400
That was Morgan Gutentag, who did that.

350
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:45,460
And the titles, of course, as always, almost always by Leemur.

351
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:54,040
And we're not in Stang Ranch, but we should be hearing the sound effects of beautiful Stang Ranch.

352
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,620
All right, there we go.

353
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,680
Now there's sound.

354
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,480
There we are.

355
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,020
Okay.

356
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,480
We're expecting our friend Lungs and Cowboy Dave to call in soon.

357
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,440
Oh, a storm's coming in.

358
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,500
Princess, we'd better get under shelter.

359
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,100
Okay.

360
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,240
Big old Texas lightning.

361
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,160
Big old thunderstorms coming up.

362
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,120
All right.

363
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,180
Rain could be deadly.

364
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,500
Hail.

365
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:17,920
Tornadoes.

366
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,120
You never know what you're going to get.

367
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,260
I know that you and Dammit will protect me.

368
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:22,860
Yeah.

369
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,740
Darn it, we sure will.

370
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,080
Later on, we'll close with another song from Rudy Schwartz Project.

371
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:38,040
He's got a new album out, a collection called Sunshine Supers Hits.

372
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,380
Oh, my gosh.

373
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,780
That's the way I prefer to pronounce it on the radio these days.

374
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,980
He covered a whole bunch of 60s and 70s bubblegum songs.

375
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,560
Build Me Up Buttercup is the one that we'll be closing with tonight, I hope.

376
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:04,420
If the rain would finally quit, we'd be able to fire up the gas-powered record player.

377
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,000
Get that thing running.

378
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,280
Ooh, it's cold.

379
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,080
It is.

380
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,640
Wet and damp.

381
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,740
But we'll make it.

382
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,520
We'll make it through.

383
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:24,260
President Lonesome Cowboy Dave was asking me what the subject matter was going to be for tonight.

384
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,260
I said, I don't know.

385
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:31,300
I said, if we talked about Donald Trump, we'd sound just like every other show in the media.

386
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,380
See you there.

387
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,120
I went and did it.

388
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,220
I went and did it already.

389
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,240
Now, didn't I told him, give me a couple of minutes?

390
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,000
Well.

391
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,040
Oh, there we go.

392
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,640
Here we go.

393
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,360
Let's try this.

394
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,340
We go like that.

395
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,440
And then do we hear it?

396
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,540
No, you can't.

397
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,340
Oh, darn.

398
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,320
That's just what I was afraid of.

399
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,520
You're wearing one of them special beastie shirts with a large nipple overhang.

400
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,340
That's the reason why you've got all these psychological problems.

401
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,040
People calling you from all parts of the country should know the different parts of that.

402
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,740
Oh, there's all kinds of people in this country.

403
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,880
Comers and goers.

404
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,580
Beastie nipple shirt.

405
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,380
Some are.

406
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,200
Empty nesters.

407
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,320
Willie heads.

408
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,500
Willie heads.

409
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,660
Sometimes they spell empty nesters.

410
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,620
They spell nesters.

411
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,700
N-E-S-T-O-R.

412
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,680
That means he's got crew in here.

413
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,380
Or he's a fanatic or something.

414
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,300
Crazy as a Bessie bug, we used to say.

415
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,340
What the hell's a Bessie bug?

416
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:32,240
Well, if you don't know, then you must be that crazy.

417
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,500
Mad as a hornet.

418
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,300
You have to look it up in your funk and waggle.

419
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,720
Tight as a tick.

420
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,380
Well, it sounds like I'm just a little bit crazy.

421
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:39,380


422
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:39,380


423
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:39,380


424
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,960
It's been expunged from the human race, and I still don't know what a damn Bessie bug is.

425
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,600
Listen to that old Dave.

426
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,220
He can sure pull up a pulpit now, can't he?

427
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,140
Yes, he can.

428
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,780
He can talk up a toe sack.

429
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,460
He can tongue tomatoes off the vine.

430
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,320
Words come out of him like water pouring out of a bucket.

431
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,880
But it don't make any sense in reality.

432
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,700
That's the problem I've been finding.

433
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,220
Well, it's just a matter of language, Dave.

434
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,160
I mean.

435
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,100
Oh, semantics.

436
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,220
Hyper semantics.

437
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,780
Yeah, I'm glad you're talking about the hyper ones.

438
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,080
They're so much easier to take than the retroactive ones.

439
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,480
Oh, some people never said pea turkey.

440
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,260
Pea turkey?

441
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:23,760
Right.

442
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,260
What's that?

443
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,280
I don't know.

444
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,780
But whatever it is, it's cold as blue fluggins.

445
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:38,680
I'm reading a book I picked up at my late dad's house called Southern Saiyans for Yankees.

446
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,380
Another interesting book.

447
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:39,380


448
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,900
Immigrants by Bill Dwyer.

449
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,960
That's Reverend Chainsmurker.

450
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,100
Why, that guy all this time he's been acting like an Australian.

451
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,140
And he was really this southern dude right now.

452
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,320
Yeah, it's Southern Saiyans.

453
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,260
I can vaguely put together what you just said about being Australian and stuff.

454
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,760
But aren't they two different age groups?

455
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,260
I mean, one of them is like a form of chimpanzee.

456
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,380
The other is a form of like a reptile.

457
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,940
No, no, no.

458
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,260
Australians are humans just like humans.

459
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,400
Mostly.

460
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,400
Except for the subgeniuses.

461
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,500
You know, there's some Australians that are obviously they're subgeniuses.

462
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,580
You can't quite.

463
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,280
Most people would think they were humans.

464
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,040
At first, anyway.

465
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,200
Yeah.

466
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,560
Until you get to know them.

467
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,360
Then you start going, I don't know what kind of person that is.

468
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,520
Yeah, what kind of mammal or woolly reptile?

469
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,680
He's got the raisin of a hog.

470
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,380
That aggro-provoking old bug.

471
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,660
I'm the greatest one of all because I'm a wild boar.

472
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,020
I wasn't going to say anything.

473
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,220
Maybe we'd need background music instead of this.

474
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,080
He makes you weep a lot of times, you know.

475
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,780
You think about the hour of slack and you start weeping like a little baby dog or something.

476
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,580
Why did you call us babies?

477
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,720
He called us babies.

478
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,640
He called me a baby.

479
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,500
I didn't mean that.

480
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,380
He called me a baby.

481
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,780
That's assault.

482
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,460
That's assault.

483
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,260
Calling people names.

484
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,340
That's assaulting them.

485
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,280
No, that's a soft tissue remark.

486
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,480
When you speak of hypergender or gender going to the bathroom and stuff,

487
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,420
is it still called like a BLT or something like that?

488
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,640
Is it named after a sandwich?

489
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:38,340
I've heard that there's a lot of upsetness about that over in some of those southern states.

490
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,380
I've not heard that.

491
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,840
I've noticed mostly southern ones.

492
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:47,980
In North Carolina, they won't let you have a lettuce, tomato, and bacon sandwich in certain rooms.

493
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:48,640
That's right.

494
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:54,140
Because it might see the ham sandwich in the other stall.

495
00:27:54,780 --> 00:28:02,060
You know, God forbid that a ham sandwich be in the same bathroom stall next to a bacon sandwich.

496
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:07,300
So you're kind of like comparing salted deli meats or something like that, right?

497
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,280
Why not?

498
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,200
Why not?

499
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:09,560
Both.

500
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,520
I said, why not?

501
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,660
Why can't you put your...

502
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:11,920
Assaulted deli meats.

503
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,960
Slap your ham and your bacon together.

504
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,120
That's how bacon is made.

505
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,940
That's like...

506
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,420
Where do you think bacon, little baby, bacons come from?

507
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,780
They come from little cellophane-wrapped packages at the store.

508
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,780
Those are called pigs.

509
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,600
Or assaulted deli meats.

510
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,860
That's assault.

511
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,660
That's assault.

512
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,300
Assaulted deli...

513
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,960
Assaulted deli meats, yeah.

514
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,920
And candied.

515
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,120
Candied hams.

516
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,020
Candied bacon.

517
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,160
Candied bacon.

518
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,680
Bacon's got sugar all through it, right?

519
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,200
Mm-hmm.

520
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:41,860
Mm-hmm.

521
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,700
That's why people like it.

522
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:42,740
I'll sue it.

523
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,020
I'm sorry.

524
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,780
I shouldn't be doing the southern side.

525
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:44,960
I'll sue it, yeah.

526
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,620
It's got...

527
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,920
Bacon's got sugar all through it.

528
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,840
It's cured with sugar sometimes.

529
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,520
It's cured with salt and sugar.

530
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,620
Sometimes it's just cured like with hickory smoke.

531
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,220
Mm-hmm.

532
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,920
Sometimes it's cured with chemotherapy or ice-cold water.

533
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,220
Did you say hemo-therapy?

534
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,220
Uh, hemo.

535
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:09,000
That's when your blood vessels get constricted and you fart inadvertently in public places.

536
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,200
But you can at home.

537
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:10,880
It's forbidden.

538
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,720
I'll take a pass on that.

539
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,020
I don't like that kind of bacon, I don't think.

540
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,180
Well, it tastes great going down, believe me.

541
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,160
It's wonderful.

542
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:20,880
Mm.

543
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,480
Listen, that sizzle-sozzle still coming down.

544
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,820
All that rain, it's about putting me half to sleep.

545
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,040
Mm.

546
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,300
Is it really...

547
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,600
Is it flooding there in Cleveland?

548
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:32,880
It's, uh...

549
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,400
It's...

550
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,580
No, no, not at all.

551
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,960
There's a burbling brook running through the radio station right now.

552
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,000
Mm-hmm.

553
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,520
It's a lovely little grotto we're in with some...

554
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,120
I know, I noticed that.

555
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,300
The clearest, cleanest water running out.

556
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,060
It's coming right out of the rocks.

557
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,280
Mm.

558
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,360
Coming out of the walls.

559
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,620
There's a cherubim's fountain and there's a Neptune's oracle fountain.

560
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,880
And they're all spitting out beautiful ice-cold, crystal-clear water from deep inside the earth

561
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,820
that's really, like, you know, pure and stuff like that.

562
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,020
And it reminds us of our...

563
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,760
Dave's putting ideas into my head.

564
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,480
Yeah.

565
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:08,480


566
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,000
Yeah.

567
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,000


568
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,000


569
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,000


570
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,000


571
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,000


572
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,000


573
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,000


574
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,000


575
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,100
We were talking about how we needed benches and little metal benches that are grottos.

576
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,300
Uh-huh.

577
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,620
And little cherubim.

578
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:21,160
But we weren't thinking about fountains, concrete fountains with little naked chairbobs, you

579
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,300
know, spraying water out of some...

580
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,100
Their lips or their something.

581
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:25,960
That did it?

582
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,600
Into the...

583
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,520
Yeah, into the fountain and then back into the creek again.

584
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,580
Now, that would be, like, real...

585
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,980
How do we get power down there to the...

586
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,320
We'd have to run...

587
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:37,560
You don't have to.

588
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,400
You'd have to have a pump.

589
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,300
No, just use the natural...

590
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,900
The chairbob would need a pump.

591
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,820
Use the gravity...

592
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,940
The gravity force.

593
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,740
Just have a natural running fountain.

594
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,440
You need a sump pump.

595
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,720
And I don't see how gravity's going to make that work.

596
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,820
It's just not hypothetically...

597
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,900
There's a lot of...

598
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:03,260
We're going to need a lot of money, actually, for all of the statuary that we need in our yard,

599
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,440
in the new church headquarters driveway.

600
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,660
And these would be lined with big...

601
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,340
Little horsemen.

602
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,920
Your disease unit number three.

603
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,520
What?

604
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,760
He's talking about the different statuary.

605
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,940
Different models.

606
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,120
That we're going to be needing.

607
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,540
Well, there would be a big statue of you, Dave.

608
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,920
Does that change your mind?

609
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,260
That'd be a lonesome cowboy, at least a bust.

610
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,760
Of course it does.

611
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,760
Are you going to show a big, like, you know, a full front of a large flabby navel or something?

612
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,420
You know...

613
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,220
No, it would probably be your head.

614
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,740
Oh, no.

615
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,220
Your noble face.

616
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,880
Oh, no.

617
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,700
Yeah, we carve it into one of the mountains out there.

618
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,340
Yes.

619
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,720
Like those...

620
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,640
Mount Rushman.

621
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,640
Yeah, Mount Rushman.

622
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,060
John Rushman or whatever its name is.

623
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:58,580
Well, and there's some earnest old white man who is dynamiting a mountain in the Black Hills

624
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,320
to look like a crazy horse, I think.

625
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,280
The Native American hero crazy horse, right?

626
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,400
Yeah.

627
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,480
But the local Lakota, of course, are going,

628
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,520
no, please don't turn our sacred mountain into a picture of crazy horse.

629
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,680
That's just the kind of thing a white guy would do.

630
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,120
Please don't.

631
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,960
But he died, but his family, I think, is still out there.

632
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,560
They're working on the part underneath the crazy horse's arm now.

633
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,360
It's really big.

634
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,040
It's the whole top half of a crazy horse and part of a horse.

635
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,560
The horse isn't crazy.

636
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,460
The guy's crazy.

637
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,460
He's crazy to fight the same army.

638
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,460
I think of conspiracy white people that were coming in at that time.

639
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:41,980
Goodness.

640
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,920
Of course, then there was the conspiracy Lakota that you had.

641
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,020
Even the Lakota had their own pink boys.

642
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,360
Everybody has their own.

643
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:55,500
You know, about half the people are going to be just nice and sweet as can be,

644
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,860
heart big as a coot gizzard,

645
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,980
and other ones are just going to be slippery as pig salve,

646
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,340
just nasty old fuddle fussers.

647
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,220
I hate you, Dad.

648
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,660
I hate you.

649
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,280
Go ahead and take the rug off, Dave.

650
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,080
Say what you mean.

651
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,800
Take the rug off?

652
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,800
Take the rag off.

653
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,700
Take the rug off.

654
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,800
This is our slack.

655
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,040
We're here to cut people some slack.

656
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,200
We don't want you to feel like you're in low cotton,

657
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,720
just joing along on the down go.

658
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,020
We want you feeling like you're drunk as a coot,

659
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,220
only you don't have to get drunk.

660
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,220
You don't have to get cat-goggling drunk just to have slack.

661
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,200
Cat-doggling?

662
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:36,540
Cat-goggling?

663
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,240
Cat-goggling?

664
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,060
Cat-goggling.

665
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,600
Cat-goggling.

666
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,300
Cat-a-goggling.

667
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:40,420
Cat-a-goggling.

668
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,060
It's also another form of communication.

669
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,880
No, I'm sorry.

670
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,840
I didn't mean to say that,

671
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,980
and I forget myself for not saying it.

672
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,200
Well, I don't care or hate.

673
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,880
Well, I don't have it in front of me right now.

674
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,220
I mean, it's got something there.

675
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,360
I don't know what it might be.

676
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,020
No, see, I have this script of Southern Saiyans.

677
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,680
He was so wet, Paul was shooting wild ducks in the parlor.

678
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,480
Oh, no.

679
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,080
Hit was...

680
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,560
Hit was so wet.

681
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,460
Hit was so wet, Paul was shooting wild ducks in the parlor.

682
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,480
His head was so diseased,

683
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,700
he got caught in a pawpaw patch eating greens by Susie

684
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:15,960
or something.

685
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,840
Well, he just got a head full of stump water.

686
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,940
Well, that's what he'd been drinking from the branch

687
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,800
instead of the river.

688
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,180
That comes when your eye sockets melt

689
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,700
and blend into the background scenery.

690
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:32,080
Now, you know, if you take stump water off a stump at midnight

691
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,840
and put it on a wart,

692
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,060
it'll make the wart...

693
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,540
It'll make the warts go away.

694
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:37,740
That's true.

695
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,680
It'll make Jesus cry, too.

696
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,680
And the virgin Aborigines will also be, you know,

697
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,860
in a sweat lodge and stuff, maybe.

698
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:49,320
I didn't know that the stump water had such far-reaching effects

699
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,800
besides wart removal.

700
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:51,720
Oh, I didn't know that was a deed.

701
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,040
It's known throughout the land.

702
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,040
It's the kickable joy juice, they used to call it,

703
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,920
when the eyeballs used to blend into the background.

704
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:00,640
Remember?

705
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,000
Don't you?

706
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:02,700
How?

707
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:03,940
How?

708
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,700
How?

709
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,180
How?

710
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,060
How?

711
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,060


712
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,060


713
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,060


714
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,060


715
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,060


716
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,060


717
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,060


718
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,060


719
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,060


720
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,060


721
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,060


722
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,060


723
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,060


724
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,060


725
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,180
Listen to that old Dave.

726
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,820
He's just crazy old Dave, ain't he?

727
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,500
He's just crazy as a Bessie bug.

728
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,960
He is crazy as a Bessie bug.

729
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,760
You know, you're one of those guys

730
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,540
that probably would have made fun of DeFuerer

731
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,960
back in the day, you know, man?

732
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,060
I'm gonna make fun of DeFuerer.

733
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,240
He's the DeFuerer we get.

734
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,860
I'm gonna, whether it's a he-Fuerer or a she-Fuerer,

735
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,180
I'm gonna make fun of him.

736
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,960
And so will I.

737
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,980
As long as they...

738
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,080
As long as I can.

739
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,560
Until DeFuerer puts me in the jailhouse

740
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,060
for talking with my big mouth,

741
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,780
on the radio about DeFuerer.

742
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,460
Because DeFuerer, there's some of those Fuerers

743
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,420
don't think that you should be allowed

744
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,940
to say bad things on the media.

745
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,600
No, they could have DeFuerer with you

746
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,240
for talking about DeFuerer.

747
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,960
Yeah, they don't think you should be allowed

748
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,420
to say disrespectful things about them in the media

749
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,700
once you become the leader, DeFuerer.

750
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,960
Then they can't talk bad about you.

751
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,300
Right.

752
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,960
Do you love the song by Spike Jonze,

753
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,080
DeFuerer's Face?

754
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,560
I love it.

755
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,460
In the high, high, right in DeFuerer's face.

756
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:05,800
DeFuerer's face?

757
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,080
Now, see, if we were cool,

758
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,900
well, if this was Puzzling Evidence Show,

759
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,900
Philo would have that song pulled up on his iPhone

760
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,360
that fast,

761
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,260
and he'd be playing it into the microphone.

762
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,800
And you'd like to run away.

763
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,060
Now, let me see if I can do that.

764
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,060
Well, I looked up Bessie Bug.

765
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,420
I was sitting here looking at all kinds of Bessie Bugs,

766
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,080
but I couldn't show my pictures to the listener.

767
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,880
I was only looking at them on my little phone.

768
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,440
You were looking at that picture of the salamander

769
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,540
out of the Smith Ranch.

770
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,600
I mean, the...

771
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,480
The barnyard cathedral there, wherever it was.

772
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,180
Oh, I have looked at that salamander,

773
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,620
and also at little lizards that lived around the house,

774
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,680
and other ones that we found down by the creek,

775
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,920
and white ones that were on the white rocks,

776
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,440
and there were just all kinds of wonderful creatures there.

777
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,740
Right, right, right.

778
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,360
Right, right, right.

779
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,940
Right, right, right.

780
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,640
Right, right, right.

781
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,440
Right, right, right.

782
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,160
Right, right, right.

783
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,480
Right, right, right.

784
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,300
I did it.

785
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,940
You certainly did.

786
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,300
I'm as tricky as Philo.

787
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,020
You're as tricky as Richard Adolph.

788
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,740
I can type in my phone real quick.

789
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,020
Here's a Trump song.

790
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,440
Here's a Trump song.

791
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,060
I'm going to...

792
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:28,260
Shh.

793
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,360
Shh.

794
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:30,460


795
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:30,520


796
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:32,740
Shh.

797
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:32,960


798
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:32,980
Shh.

799
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:32,980


800
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:32,980


801
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:32,980


802
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,300
Shh.

803
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:33,640


804
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:33,640


805
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:33,660


806
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:33,660


807
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:33,660


808
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:33,660


809
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:33,740
Shh.

810
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:34,200


811
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:34,200


812
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:34,200


813
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:34,200


814
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:44,160
When her girl says, we own the world in space, we pile, pile, right in her girl's face.

815
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:51,160
When her girl says, she'll never bomb this place, we pile, pile, right in her girl's face.

816
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,080
Are we not the Superman?

817
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,760
Are you pure Superman?

818
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,080
Yeah, we are Superman.

819
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,060
Super-duper Superman.

820
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,040
Is this Nazi land so good?

821
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,760
Would you leave it if you could?

822
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,460
Yeah, this Nazi land is good.

823
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,140
We believe in it, we could.

824
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,640
We bring the world to order.

825
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,020
I'll hit this world to order.

826
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:17,440
Everyone of foreign race will love the pure space when we bring to the world disorder.

827
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,660
When the pure space...

828
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,420
Oh, yes.

829
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,920
So beautiful.

830
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:22,920
Really.

831
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,280
It simply exposes the entire world.

832
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,160
Yeah, it's kind of timely.

833
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,080
Sorry.

834
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,040
On fait Trump.

835
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,560
Trump.

836
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:35,960
Trump.

837
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,280
Trump.

838
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,740
Trump.

839
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:36,900


840
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,640
Trump.

841
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:37,680
Trump.

842
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:37,680


843
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,560
Trump.

844
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:38,560


845
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:38,560


846
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:38,560


847
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:38,560


848
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:38,560


849
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:38,560


850
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:38,560


851
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:38,560


852
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:38,560


853
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:38,560


854
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:38,560


855
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:38,560


856
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,440
No more gashes, explosions.

857
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:47,720
That is immature and unfurled, to say the large part of it.

858
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:53,500
But see, I'm just like Puzzling Evidence Show and Philo, because whenever they mention

859
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,800
anything on that show, Philo types it into his phone real fast and has it instantly up

860
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,640
there on the microphone.

861
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,420
He's tricking it that way.

862
00:38:59,420 --> 00:38:59,820
Or K-Rob.

863
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,780
K-Rob does that on Dr. Hal's show.

864
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,920
So I have to do all that myself.

865
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,000


866
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:10,340
You pulled something up on your iPhone a minute ago, Princess Wee, but you didn't put it on the radio.

867
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,440
I can't put pictures on the radio.

868
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,060
Well, we're going to have to fix that.

869
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:15,880
Bessie Bug.

870
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,280
Bessie Bug pictures.

871
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:33,280
We're actually talking slightly semi-seriously about putting the shows on television, the radio shows, because we have this Roku channel now.

872
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,400
I don't know if the other radio subgeniuses probably don't know what the TV subgeniuses know.

873
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:48,680
But there's this machine you can buy called a Roku that allows you to get what we might call internet television.

874
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:56,760
It's quite high quality, depending, I guess, on your internet connection, but it works for ours, and ours is pretty terrible.

875
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,420
And there is a subgenius channel on there now.

876
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,420
Actually, it's a subset.

877
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,400
The OSI 74 channel.

878
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,500
OSI.

879
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:12,400
Outer Space International or something.

880
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:13,840
74.

881
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,020
OSI 74 on Roku.

882
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:25,180
And if you scroll down on that channel, you'll come to a Church of the Subgenius channel curated by Dr. Philo Drummond.

883
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,340
And you can watch the subgenius.

884
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,940
This is all free, of course.

885
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,980
It's exciting, too.

886
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,860
You can watch Arise.

887
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,660
You can see.

888
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,000
Lonesome Cowboy Dave's song.

889
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:43,600
The president's on the phone, I believe, because that's part of the Dobbs and Dealey Astacy's collection, I think.

890
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,640
And that's on there.

891
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:57,520
You can watch As They See Bob, the collection of media reports on Church of the Subgenius back when we were infamous and they were doing reports on us besides podcasts.

892
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,440
But actual TV shows used to do reports on us.

893
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,100
Yeah, regular TV cuts of people.

894
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,940
I couldn't believe that you were not serious or were.

895
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:07,840
Right.

896
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,500
And yeah, because why not both?

897
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,900
So, so, yeah, you can.

898
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:19,540
But we were talking about and this is a kind of a dumb idea because these shows are not visually interesting to watch.

899
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,520
They're people talking into a microphone.

900
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:27,920
And of course, we'd have to have a goat network picture of Dave talking into his phone over in the corner.

901
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,160
You know, I mean, Howard Stern had his show on TV.

902
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:43,540
And I guess other great people like Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck, the cameras are always pointing at them, even though they're just fat guys in a studio jabbering.

903
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,360
So why not subgenius?

904
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,120
At least we've got a pretty girl in here, Princess Wee.

905
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,520
And I can make funny faces.

906
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,580
If I knew there was a camera on, I'd shave.

907
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,680
You can make the funniest faces.

908
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:02,620
And of course, the other thing is we could just put on a slideshow of artwork.

909
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:08,180
And just fade over to show the DJs and blabbermouths every now and then.

910
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:13,580
But mostly it would just be an endless stream of subgenius pornography on this artwork.

911
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,400
I don't mean nudity.

912
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:16,760
I know what you mean.

913
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,880
Pictures of Bob, you know, porno, subgenius porno.

914
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,120
Bob Picks.

915
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:21,740
Yeah.

916
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,160
Pictures of a man smoking a pipe.

917
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:30,660
That is the most unsexual, amorphous, anti-colloquial human piece of swineberry.

918
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,480
I know, right?

919
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,180
Smoked.

920
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:32,520
Smoked.

921
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,020
I know, right?

922
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,960
I know, right?

923
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:36,920
Yes.

924
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,340
Now, now.

925
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,920
I learned that phrase from my Stangmojis.

926
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,560
See, now that I have a smartphone, I'm like hip with the in with it crowd.

927
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:50,000
I know how to use Mojis and Bitmojis and Stangmojis.

928
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,040
And I can watch TV on my phone.

929
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,800
I was watching The Walking Dead on the way to the show here.

930
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:59,880
He's all hip with the latest slang and all the latest trends.

931
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,400
Yeah, man.

932
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,440
He knows all of it.

933
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:02,620


934
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,760
He knows that time.

935
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,300
I know, right?

936
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,240
Two weeks now.

937
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,040
A phrase comes and goes in two weeks now.

938
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:08,880
I know, right?

939
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,640
Shut up.

940
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,000
It makes you angry to hear that sometimes.

941
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,120
Divisio sin guando, senor.

942
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,460
I don't know.

943
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:29,600
I enjoy teen slang, especially the kind of teen slang that's so old and obscure that

944
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,020
nobody even knows what any of it means anymore.

945
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:38,760
Or teen slang that teens, just one clique of teens made up and no other teens knew about it.

946
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,540
No same teed.

947
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,360
No, no.

948
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:45,980
You're saying because it's but hang when you when they when they just use the same old

949
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,560
trendy things.

950
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,160
But when you're when you're teeds.

951
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:49,680
Yeah.

952
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:54,740
If you're if you're if your teeds are cool, then they say things like teeds and how but

953
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,620
hang that is.

954
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,040
Yeah.

955
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,480
I ran those by.

956
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,160
I got those from my son and his clique.

957
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,660
20 years ago when they were teenagers.

958
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:09,760
I've ran them by my son the other week and he didn't recognize him.

959
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,240
He didn't know his own teenage slang that he and his buddies made up.

960
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,080
I remembered it and he didn't.

961
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,980
Who's the old one?

962
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,820
There are two special groups of language of communications.

963
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,380
What's not accents, but methods of speech.

964
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,520
And one of them is a kind of a valley girl.

965
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,020
Lilt.

966
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:31,740
Where are they?

967
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,740
Any sentence ends as a question like, you know, I know.

968
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:37,420
I know.

969
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:37,660
Right.

970
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,040
Right.

971
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:39,760
That's it.

972
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,540
And it has a special name and everything.

973
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,940
And I talk like this and everything to do is kind of like this.

974
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,560
Anyway.

975
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,440
Yeah.

976
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,920
And so these.

977
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,060
And it drives me crazy.

978
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:53,420
They go mean punk fight, smacking each other and stuff over who's right and who's wrong.

979
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,220
And like that should be allowed.

980
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,520
And other people say, well, it makes you sound immature.

981
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,460
But to whom?

982
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,860
To pre-millennials.

983
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,140
But to post-millennials.

984
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,240
You sound normal.

985
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:02,940
Right.

986
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,680
But until tomorrow.

987
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,160
Once again.

988
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,360
That's butthole.

989
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:08,720
I'm T.

990
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,800
So, you know, just make up your own slang, folks.

991
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,100
You know, people will act like they understand you because they don't want to look ignorant.

992
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:22,600
Right.

993
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,760
Hyper acronym is slang, slang, staying slang.

994
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,680
I mean, slang.

995
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,000
Right.

996
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,800
Just put the 1004 on it, man.

997
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:29,620
Yeah.

998
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,140
Do it.

999
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:30,680
Do it.

1000
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:30,920
A three.

1001
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:31,340
Five.

1002
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:37,080
What about the 2010 when the prime minister of Canada said that marijuana is going to

1003
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,100
be legal in Canada by the year 2007?

1004
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:41,920
Well, see, they forgot to pull down the jib jib.

1005
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,500
That's just their jib jaw cranking.

1006
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,320
They ain't got no whimper bat.

1007
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,440
What are those piddles?

1008
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,220
Spinks make fruit words out of.

1009
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,680
They don't even.

1010
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,700
They don't even know.

1011
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:57,380
It's not.

1012
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,460
You made fruit words up.

1013
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:01,300
I'm.

1014
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,620
That's what I'm saying is just develop your own stingle speak.

1015
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:13,220
So that the and just jaw it all the time and the others will pretend.

1016
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,220
Well, they'll start doing it, too.

1017
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:15,940
Right.

1018
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,020
They'll start picking up.

1019
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:20,780
They'll start picking up the same limb lambs you were spoozing.

1020
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,500
Well, they did the same thing.

1021
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:28,900
They used to fibble and farble back and forth between two or three extreme euphemisms back

1022
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,860
and forth into wanderlust and back again.

1023
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,620
The devotional services at 7 p.m.

1024
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,000
So they're they're among the lucky ones.

1025
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:40,700
Well, not everybody can jimber the same way that we can.

1026
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:48,400
You, me and Princess, we have been trying for seven or nine abdomens to be able to just

1027
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,000
bindle snuck this stuff out that long.

1028
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:51,760
Abdomens.

1029
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,000
They were, too, with mountains of studios, emperments every daily.

1030
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:56,620
Exacto.

1031
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:58,200
Knifey.

1032
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,600
Well, that's it.

1033
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:00,840
That's it.

1034
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:00,840


1035
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,600
As far as pie goes.

1036
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:01,860
That cuts it.

1037
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,440
What about the crust of the matter, Senor Swimbo?

1038
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:05,280
Well, we'll.

1039
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,700
Sting-a-lang, slang-stang?

1040
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,980
I think you're just full of turkey dreams.

1041
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,780
You're contrarious as a set-down jackass.

1042
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,880
I feel like I need.

1043
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:20,720
But at the same time, what makes me just as happy is a dead pig in the sunshine, to think

1044
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,320
about that.

1045
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,500
About how you can just.

1046
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:30,840
You can just start blabber-jabbing and nimbus-slamming.

1047
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:38,020
And they still won't turn the radio off, because they're wondering when the punchline's going

1048
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,200
to come, if there's going to be one.

1049
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:48,500
Which, kids, that punchline comes on July 5th of this year, 1998, when the world ends

1050
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,040
at 7 o'clock in the morning.

1051
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,240
That's right, July 5th.

1052
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:54,000
We'll see you there at Ground Zero, X-Day.

1053
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,300
Praise Bob.

1054
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,380
We've got to get all ready for several big events.

1055
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,740
We've got X-Day coming up.

1056
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:05,220
Now, if that works out, we don't have to worry about the other two events, Starwood

1057
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,460
and the Republican Convention.

1058
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,240
Right.

1059
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,500
I'm running.

1060
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,540
I hope that they finally get it in their heads to nominate Bob.

1061
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,080
The Republican Convention?

1062
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:17,920
And Democrat.

1063
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,560
You know, that would save their butts.

1064
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:25,700
The half of them that can't stand Trump, and the half of them that can't stand anybody

1065
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,980
but Trump, could all agree on Bob.

1066
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:28,780
Yeah.

1067
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,240
Yeah.

1068
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:29,940
In fact, you could.

1069
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:30,820
The Trump.

1070
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,780
Thirteen of renters could be have gone to vote in the Super Bowl.

1071
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,140
So that doesn't mean that there's someone out there who doesn't want to try and win

1072
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:39,140


1073
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,000
I guess what I was wondering at the time was whether the vote for Sanders was electing

1074
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,000


1075
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,000


1076
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:48,720
I'm sure the DNC had narrated the election, until,anhj save me from лйлхл│лЙvende.

1077
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:49,480
I'd like to meet Donald Trump, because it's save Donald Trump's life.

1078
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,680
And so, let's see if we can do it.

1079
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,980
That's right.

1080
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,500
I don't wonder if they're looking at the young president and the young president and

1081
00:48:59,500 --> 00:48:59,740
the pane here.

1082
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,580
at least. Actually, the markup

1083
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,480
on Cafe Press stuff, it probably cost

1084
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,000
about four bucks for the

1085
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,160
Don't Blame Me, I Voted for Bob

1086
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,600
button with an American flag on it.

1087
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,380
That's by Fernanda Nandie

1088
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,240
Lemur, too, by the way. Praise

1089
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,380
Fernanda Nandie Lemur.

1090
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,300
There was a

1091
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:18,900
Bob for President campaign

1092
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,000
in the city of Cleveland

1093
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,560
back in 1984.

1094
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,720
I was going to say

1095
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,460
1980 sometime. Pope Jimbo

1096
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,380
of Cleveland was

1097
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,260
had printed up red, white, and blue

1098
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,240
Bob for President things, and he was putting

1099
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,380
them all over Cleveland. I didn't know anything about it

1100
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,020
because I was in Dallas covering

1101
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,040
the Republican convention of

1102
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,200
1984 in Dallas on my

1103
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:41,660
birthday

1104
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,320
with my mom.

1105
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,180
And outside

1106
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,300
the convention

1107
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,860
with the Yippies Rock Against

1108
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:53,180
Reagan stage, I opened

1109
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,600
for the dead Kennedys

1110
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,160
who knew who I was even though I

1111
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,040
didn't know who they were. That's how weird things were

1112
00:49:59,040 --> 00:49:59,360
in 1984.

1113
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:09,160
And then I was inside the convention within slingshot distance of Nancy Reagan, sitting next to my mom, who was a delegate.

1114
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:15,020
And she had, they had concealed carry then, they didn't have open carry.

1115
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:22,300
So she wasn't carrying her sick gun on the outside, but mammy had a gun.

1116
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,340
Everybody had a gun in Texas.

1117
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,380
I thought you said she was deli-

1118
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,200
They're going to all have a gun at the Republican convention.

1119
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:29,760
in Cleveland.

1120
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,460
They'd be packing each and every one of them.

1121
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,300
Well, I wish.

1122
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,080
You know, they were talking about

1123
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,600
having open carry in the convention,

1124
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,300
which they can't do in Ohio, I don't think.

1125
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,940
You should be allowed to carry a gun in there,

1126
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,680
preferably a really highly automatic weapon.

1127
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,120
It turned out to be a Hove.

1128
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:50,000
And everybody just starts spraying each other.

1129
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,400
And we'd film it all.

1130
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,120
We'd sit back and we'd watch,

1131
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,560
and we'd go, oh, wow.

1132
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,200
You know.

1133
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,360
Well, at one point, it was like

1134
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,280
there was going to be a gunfight

1135
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,620
between the cruisers and the Trumpies.

1136
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,580
But now the cruisers are soaking in their diaper tears,

1137
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:13,540
and the Trumpies are triumphant.

1138
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:18,480
Within their world, they are triumphant.

1139
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,680
So it'll be interesting to see.

1140
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:21,280
It's a hard-swilled appaller.

1141
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,740
You know, don't you think so, Slytherin Ray?

1142
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,920
Don't you think it's a hard-swilled appaller?

1143
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,380
I can't believe it.

1144
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:31,180
Anybody as dopey as this TV guy.

1145
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,200
It's like, well, how's your plan to make this happen in the Middle East?

1146
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:40,660
What consists of your idea to make the border more secure

1147
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,800
rather than just build a, you know, Great Wall of China

1148
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,300
costing nine billion bucks?

1149
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,480
It's stupid.

1150
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:51,340
Well, now, Philo told me that a vote for Trump

1151
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,280
is a vote against boredom.

1152
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,240
And I pointed out that in world affairs,

1153
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,300
world politics,

1154
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:00,500
boredom is something to be greatly desired, actually.

1155
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,120
Boredom would be great.

1156
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:07,600
In my case, I mean, what I believe personally,

1157
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:12,860
I think Reverend Sanders of the vicious psycho-unitarian church

1158
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:15,300
of Libertyville Montpelier,

1159
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,240
up there by the notches in the Vermonts and all that stuff like that,

1160
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:25,300
I think he made some sense to at least a huge testosterone pool

1161
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,360
of thousands of greats.

1162
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,960
Yeah, but as Bill Gates said to Steve Jobs,

1163
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,560
that doesn't matter.

1164
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:35,960
No.

1165
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,280
It matters nothing.

1166
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,500
But what can you do?

1167
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,100
I gave somebody a chance to say that to me.

1168
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,280
I left him wide open.

1169
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,940
I actually said, Max are better.

1170
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,560
And I was waiting for him to go, that doesn't matter.

1171
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,360
But he hadn't seen the Pirates of Silicon Valley.

1172
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,680
He hadn't seen the Pirates of Silicon Valley like I had.

1173
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,280
So what you gonna do?

1174
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:01,980
What you gonna do?

1175
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,020
It's all movie references and silly.

1176
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:06,220
Silly.

1177
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,840
It's a bunch of silly stuff.

1178
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,080
It's a bunch of goofy.

1179
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,040
It's goofy.

1180
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,800
It's dopey.

1181
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,160
It's goofy.

1182
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,640
Jesus didn't have no disciple named Dopey.

1183
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:25,160
That's a quote of a Cleveland drive-time DJ

1184
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,140
talking about me.

1185
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,480
I can say the radio station.

1186
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:29,840
That's exciting.

1187
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,720
I just had hemorrhage.

1188
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,540
That was so exciting.

1189
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,800
I can't believe I heard that.

1190
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,100
Oh, wow.

1191
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,000
Well, you know, depicting yourself as an android

1192
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,260
with lessons to be learned from beyond the stars.

1193
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,720
You know, the old government hype,

1194
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,800
you know, make people think that somebody's coming

1195
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,360
from outer space to enslave or save them.

1196
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:54,400
Somebody is coming from outer space.

1197
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:55,200
Yeah.

1198
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,340
They're coming in outer space.

1199
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,920
Unfortunately, too, for many of the particulate mass

1200
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,800
we have to attend.

1201
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:06,560
Well, anyway, we've got to think about,

1202
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:13,220
okay, in July, if, well, hopefully the world ends

1203
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,280
and we don't have to worry about Starwood

1204
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,400
or rather we'll have Starwood on our escape vessel.

1205
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:18,720
Right.

1206
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:19,640
Princess, we and I.

1207
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:20,600
Absolutely.

1208
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,100
That's an important thing to have,

1209
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,780
that stuff on the escape vessel.

1210
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:26,140
We'll pick up Wisteria.

1211
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:26,420
It's time to go to be packing.

1212
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:27,340
Mm-hmm.

1213
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:30,200
And put it on our escape vessel

1214
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,320
and go ahead and go through the motions of Starwood

1215
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,760
and then anyone who hasn't,

1216
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:37,040
still hasn't bought their subgenius membership,

1217
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,820
we just chuck them out the chute.

1218
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,160
Just put them out in space.

1219
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,300
Shunt them out.

1220
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,300
Well, I mean, at that point,

1221
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:49,740
wouldn't it be kind of silly not to go ahead

1222
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,400
and join the Church of the Subgenius

1223
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,660
once you've realized that that's the only thing

1224
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:56,460
that could possibly not only keep you alive

1225
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,340
but allow you to live a life of freedom?

1226
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:57,420
Yeah.

1227
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,640
You can live forever in total pleasure

1228
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,520
and hedonism as long as you want to live.

1229
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,820
As long as you can think of cool things to do,

1230
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,060
you can just do them.

1231
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,040
You might really be a brain in a jar

1232
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,840
like in The Matrix or something,

1233
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,560
but you won't know the difference.

1234
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,600
That's the important thing.

1235
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:15,840
You could be already.

1236
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,480
How do you know you're not a brain in a jar

1237
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,440
like poor old Neo in that old sci-fi movie?

1238
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:26,100
How do you know you're not just a guy in a cave

1239
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:26,980
looking at shadows?

1240
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:27,660
That is on the wall.

1241
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,280
Even old cave Sophocles figured that stuff out.

1242
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,160
The cave subgeniuses knew it was all an illusion

1243
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,200
until you stubbed your toe.

1244
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,900
Now, no, well, suddenly it's not so illusory anymore,

1245
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,440
now is it?

1246
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,980
Yeah, because your toe is real.

1247
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:44,940
Yeah, your toe is real.

1248
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,200
And that's the only way you can find out

1249
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,900
unless you pay attention, I guess.

1250
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:51,480
I thought it was like a Neolithic cave drawing.

1251
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,680
You know, it's like they mastered fire,

1252
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,620
so there's torches all over the place.

1253
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:58,140
Filled with all kinds of...

1254
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,900
There's these real strange references.

1255
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,360
The things that didn't even exist yet

1256
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,800
or were about to ever.

1257
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,880
You know what I mean?

1258
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,600
Like future ancient...

1259
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,140
Mark, the three stooges on TV

1260
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:11,680
hadn't been invented yet,

1261
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,540
but people were struggling towards

1262
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:16,120
reaching that pinnacle of human evolution.

1263
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,180
It makes perfect sense to me.

1264
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,840
That is why I listen to your...

1265
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,000
But they didn't stop at the three stooges

1266
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,140
on afternoon TV.

1267
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,000
No, they had to come up with the internet

1268
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,920
and podcasts and nonsense like this,

1269
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:30,920
which is about to end.

1270
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,860
Actually, thankfully, we have about three minutes left

1271
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:35,500
and that's just enough time to play

1272
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,320
the song I promised at the beginning.

1273
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,100
Oh, let's not break your promise.

1274
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,500
No, no, I can't because it's a Rudy Schwartz project

1275
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,300
and he's our personal friend.

1276
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:47,680
By the way, he's a guy who...

1277
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,580
He used to be a Texan like I sort of used to be

1278
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:53,240
and he didn't like the way things were going

1279
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,000
in Texas and the United States

1280
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:55,980
and he moved to Canada.

1281
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,580
He lives in Montreal now.

1282
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,740
He says the healthcare is great.

1283
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:05,980
But anyway, he did a cover of Build Me Up Buttercut,

1284
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,040
which we're going to listen to now

1285
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:08,840
because we have to go

1286
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,060
because the next show is here.

1287
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,760
Okay, Dave, thanks for explaining everything.

1288
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,020
We'll see you.

1289
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,140
It's good to hear your voice, Dave.

1290
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:19,800
Yeah, man.

1291
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,520
It's good to be back.

1292
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,060
to reinforce whatever idiocy

1293
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,940
you were trying to promulgate on the masses.

1294
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:25,880
It's the hour of silence.

1295
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:26,080
All right.

1296
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,600
subgenius.com.

1297
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,180
Praise God.

1298
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1299
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,580
Mess me around and then worst of all...

1300
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:59,020
You never call, baby, when you say you will

1301
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:02,020
But I love you still, I need you

1302
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,900
More than anyone, darling

1303
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,660
You know that I have from the start

1304
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,460
Build me up, buttercup

1305
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,040
Don't break my heart

1306
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:17,160
I'll be over at ten

1307
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,900
You told me time and again

1308
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:19,940
But you're late

1309
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:22,180
I wait around again

1310
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:24,360
I went to the door

1311
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,960
I can't take anymore

1312
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,160
It's not you

1313
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,360
You let me down again

1314
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,120
Baby, baby, try to find

1315
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:36,980
A little time and I'll make you mine

1316
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:40,140
I'll be home, I'll be beside the phone

1317
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,580
Waiting for you

1318
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:50,360
Why do you build me up, buttercup

1319
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,860
Baby, just let me down

1320
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:54,000
Let me down

1321
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:54,340
Let me down

1322
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:54,640
I need you around

1323
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,420
And then worst of all

1324
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:59,900
You never call, baby, when you say you will

1325
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:03,000
But I love you still, I need you

1326
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,780
More than anyone, darling

1327
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:08,580
You know that I have from the start

1328
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,420
Build me up, buttercup

1329
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,140
Don't break my heart

1330
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,040
You were my toy

1331
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,640
But I could be the boy you adore

1332
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,220
If you'd just let me know

1333
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,320
I'll be over at ten

1334
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:25,260
You're untrue

1335
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,980
I'm attracted to you all the more

1336
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,220
Why do I need you so?

1337
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,960
Baby, baby, try to find

1338
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,880
A little time and I'll make you mine

1339
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,100
I'll be home, I'll be beside the phone

1340
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,500
Waiting for you

1341
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,600
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1342
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,400
I need you around

1343
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,080
More than anyone, darling

1344
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,660
You know that I have from the start

1345
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,380
Build me up, buttercup

1346
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,740
Don't break my heart

1347
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:35,220
Build me up, buttercup
