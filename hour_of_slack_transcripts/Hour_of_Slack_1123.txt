What the hell do you think they were doing?
Are you ready now?
Yes, I'm ready.
Close your eyes and think to yourself,
there's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like
The Self Genius
Power of
Swaggy!
You too can destroy something
if you just watch for the chance.
I only know that he is a man with hair on the palm of his hands
and no blood in his face.
This is PR.
Do you see a man with,
to, especially with?
Now these are the very tense questions.
That does things.
That does things.
What?
Do you see?
Do you see?
This is the show.
There's no question about it.
4.1
Beavitt to Lemur.
A bug girl cave of
strange subsonic sounds
of subsidence
of a catholic continental
battle.
That's our crowd at the arrival of Dr. Howe.
Oh, well, here we are.
Let's go in among them.
Remember, there's no such thing as bad publicity.
Just a wave and...
It'll be over.
Okay, you want one of these?
I'm gonna take one.
Okay.
Let's go.
If it were Rob, she'll be go, go, go.
But no.
Hi, everybody.
This is Dr. Howe and Owl
getting up with the chickens
to bring you this special presentation.
Part of the subgenius propaganda saturation
in January 2007.
We're going to be looking at subgenius
oddities throughout the ages
on our program tonight
and examine some of the strangest
quips and conundrums
that ever came toddling down the pike.
How, for example,
did royal deaths
transform English politics?
It is important to bear in mind
that deaths of kings
were no ordinary
deaths.
But you can't assassinate a bum.
Only
someone of importance.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
So Dr. Howe
played his little guitar
and hiked on down the road.
Peace, friends.
Oops.
It looks like his horse has thrown him.
Damn nag.
He used to just play that one measure.
I wish he'd stop criticizing all the time.
I'm just tuning up the instruments here.
Oh, yeah.
It is tuneful.
Why, it's the Synthron 3000.
You don't have to do anything.
It tunes itself perfectly.
It even sings a song for you.
Well, this one loops.
It just plays forever.
The little organist over there
never stops.
Drive it or park it, lady.
Well, no one can sink the show.
It's going to sink under its own weight
or float
as it bobbles and boops.
I don't want to do any more show.
It's scary out here.
I want to go home and go to sleep.
I don't want to do any more Red Bull.
That's the movie.
I'm all dizzy.
What, you're looking for the best movie?
Yeah.
Okay, I think it's right over there.
It's right behind you there.
See?
It's on the floor.
Now it's in the water.
Those who would stand
at that.
Those who stand over there.
This tuneless radio
jamboree.
And now, phylo drumming.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I have agitated
for this agreement
in the past
and I will in the future
for my testimony
and my coinage will be required
for.
This successful
operation.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Now we will continue on
down here by the prophet
where we notice
familiar spirits are gathering
about his head.
We should not
seek the
truth
here.
Yes.
We will be willing to pay
for it.
We will be willing to pay for the truth.
So, so dearly.
You finally want to buy some truth?
Yeah.
Give me some truth, man.
From the land beyond, beyond.
Yeah, thanks, thanks.
Here. Here's your money.
Wow, this is great, man.
This is a big bag of truth for just a little bitty.
It didn't cost me much at all for this truth.
Wait, this is all I get?
Oh.
This truth didn't cost me.
Yeah, this is cheap truth, man.
I bet this truth may just be
just a little bit.
What did you do in there?
Just a little bit.

Sort of true, right?
Answer me.
You think it's just sort of true?
It's kind of true, truth.
All right.
Truth is sold for one quarter.
Yeah.
You and me.
But it's not really absolute truth.
It's more like sort of true.
Why?
Because I'm really mad.
It's kind of true.
You're just a little bit.
Just a little bit true.
But it's still the truth.
But it's still the truth.
This time it's perfect.
We're coming back.
Monsters.
We'll be armed with the truth.
Just the sort of true truth.
Not the real absolute gold truth.
The sword of truth.
The shield of justice.
Well, this is just a cardboard sword of truth.
The jockstrap of consupiscence.
Wait, I don't want to wear that.
The chest protector of invulnerability.
Does he realize that he's not even on the air?
No.
He can't tell?
This is Earth's final warning.
Is Mary down there at the bottom of the sound well?
I really wish we'd have her.
I think we should have had a little bit more restraint.
What are you doing down here?
Now we're trying to find that caller.
Did you hear that caller?
He just stormed out of.
He was down there.
He just stormed out.
Slamming the door.
Where are you going?
Having a temperature check.
Hey, come back, caller.
I'm here.
Oh, there he is.
Oh, we thought you stormed out and slammed the door behind you.
We were talking about the problems involved with succession.
We all know California listeners.
Ripped away from the union.
And there's 13 internationalists.
Wow.
Now, are you listening in California?
Who, me?
On the internet?
I'm listening to you.


I'm listening in Hawaii.
You're the one in Hawaii, huh?
Where ocean breezes waft or palm-scented shores.
Where the mangoes grow in the mangrove groves.
You're not in the beach?
Okay, you probably.
You're on the MiG island there.
Are you on North Shore?
Are you in?
MiG island?
Sprayed by Russian air?
Your server's out there on a little place.
Everybody's going surfing.
Looks like I'm driving somewhere.
I can't even think.
In your woody.
Oh, pardon me.
Because, you know, the funny part is there is age one listener.
Hey, put that away.
I'm not even listening.





I'm going to go to Hawaii.
Oops, sorry.
Oh.
Oh.
No, we do have one internet listener we can see in Hawaii on our map of internet listeners.
And she can see us.
What?
Well.
Do you want me to put this away?
I just thought I would.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
It's scaring everybody.
Put that away.
What's that smell?
Oh, sorry.
But the top of the sea was so elastic that it grabbed in its chin and forced it to desist
us from this persecution.
Now, that's in Revelations 13.
Oh, that's in Revelations 13.



Of course, we like to say Revelations 13 on the show.
And Revelation X on the show, too.
You know, that famous subgenius book has now been reprinted.
And you can get this from a brand spanking new copy.

Yeah, thank you.
Thank you.
It has.
I know you have.
Just like this one I'm holding up here.
This one isn't for sale.
This is what we call a special advance premium.
A loss leader.
But you can get it in the stores.
And this is the one that has the funny and grusting pages.
Fight and claw your way into the bookstore aisles.
No, I'm not.


No, I'm not.





Take home, a brand new copy.
And now, the Holy Grail.
Old subgenius classic, Revelations X, The Boblapocryphon.
Not to be confused with the Psychadelopedia of Slack, otherwise known as the Psychopedia
of Slack, The Bobliagrphon.
Yes, The Boblapocryphon.
Where do these names come from?
Who writes them?
From Bob, of course.
Yes, all from Bob.
From that one origin.
Just ask Bob.
police lieutenant Kiefer Hudson.
Officer, where does Bob come from?
In hot pursuit of the infamous Yancey gang,
which had committed a string of jewelry store heists,
but once again proved elusive.
They fought for the motherland.
Women in warfare on the Russian front during the First World War.
They gave me the slip like always, said officer.
The definition of the Church of the Subgenius
is eternal salvation on this planet, or hell,
eternal salvation on this planet.
Either you choose the Church of the Subgenius
or you choose eternal damnation.
Amen, amen, amen.
Sing it over.
Amen, amen, amen, amen.
See the little baby.
This is Carly, a musician and the high priestess
of the Church of the Subgenius.
A bizarre new cult infiltrating into the UK.
Carly is on her way to meet two of the most important
members of her religion to rehearse for a sermon
later that evening.
I do believe that the whole of London
is feeling the Bob vibe.
Bob is with us.
Bob is God.
Quite simply, Bob is God.
I love it, I love it, I love it.
And when he goes I follow.
I follow, I follow.
J.R. Bob Dobbs is the high part of the Church of the Subgenius.
He's the great master salesman who was made enlightened
by a space alien.
Jehovah One in 1953 after working on a television set
of his own design.
And the Jehovah One came down and he snatched Bob up
into the ether of space.
And gave him enlightenment and showed him that he was
the true prophet of the Church of the Subgenius.
And that he should create a church in his name
and bring total slack to all potential subgeniuses
that live on this planet.
The ideology behind the church is slack.
Every subgenius minister wants to obtain the highest level
of slack he can or she can.
And live a totally slack life.
And that's what we're doing.
This means that you probably do not work.
As the Reverend Ivan Stang would say,
you live a life of creative sloth.
The Church of the Subgenius has changed many members' lives.
I've met people who came to me and said,
Pope Black, tell me more about Bob.
Tell me how to join the Church of the Subgenius.
I have a horrible life.
I work.
I have a job.
I have a dead end job I hate.
I hate my boss.
I'm very unhappy.
And the Church of the Subgenius shows them the way.
They quit their job.
They quit their job for Bob.
And then they go and do something that they enjoy
that makes their lives rich.
And that's what the Church of the Subgenius is all about.
It's not about being lazy.
It's about doing what you want to do that makes you happy.
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Hallelujah!
Praise Bob!
Amen!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!

After I joined the church, I found that I was drawn
to do more creative things for Bob.
To help recruit souls for a massive exodus from this planet,
which as you know will be any day now, on July 5th.
So, for instance, I've been writing books and recording sermons.
I've been writing songs.
All this for Bob, because the more we can create slack in the world,
the sooner we get to go off into bliss in the stars.
The Church of the Subgenius believed the world as we know it
would come to an end on July 5th, 2007.
We were invited to join them in a ceremony to worship Bob
in preparation for this mass exodus.
A few weeks later, we called on Reverend Adam,
and he agreed to talk to us from his home
about his life within the Church of the Subgenius.
When people first find out that I'm in the Church of the Subgenius,
they're usually full of questions,
and by about the third answer,
they all look at me a bit strange and think I'm strange.
I can tell by the look in their eyes that they think I'm a bit mad,
but then I look at their eyes,
and I can see that they have an invisible friend who lives in the sky,
so, you know, who's mad?
When the Christians have their revivals all over the country,
we can see the slack sinking into the ground,
disappearing from the entire country,
and so we have to undo their revival work
by putting on devivals, fighting against the conspiracy.
We'll have some bands, we'll have some preaching,
we'll have some jokes and some laughter,
and most of all, we'll have slack.
We attended our first Subgenius revival,
an event including bands,
dance,
dancing and prayer,
the highlight being a sermon by Pope Black,
preaching about the conspiracy that supposedly controls us.
Then they arrived,
and invented money and work.
They cut down the forest paradise and forced us to wear clothes,
and replaced the cornucopia with shops and hamburger restaurants.
They have made so many...
Some people think that the conspiracy is a dark, smoky room
with lots of high-up businessmen in suits,
making little deals here and little deals there,
and controlling people's lives through their tendricles of power.
But really, the conspiracy is you,
and it's every single damn normal person on this planet.
Every ordinary worm who lives on this planet is part of the conspiracy,
just by the code of normality that they produce.
You might have noticed that the conspiracy tells us 1998 has already passed.
Conspiracy has been fixing the calendar throughout the entire age of mankind's existence on this planet.
They've been fixing it here and fixing it there.
I think it's probably 1998 now,
and that this July the world will end.
Aliens are going to come and free the world of the conspiracy,
and take up the subgenies off into the stars,
to live with their love goddesses on their very own UFO.
Subgenius Revival
Subgenius Revival

He's gone to London to show us more about the world of Bob Dobbs.
He informed us that Bob had become a famous clip art icon,
and very popular in underground pop culture.
He devolved into this figure, this clip art figure.
Bob is the perfect marketing scam,
and anybody's allowed to use it.
This is where the magic happens!
Subgenius Revival
the evening at a subgenius squat where the Pope claimed his duty was to recruit more
members.
And I know about Bob and the rule of slack, whatever it is.
All I know is I'm fucking enjoying it and I might join it.
Where's Bob?
Two years ago, Priestess Carly had a vision of Bob who told her to form a band and spread
his word.
She immediately left her husband and a highly paid job to tour the world promoting the Church
of the Subgenius.
Bob said, go to the Tate, go to Channel 5, go to Mitsubishi, go to Sony, go to the government,
go to the Arts Council of every goddamn nation and spread the word of Bob.
You can be anything you want.
You can be a Pope.
You can be a Bishop.
You can be an Emperor.
I'm a high priestess.
What else could I be?
After spending so much time with Reverend Adam, Priestess Carly and Pope Black, we wanted
to end our journey with them by finding out how Bob had changed their lives.
Before I joined the church, I was going nowhere with my life.
I would probably have ended up in some dead-end job with a shotgun in my mouth and my toe on
the trigger.
It was probably the most miserable time in my life.
There was nothing for me except working, cooking, eating, fucking, sleeping, drinking.
There was nothing that really made sense to me.
Since I found Bob, it has opened up an entire new world for me.
I'm a Christian.

I'm a Christian.
I've gone to so many� crossing paths in life.
I'm a Christian.

I'm a Christian.
Thank God that I'm obligated to see God when I'm dead and feel unclean.
I'm someone who loves you.
I love to get this man.
I need this man.
There's only one way to salvation.
All you have to do is pay $30 to the Church of the Subgenius by July 5th, 2007,
or else you'll fry in hell with the rest of them.
And I know you don't want that, friends.
And what we just heard is the soundtrack of a film by Natalie Ellis called The Cult of Bob,
which you can see on YouTube.
If you type in Cult of Bob and do a search on that,
this radio show, however, is Hour of Slack number 1123 from the Church of the Subgenius USA HQ.
Although most of this particular episode, except for the collages, which are by Leemur and also norlpref.com,
which bracket everything, is tonight, this show,
from an episode of the Puzzling Evidence More Than an Hour, Less Than a Show,
show.
Show, from January 2007,
with Dr. Howell, Dr. Philodrumon, and our dance instructor, Puzzling Evidence.
Woo!
Okay, now, I'm doing a little dance, and we'll drop your mind back in your brain pan.
Jerry! Jerry!
No, it's all right.
All right, Jerry.
There we go.
All right.
And this is really a historical week.
There are a lot of things that happened back in history during this week.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
No.
This world is not a good idea.
No.
I think we should delete and start again.
No, I think we should take this and just overlay it with the one that we know is good.
I think we should save it for later.
Okay.
Did you hear about...
I think history is repeating itself again.
Dick Cheney found the Holy Grail.
The world's great again.
Yeah, again.
That guy's just...
How could he...
How does this man do this?
He just does so many amazing things in one week.
It's amazing.
I just hit save it for later.
What happened, little caller?
What happened, little caller?
What happened, little caller?
Well, I think we're...
Oh, yeah.
That's a little bit...
You're continuing this war?
Call her extreme.
We're gonna win.
We're gonna...
Oh, that's great.
You mean with Jerry Ford?
I remember those...
We can't win.
You can't win in America.
We don't win wars.
We sweat wars.
You just can't win.
You can't fight City Hall.
We don't like the stardom, and when we do, we can't win them.
Because we know we can't win them.
That's why we don't like the stardom.
You're screwed, bloated, tattooed.
Plus, people get hurt and things get broken.
We should just talk about it.

Stuff happens.
We would just talk things out.
It would be a lot better.
You know, just sit down and talk.
It's gonna take us thinking about being good with each other and being nice to each other for a while.
Have a nice day.
You know?
We gotta get off of this hate trip, man.
Hate.
We gotta get back on the love wagon.
Hate.
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
Make me hate crime.
Don't you...
Now, when I say, know what I'm saying, you're supposed to say, know what you're saying.
Know what you're saying.
Yeah.
Just a beautiful show.
Okay, car, do you remember that now?
I crashed the old bad show.
Don't say it.
And made a beautiful show happen.
I said it, car.
I heard I was staying with him.
Don't you say it.
Is that true?
Yeah, he was here last week.
Wow, okay.
He just came and left.
I just came in for a haircut.
Yes.
The unconquerable will.
And a sponge job.
Immortal hate.
Hey, whoa.
Encouraged never to submit to a deal.
You have to change the music for that.
Hey, did you know that phrase, are we not man, came from...
H.G. Wells?
It came from the island of Dr. Moreau.
Sure did.
The speech of the savior of the mall.
That noise you just heard was Buzz McGavin slapping his forehead.
I guess I called too late.
Not to slap his forehead.
No, that's okay.
Yeah, yeah.
The island of Dr. Moreau, that's true.
Are we not men?
That's an excellent film.
Which I would say had a huge impact on the sub-gum-dini's, right?
Yeah, sure did.
I could tell that right away.
That and Little Big Man.
Yeah.
What are the movies?
Well, certainly any science fiction movie you guys saw and we saw.
I know Justin from What He Was.
Well, one of the first things I got from Sting was the tape where he's doing...
I know Bob Dobbs from What He Was.
And we know some huge sports they was.
That's a great rant.
The whole rant.
Bob Dobbs.
Because Sting was always an old guy from the beginning.
He's always been the old guy.
Bob Dobbs.
Because we were feeding...
His signal earlier in the show, and you were listening to him talk about...
He was so distant from that early character that he was so long ago.
But I know the feeling.
I actually have tapes of myself in early teens.
First screams for listening.
Huh.
Everything I know is wrong.
Peter Pan changed his name to Peter Pan Handel.
And he's standing out.
He's living out in front of the BART station now.
Captain Hook bought Neverland from Michael Jackson.
Man, this week's amazing.
He's turning it into a casino.
Welcome to Dobbsville.
It's not funny.
Where you, the customer, are our finest product.
Okay, I have to evacuate the void.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
You know, what we're interested in is the software of battle as opposed to the hardware.
And hardware in this context means what it sounds like.
Arms and armor.
Battle formation.
He couldn't handle the show.
So he went to the bathroom and got sick, as you can see in this tape.
The organization of armies.
He evacuated from both ends right now.
But can you speak in a military context?
And the interesting thing is, right now, you can see on the camera here,
Zoff Filo's entering the airlock.
That, by contrast, covers nearly everything else.
What I was saying three minutes ago.
Behavior.
Strategy.
And the truth is, folks, he's only hearing it now, days later, when he downloads it on the web.
And indeed, the whole gamut that Klaus Witz knew so well.
That's FiloWare.
And if you have FiloWare, it will bring you the version of the show that only has Filo's voice.
Confrontations and hardware factors.
Because ambushes or unexpected flanking movements and maneuvers can overcome enemies.
Do some hammering.
Do some hammering.
Do some hammering.
And a battle field.
Larry Harvey likes to dive into the heaps of money and swim through it.
So John Law is now a jader.
And Larry Harvey is on his way.
In the subgenius universe.
That is almost true.
Caller, what happened?
Caller.
What?
The caller in this case is represented by a wolf.
A wolf.
Balanced by doubt and shame.
So you read this in the paper?
In the examiner.
The examiner.
Of this past day.
Of this past day?
Yes, not the future day.
Or the present day.
Thursday?
Boy, am I ever.
I'd like to drink some of this.
So Miles had a drink.
Could I drink some of this?
It's got acid in it.
Acid?
Yeah, LSD and pot and speed.
And copper sulfate.
And copper sulfate.
There is a little extra cup here.
And I would like to drink some because I'm so thirsty.
Yeah, I just.
Sure, yeah.
You're a roundabout child.
Don't be scared, caller.
That's a scary caller.
There are no such things.
I think my brother's going to call today.
Brother, go find your brother.
Brother?
Brother, that's silly.
Oh, boy.
Whoa.
Calm down, caller.
That was just an experiment.
Like if you guys had a laugh track.
Okay.
You can provide that.
You're more like a huff.
You're scary.
You're not funny.
What happened to that?
Can't you go ha, ha, ha?
Life-loving laughter.
What happened to that?
How about T-Harr, har, T-Harr, har?
How about giggle, twitter, twitter, giggle?
Okay, let's sync up here on the show.
I'm not tracking here.
I've got my equipment.
I've got a bokeh.
Oh, maybe it was just in my headphones.
This is where they make the show.
A giant factory, a former airplane manufacturing shed.
The show is cobbled together here with a little bit of Yankee ingenuity.
American.
American know-how, chewing gum and bailing wire.
They pull themselves up by their bootstraps and hang onto the seats of their trousers as they fly blind here at the giant show factory.
And somehow, gosh darn it, at the end they have a show.
This is the archive where thousands of shows are stored in digital form.
Look at them down there.
Each one can be fully recreated.
Why are some of those shows skinnier than the other ones?
Some are low-calorie shows.
Are they low on humor and listening value?
Others are full of fats and butter.
I like the Alexa.
Trans fats.
The what?
Do you know which of those shows are just fluff shows filled out with air and whipped sugar?
Oh, Saturday Night Live.
That's the right answer.
I'm going to give you a haircut now.
Yeah, here.
Yeah, hold still while we cut your hair.
Hold still.
Oh, I got his ear.
What's wrong?
Oh, no, man.
I'm sorry.
Now you've got it.
He's over there.
You can find the spot and reattach.
Yeah.
Ah, that was good.
Oh, sorry.
Man, my nose is just completely swamped.
It's like a swamp up there.
Oh, when you put it on the nose, it blows.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.










Oh, my God.
Can you push the snore button when that happens?
I wonder if it is.
One of the trolls rampant snoring.
There is snoring.
Dr. Howell.
Yeah.
How can he do that?
This is all happening in a two-minute time.
He sleeps and talks at the same time.
Yeah, it's sleep talking, which Subgenius is an excel at.
As you can see right now.
Okay, now we'll go to Channel X and see what the audience thinks of it.
Stinks.
But what do they think out there in radio and radio?
Do you know how Nosferm works?
Nosferatu got his name.
Okay, what do you think of the color?
From climbing a tree and . . .
That's our test.
His nose was big enough for two people.
Thanks, thanks.
You know, he only weighed 170 pounds, but he was six feet tall.
Characteristics and behavior, Nosferatu was originally a wealthy 19th-century Hungarian.
He plucked a rare . . .
Rare.
. . . Rhenuitis flower, because he was a young man.








He lost to a band of gypsies, infuriated the odor and the sinus clearing, and Blossom
cursed the nobleman with eternal life as a vampiric odor eater.
Over the years, Nosferatu terrorized villagers by sucking the odors from baked goods, perfumes,
and flowers.
After luring him into a castle filled with the overwhelmingly enticing aroma of 200 mugs
of chamomile tea, Matthew Damon kept Nosferatu distracted until dawn.
Then, pulling aside the garbage bags he had earlier taped over the windows, Damon watched
with satisfaction as the sinister sniffer burst into flames and was quickly reduced to
ashes.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Where's the weatherman?
They call him Nosferatu now.
He's out in the hall.
I don't know whether you'll get weatherman or not.
Did you want to talk to him?
Hold still.
If you hold still, I'll go get him.
Hold still!
Yeah, stop jerking around, are we?
You have to stand still.
What do you have?
You don't have control over your muscles or something?
Well, that needle stings when they...
I'm sorry.
The report of points at Louis Spoonley was not available at offshore Boone 59...
Not available in any stiller.
...to the wild west of Point Reyes with North 19...
Thank you, weatherman.

for the dictator.
Well, I'm sure it would hate to be mentioned
as the plaintiff in a lawsuit
or as one who had not yet paid for a pair of shoes
now being left behind.
Actually, a gift I would not wish to destroy.
Me.
Me.
Well, tell us, what's the trick this time?
It's called the Whispering Queen.
You and I both know that this is just a trick.
Yes, you're right.
It's a trick.
My assistant is in the basket that I have pierced with salt.
Now, put the lid on.
Oh, watch.
Hi, Rhoda.
She's a cripple, you know.
Stays in her room.
But first, you must shuffle this pack of cards.
Oh, I see.
Well, here goes.
All shuffled.
Good.
Now I lay the pack face down and divide it into three heaps.
One here and one here on the other side.
This is giving me the creeps.
And now this one and the next.
And this one and now this and this.
All right, Don, open the lid.
Five of clubs.
Well, that's quite a trick, Blackstone.
It is puzzling, isn't it?
Yeah.
I don't get it.
Simple, but did it fool us?
I hope you like that trick, ladies and gentlemen.
And until next time, goodbye.

Be hot, hot, hot.
I will know young people.
My hot mouth.
To do young people.
Half of the world I'm pushing, pushing within a year, year, year, year.
We'll reach that climax.
To do sex.
I know sex.
I know desires.
I want to be a, want to be a nerd.
I'm going to be an airline stewardess.
No, no desires.
Bone, bone.
Give them a little thrill.
Sightment.
Young man, what's your plans?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
I know work.
No spitball.
And I know hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.
My mouth.
Slack, slack.
Word.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Slack.
One day without.
Slack makes me weak.
We want to cum.
We want to cum.
We want to cum.
We want to cum.
We want to cum.
We want to cum.

But oh, listen to me.
Slack, slack, slack.
Play with a neighbor.
I don't think, I don't think.
Word.
Word.
Word.
Let them have their dope.
Let them have their dope.
Let them have their sex.
Let them have their sex.
Spit.
That's right.
That's right.
My bone.
You got a hold of it?
Have you ever played it?
Now, let's break it.
Bone is broke.
Bone.
Right?
Feel that.
Feel that.
Hold it up.
Hold it up straight.
That's it.
You're holding that straight.
Now, if you hold it up straight, it stands straight, right?
It all depends on which way you hold it.
You hold it this way, it leans that way.
You hold it this way, it leans that way.
You hold it this way, it leans that way.
Right?
Right?
And neighbor, we're going to end up with this.
Look at it.
You see what I mean?
Feel it.
Try to hold it up.
Can you hold it up?
Look, it fell over.
Try to hold it sideways.
You can.
Try to hold it down.
Oh, it fell on the floor.
Bone.
Bone.
Man alive, a lot of you haven't made it.
And the thing curbed.
Woo.
And when that thing curbed, it hit the teacher smack dab in the head.
Work my clock over.
Well, nonetheless, we'll conduct our survey next week with our special guest, Godfrey Shagnasty.
And he'll teach us how to build our own personal gallows that we can use in our backyard to take care of those old and trusted pets of ours that have just outlived their usefulness.
And yet we love them.
And so we want to make sure that.
And we're not going to allow anybody to take any cell phone movies of them at the gallows.
That's right.
Only clockwork mechanism, eight millimeter.
Gallows are horrible.
Throughout the extensive days, ceremonies.
And film.
Fish, new film.
We will be deeply committed.
They still make it.
To the principle of painless death.
Yes.
Going forward, we'll try to remove the criminalities associated with this.

You can park your pipe at Moonshine Park.
Park your pipe.
What kind of silliness is this, caller?
Hey, man, how's your day going?
Hey, you guys said you were looking for a guy that needs to go to the hospital.
Why can't it be a girl?
It can be a girl.
We were actually referring to some history, but it's just as wonderful to have her story.
You need to go to the hospital?
So, of course, we'd all rush to take you to the hospital.
So, yeah, we'll come over.
Do you want us to come over and take you to the hospital?
There's going to be the doctor there.
Okay, we'll have to go to the girl's home.
There'll be a doctor, yeah.
I need a doctor.
We'll serve your doctorly needs in the car on the way to the hospital.
What's wrong?
Do you need a nurse?
Do you need some boys in boots?
What do you got?
You might need a nurse.
Tell us your symptoms, please.
Um.
I'm a little dizzy.
Dizziness?
Check.
Yeah, I've seen, like, a lot of colors.
Colors?
Check.
Colors?
Yeah, just, like, rainbow colors.
Rainbow colors, huh?
Yeah, and I keep on seeing everything.
And you're dizzy, and you're hearing music, you're hearing voices?
Yes.
Have you exerted yourself unusually lately in any way?
Outside your regular routine?
I feel like you're going crazy because nothing stops.
No, I was just hearing.
You guys need to go to the hospital.
I hear you.
It's me.
Yeah, well, you know, you should go to the hospital.
If you're, what about your fingers?
Do they feel okay?
Fine, I'll stop that.
Your fingers, you know, you touch your fingers.
Those are not her fingers.
Do they feel all right?
Are those your fingers?
No, those are my fingers.
Those are not my fingers.
Oh.
That's not how you better start using their fingers.
Okay, no.
Let's just start over.
Somebody's finger.
Let's just start with the 60s.
All right.
All right.
Everything mellow, and then we'll move up to 2007.
Okay, you ready?
Oh, wow.
Everything just seems to be melting.
Like, oh, my God.
I'm just, it's not really, really bad.
You're tripping.
Okay, now we know.
Okay, we're going to lie on top of you, all three of us.
Yeah.
And hold you down.
And it's going to be.
Make room.
So the train of fate goes over us.
Hug therapy.
Yes, I'm going to start here.
You start how?
What do you think I should do?
Just.
Well, we'll be there in just a minute.
Just lie still now.
And enjoy the rain.
Rainbow.
Wow.
Isn't it beautiful?
Are you guys going to tie me down?
I don't want to be tied down.
No, we won't tie you down.
We're not that kind of doctor.
We're just going to lie on top of you.
We're good doctors.
We've washed your little brain and put it back in your brain pan, and you'll be fine.
Right, because it's your brain.
Wow.
We don't want to.
And we use warm water.
We just want.
I can get a new heart.
And courage.
Yeah.
You know, this is your brain on dust.
Or rather.
And what's the third thing we mix in?
I forget, because I do this so much.
Heart, courage.
I just scooped it out of the can here.
And the brain.
Snakes and snails.
Puppiedog.
A living brain.
A human brain.
Sugar.
Here we go.
Starting the operation.
Then you might just want to get back to Kansas.
I think my arm aches a little bit.
Really?
Okay, we'll fix that too.
Yeah, thank you.
There you go.
Okay, now we're dusting off the exterior of the brain pan.
Okay, yeah, you keep doing that.
It feels great.
I'm awake, are you?
I mean, I.
No, we're both awake.
I'm doing it right now.
We're all awake.
You're sleeping right now, right?
Right.
And I'm doing this right now.
Somebody is, but I.
I don't think it's me.

I think you do.
I'm going to play 2001 for you.
Well, a patient should sit there patiently.
Yeah, and you'll be able to.
You're listening to the soundtrack of 2001.
And we'll just work on your brain.
Okay, now we'll be right there.
Hold on.
Take a deep breath.
All right, just relax.
Don't laugh when you see my moon boots.
Yeah.
They are just really warm this time of year.
She's going into trance now.
That's right.
That's very good.
Are you going to take over, Doctor?
Yes, I'll take over.
Oh, I didn't mean to laugh.
I was just looking down here.
Now, remember, she is not in rapport with you, but I will cause her to respond only
to the sound of your voice.
All right.
The next voice you hear will be Dr. Philo Drummond.
I want you to respond only to this voice.
Here is the backseat.
My head's stiff.
Next.
Not so.
Out.
Down.

Mm-hmm, down.

























There you go.
And she has.
She has to go.

Those are from the great guidance Romain

Take a deep breath.
Now
hold it in.
This is prana.
Prana

breath.
To control your breath
is
to become

Here, this cayenne pepper

Yeah, have a little bit of

Yeah, right.

Jeez, come on.
Come on, man.
You get in the room with you
and all of a sudden it smells like

Yeah, okay.
Oh, I have to put my security
Yeah, everybody's got their orders

I can't get through the door.
I'll be right there.
I've just got to slide this
security card in again.
Let me scan Imaging for access.
Okay, just give me a chance.
Let me try it again.
It worked here.
I'll

Damn, I need to turn it around.
Yeah, it's

Yeah,
I'll say that.
Look, Philo, they're scanning it.
That's who?
That's the Imaging Scan Lady.
Who, what lady?
Imaging Scan.
That's what you're looking at while you're doing it.
What is this?
Yeah, I was a joke, man.
Don't worry about it.
That lady, she's in a skin tight red suit of some kind.
Are we done yet?
Imaging Scan Lady.
See what you're talking about.

Ah, but they granted my access.
There she said, access granted, main title.
Your Honor, may I have a moment, please?
Go ahead.
I would now like to call Mrs. Martha Norris.
Yes, please.
Chief Glass, you stated that Moe Riggs Donald Brown can truck a Pixar retail room.
That's right.
Then why Martha Longville Furrow and Julie Adams?
Well, because.
But is it that being drivers tell someone that's full to pass not truck?
Well, no, that being drive them so exquisitely, I put that I.
Thank you, that's all.
My God, look at you.
In other words, one with a badass must train be a half to Nazis.
Oh.
No, they wouldn't.
I see.
I believe you stated were unequal and your ankle frames you were killed and was for your husband.
They would have been during the to walk.
Yes, that's track, but not all I'd ride.
Just look.
Mr. Mason, I have no further questions of this witness.
Court's adjourned.
I have no further questions of this witness.
And now, have you a trick to show us?
Well, I'm going to show you now, a most unusual one, Don, one that you can do entirely by yourself.
Oh, wait, Blackstone.
You mean that we can fool ourselves with it?
Absolutely.
All you need's a pack of cobs.
Now, Rhoda, take this pack, will you?
And while my back is turned, deal nine cobs.
OK.
This is mystifying already.
Have you finished dealing the heap, Rhoda?
Have I finished dealing the heap,ottle?







All right.
Let's count them all together.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
You mean I have nine cards in my hand?
Yes, nine.
Boy, that's the most baffling trick you ever did.
You mean that you did, Rhoda?
Yes, whenever you try that trick exactly as I described it,
you will always have nine cards.
Say, I'm going to try that myself.
I hope you like that trick, ladies and gentlemen.
And until next time, goodbye.
Playwright Paul Halperin can't get over the woman who inspired him.
The woman of his what dreams.
You got to get back on the horse like I did with your sister.
What dreams may come.
Cool people, just people who consider themselves swinging.
And if you consider yourself swinging, well, you just have to go to the
house.
It's the place to be and the place to be seen.
It's a middle class image or an intellectual,
totally intellectual.
High intellectual.
It grew naturally.
And then for the adults, a desire on my part.
And then high school girls.
We'd like to do high school girls.
It's a very beautiful thing.
Time after time.
When I first came, I realized that it was going to be real good.
Kind of strange, but it's really worked out very well.

Now you are ready to cement the canopy on the top of the fuselage, DL.
Place tab 32 and tab 33 in holes 33A and B.
Now you are ready to apply the decals that came with your model.
In a small bowl of water, soak the sheet containing the decal.
You may wish to separate them using a pair of scissors for more easy application to your model.
Now I have 20 wet decals and I have to put them all somewhere.
Well, here, put them on this.
And the really fun ones with the long, long, long white stripes or something that run along the top of a fuselage of an aircraft.
And they would take forever to get aligned because you didn't know the trick about wetting the model first.
You see, in World War II, they sought the transformation of global politics.
Yeah.
That was the hard part.
You didn't know about that part.
You didn't know all the little tricks.
And so you wind up with a model smudged and fingerprints on the windows and the bad stripes.
I think by the time I made my last model, I was starting to figure that stuff out.
But by then, we burned so many models and pulled so many models up.
I'd rather intend it to support justice and humanity.
You want to leave?
The United Nations.
Out of here, man.
The World Bank, the International Court of Justice, even Military Alliance.

Hey, Baldy, get off of there.
I'm almost finished.
You just told your horse.
I wasn't talking to you.
Even during the worst years of the old war, that's the old war, too, and the global anarchy that followed,
the process of international institution building has continued to develop and flourish.
And they're going to build one near my house, an institution, that is.
Actually, they're going to build it where my house used to be.
They're going to tear down my house and put up a screwball institution, a happy farm, a wacky world.
Ski the gee.
They're going to set up the cuckoo bin.
That's where my house used to be.
Yeah.
For a bunch of out-there widgets and wonkies.
Well, I just don't know what the world's coming to.
Oh, I'll get it.
What is it, King?
Say there's some bad men outside.
Men who want to steal away the vitals of American democracy and erect in its place an obscene and purposeful entry.
Hey, how long does, uh, forget all this.
How long is it, uh...
Can you imagine doing this show for three years?
No.
God.
I can't imagine it.
Me neither.
Who would do that?
Start with ten repetitions, working up to twelve, and then fifteen in weeks three and four.
Roll forward, belly down, on the show until the show is under your shins and you are in the plank position.
Keep your core tight.
Do one push-up, and then initiate from the core.
Pull the show with your feet until your knees touch your chest.
Then roll the show out and repeat.
Sounds like snap.
But, is there a complication in the machinery to buy it?
Sounds like snap.
No, no, it's all, uh, like isometrics.
You don't need anything but yourself.
You just...
You and the doorway, the squat thrust, the vertigo pogo stick.
You just... You and the doorway, the squat thrust, the vertigo pogo stick.

And with luck, you can be a champion.
We don't know what kind of champion. That's up to you.

end of it.
Shake the off.
Push him in front of the car.
Too late.
All right, now we're beginning
our approach back to Earth.
Oh, yeah, it's that time.
Yeah, we've got to start zooming back.
Yeah, zooming onto the field that we're going to land in
and then we have to push the building back into
a position before anybody can see
that we've been flying it around all night.
Yeah, we have to make sure that they know
that we...
They don't know.
Yeah.
It's amazing the way they
got along. They don't know
about that special
function.
In the fullness of time, they'll catch up.
Then they'll be sorry
after me and my theories
and I shall have remained
sweet.
As far as the kneeling
figures, those
are more dark than they can see.
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah, so, yeah, we're taxing in
the building into position here.
Okay, I'm
recovering.
Good. Good, good, good.
The man, the myth, the legend
and the show.
Thank you for being with us tonight.
All you grateful callers.
Get out!
Get out!
Whoa, you spilled over a little bit.
I'm okay, I'm okay.
He just dropped all the listeners.
Let me throw you a lightsaber,
a Mars bar and a couple of mentos.
All right.
He's coming into shore, ladies and gentlemen.
Don't forget, you can't fool Bob.
He tried to swim the English Channel.
Now we must add his name to that.
That long list of losers
will never make it.
Don't forget your new copy
of Revelation X.
Oh, yeah. They're supposed to send me one
in the mail. It hasn't come.
What's the story there?
Stang.
Well, it's a long, long complicated story.
Yeah, Stang. Where's my copy, Stang?
I don't have a copy.
Give me a...
Bring me my horse.
Morigard, come here, boy.
I want you.
Uh...
Ugh.
Get out from under that car.
Ugh.
Now, drop trowel.
Whoa.
And
King Kong, of course,
we have to see once a week because of how
it just makes me drink
because I have to watch this thing again and again.
Good luck.
Drink.
Well, if you drink like that,
you're going to rot your...
You're going to rot your liver out in no time.
You'll have to have an extreme makeover.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Man.
There's no end.

And the show is leaking.
And it's leaking into the next show.
It's puzzling evidence.
More than an hour, less than a show.
We're reviewing movies now.
Sometimes we talk about Bob.
Some of our favorite movies.
Yeah, sometimes we talk about Bob.
But most of the time,
because people are driving to work right now,
and they're thinking about...
They're thinking about their cell phones.
They're thinking about Slack.
They're thinking about all the things that they have
and wish they had, don't have.
And they just wish the show would go away.
And we hope to provide that right now.
So...
Woo!
