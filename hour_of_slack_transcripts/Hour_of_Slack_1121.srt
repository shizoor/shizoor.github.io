00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,140
The unusual vocalizations you were about to hear were tape recorded by a news reporter in the high Sierras of California.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,620
Speaking for Bob.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,280
Yes, friends, card, badge, comic book, and picture.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,500
All yours when you join the Self Genius Hour of Swag.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,740
Oh, yes. We'd be mighty proud to have you become a member.

00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,980
Mail ten cents to P.O. Box 776777.

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,000
That's P.O. Box 777777.

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,920
That's all there is to it. One dime, and you're a member today.

10
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,080
Have fun.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:41,900
Unconscious.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,700
That is all right.

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,320
You can have all the fun you want and be killed in an accident.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,680
I'll feel a lot easier if you'll promise to do that, and so will your mom and dad.

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:52,660
Happy.

16
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:54,960
Happy.

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,700

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,640
Happy.

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,280
Happy.

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,940
Happy.

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,600
No remission without blood.

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,360
No remission without blood, brothers and sisters.

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,220
St. Paul says it, and don't you forget it.

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,140
No remission without the blood of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,700
Amen.

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,380
No remission without blood.

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,440
No remission without blood, brothers and sisters.

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,020
There's no remission without blood.

29
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,260
blood of our Savior and Lord Jesus Christ.

30
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,220
Oh yes, you say, and realize you need hair.

31
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,520
Smells, you can take it, you can take it.

32
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,220
There you have it, A, B, C.

33
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,700
Remember, let's practice.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,420
Action.

35
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,220
Lay down on the couch or bed.

36
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,480
Using the A step, use the B question.

37
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,400
Severely traumatized persons should continue moving along.

38
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,360
Forget the data.

39
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,240
4, 3, 7, 2, 8, 1, 9.

40
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,000
4, 3, 7, 2, 8, 9, 1.

41
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,360
Jam, coke, jam in your head.

42
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,700
Next, disordered minds.

43
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,500
Happy memory.

44
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,780
Let's get to chasing those memories to sharpen that short-term brain.

45
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,660
1, 3, 4, be deleted.

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,780
Your memory gone.

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,520
Opened an area.

48
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,760
More framework than solid.

49
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,420
It is blue or blue-green and about the size of a cantaloupe.

50
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,620
Gee, I hope I tuned into the correct dimension.

51
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,280
Ha ha.

52
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,060
She headed toward the man and the boy with...

53
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,520
Mad eyes.

54
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,740
Hands raised like claws.

55
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,200
Had to jump between them.

56
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,300
You threw your body to save your husband's life.

57
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,420
And shouting something, remembered herself.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,460
Finally succeeded in backing the woman against the wall.

59
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,420
Long enough for the man to grab his son and go outside.

60
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,460
You remember what you uttered?

61
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,040
It is a true story.

62
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,380
I will tell you.

63
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,320
It is a true story.

64
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,780
That he's...

65
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,400

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,620

What?

108
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,220
Um, yeah, thank you.

109
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,040
An exercise in gravity deflection.

110
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,280

She is design. An icon to femininity.

124
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,400

Good luck deciphering this illusion.

128
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,580
Plain twisted shrapnel of peripheral skirmishes dance about the true point of contention.

129
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,740
A blowfrog feminist nostalgia trip.

130
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,080
Let me get that again with the fridge unplugged.

131
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,940
Tossing the gloins. A silent affair.

132
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,560
Eight or nine pills nightly and a red runny nose.

133
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,880
Seats a compliment or a fishing expedition.

134
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,420
But serious filter repair women strap their jugs to one side or another.

135
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,140
This ruling is absolute.

Michael Alcandor's Masonic obsessions triggered by the epitome of accidental overdoses

137
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,280
cannot be repaired or undone too late for that sucker.

138
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,100
But one day when I've accumulated enough formal benignity,

139
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,420
I've found Pulbasa Solani Pastrani loaf.

140
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,340
Graffics,

141
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:31,340


142
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,400
Just what went wrong.

143
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,920
That's as professional as it gets.

144
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,960
Oh,

145
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:52,660
that admittedly feels like aolf lecture.

146
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,180
But I don't want to endure the pain and where it should be.

147
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,180


148
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,180


149
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:53,180


150
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,700
You broke the law!

151
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,080
You broke the law!

152
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,060
The Psychoskeletons did that, friends.

153
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,100
With their crimes against humanity.

154
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:01,300
You can find them at myspace.com slash thepsychoskeletons.

155
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,640
And before that, at the very beginning of our Slack number 1121,

156
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,800
we heard so many cut-ups and intros by Leemur.

157
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:20,060
And a little clip of yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, reading from the new audiobook of Illuminatus.

158
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,960
More on that later.

159
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,260
We heard RURAL WAR ROOM.

160
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:35,800
And there will be a whole lot more RURAL WAR ROOM coming up.

161
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,160
And we heard Reverend Norell Krepp.

162
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,840
As we now hear again.

163
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,520
Have you ever killed innocent civilians without slowing down?

164
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,680
Secured no-bid government?

165
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,660
Or taken contracts from a cash machine?

166
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,180
Or ordered a village destroyed from a phone booth?

167
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,260
You will.

168
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,920
And the company that'll bring it to you, AT&T.

169
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,160
Stimulate large and small privates and wider man can expand faster growth.

170
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,440
And I am so pleased.

171
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,740
All the swearing.

172
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,480
Thank you all for coming.

173
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,300
Thank you for coming.

174
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,460
Thank you all for coming.

175
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,060
Damn the growth.

176
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,700
So well in that position.

177
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,120
Yet it is not growing fast enough.

178
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,320
Not strong enough.

179
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:23,760
Grow.

180
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,260
Grow.

181
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,280
Damn the woman.

182
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,520
Stimulating discipline.

183
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,080
We believe.

184
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,760
Growth stimulating terrorist groups.

185
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,180
And that is fitting.

186
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,880
Growth.

187
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:36,980
Discipline.

188
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,420
And you can rest assured.

189
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:44,160
In the past, Mr. President, you've taken our freedoms and our security and our confidence.

190
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,400
And for growth.

191
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,080
Grow.

192
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,440
Grow.

193
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,760
Simply isn't growing fast enough.

194
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,700
We will execute with pride.

195
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,860
Would you like to test this new product?

196
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,260
She survived a very serious illness.

197
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,560
Would you like to try out this new product?

198
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,220
She came through a very serious illness.

199
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,600
I'm trying to get rid of the cold at the moment.

200
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,320
The pain is beginning to disappear.

201
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,940
I'm trying to fight off the cold at the moment.

202
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,960
The pain is beginning to wear off.

203
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,440
They decided to proceed with the treatment.

204
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,540
Reading in a poor light can cause headaches.

205
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,120
They decided to go ahead with the treatment.

206
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,020
Reading in a poor light can bring on headaches.

207
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,580
I'm too tired to see anybody today.

208
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,820
Feel up.

209
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,440
Feel up.

210
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,660
I don't feel after seeing anybody today.

211
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,760
You must build up your muscles.

212
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,840
You must strengthen your muscles.

213
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,700
Eight.

214
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,140
One.

215
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:32,860
Two.

216
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,720
Three.

217
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,560
Four.

218
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,580
Five.

219
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,480
Six.

220
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,040
Go ahead with.

221
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:38,940
Six.

222
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,120
Bring on.

223
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:40,940
Seven.

224
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,520
Feel up.

225
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:42,840
Eight.

226
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,280
Nor Alpref did it.

227
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,100
Reverend Nor Alpref did it.

228
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,980
Nor Alpref is available at NorAlpref.com.

229
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:58,900
And remember friends, the great American novel Illuminatus by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson.

230
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:07,520
It's being made into an audio book by the guys who put together maybe Logic University.

231
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:16,160
And this, what you're about to hear, is chapter one of the audio book of Illuminatus.

232
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,440
So, let's get started.

233
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,020
Deep Leaf Audio presents Illuminatus Part One.

234
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,020
The Eye in the Pyramid by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson.

235
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,540
Performed by Ken Campbell and Chris Fairbank.

236
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,760
Dedicated to Gregory Hill and Kerry Thornley.

237
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,560
Book one.

238
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,280
Feverum.

239
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,080
The history of the world is the history of the world.

240
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,420
The history of the warfare between secret societies.

241
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,840
Ishmael Reed.

242
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,920
Mumbo Jumbo.

243
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,840
The first trip or Keetha.

244
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,380
From Dealey Plaza to Watergate.

245
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,420
The purple sage opened his mouth and moved his tongue.

246
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,820
And so spake to them and he said.

247
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,840
The earth quakes and the heavens rattle.

248
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,180
The beasts of nature flock together and the nations of men flock apart.

249
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,080
Volcanoes usher up heat while elsewhere water becomes ice and melts.

250
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,220
And then on other days it just rains.

251
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,200
Indeed, do many things come to pass.

252
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,080
Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst KSC.

253
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,380
The Book of Predications.

254
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,420
The honest book of truth.

255
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,660
It was the year when they finally emanentized the eschaton.

256
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,860
On April the first the world's great powers came closer to nuclear war than ever before.

257
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,840
All because of an obscure island named Fernando Poe.

258
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,760
By the time international affairs returned to their normal Cold War level.

259
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,360
Some wits were calling it the most tasteless April Fool's Day.

260
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:11,620
The world's greatest

261
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,320
joke in history.

262
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,000
I happen to know all the details about what happened.

263
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,800
But I have no idea how to recount them in a manner that will make sense to most readers.

264
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,800
For instance, I'm not even sure who I am.

265
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,000
And my embarrassment on that matter makes me wonder if you will believe anything I reveal.

266
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:41,860
Worse yet, I am at the moment very conscious of a squirrel in Central Park just off 68th Street in New York City.

267
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,100
That is leaping from one tree to another.

268
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,100
And I think that happens on the night of April the 23rd.

269
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,100
Or is it the morning of April the 24th?

270
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,320
But fitting the squirrel together with Fernando Poe is, for the present, beyond my powers.

271
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,100
I beg your tolerance.

272
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,640
There is nothing I can do to make things any easier for any of us.

273
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,700
And you will have to accept being addressed by a disembodied voice.

274
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,980
Just as I accept the compulsion to speak out.

275
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:20,500
Even though I am painfully aware that I am talking to an invisible, perhaps non-existent audience.

276
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,900
Wise men have regarded the Earth as a tragedy.

277
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,600
A farce.

278
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,620
Even an illusionist's trick.

279
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:39,200
But all, if they are truly wise and not merely intellectual rapists, recognize that it is certainly some kind of stage in which we all play roles.

280
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,000
Most of us being very poorly coached.

281
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,980
And totally unrehearsed.

282
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,810
Before the curtain rises.

283
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:51,570
Is it too much, if I ask tentatively, that we agree to look upon it as a circus?

284
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:57,330
A touring carnival, wandering about the sun for a record season of four billion years.

285
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,590
And producing new monsters and miracles.

286
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,930
Hoaxes and bloody mishaps.

287
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,270
Wonders and blunders.

288
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,670
But never quite entertaining the customers well enough to prevent them from leaving.

289
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,170
One by one.

290
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,030
And returning to their homes for a long and bored winter's sleep.

291
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,110
Under the dust.

292
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:20,330
Then say, for a while at least, that I have found an identity as Ringmaster.

293
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:24,470
But that crown sits uneasily on my head.

294
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,490
If I have a head.

295
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:31,470
And I must warn you that the troop is small for a universe this size.

296
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,790
And many of us have to double or triple our stints.

297
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,110
So you can expect me back in many other guises.

298
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,470
Indeed.

299
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,790
Do many things come to pass?

300
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:48,450
For instance, right now, I am not at all whimsical or humorous.

301
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,530
I am angry.

302
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,450
I am in Nairobi, Kenya.

303
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:57,430
And my name is, if you will pardon me, Nkrumah Thubar.

304
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:00,030
My skin is black.

305
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,110
Does that disturb you?

306
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:02,830
It doesn't me.

307
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,610
And I am, like most of you, midway between tribalism and technology.

308
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,030
To be more blunt as a kikuyu shaman.

309
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,550
Moderately adjusted to city life.

310
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,590
I still believe in witchcraft.

311
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:20,790
I haven't yet the folly to deny the evidence of my own senses.

312
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,410
It is April the 3rd.

313
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,790
And Fernando Poo has ruined my sleep for several nights running.

314
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:32,410
So I hope you will forgive me when I admit that my business at the moment is far from edifying.

315
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:38,650
And is nothing less than constructing dolls of the rulers of America, Russia and China.

316
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,610
You guessed it.

317
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:44,550
I am going to stick pins in their heads every day for a month.

318
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,470
They won't let me sleep.

319
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,910
I won't let them sleep.

320
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,770
That is justice.

321
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,250
In a sense.

322
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:58,070
In fact, the President of the United States had several severe migraines during the following weeks.

323
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:04,170
But the atheistic rulers of Moscow and Peking were less susceptible to magic.

324
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,610
They never reported a twinge.

325
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,590
P

326
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,110
O

327
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,490
K

328
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,470
A

329
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,210
Puka.

330
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,450
From old Celtic mythology.

331
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,810
A fairy spirit in animal form.

332
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,070
Always very large.

333
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:29,270
The Puka appears here and there.

334
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,090
Now and then.

335
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,950
To this one and that one.

336
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,030
A benign but mischievous creature.

337
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,610
Very fond of rum pots, crack pots.

338
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,750
And how are you, Mr. Wilson?

339
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,190
How are you, Mr. Wilson?

340
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,170
Who in the encyclopedia wants to know?

341
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,030
President, let's go.

342
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,130
Dr. Chumley, the screwiest thing just happened to me.

343
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,310
I know, I know. I believe me heads will roll.

344
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,390
But Dr. Chumley, I was looking for...

345
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,290
No remission.

346
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,710
No remission.

347
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,830
No remission.

348
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,650
Without the shedding of blood.

349
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,210
No remission without the shedding of blood.

350
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:19,210
It's the word of the Bible and the word of God.

351
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,010
And it says it plain and clear.

352
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:25,290
So no high-brow professor can say it means something else.

353
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,550
And this is what it says.

354
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,510
No remission.

355
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,950
No remission, brothers and sisters.

356
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,410
No remission without the shedding of blood.

357
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,590
Without the shedding of blood.

358
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,550
No remission.

359
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,810
No remission without the shedding of blood.

360
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,230
All the blood in the world isn't enough.

361
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,630
Every man, woman, and child isn't enough.

362
00:19:51,850 --> 00:20:00,150
Even all the animals, if you added them in line in some pagan or voodoo sacrifice, it wouldn't be enough.

363
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,650
It wouldn't be enough, brothers.

364
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,710
The good book says so.

365
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:11,470
Because all the blood in the world isn't equal to one drop.

366
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,250
Not one drop.

367
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,830
Not one drop.

368
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:22,150
Not one drop of the precious blood of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

369
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:31,470
You may mock and you may jest, but at the last judgment, the smile will be wiped off your face.

370
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,230
For the day that my derelict國 tells me what is the end is at hand.

371
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:48,550
For all that has been destroyed, give me today号 Vannala earth of the Advance of God and the

372
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:48,550


373
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:57,270
All that has repented and from the power above and from the Father and the Son of Driver of

374
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,710
all things,

375
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:02,590
all things,

376
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:04,690
control

377
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,150
I guess that makes sense.

378
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,190
Well, yeah.

379
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:07,710
Yeah.

380
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,550
Yeah.

381
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:13,050


382
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,670
Stop talking.

383
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,170
Yeah.

384
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,010
Hey.

385
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,070
If you think that's funny, listen to this one.

386
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,430
I was walking down the street and a tramp came up to me, so I bit him.

387
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,390
If you think that's funny, listen to this one.

388
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:28,710
Good evening.

389
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:29,890
This is...

390
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,090
This is genius.

391
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,410
Oh, fuck.

392
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:33,670
Huh?

393
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,370
What's in it for us?

394
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,010
Nothing.

395
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,630
You got a head full of gray.

396
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,690
If I had the chance, I could be a dick like Bob.

397
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,170
Genius.

398
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:45,790
I'll be right back.

399
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,370
From William Shakespeare, Richard III.

400
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,210
No.

401
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,090
Mother.

402
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:00,630
Yes, dear.

403
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,450
Mother, what do husbands and wives do when they get married?

404
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,850
What do husbands and what?

405
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:13,170
George, Kitty was just asking what husbands and wives do when they get married.

406
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,210
I just thought it might be nice if we told her the story together.

407
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:17,930
What husbands and...

408
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,130
Well, dear, you see this human vagina...

409
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,250
Oh, well, I guess I've seen worse.

410
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,710
Now, George.

411
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,650
Now, look.

412
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,710
When a man and a woman are married,

413
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,950
the penis beats around the bush.

414
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:31,490
That's it.

415
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,130
Oh, yes.

416
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,590
That was pretty silly, wasn't it?

417
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:37,730
Oh, sure, kitten.

418
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,110
I guess you're right.

419
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:39,970
Oh, no.

420
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,930
Oh, no.

421
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,670
Oh, my God.

422
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,550
Oh, my God.

423
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,590
Oh, my God.

424
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:11,910
Oh, my God.

425
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:12,930
Oh, my God.

426
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,770
Oh, my God.

427
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,050
Oh, my God.

428
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,990
Oh, my God.

429
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:16,070
Oh, my God.

430
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,770
Oh, my God.

431
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,530
Oh, my God.

432
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:17,530


433
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:25,310
No other nationally known toilet you've ever used equals the subgenius power of...

434
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,110
That's the truth.

435
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,170
And remember...

436
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,970
It's smooth, so smooth.

437
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,330
It's slick, so slick.

438
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,710
It's smooth, smooth, slick, slick.

439
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,270
Hello?

440
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,370
Isn't anybody home?

441
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,950
Yes, you can just see us in the old,

442
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,210
old walking ground.

443
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:51,270
Mold!

444
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,010
Mold!

445
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,470
I still feel like a sense of form.

446
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,050
Once I saw the young seed spread

447
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,790
Across the plains of Neptune

448
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,850
Filled on sunshine and a bit of blood

449
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,610
A sense it was looking good.

450
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,650
Mold!

451
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,550
Mold!

452
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:28,110
Mold!

453
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:28,690


454
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:28,690


455
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:28,690


456
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:28,690


457
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,750
I still feel like a sense of form.

458
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,230
The light bulb's dimmer than it's ever been

459
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,670
But a flame like a ticking time bomb

460
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:54,190
Two fingers raised in a plaster cast

461
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,090
Both feet stuck in the past

462
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,790
Mold!

463
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,530
Mold!

464
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:02,890
Mold!

465
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,970
I still feel like a sense of form.

466
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:06,330


467
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:19,230
Emergency!

468
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,710
Music

469
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,110
Emergency!

470
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,170
Music

471
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,330
All that is beautiful is born to die.

472
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:28,690
Music

473
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:28,690


474
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,390
But only turns to beauty in a crutch and die.

475
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,550
Music

476
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:47,990
Mold!

477
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,570
Mold!

478
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,090
Mold!

479
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:51,530
Mold!

480
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:53,470


481
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,490
Mold!

482
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,570
Mold!

483
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:58,650


484
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:58,650


485
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:58,650


486
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:58,650


487
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:58,930
MOLD!

488
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:04,650
Yes, the song was called Mold by Loop Aznavour.

489
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,370
Loop Aznavour.

490
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,630
And Al Remer.

491
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,590
Conflicted by the sudden death of a man and his family.

492
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,430
Switch to short wave.

493
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,990
See if there's anything special coming through.

494
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:16,210
Yes.

495
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,950
Try the nine meter wave.

496
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,810
Oh, oh, oh.

497
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:22,010
Uh oh.

498
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:22,590
Let's hear that.

499
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,490
Uh oh.

500
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:23,490


501
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:24,550
The soft genius.

502
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,570
The power of...

503
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,130
The soft genius.

504
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:27,130


505
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:27,450
Squash!

506
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,630
The soft genius.

507
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,510
There they are. They're coming in.

508
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,730
Call the whole thing off and save $20.

509
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,710
You ready, Professor?

510
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,030
Ten seconds.

511
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:39,750
Eight, five, three, two, one.

512
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:40,350
Now.

513
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,530
Oh, yeah.

514
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:44,430
Stop.

515
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:48,150
What they're doing is they're nailing their trash up on a pole.

516
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,850
We've all seen them. Signs.

517
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,430
Two on your side.

518
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:57,470
Consumer reporter Shelley Bailey Shaw introduces us to a man who's made ridding his neighborhood of these illegal signs

519
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,330
really his mission to get this done.

520
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,110
He has, Natalie.

521
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,290
And normally in our two on your side reports, we try to be your advocate, your voice.

522
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:11,210
But tonight we want you to meet a man who's already on your side in a battle waged street by street, pole by pole.

523
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,350
O'Nenslow is an unemployed bookbinder with a bike.

524
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,850
On a bike, you see everything.

525
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,070
And a beef.

526
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,390
So when I'm out riding, I see all the signs.

527
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,210
I used to wish somebody would do something about that.

528
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,750
Then I realized I am somebody.

529
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,450
That's when he started his company.

530
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,290
He's got a collection of sorts.

531
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:33,050
170 signs in just four months.

532
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:38,390
Every time I see a phone number on a pole, I think I got to keep people from calling that number.

533
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,650
So they get the idea that they're not going to be making a profit from trashing our neighborhood.

534
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:48,290
Keep in mind, it is illegal to hang these signs on city or utility poles.

535
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:52,970
Even this sign advertising jobs for people who want to put up more signs.

536
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,510
Easy hours, easy cash.

537
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,450
A few years ago, Nenslow says most of the signs were for the poor.

538
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:57,450


539
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,910
Most of the signs were for work at home jobs or weight loss programs.

540
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,270
But now, nearly all of them target people caught in the credit crunch.

541
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,690
I buy houses.

542
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:11,010
My nemesis, the most efficient of all the illegal sign posters.

543
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,590
He's got a ladder, so he puts them way up and nails them in really good.

544
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,170
I kind of have to respect him because he works hard.

545
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,370
His nemesis.

546
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,690
Another I buy houses.

547
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:25,550
Even switched from small nails to two-inch roofing nails.

548
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,450
Forcing Nenslow to develop his own.

549
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:27,750
He's got a few signs.

550
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,050
He's got a new weapon.

551
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,050
Got them.

552
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,910
Dedicated guy, isn't he?

553
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,230
But then, so am I.

554
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:38,250
For a very short time, the city fined a few illegal sign posters.

555
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,690
It's a timely process.

556
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:43,950
It's a resource-heavy process that we just don't have the ability to sustain.

557
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,670
Well, this is Shelly Bailey-Shaw calling from K2 News.

558
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:50,010
We decided to call the I buy houses guy ourselves.

559
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:55,530
When you send out high schoolers to put the signs out, you tell them not to put them on the poles,

560
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,430
but they do anyway because they're paid on a contract.

561
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:57,930
They're paid on a commission basis.

562
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:01,770
And the owner says he only takes them down if there's a complaint.

563
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:02,810
Dead.

564
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,850
Regardless, Nenslow remains undeterred.

565
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:10,670
It's easy to want to give up when you think you're the only one who cares about something like this.

566
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:16,510
But you just got to keep at it, and eventually people will notice, and they'll help you out.

567
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,390
They'll be on your side.

568
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:23,910
Now, the city encourages volunteers like Nenslow, so long as they don't damage painted light posts,

569
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:27,310
the city may try to start up some sort of formalized program

570
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,570
but hasn't done so yet.

571
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:33,770
And you know, there's only one person that has ever on the street actually thanked him for what he does.

572
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,310
So we should thank him for all his efforts and people who do the same thing.

573
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,050
You better believe it.

574
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,250
Anybody seeing him do it should walk up and say thanks a lot.

575
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:40,730
Absolutely.

576
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,530
And maybe grab a pole of their own.

577
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,230
You better believe it.

578
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,110
Shelly, thanks much.

579
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:44,470
Thank you.

580
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,530
How normal is that?

581
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,790
Prepare for shock.

582
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,770
Six vodkas.

583
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:48,690
Six vodkas.

584
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,210
Ooh!

585
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:49,630
Ooh!

586
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:50,790
Normal.

587
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:51,870
It might be normal.

588
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,410
It's normal.

589
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,330
Oh, dear.

590
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,130
Heroin.

591
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:54,830
Full stop.

592
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:57,810
Normal.

593
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,730
I don't know.

594
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:59,430
Normal.

595
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,030
Normal.

596
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:00,930
Am I normal?

597
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:01,690
Normal.

598
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:02,650
Is that normal?

599
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:03,550
Am I normal?

600
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,230
Normal.

601
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:11,370
I had been feeling so normal for such a long time, and I had been in a state of such normality,

602
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,450
unremitting normal.

603
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,430
Normal.

604
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,450
It's a global condition.

605
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:15,450
Normal.

606
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,770
My normality really is normal.

607
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,610
Am I normal?

608
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,690
Are you normal?

609
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,510
Spectacularly normal.

610
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,210
Gonna get worse.

611
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:22,990
Gonna get worse soon.

612
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:23,610
Normal.

613
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,690
Should it be normal?

614
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,430
Normal for me, normal is lipid.

615
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:27,510
Lipids.

616
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,950
Am I normal?

617
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:29,890
Absolutely normal.

618
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,830
I couldn't have cared less.

619
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:31,530
Normal.

620
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,830
Is that normal?

621
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,190
Am I normal?

622
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,130
No.

623
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,010
Normal.

624
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:36,810
Normal box.

625
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,150
I'm pretty normal.

626
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:38,970
Be normal.

627
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:39,870
What's normal?

628
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,910
The normal numbers.

629
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:41,910
It's not healthy.

630
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,870
What's normal?

631
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:43,870
Who's a normal question?

632
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:44,910
It's not healthy.

633
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:48,350
Yes, this is what makes me think I'm crazy.

634
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:49,430
The subgenius.

635
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,570
Power of...

636
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,410
Watch.

637
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:54,590
Watch.

638
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,310
Watch.

639
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:57,310
Yeah?

640
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:57,410
Yeah.

641
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:57,410


642
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,970
Yes, does that animal look like the needy sport girlur…

643
00:30:58,970 --> 00:30:59,010
Watch.

644
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:00,490
Yes!

645
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:04,030
Alwaysın duas в эфире.

646
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,350
essa Microsoft perçok olun.

647
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,370
I gotaggi GI f***.

648
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:19,650
So far I haven't got actually NOTHING.

649
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,130
I can't...

650
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:27,270
If I just put some G

651
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:27,270


652
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:27,270


653
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:27,270


654
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:27,390
comment

655
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:27,390


656
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:27,390


657
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,090
you

658
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:25,630
don't

659
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,370
media

660
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,330
you

661
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:32,970
$250, and complete what's called a porn star for education program.

662
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:34,690
Fireworks.

663
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:39,710
As much a part of summer and celebration as tragedy, especially when the weather's dry.

664
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,230
Use sparklers or fireworks in your area.

665
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,310
Don't dispose of them.

666
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,790
Keep fireworks handy and go up in flames.

667
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:46,490
Ow!

668
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,230
But listen here.

669
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,830
Suppose you've got a great big palace.

670
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,070
Giant Palace.

671
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:53,950
Oh.

672
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,250
Well, that's just what it is.

673
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,010
Hold it.

674
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:58,870
What's the palace good for?

675
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,410
Go on, let's see.

676
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:02,650
Very well.

677
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:03,550
Oh.

678
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,670
Oh, I get it.

679
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:07,890
Good heavens.

680
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,270
That palace has never come up before.

681
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,470
Yes, but if this palace is such a dinger...

682
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,850
I don't even know how it works.

683
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,050
All right.

684
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:20,050
And don't monkey around with that palace anymore, Mr. Quinn.

685
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,610
I might not be around to give you a hand.

686
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,450
Well, I don't understand.

687
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:26,950
Goodbye.

688
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:27,370
Goodbye.

689
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:27,390


690
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,210
What?

691
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,950
Well, heck, Mom.

692
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:32,510
Yes?

693
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,710
There's somebody coming, Dad.

694
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:37,490
You sure?

695
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,590
I saw them.

696
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,790
Honest, Dad.

697
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:40,950
I saw them.

698
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:41,930
Look.

699
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,910
There's something funny about that second one.

700
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,110
I don't like that.

701
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,430
He's all spindly.

702
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,730
And his head's funny.

703
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,110
He's funny, all right.

704
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,470
What is it?

705
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:52,590
Well, that's...

706
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,950
The subgenius power of...

707
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,890
Slash!

708
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:57,390


709
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,090
I don't like this.

710
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,810
You go back to the shack and break out those rifles and see they're loaded, you hear?

711
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:03,710
All right, Dad.

712
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,010
And put away the guns.

713
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:05,630
No!

714
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,890
Hurry, hurry, step this way.

715
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,330
Bricks from the four corners of the world.

716
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,290
There are thin, pinheaded people.

717
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,150
There are fat peenies.

718
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:19,530
So hurry, hurry, look them over the lady with a pinheaded head.

719
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:23,170
You get the whole show now if you hurry, hurry, hurry.

720
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,530
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

721
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,030
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

722
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,370
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

723
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:30,330
We've got the show if you've got the dime.

724
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,290
Yeah.

725
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,210
All so shapely and lovely that...

726
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:34,950
Bob, Bob.

727
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,530
Bob, Bob.

728
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:43,090
From PR News in Washington, I'm found guilty on several counts, including electricity,

729
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,990
water and communications.

730
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,310
Jazz legend Max Roach has died.

731
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:52,310
Roach was a composer and drummer who lacked adequate steel reinforcement.

732
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:56,310
And now updating figures from Wall Street.

733
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,350
12th, 12th, 8th.

734
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,830
9, 7, and 2, 4, 1.

735
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:05,790
It's impossible to know if today's panicky fear was just fearful panic or reflects real

736
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,910
panicky panic.

737
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:11,030
China's president is blamed for heavy rain and flooding in Houston.

738
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:15,730
Rescuers continue their search for victims of PR News in Washington.

739
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:22,250
A thanks to Lemur and this background music, which is by Speed Cave.

740
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,650
And now a report from Noro Pref.

741
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,350
This is the Speed Cave.

742
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,210
With story of...

743
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:35,610
Why…

744
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,310
And it has happened to everyone.

745
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,790
Do not try this at home.

746
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,170
Call and help someone so that they can stay at home.

747
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,510

00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:55,710

00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:55,710


750
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:55,710


751
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:55,710


752
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,550
DORCH

753
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,050
Idiot

754
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:56,350
S 빠

755
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,290
My father, of course, only had baby rhinoceros.

756
00:34:59,530 --> 00:34:59,970
Girls.

757
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,390
Billions and billions and billions.

758
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,090
Wet stuff.

759
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,050
Kangaroo or a whale or a dog.

760
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,370
It seems to be all head.

761
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,090
Very long.

762
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,290
It can wriggle and swim.

763
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,310
Frogs.

764
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,990
Pours his tiny little sperm.

765
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,450
The sperm is on her back.

766
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:12,970
Meat.

767
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:13,350
Meat.

768
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,030
Sperm.

769
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:14,570
Well.

770
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:15,490
Mmmmmmm.

771
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:15,850
Mother.

772
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:16,190
Mother.

773
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:16,470
Mother.

774
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:16,750
Her.

775
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:17,170
Her.

776
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:17,410
Her.

777
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:17,530
Her.

778
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:17,710
Her.

779
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:17,890
Her.

780
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:17,970
Her.

781
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:17,990


782
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:18,270
Her.

783
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:18,810
Right away.

784
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:19,330
Hard.

785
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:19,710
Hard.

786
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,550
There's no family that stays together.

787
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,690
Cats and dogs have the sperm.

788
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:32,570
Are they their guts?

789
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,730
Or their brains?

790
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,230
The most annoying thing.

791
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,790
The most wonderful thing about the dickhub.

792
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:48,770
Pay attention.

793
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,310
I warned you folks.

794
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,370
He raised that freedom.

795
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:00,990
My.

796
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:01,690
Hey.

797
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,730
That's a sweet new one.

798
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:05,810
Oh.

799
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,650
I warned you folks.

800
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,070
I warned you sister.

801
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,110
Yes.

802
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,590
I'm the new.

803
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,510
The new.

804
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,010
The new.

805
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:16,290
The new.

806
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:16,530
The new.

807
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,130
The new.

808
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:17,290
The new.

809
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,370
The new.

810
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:27,990


811
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:27,990


812
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,050
The new.

813
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,630
The new.

814
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:32,670
The new.

815
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:32,730
The new.

816
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:32,730


817
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:36,930
satu-seiya.

818
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:36,950
Seiya!

819
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:36,950


820
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,410
Can I get it?

821
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:37,750
Here it goes!

822
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:37,870

824
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:41,290
I wanted to try the other one.

825
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:41,290


826
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,710
I wanna Marx from the cells, The

827
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:46,390
Project Biohazard.

828
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,310
All right, all right, all right.

829
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,430
There she is.

830
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:49,790
Yeah.

831
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,430
Farrah, walk.

832
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:57,410
Whoa, what's going on here?

833
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,590
It's good stuff.

834
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,690
It's got all the friends, you know.

835
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,550
Really?

836
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:05,770
That's Christmas?

837
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,170
Oh, so nice.

838
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,290
All right.

839
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,390
Let's go.

840
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,090
Yeah.

841
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,950
Oh, God.

842
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:50,910
You're on out.

843
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,050
No wiggle room.

844
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:52,710
No wiggle room.

845
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,190
Oh, my God.

846
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,510
Oh, my God.

847
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:55,010


848
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,430
Oh, my God.

849
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:01,870
Oh, my God.

850
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,610
Oh, my God.

851
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,030
Oh, my God.

852
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,190
What is that?

853
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,710
He doesn't know what he's doing.

854
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,130
Oh, my God.

855
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,730
Oh, my God.

856
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:17,990
Oh, my God.

857
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,010
Oh, my God.

858
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,610
This is so unique.

859
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,790
I'm getting hooked on this.

860
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:23,370
Huh?

861
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,110
Oh, my God.

862
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,290
Oh, my God.

863
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,350
Rural War Room.

864
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,830
Rural War Room.

865
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,950
By Rural War Room.

866
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,290
And now, Noro Press.

867
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,470
Wriggle and do.

868
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,850
Pokey, pokey, pokey, pokey.

869
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,410
M-O-R-P-H-S.

870
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,390
I don't know.

871
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,270
Pokey.

872
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,610
Pokey, Pokey, how's that, Pokey?

873
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,170
Pokey, Pokey, don't eat it!

874
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,150
Help, well...

875
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,010
Pokey, Pokey.

876
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,970
Thanks, Pokey.

877
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,930
You don't go out and play and have adventures anymore, Gumby.

878
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,470
Yipes! Look behind you, Gumby.

879
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,310
Hold on.

880
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,690
That did it, Gumby.

881
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,510
Pokey.

882
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:12,630
Gumby, look!

883
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,470
Pokey, Pokey.

884
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,990
Pokey, Pokey, Pokey, Pokey.

885
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:24,090
You'll want to do everything in your power to make sure that your seeds come up

886
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:27,690
and that they grow into strong, vigorous plants just as a commercial grower does.

887
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:32,210
That's one reason why the United States Department of Agriculture asks for

888
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:35,790
the self-genius power of...

889
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,590
And that means two things.

890
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,010
Fertilizer and the government.

891
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,070
Often they kill the plants.

892
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,150
Speak!

893
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:44,910
Speak!

894
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,750
A wise dog containing meat-mealed and red-blooded vitality.

895
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,090
America's largest dog.

896
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:58,570
Hello, I'm a slack therapist, president of the International Association of Constipation.

897
00:39:58,650 --> 00:39:59,350
I am also...

898
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,910
I feel very constipated.

899
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:01,490
I've...

900
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,090
I've...

901
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,590
Constipation Americans.

902
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:07,870
Hoarding, hoarding chews.

903
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,750
Constipation.

904
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:11,250
Hard, dry, slack clearinghouse people.

905
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,350
Constipated.

906
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,650
Constipated every day.

907
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:14,330
I repeat.

908
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:14,910
I repeat.

909
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:15,910
Constipation.

910
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:16,950
I repeat.

911
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,330
I repeat.

912
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:18,330


913
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:18,330


914
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:18,330


915
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:18,330


916
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:18,330


917
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:18,830
Constipation.

918
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,670
Useless.

919
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:20,110
Rectum.

920
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,210
Why is this important?

921
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:22,990
Out of the body.

922
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:23,650
Experience.

923
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,030
Blackhawk.

924
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:31,050
Let me give you a simple analogy on this concept.

925
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:31,730
Bad breath.

926
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:32,530
PMS.

927
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,630
Canker sores.

928
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,370
Body odors.

929
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:34,970
Hemorrhoids.

930
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:35,510
Obesity.

931
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,450
Just piles up.

932
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:37,630
Laxatives.

933
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:38,250
And joints.

934
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:38,930
Too high.

935
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:39,430
Body.

936
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:39,930
Waste.

937
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,630
Constipation.

938
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:42,970
Number two.

939
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:43,750
Tie it up.

940
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:44,790
For constipation.

941
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:45,990
Number two.

942
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,490
Not hard.

943
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,790
And the length should be the size of a good banana.

944
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,650
Become hard.

945
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,270
Become harder.

946
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:51,870
Gas and odor.

947
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:52,450
Gas.

948
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:52,650
Gas.

949
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,630
Have explosive gas.

950
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,010
Why?

951
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,790
Plummet to the bottom of the toilet.

952
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:56,450
Pump.

953
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:56,810
Pump.

954
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,730
How many of you get up in the morning staggering?

955
00:40:59,170 --> 00:40:59,830
Go ahead.

956
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,270
The cause of constipation.

957
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,010
America has a love affair with crap.

958
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:04,630
Mush.

959
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:04,890
Mush.

960
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,370
Over and over.

961
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,030
Hard or soft.

962
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:07,450
.

963
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:09,710
Lubricate.

964
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,090
.

965
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:10,530
Slack.

966
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:10,990
Silly.

967
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:11,310
Silly.

968
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:11,910
It won't suck.

969
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:15,330
I highly recommend that you try therapy and detoxifying.

970
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,930
My favorite Soviet official.

971
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,250
Sometime chairman of the state planning committee.

972
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:26,650
Vinyamin Emmanuilovich Dimschitz.

973
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:30,350
The bishop's name is Tiny Muskins.

974
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:35,910
Though I think that first name is pronounced in Dutch as Teeny.

975
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,950
Teeny, Tiny, whatever.

976
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,070
The only national gang.

977
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,150
Now, uh, hi.

978
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,330
How are you?

979
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,370
Hello, it's me.

980
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:46,570
Lieutenant.

981
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,030
Um.

982
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:47,750

987
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,210
What is this anyway?

988
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:55,370
Just what it looks like.

989
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,250
You understand?

990
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,210
Yeah, I understand.

991
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,990
Well, see if you understand this.

992
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,650
The Soul Genius.

993
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:01,710

998
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,570
Who are you?

999
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:05,030

1000
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,270

T

1019
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:46,570
There's no poverty.

1020
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,830
Um, I hadn't thought of it.

1021
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:49,810
I hadn't thought of it.

1022
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:50,390
Hit, hit, hit.

1023
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,130
Uh, hit.

1024
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,010
Getting a little wobbly.

1025
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,290
Candidates, candidates, candidates, candidates.

1026
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,470
Croc, croc, croc, croc.

1027
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:55,350
I think they bought them.

1028
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:57,190
I think they bought them to perception of reality.

1029
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,050
Desperate, desperate.

1030
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,050
Oh, uh.

1031
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:03,750
The, the, the, uh, offensive and tasteless Republicans.

Look, look, uh, I think, I think that, I think, I think.

1033
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:07,590
Chaos in Iraq.

1034
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:08,110
Chaos in Iraq.

1035
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:09,110
Help, help.

1036
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,230
That's right, that's right.

More, more.

Thank you.

1046
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:54,390
Coming for to carry me

Coming for to carry me

1051
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:30,210
Oh, I looked over Jordan in 1949

1052
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:40,390
Oh, bring love, Victoria

1053
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:41,490
Coming for to carry me

1054
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:41,490

Coming for to carry me

1061
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:17,490
Oh, bring love, Victoria

1062
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,970
Find out the actual facts about

1063
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,510
The Self Genius

1064
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:26,070
Power of Watch

1065
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,110
No worse than taking a drink

1066
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:29,590
Oh, Tom, how could you?

1067
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:30,470
We're stupid

1068
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:37,670
Like all too many of his contemporaries, Tom is experimenting with something about which too little is known by anyone

1069
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:38,570
Maybe you're right

1070
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:39,790
Oh, come on, Pop

1071
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,630
But some facts are known

1072
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:42,430
How do you know?

1073
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:43,430
Oh, Pop

1074
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:44,150
Come on

1075
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,830
There are apparently few physical manifestations

1076
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,430
Lowering of the eyes

1077
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:50,110
But there are other effects

1078
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,630
Psychological effects

1079
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:54,650
The induced uncontrollable feeling of reason

1080
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:56,430
May result in a loss of attitude

1081
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,970
He becomes distorted

1082
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,790
Because I haven't been caught yet

1083
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:00,830
Isn't it?

1084
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,650
But consider this

1085
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:08,270
Yeah

1086
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:09,990
Hey, yeah

1087
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:10,350
Yeah

1088
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:10,850
So?

1089
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:11,210
So

1090
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:11,530
No

1091
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:12,730
Didn't think of that

1092
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:13,410
Yeah, but no

1093
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:13,750
Yeah

1094
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:14,450
Yeah

1095
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:14,670
Well, I can't

1096
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:17,530
I, uh

1097
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:19,190

People are talking about stuff.

1126
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:43,950
Talk about stuff.

1127
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:44,450
Talk about stuff.

1128
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:45,550
I'm glad people are talking about stuff.

1129
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:48,890
What else?

1130
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:49,610
What else?

1131
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:50,610
Oh, yeah.

1132
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,690
I got this email from Gilligan.

1133
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:53,690
Gilligan.

1134
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:54,650
Gilligan.

1135
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:59,550
Uh, and he was like, so I thought, like, I'm a transsexual.

1136
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:02,070
Like, like, I'm a transsexual.

1137
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:04,090
I was a guy, and now I'm a girl.

1138
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,390
Uh, which is fine.

1139
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:07,990
Fine.

1140
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:09,650
I'm a transsexual.

1141
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:10,050
Fine.

1142
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:11,190
Transsexual.

1143
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:11,970
A little more girly.

1144
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:13,030
Oh, yeah.

1145
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:13,490
So.

1146
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:13,870
Oh, yeah.

1147
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:14,130
So.

1148
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:15,190
Transsexual.

1149
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:18,250
Han is coming up in a couple weeks, so if you haven't registered.

1150
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:19,150
Transsexual.

1151
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:21,650
That's han.blogspot.com.

1152
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:22,530
Uh.

1153
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:23,510
Uh.

1154
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:24,770
So, yeah.

1155
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:25,090
Uh.

1156
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:25,610
Uh.

1157
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:26,150
So.

1158
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:26,470
Uh.

1159
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:29,410
Two thousand.

1160
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:29,910
Thousand.

1161
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:30,270
Four.

1162
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:31,830
Listen and live.

1163
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:33,130
Listen and live.

1164
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:34,270
How to make people like you.

1165
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:34,570
Less.

1166
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:35,610
Five years of shootings.

1167
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:36,530
Less than two seconds.

1168
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:36,890
Clearly.

1169
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:37,950
Boring or threatening.

1170
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:38,690
Dimwitted.

1171
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,330
And one thing became very clear.

1172
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:41,370
People like you.

1173
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:41,790
Privileged.

1174
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:41,790


1175
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:42,830
Barbie doll conventions.

1176
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:43,530
Government.

1177
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:44,230
And television.

1178
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:44,890
Yes, television.

1179
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:45,790
Stink.

1180
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:46,370
Stink together.

1181
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:46,710
Together.

1182
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:47,610
Keep your brain alive.

1183
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:48,290
Feel love.

1184
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:49,230
Emotionally.

1185
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:49,990
And we need love.

1186
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:51,090
Face to face.

1187
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:52,110
Don't waste my time.

1188
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:52,890
Friend or foe.

1189
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:53,610
Fight or flight.

1190
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:54,610
Undress and.

1191
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:55,650
And fresh and exciting.

1192
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:56,170
Try this.

1193
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:56,870
World peace.

1194
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:57,730
Try this.

1195
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:58,410
Bungee jumping.

1196
00:53:58,530 --> 00:53:58,750
Feel.

1197
00:53:58,890 --> 00:53:59,070
Feel.

1198
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:00,370
Unbutton your jacket or coat.

1199
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:00,970
High.

1200
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:01,410
Yo.

1201
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:02,170
Full blown.

1202
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:03,890
Ideally you'll need a partner to work with.

1203
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:04,490
Clap.

1204
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:05,490
Now the real fun begins.

1205
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:06,210
Head energy.

1206
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:07,110
Head to head.

1207
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:08,010
Gets even better.

1208
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:08,730
Keep listening.

1209
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:09,950
I don't want to be lonely.

1210
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:10,890
And it makes no sense.

1211
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,210
Family and work.

1212
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:12,690
A joy.

1213
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:13,850
Poached eggs.

1214
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:14,410
Poached eggs.

1215
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:14,910
Without thinking.

1216
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:15,850
Who knows where it will lead.

1217
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:16,950
Slouch in a chair.

1218
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:17,990
And let your head droop.

1219
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:18,370
Feel good.

1220
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:20,150
Putting out useless attitudes.

1221
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:20,870
Right.

1222
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:21,650
Think about it.

1223
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:22,610
Be doomed from the start.

1224
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:23,210
Help.

1225
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:23,470
Help.

1226
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,410
There's something warm.

1227
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:24,750
Facts.

1228
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:24,930
Facts.

1229
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:25,130
Facts.

1230
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:25,350
Facts.

1231
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:26,790
How about that for a really useful attitude.

1232
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:27,370
Useful.

1233
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:27,890
Revenge.

1234
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:28,430
And disrespect.

1235
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:30,790
Help.

1236
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:31,670
Help.

1237
00:54:32,490 --> 00:54:32,890
Help.

1238
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:33,990


1239
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:34,470
Help.

1240
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:35,550
Help.

1241
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:37,130
What did I do?

1242
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:37,950
Stay back.

1243
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:38,730
What did I do?

1244
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:40,810
The Self Genius.

1245
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:41,750
How.

1246
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:41,870
How.

1247
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:42,230
How.

1248
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:43,710
How.

1249
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:44,270
How.

1250
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:44,690
How.

1251
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:44,690


1252
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:45,450
Oh my God.

1253
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:46,470
Do it.

1254
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:47,390
Help me.

1255
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:55,210
The American Academy of Neurology has issued a new guideline for using tics.

1256
00:54:55,370 --> 00:55:01,250
All available studies indicate that using tics is not helpful and carries significant risk

1257
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:07,010
and is also associated with diarrhea, bloodstream infections, and blood clots and therefore

1258
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:07,710
is recommended.

1259
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:11,770
Once again, all available studies indicate that using tics is not helpful and carries

1260
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:17,110
significant risk but should never be recognized in the future.

1261
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:19,010

Wiretap.

1270
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:32,250
Without a warrant, stunning surveillance.

1271
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,830
Without a warrant, terrorist government practice.

1272
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:38,090
Wiretaps never, never cooperate with the government.

1273
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:39,110
Well, I hate facts.

1274
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:40,630
Read that in the reverse.

1275
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:44,150
This is a terrorist surveillance program.

1276
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:48,670
This is intended to wiretap millions or billions in America.

1277
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:50,130
I target the government.

1278
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:52,230
I honestly don't understand.

1279
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,330
This is a problem.

1280
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:54,610
Unconstitutional.

1281
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:55,410
That's not good.

1282
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:55,970
That's not good.

1283
00:55:56,050 --> 00:55:58,010
Vacuum up Americans' legislation.

1285
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:06,650
Yeah.

1286
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:09,210
Shoot them and slit their bellies.

1287
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:09,730
What for?

1288
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:12,650
Like he said, a man has to make a choice.

1289
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:15,530
Yes, tasty, great, and pure.

1290
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:17,070
Here, I'll cut the bellywood.

1291
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:18,150
Touch the body.

1292
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:22,570
And it's easy and absolutely swell eating.

1293
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,890
The most versatile dish in the world.

1294

Oh, that was our impression in it.

00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:28,370
Hahaha.

00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:35,010
For the first time, science has created the self genius.

1298

Power of science.

1299
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:37,910
What?

1300
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:40,610
Yes, it contains pure virgin sh-toilets.

1301
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:41,950
What kind of show are we gonna have?

1302
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:44,090
Well, I figure on something gay.

1303
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:45,650
Uh, no dull spots, sir?

1304
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:46,950
Well, there may be a little tonight.

1305
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:48,290
Bob's coming over a little later.

1306
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:49,810
But let's have some music, huh?

Charged with one count of invasion of privacy.

1316
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:07,790
And is likely to face more charges.

1317
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:08,230
