1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,160
In one of the countless billions of galaxies in the universe lies a medium-sized star,

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:14,000
and one of its satellites, a green and insignificant planet, is now dead.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,980
From PR News in Washington, I'm Idealon.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:24,600
The FBI says that President Bush landed about 100 feet away from his podium on Wall Street 28 and 62529.

5
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,860
Byron Dorgan says Federal Judge Joan Lefkoe Brown was a dud.

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,640
PR's bad. PR's bad.

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,760
PR's PR News, meanwhile, has called for more violence.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,120
Police say PR News was gunned down today in Washington.

9
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,040
Hello? Hello? Hello?

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,820
I thought I told you never to call me here.

11
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,840
This is important. I'm trying to do something of importance. Can't you understand that?

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,320
Yes, I know you have needs, but I have needs too, and my needs are to broadcast...

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,080
What is... Is that... Will you get that away from the phone? I can't even...

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,340
Why do you call me here?

15
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:57,960
All right, okay.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,840
We'll talk about this later.

17
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,980
I'll call you some other... Yes, I... No, I don't want to say it. I'm...

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,080
All right, I love you. Now... Yes.

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,140
Yeah, puppy biscuit. Right. Two pounds of butter. Right. I won't forget.

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,760
And, uh... Yes, the Simpletons are coming over tomorrow night. Yes, I... All right. Okay.

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,940
Yes, you too. All right. Okay. Goodbye.

22
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,980
Well, that was another typical disgruntled caller disrupting our show.

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,100
So we've come here today to dramatize...

24
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,200
It's a shameful condition.

25
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:31,660
It's...

26
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,760
Bob?

27
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:45,780
Bob?

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,300
Now, uh...

29
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,880
We have a... We're looking deep into the brain of the Bobby now.

30
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,200
Listen to that babble of Bob's in the brain of the Bobby in the tiny...

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,020
He thinks about his Bob.

32
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:58,840
Well, I...

33
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,500
I rarely do.

34
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,620
He pulls on his Bob and he packs his Bob and he...

35
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,040
Now, come on. Let's keep it clean here.

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,160
He does little movies of his Bob and, you know...

37
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,200
Oh, those are so cute. You can run them again and again.

38
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:08,860
It's true.

39
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,380
And we've accepted that free gift of being made righteous.

40
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,920
Father, today, open up the eyes of our understanding.

41
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:24,060
Let the presence of the Holy Spirit fill this room

42
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,240
and flow through this tape, this CD, this cassette tape,

43
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,840
this book.

44
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,500
Oh, God, talk to us today.

45
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,640
Help us understand how much you are for us.

46
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,020
You said you came that we might have life and have it.

47
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,960
Have a life.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,960
Have a life worth living.

49
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:51,680
A wonderful, faith-filled, happy, healthy, joyous, successful, prosperous life.

50
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,300
And just as you broke the powers of darkness at Calvary,

51
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,100
you spoiled the principalities and powers.

52
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,580
And you've come now to divide the spoils of the strong men

53
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,380
with those of us that are rising up and being strong in you.

54
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,320
Thank you, Father, for this message

55
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,580
and this great healing prosperity revival

56
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,900
that's sweeping across our land and around the world.

57
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,240
In Jesus' name, amen and amen.

58
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,700
Thank you, God.

59
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,000
Praise God.

60
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,920
Are you ready to get into the Word now?

61
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,740
Oh, yes.

62
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,440
The book of Deuteronomy, the 11th chapter,

63
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,100
it says that,

64
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,600
If we will put God's words in our mind, in our heart, in our soul,

65
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,560
our days will be as the days of heaven on earth.

66
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,300
Now, listen to this.

67
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,520
The plague of frogs.

68
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,780
The plague of bugs.

69
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,720
The plague of blood.

70
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,860
The plague of infinite darkness.

71
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,740
The plague of your brinner.

72
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,020
The plague of Pharaoh's tiny son.

73
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,040
Only a tidbit in the malicious mouth of dogs.

74
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,440
We're standing up high on the plateau,

75
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,900
looking out over the Indians,

76
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,840
thinking to ourselves,

77
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,340
what if they take over this great land?

78
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,040
I die now, my son,

79
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,860
but someday there will be a man

80
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,280
with something in his mouth from which smoke comes

81
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,720
like the fire on this sacred mountain.

82
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,960
I am weak, my dear son,

83
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,640
but I tell you that this man will be named.

84
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,720
Yes, this early misinterpretation of prehistory

85
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,900
predicted the coming of Marlboro Man as a leader in the future.

86
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,740
What the hell is it with you people?

87
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,680
What do you mean?

88
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,520
You know what I mean.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,160
Management, you, Jesus, John the Baptist,

90
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,200
a whole bunch of you.

91
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,340
All fired up to throw your lives away.

92
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,200
They did what they had to do.

93
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,360
Hogwash.

94
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,080
You think the Lord had to die to make his point?

95
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,740
What if when they said,

96
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,120
come on down from that cross,

97
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,920
old Jesus just come on down and spit right in their eye?

98
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,100
What harm would that have done?

99
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,140
That's about the dumbest thing I ever heard.

100
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,320
No, it ain't.

101
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,740
The dumbest thing is dying when you ain't gotta.

102
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,100
Dying just because you piss poor at living.

103
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,000
That ain't true.

104
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,780
It is true and you know it.

105
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,000
And I'll tell you something else that's true.

106
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,100
When it comes to living,

107
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,240
dying is the easy part.

108
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,820
Uh, we, we, uh, we're still at war.

109
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,720
But you bet.

110
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,820
Ask others.

111
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,060
Ask others.

112
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,800
My department.

113
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,700
Ask the American people.

114
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,700
But my department is worshipped in this mess.

115
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:30,700


116
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:30,720
Be, make sense.

117
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,900
Make sense.

118
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,040
The American people expect us to do that.

119
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,020
The American people expect us to do that.

120
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,700
But you bet.

121
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,580
We've been.

122
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,900
Still at war.

123
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:39,900
Still at war.

124
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,880
Still at war.

125
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,420
But you bet.

126
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:41,960
We still at war.

127
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,220
Still at war.

128
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,080
Still at war.

129
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,200
Stop.

130
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,120
We still at.

131
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,660
We still at.

132
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,260
We still at.

133
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:50,760
We still at.

134
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:50,800
Still at.

135
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:50,900
Still at.

136
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,200
Still at, still at, still at war.

137
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,040
People expect.

138
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,620
People expect.

139
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:54,760
People expect.

140
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,040
Do that.

141
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,840
Do that.

142
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,140
Uh.

143
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,740
Re-

144
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,260
He's still at war. He's still at war. He's still at war.

145
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,080
And here we are Sunday morning in Normaltown, USA.

146
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,140
And we're driving down the new concrete freeway.

147
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,920
Dad smoking his pipe while Mom applies her lipstick.

148
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,780
In the rearview mirror...

149
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:22,840
In the backseat, Junior and Sis take turns French-kissing Spots, the family dog.

150
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,340
There's Mr. Wilson emptying the trash into his...

151
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,840
A clean hit, and Mr. Wilson will be in the hospital at least two and a half years.

152
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,620
Hi, Mr. Wilson.

153
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,020
Goodbye, Mr. Wilson.

154
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:34,400
Sorry about stealing you.

155
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,500
Okay.

156
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,940
As long as you apologize in the future, everything's okay.

157
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,420
And now we come to Four Corners, the famous traffic intersection in Midvale's downtown business district.

158
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,260
Hi, Mr. Caller.

159
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,660
In my hometown.

160
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,020
See, he's so happy here.

161
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,540
As Richard Nixon used to say during the Vietnam War,

162
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,880
now...

163
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,520
More than ever.

164
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:02,980
You!

165
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,540
You look like, you look like, you look like you're just the right age to be drafted.

166
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
Does that even bother you?

167
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,240
It was a sign at Jonestown behind Jim Jones' dead body.

168
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,480
And it said,

169
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,640
Those who do not remember the past are condemned.

170
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,420
To repeat it.

171
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,300
Those who do not remember the past are condemned.

172
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,700
To repeat it.

173
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,660
Which would you rather sacrifice, your hot car or your life?

174
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,640
Die for oil, sucker.

175
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,220
Hurry, hurry.

176
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,020
Hurry, ladies and gentlemen.

177
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,880
Come to the subgenius land carnival of grotesques and oddities for one dime, ten cents.

178
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,560
One thin tenth part of a dollar admits you to the kingdom tense.

179
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,600
You will see two-ton Tessie, the ugliest thing on the Midway.

180
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,780
See her twirl her tassels.

181
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:19,260
Grown men, blanch, and young boys lose the desire to continue with puberty when this horrific sight of nature is revealed.

182
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,540
Oh my.

183
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,780
Hey, that's my butt.

184
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,660
Billy, you are not going in there.

185
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,340
Come away right now.

186
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,560
Oh, come on.

187
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,500
It looks me, Aunt Bertha.

188
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,340
I want to see the six-headed cow.

189
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,400
I want to see the two-headed snake, Aunt Bertha.

190
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Now, boys, you know that it says in the Bible,

191
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:45,960
He who lookest upon the two-headed geek becomes himself a horrible freak.

192
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,720
One of us. One of us. One of us. One of us.

193
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,880
And so, Aunt Bertha and the children left the fairground.

194
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,540
Sadder. But perhaps a little wiser.

195
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:10,520
For they understood that Jehovah One in His Majesty had put the carnivore there in the first place just to teach them that lesson.

196
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,520
I want to go see the lonesome cowboy Dave.

197
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,980
I want to go see Red Mist. I want to go ride on Red Mist.

198
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,260
I want to go see the Brother Justin, seven-headed devil.

199
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,300
Search and destroy, search and destroy.

200
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,240
Come on, come on.

201
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,440
I want to go see the Antichrist, and bye.

202
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,520
Okay, now just...

203
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,960
I just want candy apples.

204
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,500
Quiet down or you're not going on any of these damn rides.

205
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,900
First, you pull up your pants.

206
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,120
You're crying out loud.

207
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,260
You look like a shoe baby.

208
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,400
Whatever the hell that is.

209
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,180
So, order caffeine.

210
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,180
And tie your shoes, by the way.

211
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,440
I've got to go kill that devil preacher, Bob.

212
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,980
Stan, you'll get plenty of chances to kill lots of things if we go on Red Mist or search and destroy.

213
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,620
No, man, I know why I've been given these powers.

214
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,760
I've been given these powers so I could go be the one that kills Bob.

215
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,500
Well, you'll get plenty of chances to try your powers out on these new war rides.

216
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,100
I'm going to kill Bob and save the world, man.

217
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,020
Ah, you can kill anybody you want and win a medal for it or maybe even a Googie prize.

218
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:03,640
Really?

219
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,520
Have you ever seen one?

220
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,960
They're as big as the sun and they fit neatly on anyone's chest.

221
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,160
We can go to that recruitment place and join up.

222
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Oh, no, that's for later.

223
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,380
First, we're going to take a ride on Red Mist.

224
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,780
I just step inside the little capsule here.

225
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,780
Oh, man, this is authentic.

226
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,380
Shut up.

227
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:19,720
This is scary.

228
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,020
Please don't go on the Red Mist ride.

229
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,780
This is the unfriendly neighborhood.

230
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,740
I don't want you to go on the Red Mist ride.

231
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,760
There's a surge and sea all over the walls.

232
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,440
And up here comes a Red Mist.

233
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,360
Somebody just exploded an anti-personnel.

234
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,380
Oh, that was backwards, wasn't it?

235
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,420
Of course it's backwards.

236
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,140
It's all backwards.

237
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,960
The planets you live on.

238
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,440
The cheese you eat.

239
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,060
The factories you smell and the olfactory feats you perform.

240
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,680
Everything in here is controlled.

241
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,200
The Red Mist.

242
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,540
The search and destroy rockets.

243
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,360
The little rides that take the children to teach them about war.

244
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,180
For it is what they need to learn.

245
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,020
And yourself, why have you enlisted?

246
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,800
Oh, carnival today.

247
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,480
Everything has been so backwards and upside down and inside out

248
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,420
that I just had to come here to see if I could figure it all out.

249
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,040
Well, there's no chance of that.

250
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,140
Everything's going to look pretty much askew as it did before.

251
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,420
But if you just put your hand here on the little plan-gar,

252
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,860
and let's say it's heating up now.

253
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,780
I don't know if I should do this.

254
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,040
Oh, you have to do it.

255
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,160
It's taking your decoder name, your special eye patch now.

256
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:25,900
Ah.

257
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,640
That looks good.

258
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,220
You look like a real pirate.

259
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,700
You're going to be able to kill lots and lots of people and scare them before they die.

260
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,560
And it could feel real good.

261
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,680
But remember, if you step on the wrong thing,

262
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,400
Red Mist.

263
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,340
I'm nervous. I'm really, really nervous.

264
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,920
Well, here's some nerve pills.

265
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,560
And here's the nerve gas.

266
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,400
Don't get too flatulent there.

267
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,340
Just a little army joke.

268
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,320
Ah, fudge.

269
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,880
Yeah, up it up, baby.

270
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,980
Be careful with that nerve, Jay!

271
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,420
Yeah, I don't want to have too much of that.

272
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,160
Okay, okay, okay.

273
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,180
I'm feeling kind of nervy now, aren't I?

274
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,780
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

275
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,300
Ready to spank the future?

276
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,700
Show them what it is.

277
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,500
Yeah.

278
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:13,340
That's the first thing I noticed about them was the strange laughter after coming out of the rides.

279
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:22,760
The carnival itself wasn't impressive as far as the facility or fairgrounds or anything.

280
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,580
You know, they didn't have much going on.

281
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,360
Not too many potato cakes or funnel hoses or any of those things.

282
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,540
There were a lot of important records and documents they were keeping somewhere.

283
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,540
It looked like the ones in Red Mist were having the most fun.

284
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,300
That simulated blood all over there.

285
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,440
I like that booth.

286
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:46,940
That way they had them Arturians that were that cult that liked to cut each other's legs and arms off so they could follow that one cult guy.

287
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,960
Oh, that is sh-

288
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,800
That's a crazy cult.

289
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,140
The John Wilkes booth was my favorite.

290
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,220
The one that would just pop surprise.

291
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:54,500
Oh, yeah! That was crazy.

292
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:54,780
Killer!

293
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,720
Pops the Prez.

294
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And I wish they'd stop doing this to me because my nerves are...

295
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,260
My nerves are not meant to be part of this.

296
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,160
Arturo.

297
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,660
Yes?

298
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,200
What is it?

299
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:11,940
Our hero.

300
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,680
I am not your real hero.

301
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,360
I am more of a figment of your October imagination.

302
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,100
But that's okay, friends.

303
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,360
Because we're back at church again.

304
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,180
The fun ride, the Abusement Park, we call it.

305
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:28,760
Yes.

306
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,640
Yes, indeed.

307
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,820
The Dobstown Abusement Park of the Hour of Slack.

308
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,560
This episode, number 996, entitled Revenge of the...

309
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,820
Shit.

310
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,780
A foul number.

311
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,260
1996.

312
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,600
Mmm.

313
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,080
Yeah.

314
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,620
And we've been listening to...

315
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,660
The show started out with the usual chop-ups by Mr. Fernando.

316
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,080
Mr. Fernando.

317
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:03,360
And a bunch of collage material there by Norel Pref at heavyconfetti.com.

318
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,740
And of course, we heard Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence and those old-timey guys from the

319
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,620
old-timey KPFA show, which is still on to this day on kpfa.org.

320
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:20,580
And praise all those many orgs who help us and bring us things like...

321
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,060
Fat suits.

322
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:22,920
Yeah, fat suits.

323
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,160
Fat suits.

324
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,340
The armaments are very important, Stang.

325
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:31,400
As a member of the service club, you should know that these armaments are fully insured,

326
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,440
and they're very, very safe for even the smallest brat.

327
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,040
And speaking of brats, they're all about to get drafted, aren't they, as I understand

328
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,320
it?

329
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,560
Yes, and they're going to have to attend those.

330
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:49,120
There's big talk of sending them up into the sky to pioneer the outer planets, the new

331
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,860
world...

332
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,660
Nice.

333
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:57,960
...where our youth can go to fight for the new Mars and the old Earth and protect freedom...

334
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,780
Liberties.

335
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,140
...and media.

336
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,060
The Omicron death.

337
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:09,500
T-shirts and tennis shoes and the American Western Civilizational Way.

338
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,200
The Black Stan.

339
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,360
The queer hats and synoptic remotes.

340
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,400
And it's our burden, friend.

341
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,620
It is a burden that we must take on because...

342
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,040
Well, actually, no, we don't have to take it on, do we?

343
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,640
Because isn't that the point?

344
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:20,640


345
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:20,640


346
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:20,640


347
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:20,640


348
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:20,640


349
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:20,640


350
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:20,640


351
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:20,640


352
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:20,640


353
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:20,640


354
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:20,640


355
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:20,640


356
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,020
Isn't there something bigger than saving the world?

357
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,100
Something called X Day.

358
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
X Day.

359
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,380
Yes.

360
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,720
X Day is approaching, friends.

361
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,780
X Day.

362
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:38,920
Your prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stank, does not want to see you go unruptured on

363
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:45,140
that precious day, that prophesied day that Bob said was coming, July 5th, 1998.

364
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,660
This could be that year, friend.

365
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,920
One of these days, it's going to happen.

366
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,100
You don't know.

367
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,700
You don't know what planet this is on.

368
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:51,920
I'm not waiting.

369
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,580
I know.

370
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:52,960
Yes, it's...

371
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,800
And, friends, the X Day drill, actually.

372
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:02,540
The event itself, the gathering, the great gathering of the subgeni will occur from June

373
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:11,500
30th to July 5th of this year, they falsely call 2005, at Brushwood Center.

374
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,480
Brushwood Folklore Center, Sherman, New York.

375
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,880
You're not going to learn much folk-lay over there before we have Folklorico this year.

376
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,540
No, but there will be the bad film.

377
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,420
Not too many dancing ladies in red Piper dresses or those people with the funny hats.

378
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:31,860
The evil bad film drive-in will be there, Dr. Dark's bad film drive-in, as usual.

379
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,920
With evil popcorn and hot dogs to go with it.

380
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,980
Sideshow marvels, limbless geeks and cult figures, human fights.

381
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,520
People with one eye right in the middle of their bleeding forehead can read your mind

382
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,660
and wish they couldn't.

383
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,360
The amino acids heard in the background.

384
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,080
DNA, which sponsors their activities.

385
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,800
Nude squid gigs, my friend.

386
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,880
Oh, and they're fun to eat as well as throw at passengers on this rickety train.

387
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:05,900
And the costume ball this year is with the theme of deities, yes, yes, yes.

388
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,340
Dress as your favorite false prophet.

389
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,140
Build a huge false idol to worship.

390
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,360
Well, we've done that plenty of times before, my friend.

391
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,340
We've built false idols.

392
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,940
We've built false idols all up and down this highway.

393
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,320
Look at their skulls rising up high in the sky.

394
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,720
Look, there's the giant skull of Philodrummon.

395
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,780
He'll be there too.

396
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,480
Shines, just like he shines his feet.

397
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,820
And look, there's the skull of the Reverend himself.

398
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,720
Ah, yes, torpid vehicle, but it can still do wonders if you push the right buttons.

399
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,920
Oh, such torpidity.

400
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,600
And friends, you'll get torpid as heck.

401
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,860
And then naked frop baptism, or Bobtism, I should say.

402
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,400
In the great heated pool of Brushwood.

403
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,340
Bodies will float in the river.

404
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,820
Gashes above their eyes and ears are not a thing to concern yourselves with.

405
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,200
They have taken these wounds upon themselves.

406
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,540
They're mad.

407
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,640
They want only one thing.

408
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,360
A new, a new brave.

409
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,360
A new race.

410
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,340
A new slack.

411
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,400
A new Bob.

412
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,560
Actually, we do want a brave new world, friends.

413
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,800
Better than this chicken crap baloney we've been dealing with.

414
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:21,180
And that's why lonesome cowboy Dave and the mondo retardo band will be at X Day.

415
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,260
It's why there'll be launchings.

416
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:29,860
Why, look at that head fly through the air, followed by the brain and the soul and the soul brain mind.

417
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,220
And the fingerprints.

418
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,900
Oh, that's beautiful.

419
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,120
Oh, what a fine launching.

420
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,480
Excellent form with his swing there.

421
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,580
Dr. Banz, friends, to launch those heads.

422
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,720
Like the aforementioned amino acid we're going to be.

423
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,420
Fully accredited, Dr. Banz. Fully licensed.

424
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,680
By the state of anxiety in which this lightning bolt strikes.

425
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
Never mind it.

426
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,960
Friends, these are the doctors that'll pry your mind open, just like this show does.

427
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,100
Doctors for Bob, man.

428
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,360
It will open various doors for you.

429
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,320
Look closely at these doors.

430
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,440
A giant mahogany door with a beautiful silver clapper on the bell.

431
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,300
And a beautiful Reverend Nikki Death Chick whipping and spanking the guilty.

432
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,800
And the innocent until they're guilty again.

433
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,540
And Sister Ducadence.

434
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,200
Yes, I just talked to her tonight on the phone.

435
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,760
Making plans to be there all the way through July 5th, friend.

436
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,540
It's on a Tuesday.

437
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:30,900
But are you going to go back to work because you have more faith in Mammon than in Bob?

438
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:38,840
Are you going to do that and just skip waiting for the saucers that beautiful 7 a.m. July 5th, Tuesday?

439
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,160
Skip on down like a bright innocent child.

440
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,800
Everything is sanctioned by the Knights Pimpler.

441
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,780
There's no lost cheese or fried lightning bolts.

442
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Everything is square and juicy.

443
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,540
You'll love it, little ones.

444
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,700
And the little one will love yours.

445
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,840
And do you know why?

446
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,740
Because you know who else is going to be there, friend?

447
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,100
You.

448
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,420
That's right. You're going to be at Exit 8.

449
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,140
You're going to be with us on the saucers, ain't you?

450
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,440
Because you're a subgenius minister.

451
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,720
Otherwise, you probably wouldn't be listening to this show.

452
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,140
You wouldn't be able to listen to it without wanting to sign up, join up, and be a subgenius minister.

453
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,100
Casting out devils and false prophets.

454
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,160
A lot to throw out.

455
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,360
Yeah, a lot to cast out.

456
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,200
And sexing those fraught nuns and nun snakes.

457
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,120
Oh, lots of sex and nuns.

458
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,120
You know, we're like any respectable, huge world religion.

459
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,320
Our priests are sex fiends.

460
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,860
We don't chase after children because they're too small.

461
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,020
Oh, yeah. That's the main problem. They just don't fit, right?

462
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,840
And friends. But we chase after them for their souls.

463
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,020
We want to raise them.

464
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,160
We want to see that they're raised right.

465
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:43,600
Wow.

466
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,900
It's the same for everything.

467
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,600
There's nothing like nothing.

468
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:52,160
You never saw anything so heartwarming as a whole field full of subgenius children on

469
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:58,540
Ex Day Mourn, waiting for those saucers to come down, doing things that you wouldn't do normally, you know,

470
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,440
because it's not usually the end of the world.

471
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,680
But you're not normal, and you can do these things.

472
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,200
You can not only warm those hearts.

473
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,820
You can cook them in a pan, and we're going to cook plenty.

474
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,120
Praise Bob. Praise Bob. Praise Bob.

475
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,640
It's a prosperity ministry.

476
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,660
Oh, yes.

477
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,400
It's a prosperity ministry.

478
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,760
And it's a slack ministry.

479
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,280
Friends, you'll learn how to slack off like a real slack-off artist.

480
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,900
No weepers here.

481
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,680
No peepers.

482
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,240
No silent green.

483
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,960
No eyeballs.

484
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,840
No nothing.

485
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,980
No human beings at Brushwood Ex Day.

486
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,480
And you can't get in unless you're a subgenius minister.

487
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,760
And you can't be a subgenius minister unless you've got the blood of the Yeti coursing through your veins.

488
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,640
Ah, yes.

489
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,280
You're going to have to have a little card maybe, huh?

490
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,380
You're going to have to have maybe a little ID card that shows you.

491
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:41,620
Oh, yes.

492
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,680
You've got the right feet and the right structure and the front of the brain with a

493
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,140
heart skull.

494
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,220
Well, I've got that card in my pocket.

495
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,820
I've got mine in my pocket.

496
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,800
I ain't going to be caught on that.

497
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,020
You know how it's going to be there, friends?

498
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,740
Joe's got a picture on it.

499
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,240
Beautiful picture.

500
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,900
Princess, we are those going to be there.

501
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,560
And one of these days, her flock, you know, she's the queen of all the UFOs.

502
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,240
And one of these days, them UFOs are going to be coming.

503
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,200
They're going to be coming, friends.

504
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,440
They're going to lift us up in glory because we've got subgenius ministers' card in our

505
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:08,780
pocket.

506
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,420
And the rest, they're going to burn.

507
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,260
Cruel.

508
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:11,360
Cruel.

509
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:11,360


510
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:11,360


511
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:11,360


512
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:11,360


513
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:11,360


514
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,480
Torturously.

515
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,140
Because Bob is not a forgiving God.

516
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,680
He's neither a wrathful God.

517
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:18,940
He's a forgetful God.

518
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:18,940


519
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,100
He's a forgetful God.

520
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,120
He's not going to pay any attention to what we're doing.

521
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,420
We're probably going to be getting back once we've got those escape vessels at our command

522
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:33,600
armed with weapons beyond the – well, within the imagination of every subgenius but beyond

523
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,380
that of the pink boy, the norm worm down below, who will be facing those weapons for

524
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,160
the first time.

525
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,080
Those highest – those bullies in school.

526
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,580
that tormented you.

527
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,840
This is your chance for revenge.

528
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,720
And if you prefer,

529
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,480
you can reconstruct these bullies in your mind

530
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,780
and have them torture you all over again.

531
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,220
That's right.

532
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,600
You can do everything you ever dreamed of all at once.

533
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,880
It's like the perfect drug,

534
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,160
and yet it's without drugs.

535
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,360
It's Bob.

536
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,100
It's Bob.

537
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,800
That's all it is.

538
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,460
It's just the love of Bob

539
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,200
entering your heart and your mind.

540
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,840
The main thing is Bob creeps into your head.

541
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,780
That face.

542
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,620
You know what I mean?

543
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:09,960
You know what I mean?

544
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's a face, man.

545
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,800
He's a big, big man, Bob is.

546
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,520
That's why his face has been copied

547
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,400
and put up everywhere.

548
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,040
He's that smoking guy with the pipe.

549
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:18,960
That's Bob.

550
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,320
That's the Bob we're talking about.

551
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,460
I got so sick while I was driving,

552
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,180
I almost got pulled off.

553
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,100
If you see some pipe-less Bob,

554
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,440
that's just an A-Bob.

555
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,220
That's a bad sign.

556
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,100
That's an A-Bob.

557
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,460
He's not of the true Bob's full nature

558
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,620
unless he's got that pipe.

559
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,020
And not every A-hole with a pipe

560
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,320
is J.R. Bob Dobbs, my friend.

561
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:37,920
Yes.

562
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,980
But what's that?

563
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,260
There are false prophets everywhere.

564
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:40,980
False prophets.

565
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,240
Horrible.

566
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,320
There are false missions.

567
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,180
There are sins.

568
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,840
Becut them.

569
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,420
There are dangerous situations.

570
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,160
Spiritual situations.

571
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,160
That is deep.

572
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,440
Oh, yeah.

573
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,620
This is good false prophet music.

574
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,340
In the meantime, let's dance.

575
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,840
But of course, let's dance.

576
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,320
Oh, yes.

577
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,160
The bombs are exploding out the window.

578
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,780
I can't.

579
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,360
I can hardly.

580
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,340
I can see the flash.

581
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,340
I can't hear the damn thing but the band.

582
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,800
Every other soldier has a pipe.

583
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,620
Yes, look at those handsome young lads

584
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,200
off to die for what?

585
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:15,740
For slack?

586
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,500
Oh, speaking of dying for war and stuff,

587
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,420
I think it's probably time for PR news and...

588
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,240
And, uh...

589
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,880
Cha-cha-cha.

590
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,460
Cha-cha-cha.

591
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,360
From PR news in Washington,

592
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,120
I'm an arrogance of power.

593
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,080
Consumer prices rose by a half percentage point in April,

594
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,920
but the gain was largely caused by the traffic congestion.

595
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,160
Here's bad.

596
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,860
In stocks today,

597
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,720
1, 2, 1, 3, 10, 4, 6, 4, 6, 30.

598
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,880
The city of Los Angeles faces significant problems,

599
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,140
including gang violence and the nation's worst PR news.

600
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,400
Satan in the White House.

601
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,300
We'll be watching.

602
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,040
Satan in the White House.

603
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,960
We'll be watching.

604
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,940
People are dying all over the world,

605
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,860
some by their own hands, some by accident.

606
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,300
Soon a lot more people will die of starvation.

607
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,560
Oh!

608
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,000
And there's nothing we can do about it, nothing at all.

609
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,840
Do you understand?

610
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,060
Satan in the White House.

611
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,020
We'll be watching.

612
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,700
Satan in the White House.

613
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,640
We'll be watching.

614
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,640
People are dying all over the world.

615
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:08,700
We'll be watching.

616
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,560
People are dying all over the world, some by their own hands, some by accident.

617
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,020
Soon a lot more people will die of starvation.

618
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,160
Oh!

619
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,700
And there's nothing we can do about it, nothing at all.

620
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,560
Do you understand?

621
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:21,600
It's part of a major realignment by the Pentagon and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.

622
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
Another zombie flick.

623
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,900
It's a different kind of church and state.

624
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,640
More violence.

625
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,500
Well, when I first heard this news, I am very surprised.

626
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,320
With 181 people bored.

627
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,500
Can fortune cookies produce a real fortune?

628
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,000
What happened to keeping church and state separate?

629
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,860
The 1999 massacre at Columbine High School.

630
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,760
Government troops putting down an uprising there fired into a crowd that included

631
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,440
Cat Stevens.

632
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,660
Night of the Living Dead.

633
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,560
Land of the Dead.

634
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,480
Where the truth lies.

635
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,820
Jane Milhans has.

636
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,640
The lifestyle based on pretending that you're someone else.

637
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,540
Across the country.

638
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,400
It was offensive.

639
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,740
We believe that the Secretary has made a grave, a colossal grave.

640
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,300
Just, I was in shock.

641
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,800
375 million dollar hole.

642
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,580
Bigotry.

643
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:06,840
Profane.

644
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:07,840
Patriot.

645
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,060
Secret.

646
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:08,880
Evil.

647
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,800
Done deal.

648
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,260
Torching police cars.

649
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,940
Sexually explicit.

650
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,180
Irrational.

651
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,220
Slipped through the crack.

652
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,220
Condemn a culture.

653
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,220
Bite, bite, bite, bite.

654
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,000
Let it slip.

655
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,160
Bang, bang, bang, banger.

656
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,800
Unthinkable.

657
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,120
How corrosive that can be.

658
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,660
U.S. intelligence.

659
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,240
Angrily denounced authorities.

660
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,460
U.S. intelligence.

661
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,860
Lends fact and fiction.

662
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,140
Gus Van Sant's last days.

663
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,640
It appears there's a discrepancy.

664
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,600
ICMS.

665
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:51,060
And this war in LA is a beloved lives.

666
00:26:51,880 --> 00:27:01,060
Want your friends?

667
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,060


668
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,060


669
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,620
―

670
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:01,620


671
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,860
Die for oil, sucker

672
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,160
Sucker

673
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,800
Sucker

674
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,620
You too can get your face shot off

675
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:16,380
So arms race tycoons won't have to get a real job

676
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,480
The cold war's over, it was all a mirage

677
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,280
We could use that money, we got problems to solve

678
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,380
But we're not allowed a chance at the peace dividend

679
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:29,880
Cause our psycho president's got his head in the sand

680
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,060
What kind of a Bush League double cross is this?

681
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,100
Cheap oil? The price has already gone up

682
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,380
This still could wind up making Hiroshima look like a picnic

683
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,400
And keep in mind, Bush is a born-again Christian

684
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,980
Does he believe in Armageddon and the last generation?

685
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,180
Die for oil, sucker

686
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,860
Sucker

687
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,100
Sucker

688
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,100


689
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:03,760
Sucker

690
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,260
Sucker

691
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,740
Sucker

692
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,280
Sucker

693
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,600
Secretary of State Jennifer Wilbanks shot and wounded President Bush

694
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,660
He was elated

695
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,660
Bush threatens everyone

696
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,360
If there's any uncertainty in any form, police changed the story

697
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,280
Also, China, Korea fled due to nerves

698
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,880
Criminals convicted of the most heinous crimes

699
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,680
Spent days searching for food or water

700
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,080
It is turned up across the country

701
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,800
Backed up

702
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,520
He's good, he's alive, he's real, he answers

703
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,300
Jogging three days down a road.

704
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,060
Uh, baby, baby, baby, baby, back, back, back, back.

705
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,600
Praise the baby.

706
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,140
Leverage.

707
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:35,760
Leverage.

708
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,320
Leverage.

709
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:36,840
Leverage.

710
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,260
Leverage.

711
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:43,380
Each day I get up to take a breath, brush cobwebs from my spirit.

712
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:49,840
I try to recall fractured dreams that drift away somehow.

713
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:57,180
Seems half the time I yearn for death, the other half I fear.

714
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,540
I can't make up my mind.

715
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,000
Seems I've got to spell live for now.

716
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,540
Time is running out for the planet Earth.

717
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,740
Music.

718
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,000


719
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,660
Everything around me became suddenly.

720
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,080
unreal as if in a dream

721
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,840
do you

722
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,920
do you

723
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,940
do you

724
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,720
do you

725
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,000
do you

726
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,560
do you

727
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,160
do you

728
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,200
do you

729
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,200


730
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,200


731
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,260
do you

732
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,720
do you

733
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,720
do you

734
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,480
do you

735
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,840
do you

736
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,000
do you

737
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,040
do you

738
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,080
do you

739
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,120
do you

740
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,160
do you

741
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,320
off I like, I'm not going in there.

742
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,320
Private Mandamus,

743
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,260
we've been wanting to speak to you now

744
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,300
because of your

745
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,700
record. It's a very

746
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,780
important

747
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,740
misread piece of

748
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,060
disinformation. Private

749
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,840
Mandamus, it seems you've been

750
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,220
working for the Skel Patrol

751
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,140
for the last three months and haven't

752
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,660
found one bloody drunk.

753
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,960
You've just been writing these papers

754
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,080
and handing them out.

755
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,880
But we can't allow

756
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,860
this. We can

757
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,520
however prohibit it, you see.

758
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:32,840
How do we work?

759
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,480
Get your hands out of there.

760
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,920
I was breathing

761
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,080
so softly. I could

762
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,700
hardly rest my own temperature.

763
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,020
I was convinced something

764
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,880
had gone very, very wrong

765
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,880
with my central nervous system.

766
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,000
For instance, this

767
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,280
pineal gland here.

768
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,980
All I have to do is push the right

769
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,000
buttons. And you see, I can

770
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,040
expand. I can become bigger

771
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,820
or smaller. Of course, it's not

772
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,920
like before. I still

773
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,880
have limitations. The

774
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,540
Big Bang is over, so to speak.

775
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,780
But I'll be back again someday.

776
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,980
You know, they said God's, the mind

777
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,020
of God was damaged in

778
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,880
the Big Bang. And that's what

779
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,260
the new age is all about, man.

780
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,100
God's got brain damage. That means

781
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,920
you're God. You can do your

782
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,760
own thing. It's the age

783
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,640
of Aquarius, man.

784
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,640
You're screwed up, but you're God, man.

785
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,860
It's so cool. You can be

786
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,700
like an angst character, like

787
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,500
Promethean James Dean of the

788
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,660
old era type. It's like there's no

789
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,860
good or no evil. There's just

790
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,660
you, man. And it's like

791
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,880
you just do your own

792
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,220
thing.

793
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,980
It's the new age.

794
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,880
What you feel, that's what's real, man.

795
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,220
The Tao balances

796
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,720
angst and joy, man.

797
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,880
Well, it's not real joy.

798
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,100
It's closer to slack, actually.

799
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,760
It's kind of a

800
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,860
form of loose joy, which hardly

801
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,420
ever assembles.

802
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,020
Well, let's say it's hard to achieve.

803
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,780
Hey, man.

804
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,680
Guzzle.

805
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:05,900
Guzzle.

806
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,380
Do something about him.

807
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,820
Friend, I can tell by the fact that you

808
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,000
tuned in. There are some things I don't

809
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,760
need to tell you.

810
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,940
I'm not even going to bother.

811
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,240
What is wrong with that guy?

812
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,900
He's okay, man. He's been

813
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,200
hanging around with private mandamacy.

814
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,680
He's been telling all that

815
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,540
easy stuff, you know?

816
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,500
He's going to be all right.

817
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,700
Look, look. See, his flesh tone is

818
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,060
well, it's not really a flesh tone. It's more of like a

819
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,960
he looks like the bark of a tree

820
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,780
or maybe, hey, it's an onion skin.

821
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,380
Yeah, man. He's a vegetable.

822
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,360
The onion skin.

823
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,100
He's the metaphor man.

824
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,400
Like the conspiracy itself.

825
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,780
You peel away the onion skin,

826
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,700
yet there's another skin underneath.

827
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,880
And you peel away that skin, and there's

828
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,660
another skin. It's skin upon skin.

829
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,640
That doesn't work when they start peeling.

830
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,860
You peel off a lonesome cowboy Dave here now,

831
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,860
does it? You peel off one layer of skin

832
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,680
and he starts screaming. That's because

833
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,600
there's only one layer to a subgenius.

834
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,840
There's no metaphors here, man. It ain't like nothing

835
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,740
but what it is.

836
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,940
It's because we're the pure, the honest

837
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,400
primates.

838
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,740
The mandrills

839
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,220
of the world, don't you see?

840
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,840
Our purple behinds glow with

841
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,460
pride and slackdomness

842
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,480
because we've got Bob in them.

843
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,660
There's also the toxic material.

844
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,460
We can also look at that aspect of it, too, but sure,

845
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,400
sure, yeah, we're glowing. You need to get

846
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,360
a glow on every day before you ride the bus.

847
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,580
Some of us don't actually ride it.

848
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,320
We just kind of take it around

849
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,500
with us. Friends, you're either on the bus

850
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,400
or you're off the bus. You're either

851
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,480
on the saucers or you're off

852
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,220
of those saucers, my friend.

853
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,360
Reverend Ken Kesey,

854
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,360
the great subgenius, a dues-paying

855
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,660
subgenius minister, by the way,

856
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,360
said that. I remember when Neal Cassidy

857
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,200
was achieving his

858
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,640
penultimate years,

859
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,380
and I talked like this,

860
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,600
Colorado, he still had a nasal

861
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,480
twang that

862
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,520
deviated septum, perhaps, but we're

863
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,000
all deviated, you know.

864
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,180
This is where I should cut to

865
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,640
a bunch of Neal Cassidy.

866
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,460
But you're going to have to lead some meager,

867
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,680
eccentric, sincere, maniacal

868
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,680
like Alexander.

869
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,900
I'm going to make you discover that's pretty fair.

870
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,880
Spencer, that's pretty fair for

871
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,460
Tom Edison. Well, here we want someone

872
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,520
who's like Tony Perkins.

873
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,580
That's it. Somebody who is

874
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,240
who could be

875
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,200
either way, but in this case, it's a

876
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,180
definite neurotic thing already.

877
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,040
I mean, like, he's obsessed

878
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,520
with racing, as say, Tony Perkins

879
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,700
as a sick cat,

880
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,100
not being approved of at all,

881
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,160
as the son, you see, would be. So he'd have

882
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,180
a mania for auto racing, even

883
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,060
though, like say, Tony Perkins wouldn't be good

884
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,640
for football or wrestling or anything.

885
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,160
Why, this fellow can't race

886
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,180
with a dam. He's the poorest of the

887
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,060
bunch. Yet it runs in the family. It's in his

888
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,780
blood, you understand. Here we got this

889
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,060
rural French garage-owning

890
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:55,400
family.

891
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,360
The uncle, brother, couple of the brothers,

892
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,660
father himself, race.

893
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,460
Neil Cassidy, Neil Cassidy,

894
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,440
Neil Cassidy, Neil Cassidy,

895
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,560
but I bet I could...

896
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,120
Singing lonesome songs to the moon,

897
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,700
arguing with himself...

898
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,840
You know you can't force Cassidy, okay?

899
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,900
Kids, we're talking about ancient, dead

900
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,400
subgeniuses of the past, and that's what you'll

901
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,380
be if you don't make sure that we have your

902
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,080
correct address on our

903
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,380
mailing list. And this is

904
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,280
how we salute them. For instance,

905
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,360
we light two flowers for

906
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,280
Jack Kerouac. For Neil

907
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,400
Cassidy, we blow up five flowers.

908
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,380
And for the others, we

909
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,640
take the tiny little regimental

910
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,200
everyday conspiracy bus

911
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,260
and blow the hemp into bluey.

912
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,380
But for Bill Hicks, we eat a whole

913
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,320
can of black beans and lay around

914
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,580
pyroflatulation all night long.

915
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,320
There's no need for it.

916
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,040
It's an experience.

917
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,400
It's hardly an experience.

918
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,540
It isn't a hallucination, my friend.

919
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,340
It isn't pollution.

920
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,400
It isn't? Uh-oh.

921
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,020
It isn't your eyes that are seeing the wrong things.

922
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,900
It's your face

923
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,340
that's in the wrong place.

924
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,000
You have visited yourself

925
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,380
upon an ugly, angry

926
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,400
world. A world

927
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,420
of misconception and deceit.

928
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,520
Here, sit down

929
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,980
on the toilet of love.

930
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,220
Place your fanny,

931
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,360
your booty firmly

932
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,720
on the place where...

933
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,280
Why can't I just...

934
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,380
Forget about it. It's because we're not in the

935
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,820
world of love, man. We're in the world

936
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,040
of the hate.

937
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:33,980
Hate.

938
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,780
The hate.

939
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,940
The hate.

940
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:37,360
The hate.

941
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,280
The system changes.

942
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,940
Every system is an integral

943
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,500
window for the...

944
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,600
It's a bad idea, man.

945
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,160
I mean, like, if I had my chance,

946
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,460
or my choice, or my...

947
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,960
to have my own church, or some...

948
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,700
You know, to make

949
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,080
a spiritual movement, you know,

950
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,840
and reap souls,

951
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,580
and rape sloughs,

952
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,800
and, you know, gather unto myself

953
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,680
the many from amongst the fumes,

954
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,980
and so forth, you know, like, if I could do that,

955
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,580
you know, like, why would I become a,

956
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,180
you know, a slack genius,

957
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,960
or any of those others? Because, like, think of...

958
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,780
I mean, most of these people are, like,

959
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,100
not... They're like monopens.

960
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,280
Oh, yeah, I can do that. I can do that.

961
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,500
What, you know, like, all deformed

962
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,920
and everything, you know, some of the, like,

963
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,720
the big macrocephalic dudes, man.

964
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,960
The guys with the big, high foreheads,

965
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,540
you know, the brain thing, they've got the, you know,

966
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,580
like, the hardening of the skull and stuff.

967
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,000
These are, like, the leaders of this church, you know.

968
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,780
The overman.

969
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,920
Well, and some are the underman.

970
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,180
Actually, oh, here, here, speaking of which,

971
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,280
I'll have you know,

972
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,520
some of us are just regular, ordinary people.

973
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,160
Space was named the B.M.T.

974
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,640
Yes, I, Dr. Howell,

975
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,200
am the mighty,

976
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,820
most of the submen, the undermen,

977
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,300
the greatest in the lowerarchy.

978
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,660
Of course, we're inferior to normal people,

979
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,960
we undermen, but nonetheless,

980
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,040
of this enormous army of gimps and wimps,

981
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,760
I, Dr. Howell, approach common humanity the most.

982
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,680
It's enormous.

983
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,500
Though subhuman and a subgenius,

984
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,580
I am almost a human.

985
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,480
At least we undermen understand what we undertake.

986
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,660
What we take down under the surface

987
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,800
of what we understand, down, pulled down

988
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,500
with the undertow into the underpinnings

989
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,640
of the unconscious mind.

990
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,220
In this sub-stratum, we, the undermen,

991
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,280
root and furrow our...

992
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,460
burrows tunneling past roots

993
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,800
in the warm earth smell of a bean burrow.

994
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,880
And so, muchachos,

995
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,600
no matter how macho you are,

996
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,380
you're still just a little chaco in the gazpacho.

997
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,560
Let me out of here, I'm boiling!

998
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:37,980
Play the game, Mark.

999
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,400
You play the game, I'm getting out of here.

1000
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,540
Keep that Swedish Godzilla away from me.

1001
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,080
Yeah, keep that Swedish Godzilla,

1002
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,740
that sweet Godzilla away from me.

1003
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,540
No, I can't.

1004
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,140
Johan?

1005
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
Here is your photon of all the...

1006
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,980
Godzilla?

1007
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,900
Yeah, I've been Godzilla.

1008
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,500
I'm in good connection with Connecticut.

1009
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,320
I am Godzilla.

1010
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:58,440
Godzilla, what I learned in the country little town.

1011
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:01,260
Stockholm's not big enough for me.

1012
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,260
I have to take a ride by the Japanese sea

1013
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,420
and smash Tokyo down.

1014
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,120
That was fun.

1015
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,040
Ha-hoo!

1016
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,040
The Swedish Godzilla song by Lenten Cowboy Dave.

1017
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,900
Swedish Godzilla.

1018
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,120
No, the geography Godzilla song.

1019
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,360
It's the Swedish Godzilla.

1020
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,100
What's the Godzilla song now?

1021
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,020
It's the...

1022
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,000
Geography Godzilla song, apparently.

1023
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,540
These are all the places that Godzilla will be destroying

1024
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,740
during the coming time,

1025
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,040
followed shortly by the U.S. Army behind him.

1026
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,060
It's sort of a mop-up in the...

1027
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,220
Stockholm, Tokyo, Osaka, Beijing,

1028
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,520
Seoul, Haifu, Barzu.

1029
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,080
And here they come.

1030
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,020
Connie's got connections in Connecticut.

1031
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,880
Yes, she really has connections in Connecticut.

1032
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,980
There goes Danbury.

1033
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,900
She was born out in Wyoming as a girl.

1034
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,640
She started roaming...

1035
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,140
Oh, there goes Vest.

1036
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,800
...in Connecticut.

1037
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,540
Pfft.

1038
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,900
One day she took a trip way down to Florida.

1039
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,900
Oh, they're moving on to New York State.

1040
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,000
And she called the real station down in Florida.

1041
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:00,600
Pfft.

1042
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,800
There goes Albany.

1043
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,780
She became a baby cutie and was such a little cutie

1044
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,060
and she soon had all the flowers there adoring her.

1045
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,260
Then Connie secured the leading role

1046
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,760
in a wonderful Broadway attraction.

1047
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,600
But she wouldn't stay on a great white way.

1048
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,680
The pace of the action...

1049
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,620
You know, I sometimes think

1050
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,780
what a great and wonderful thing it would be

1051
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,180
if our Lord Jesus

1052
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,760
would dress up in one of those Godzilla suits

1053
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,680
around Christmas time

1054
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,660
and come visit your neighborhood

1055
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,760
and perhaps my neighborhood.

1056
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,080
Just hang around.

1057
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,860
Maybe sing a song with a band.

1058
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,740
Or wear one of those funny 1938 haircuts.

1059
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,880
I think I'd love that more than anything

1060
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,960
except life itself.

1061
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,220
Except for this is a freaking life.

1062
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,160
Hell no.

1063
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,580
This is not life.

1064
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,900
This is a pee hole we've crawled into

1065
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,080
and can't get out of.

1066
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,000
I don't care.

1067
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,580
As long as I can see Jesus dressed like Godzilla.

1068
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,580
Oh, some funny Sunday.

1069
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,600
I don't know.

1070
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,280
Behind the pews or making the pew.

1071
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,680
Ha, ha, ha.

1072
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,600
And that's why people join

1073
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,000
the Church of the Subgenius, friends,

1074
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,800
because we have holidays like X-Day

1075
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,420
where you can find Jesus

1076
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,820
dressed up like a Godzilla.

1077
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,060
Yes, it's true.

1078
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,440
Actually, they will have an ugly parade this year

1079
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,060
at, uh...

1080
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,080
And who knows how Jesus will dress

1081
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,240
this particular time.

1082
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,040
He could be wearing anything

1083
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,420
or maybe nothing at all.

1084
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,860
I mean, you know how Jesus is.

1085
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,720
If only his mom would dress that way.

1086
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,080
Yeah, yeah.

1087
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,020
I'm supposed to be happy.

1088
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:20,880
She's a mammy.

1089
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,540
I'm the pappy.

1090
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,420
Now Connecticut's my old hometown.

1091
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:24,380
Yeah.

1092
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,980
Oh, Connie.

1093
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:27,960
Connie.

1094
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,020
I know you're interested in these squids.

1095
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,500
These prairie squids.

1096
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,640
But as you can see,

1097
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,980
we only have four of them left.

1098
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,560
And you have asked clearly here in your invoice

1099
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,380
you said you would send me six.

1100
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,420
And this is a past-future kind of thing.

1101
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,000
So, you know, if you don't really...

1102
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:51,460
You...

1103
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,680
Hey, I just realized

1104
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,580
there's some credits.

1105
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,980
that need to be given here

1106
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,480
that we just completely blew off.

1107
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,600
The PR news, of course,

1108
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,240
is from Mr. Fernand and Andy Leher.

1109
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,600
Leher.

1110
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,760
Oh, the lady.

1111
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:05,840
Leher.

1112
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,680
And, uh...

1113
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,420
And Reverend Norrell Preff

1114
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,600
of HeavyConfetti.com

1115
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,420
did a bunch of that

1116
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,480
Satan in the White House

1117
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,000
and conflicting news reports

1118
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,760
and various mixes and chop-ups.

1119
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,380
The ordinary...

1120
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,620
And we heard Dr. Howell,

1121
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,880
claiming to be an...

1122
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,640
uh...

1123
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:26,680
uh...

1124
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,760
underman.

1125
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,840
And, uh...

1126
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,120
this is, uh...

1127
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:31,680
uh...

1128
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,900
Uncle Onan Canabite.

1129
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,740
Unclean One Canabite

1130
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:36,360
in the background.

1131
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,820
With the, uh...

1132
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,440
Onane ain't ain't song.

1133
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,340
He owes no mane.

1134
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,420
Listen to that.

1135
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,120
Onane.

1136
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,020
O-O-Onane.

1137
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,580
And friends,

1138
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,260
Phineas Narco

1139
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,700
of NationalCynical.com

1140
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,200
did a whole bunch of the, uh,

1141
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,000
mix-ups there.

1142
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:58,660
There was a...

1143
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:00,140
the For What It's Worth.

1144
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:01,980
Um...

1145
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,200
Uh...

1146
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,720
There's something going on

1147
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,760
and there's something happening here

1148
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,660
at business there.

1149
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,820
Dr. Phineas Narco.

1150
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,500
So you see,

1151
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,180
somewhere out there in the world,

1152
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,560
there are some geniuses

1153
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,140
who care!

1154
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,700
Although they don't actually do anything.

1155
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,620
They really care!

1156
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,080
May I just say right now

1157
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,820
for this August, buddy?

1158
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:24,600
Hey!

1159
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,680
That I'm wearing a pink ladies' merkin

1160
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,540
underneath these silky panties.

1161
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:31,320
Ah.

1162
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,160
I'm a pubic merkin

1163
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,080
because for the love of Bob...

1164
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:38,620
Whatever.

1165
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,980
For want of something else to call him.

1166
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:41,960
Uh, Bert.

1167
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,960
I prefer to call him less

1168
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,640
than I have in the past.

1169
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,540
That's for sure.

1170
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,660
I'm listening to this blip on.

1171
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,040
May I say right now

1172
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,180
that, uh,

1173
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,300
that I'm having a dysfunction

1174
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,880
in my colon area.

1175
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,540
That, uh, perhaps, uh...

1176
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,440
Too much information.

1177
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,860
My entire intestine may leap out

1178
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,060
like one of those alien things

1179
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:04,920
or whatever it was.

1180
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:06,420
Thanks.

1181
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,900
I'll begin an argument

1182
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,320
with someone like that.

1183
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,080
Too much information.

1184
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,080
But I just say a bunch of

1185
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,980
unentertaining, boring crap

1186
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,720
that's going to irritate you.

1187
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:19,960
Would you like a Kleenex?

1188
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:20,620
Bob?

1189
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,660
That grinning man with the pipe.

1190
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,980
The halo fellow

1191
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,080
that the best players

1192
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,500
claim does not even exist.

1193
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,860
People who deny the reality of Bob,

1194
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,220
who is lower than that?

1195
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,000
It's just like those wretches

1196
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,500
who have claimed that Tarzan,

1197
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,600
Sherlock Holmes, and Robin Hood

1198
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,660
are fictitious characters.

1199
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,280
For surely our Bob is in their company.

1200
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,520
A heroic, happy madman

1201
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,680
who won't quit fighting

1202
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,180
until all humanity

1203
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,600
achieves select,

1204
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,060
or at least that portion of humanity

1205
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,120
which is tired unto Bob.

1206
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,160
That, I chance, is all.

1207
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,600
I was so glad when that pleasure saucer landed,

1208
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,460
but the pilot was drunk or something,

1209
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,940
and I made out pretty good

1210
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,500
balancing on one knee and all,

1211
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,400
but it was kind of awkward to hump

1212
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,320
while I had to play the cut off my foot

1213
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,620
with a pleasure saucer blues,

1214
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,500
but it was real nice of Bob

1215
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,720
to grow me a new foot,

1216
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,200
but it's a dinosaur thing

1217
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,160
and has claws,

1218
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,840
so now I can't wear a shoe on that foot

1219
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,480
and people sure stare a lot

1220
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,780
and I tend to walk in circles like this.

1221
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,140
Ka-dunk, ka-dunk, ka-dunk.

1222
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,900
Crazy damn old Bob,

1223
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,880
I sure love him,

1224
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,080
but well, he's nuts.

1225
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,680
Uh, help-o-putey, dear friends.

1226
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,200
Uh, huh.

1227
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,180
And this is Atomic Jefferson.

1228
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,600
Dead possum in the road

1229
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,760
Shaggy hair

1230
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:51,760


1231
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,120
Shaggy hair

1232
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:53,140
Shaggy hair

1233
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,140


1234
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,140


1235
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,140


1236
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,140


1237
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,140


1238
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,940
Shaggy hair

1239
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,020
Shaggy hair

1240
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,580
Shaggy hair

1241
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,600
Your jaw is slack

1242
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,960
Your eyes are shut

1243
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,100
I believe

1244
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:09,600
Your heart has failed

1245
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,680
Dead possum in the road

1246
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,020
Dead possum in the road

1247
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,120
They play dead possum in the road

1248
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:23,120


1249
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,180
Sometimes

1250
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:33,000
Don't you try to pick him up

1251
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,880
He may bite

1252
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:48,200
You know, when I was just a boy

1253
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,140
My daddy was on his way home from work one evening

1254
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,900
And he saw a dead possum in the road

1255
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,880
He stopped to get a closer look

1256
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,480
And he saw that it was a mama possum

1257
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,100
She had some babies in her pouch

1258
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:12,040
And a couple of them was still alive

1259
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,980
So he brought them home

1260
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,960
To my brother and me

1261
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:26,180
And we give them some water

1262
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,420
And some bread to eat

1263
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,220
When they was big enough to go

1264
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,420
We set them free

1265
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,420
Cause you know

1266
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:44,440
The wild's the only place a creature like the possum ought to be

1267
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,280
I'll break them off something raw

1268
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:25,120
Dead possum in the road

1269
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:34,000
My heart goes out to you

1270
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,640
So whatever you may do

1271
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,640
Wherever you may go

1272
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,180
Stare closely at me

1273
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,180
We're on the road

1274
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,860
We're on the road

1275
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,440
Amazing!

1276
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,580
Atomic Jefferson, dear friends.

1277
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:11,020
You know, these guys sound like an early Leonard Skinner or something.

1278
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,400
They're from Birmingham, Alabama.

1279
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,200
They've got that southern sound.

1280
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,700
They smell like rich and gravy, you know?

1281
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,880
They're for real.

1282
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,700
Like God's people.

1283
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,060
I doubt if they're for real, Stan.

1284
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,080
No offense, you Yankees.

1285
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,180
Just don't speak God's language.

1286
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,180
We don't have the physical mechanics.

1287
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,800
Nor play God's guitar.

1288
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,820
We don't have the demonic tongue, you southerners do.

1289
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,420
Nor God's harmonica.

1290
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,100
You can't eat God's beans.

1291
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:40,120
But we play Satan's fiddles.

1292
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,040
Like Charlie, which is fat.

1293
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:42,860
Oh, yeah.

1294
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:44,920
You got that satanic fiddle playing down.

1295
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,020
Oh, I got Charlie.

1296
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,180
Don't hang on.

1297
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,200
Okay.

1298
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:49,600
Okay.

1299
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:49,900
Holy.

1300
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:50,460
Holy.

1301
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:50,980
Holy.

1302
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:52,220
Holy.

1303
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:52,700
Holy.

1304
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:52,780
Holy.

1305
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:52,780


1306
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:52,780


1307
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:52,780


1308
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:52,780


1309
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:52,780


1310
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:52,780


1311
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:52,780


1312
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,400
This is a special meeting.

1313
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:59,200
And I'd just like to remind everybody seated here that they're not supposed to be in those

1314
00:51:59,200 --> 00:51:59,680
seats.

1315
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,980
There's something seriously wrong with your pants and your stuffing.

1316
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,100
The places we've had marked are inferior to the original places.

1317
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,860
And they're translated into stellar material.

1318
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:17,280
Some of you will be evaporated, then the rest of you will become like mother's milk.

1319
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,060
I tried.

1320
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:29,560
They'll become like soft, screwy, smelly, like the cream that runs down the side of Bob's pipe.

1321
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:34,180
Like the unconscious underman and the macho muchachos.

1322
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:40,540
Can you feel Bob swelling up in you down there?

1323
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,220
Oh, yeah.

1324
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:45,940
Just a repetitious simian with nothing on your mind except for that blank check.

1325
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,540
Check.

1326
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:47,580
Check.

1327
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,920
Did you say something about blank checks?

1328
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:49,460
Yeah.

1329
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,980
We're looking for blank checks and lads.

1330
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,780
We're looking for blanker checks.

1331
00:52:54,840 --> 00:53:01,220
Who can be filled in by Mr. Fill-in-the-blank-himself, J.R. Bob-the-Dobbs.

1332
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:04,360
I remember Phil Dirt and the Dozers, my favorite band.

1333
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,740
They were a great band.

1334
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,920
But not as great as Phil-in-the-blank.

1335
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,880
Phil was cool.

1336
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,060
And I remember Jethro Tull of Jethro Tull.

1337
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,580
He was a cool fella, too.

1338
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,300
He was in the...

1339
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,140
How did you meet him?

1340
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,460
How'd you come upon him?

1341
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:23,360
He used to be in commercial radio.

1342
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,100
And, of course, that was before the accident.

1343
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,320
It wasn't an accident.

1344
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:30,840
That's another thing.

1345
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,640
It's real.

1346
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:32,840
Bankruptcy.

1347
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,220
It was on purpose, wasn't it?

1348
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,580
Iron lung and the...

1349
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:38,440
Well, in your case, it looks more like a copper mask.

1350
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,360
Yeah, we're dealing with some inferior metals here.

1351
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,580
The iron butt.

1352
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:43,940
Oh, that's...

1353
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:44,740
And the iron suit.

1354
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,340
I am your father.

1355
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:50,280
And the iron fist of...

1356
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,340
What is the iron fist?

1357
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,620
The iron fist of the...

1358
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:55,540
It's like the iron fish.

1359
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,240
Tish.

1360
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:56,940
Yes.

1361
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,440
Revenge of the...

1362
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,020
Shit.

1363
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,800
That is the theme of our show.

1364
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,700
Tish means dish in German, don't it?

1365
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:08,060
How they take something great and turn it into utter crap.

1366
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:08,860
Oh, pish cash.

1367
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:09,840
Like this show.

1368
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,920
Like this whole radio station once we got here.

1369
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,040
Tommy, can you feel me?

1370
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,200
Can you hear me, though?

1371
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,380
Can you feel me?

1372
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:17,380


1373
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,260
Can you see me?

1374
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:18,440
Hello, daughter.

1375
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,020
It's a lot of malarkey.

1376
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,440
Can you see me?

1377
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,860
Tommy, can you feel me?

1378
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:24,880
Can you smell me yet?

1379
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,840
You're rising up.

1380
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,000
I wasted my pants again.

1381
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:29,680
Are you wasted yet?

1382
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,680
Can you feel me, Tommy?

1383
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,160
Can you feel me, Tommy?

1384
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,120
You're just another scale in the road.

1385
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:34,560
I hear you.

1386
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,200
Can you feel the seed rising up?

1387
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,920
Bob's coming, friends.

1388
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:47,320
And you can get more of that man, Bob.

1389
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:51,220
If you just write for free information from the Church of the Subgenius,

1390
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,520
that's right, the information's free.

1391
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:56,100
You know, I love saying this, because nobody just about ever does this,

1392
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:56,880
but you can.

1393
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,100
But you sound so cool when you do it.

1394
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,380
Actually drop you a card to Subgenius Foundation.

1395
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,740
No, not Dallas, Texas no more.

1396
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,040
No, not Austin, Texas.

1397
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:04,320
Nope.

1398
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,420
They don't need slack in Texas anymore.

1399
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,440
No, they're not too good for them.

1400
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,440
DNA level C.

1401
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,320
Here at DNA level C, friends, that's post office box.

1402
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,160
Got that pencil ready?

1403
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,200
Box 18141.

1404
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,660
117 Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1405
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:24,700
44118.

1406
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,680
And that's an odd dress you won't want to miss.

1407
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:32,840
It's an odd dress, all right, that she's wearing down there at subgenius.com.

1408
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,820
But look, once again, the pubic goatee's growing out of the top of her skull.

1409
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,000
Oh, that's mighty, mighty interesting.

1410
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,640
I can't breathe.

1411
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:45,680
I...

1412
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,340
It's okay.

1413
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,360
It's going to be all right.

1414
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,020
I'm telling you.

1415
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,080
I keep trying to tell you.

1416
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,700
It's going to be all right.

1417
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,540
You think it's really going to be all right?

1418
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,540
Yeah, yeah, man.

1419
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,600
Princess, we was always saying that.

1420
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,780
I didn't like Red Mist.

1421
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:58,860
I didn't like Search and Destroy.

1422
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,620
I didn't like any of the other war rides at this freaking carnival, man.

1423
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,000
I know, but I have it on good authority that it's going to be all right, okay?

1424
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:07,900
I don't like authority figures either.

1425
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:11,580
I like figurines, you know, little tiny gnome things you put in the back of your head.

1426
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:11,680
It's okay.

1427
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,260
The disfigurines you have to worry about, dude.

1428
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:13,780
I know.

1429
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,160
Yeah.

1430
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:14,920
Hey, look.

1431
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,060
They're all like us.

1432
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,080
They're all disfigurines.

1433
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:20,780
Some of them have too much rouge on the left side of their head.

1434
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:25,840
With Tuesday's election, Joseph Rat, Joseph Rat, choked the new pope.

1435
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:29,840
Rat, rat, rat, rat, Joseph Rat, Joseph Rat, choking pregnant teens.

1436
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,900
Deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep, deep.

1437
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:37,820
Joseph Rat, Joseph Rat, Joseph Rat, Joseph Rat, choked the new pope.

1438
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:38,840
Choked the new pope.

1439
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,840
Choked the new pope.

1440
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,160
Have you dug his seat?

1441
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,240
Yes, ma'am.

1442
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:44,880
You ready now?

1443
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,520
Or somewhere in outer space?

1444
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,000
Outer space.

1445
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,900
God has prepared a place for those who trust him and obey.

1446
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,900
That's X-Day, friends.

1447
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,280
God's prepared it for you.

1448
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:55,640
We know.

1449
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:56,020
Yes.

1450
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,000
We're not especially prepared things just for you.

1451
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,520
Well, who did he do?

1452
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:02,440
One negative guy.

1453
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,320
I'm going to pound him.

1454
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,020
What a jerk.

1455
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,680
God, I hate these people.

1456
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:06,360
You have no idea.

1457
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,680
It's unbelievable to me.

1458
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,480
The pinks.

1459
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:09,940
The boy.

1460
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,020
Mediocritans.

1461
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:11,620
The humans.

1462
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,320
The normals.

1463
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:17,300
Eli, Eli, Lama, subhas the name.

1464
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:18,200
Shh.

1465
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:19,140
Hi.

1466
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:22,040
Sullen, misguided, drunks and criminals.

1467
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,840
Can't something be done?

1468
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,780
He's given a bath and a pair of clean pajamas.

1469
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:27,680
Squalid homes.

1470
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:28,660
Dirt.

1471
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:29,700
Futures.

1472
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,020
Here in the rear of dead.

1473
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,720
Best psychological test.

1474
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,400
But I don't want to do that.

1475
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,980
Gargoyles coming down.

1476
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,640
As the months pass, Benton sees Johnny frequently.

1477
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:42,760
Sometimes at the community swimming pool.

1478
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,360
It was a never to be forgotten experience for the boy.

1479
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:47,420
This is...

1480
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:47,840
Fun.

1481
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:48,760
Fascinating.

1482
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,440
See, that was dumb, wasn't it?

1483
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,000
It certainly was.

1484
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:57,760
Arrgh.

1485
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,520
Today my mother killed me.

1486
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:01,160
Who are you?

1487
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,980
Who do you think I am?

1488
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,260
I'm asking the questions here.

1489
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:05,780
Who are you?

1490
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,820
I am anger.

1491
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,400
And I am lies.

1492
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,160
Who are you?

1493
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,160
Joseph R. McCarthy.

1494
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:11,280
Face me.

1495
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:12,960
Guilt.

1496
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:13,660
Guilt.

1497
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:14,280
Guilt.

1498
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:15,040
Guilt.

1499
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:15,520
Guilt.

1500
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,060
Guilt.

1501
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:16,240
Guilt.

1502
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:16,660
Guilt.

1503
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:16,820
Guilt.

1504
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:17,560


1505
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:17,560


1506
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:17,560


1507
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:17,560


1508
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:17,560


1509
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:17,560


1510
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:17,560


1511
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:17,560


1512
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:18,920
Guilt.

1513
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,000
Guilt.

1514
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:19,420
Guilt.

1515
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:19,420


1516
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:19,420


1517
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:19,420


1518
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:19,420


1519
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,680
You guys don't play fair, do you?

1520
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,620
Don't have to.

1521
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,240
You don't have to, do you?

1522
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:23,440
Hmm.

1523
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,080
CBS Radio Network.

1524
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,320
I was unfairly...

1525
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:27,440
Guilt.

1526
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:27,940
Guilt.

1527
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:28,060
Guilt.

1528
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,380
And irresponsibly smearing innocent people

1529
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,800
from behind the cloak of congressional immunity.

1530
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:33,160
Guilt.

1531
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:33,700
Guilt.

1532
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:33,940
Guilt.

1533
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:34,820
I gave no evidence.

1534
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,760
A typical McCarthy mixture

1535
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,640
of quarter truth...

1536
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:38,840
Guilt.

1537
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:39,240
Guilt.

1538
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:41,440
Half truths and untruths.

1539
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,320
Almost every one of McCarthy's charges...

1540
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:44,460
Guilt.

1541
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:44,940
Guilt.

1542
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:45,140
Guilt.

1543
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,980
Are a wormed over rehash

1544
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:47,560
of charges...

1545
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:47,560


1546
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:53,860
is made before half-truths and untruths McCarthy is lying the American people

1547
00:58:53,860 --> 00:59:01,640
expect McCarthy is lying well McCarthy was a scandal monger and a hate monger

1548
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:06,180
57 people died as a result of the Dukes and Stooges who have been planning

1549
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:11,060
disaster for America maybe they just never grew up boys will be boys it's
