1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,760
What the hell do you think you're doing?

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,960
Superior mutants.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:08,740
Repent.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,820
Quit your job.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,640
The world ends tomorrow.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,300
And you may die.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,540
Well, no, probably not, but whatever you do, just keep listening.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,820
The Church of the Subgenius could save your sanity with...

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,120
Are we controlled by secret forces?

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,300
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

11
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,800
Do people think you're strange?

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,700
Do you?

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,340
Then you may be on the right track.

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,560
Are alien space monsters bringing a startling new world?

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,580
Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet.

16
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,300
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,100
This is it.

18
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,640
The only faith that promises action, thrills, success in sex and business.

19
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,740
Get all your slack and more.

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,800
The Subgenius.

21
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,460
The Subgenius.

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:17,400
At last, I have control of your radio tubes.

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,980
And I do, too.

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,020
Good.

25
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,440
This is Ren Huak.

26
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,400
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Ren and Stimpy Show.

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,860
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:27,860
Keep listening.

29
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,720
Keep listening, you idiots.

30
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,980
Else I shall deal you.

32
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,260
Well, well, well, well, well.

33
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:35,900
You're dead.

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,240
You're so dead.

35
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:37,780
We're back.

36
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,080
The sounds have resumed in my head.

37
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,680
And in your head as well.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,380
Yes.

39
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,100
It's so beautiful.

40
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,680
Burgeoning clouds over the distant horizon.

41
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,120
So deep and echoey.

42
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,300
The sounds recur.

43
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,840
The brain grows in its blast-out fluid.

44
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,760
The plasma glowing.

45
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,200
So beautiful and pink.

46
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,060
It's lovely to see you burn again.

47
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:07,900
Hi.

48
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:08,560
Oh.

49
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,380
Nothing is forever cerebral.

50
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,240
Hydrofluids.

51
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,340
CHF.

52
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,480
Let us drift our minds.

53
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:17,680
Ooh, scary.

54
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,140
To blanker hands.

55
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:20,780
Nothing.

56
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,180
Ooh.

57
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,180
As the puffing slowly drift towards the individual parts of your mind.

58
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,620
How many individual parts are there?

59
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,520
It's the pipeline, can't you see?

60
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,940
It's the pipeline.

61
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,700
Nothing.

62
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,900
It's bringing the nutrients deep inside to where we can work with them.

63
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,060
It's the nexus of all creation.

64
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,780
It's the basis of our economic and commercial life.

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,900
It gives us bread and cheese.

66
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,600
It gives us an egg in it.

67
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,000
It gives us the crabs.

68
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,000
It gives us everything.

69
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,380
Everything?

70
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,080
Almost everything.

71
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,320
It gives us the church of the sub-knuckle sandwich.

72
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,280
It gives us vague ideas of liberation and freedom which we cannot understand or explain

73
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,740
to others.

74
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,960
Let me I live in this lonely room.

75
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,820
To cry.

76
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,820
And to warn the others.

77
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,080
Yes.

78
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,480
Yes.

79
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,660
We must warn them.

80
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,300
Yes.

81
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:19,740
Yes.

82
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,340
We must.

83
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:20,640
Yes.

84
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,620
Because the time grows nigh.

85
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,040
Nigh.

86
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,860
The time grows nigh.

87
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,500
Nigh.

88
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:25,760
Nigh.

89
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:25,980
Nigh.

90
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:25,980


91
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:25,980


92
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:25,980


93
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:25,980


94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,160
It's night time for the good life and Henry's wooden eye.

95
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,640
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

96
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,600
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

97
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,540
The revolution begins immediately.

98
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:45,660


99
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Yeah.

100
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,480
Yeah.

101
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,820
Yeah.

102
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Yeah.

103
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:51,820
Yeah.

104
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:52,880


105
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,020
Yeah.

106
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,640
Yeah.

107
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,160
Yeah.

108
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,440
Yeah.

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,400
Yeah.

110
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,020
Yeah.

111
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,520
Yeah.

112
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,120
Yeah.

113
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:12,660
Ohhhhhhh!

114
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,480
Nice beaver.

115
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,820
I'm sorry, I'm caught in traffic.

116
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,080
It may be a while before anybody can get into the station.

117
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,420
Don't you have an emergency DJ?

118
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,620
Somebody with a deep voice hidden in a kitchen.

119
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:24,620


120
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:24,620


121
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:24,620


122
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:24,620


123
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:24,620


124
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:24,620


125
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:24,620


126
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:31,340
drawer? Just follow the formats. You've only got a few more hours. I have all the characteristics

127
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:38,860
of a human being. Flesh, blood, skin, hair. But not a single clear identifiable emotion

128
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,580
except for greed and disgust. Something horrible is happening inside of me and I don't know why.

129
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:56,940
Don't congratulate yourself now, Doctor. D-O-K, Doctor. Sit down in that chaise large.

130
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,040
Place your feet behind Chaz's ears and begin rubbing slowly.

131
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:09,500
Eh? Little blue ones that dance in front of your eyes. Just reach over and take one of

132
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:16,220
these Sumerian tablets. I think you'll feel the presence of something that goes way, way

133
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:25,120
back. Once you do, the floodgates will be all open. Nice and open.

134
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:39,700
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. And

135
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:46,200
like that, he's gone. You, dipstick, sties. It makes me laugh. You're all dead. You're

136
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,700
all dead.

137
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,320
Take them to the secret broadcast cave and train them all to talk like me. Real sexy.

138
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,040
Enchanted and raptured and bombed.

139
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,420
So you say you're a tough bratty.

140
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,400
Yeah, I'm a tough bratty.

141
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,420
What do you mean by that? You've been around the block, huh?

142
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,620
Yeah, well, you know, I didn't fall out of the tree yesterday, you know?

143
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,060
No, you didn't fall out of the tree. You look like you maybe fell out of a truck.

144
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,540
Well, going around the block. You know what I'm saying? Now look, watch. See? Now listen.

145
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:11,760
Look.

146
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,940
Talk like that. I mean, you know, talk like that about me, go ahead.

147
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,200
Come on, guy. I've seen roughly three times.

148
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,200


149
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,200


150
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,240
I've seen roughly three times.

151
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,240


152
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,680
I remember you had a pair of very rouged faces like yours before, and I know what you're

153
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,340
up to, see? There's nothing in my wallet but a pair of, uh, listen here. Now watch. Now

154
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,400
look, see? Listen.

155
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,240
Hey, what are you guys going on about? Okay, just, okay. Now I think I've got it figured

156
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,600
out.

157
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,180
You should be able to figure it out, Wilt.

158
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,960
Let me say the thing that makes me feel like I'm on the radio. Ah yes, dear friends.

159
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:46,180
I feel like I'm sitting at my spaceship console because the station here, downtown, is a spaceship.

160
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,180


161
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:54,760
WCSB, where we originate, has been completely revised and revamped, amped up.

162
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,480
It's beautiful.

163
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,060
It's so spaceship-like now.

164
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,480
It's like a Star Trek set.

165
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,840
It literally is.

166
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:06,820
In fact, I think if this were put in a Star Trek set back in those days, they would be confused and amazed.

167
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,860
Well, actually, right where I'm sitting looks like a Star Trek set, and the rest of it looks like a Tarzan set.

168
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,420
As it always did.

169
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,520
Yes, the burnt cork walls.

170
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,120
The strewn-about sandwiches on the floor.

171
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,740
The pieces of detritus left for years.

172
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,200
That's the way I started.

173
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,380
The vanished lives.

174
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,800
A fine patina of detritus, yes.

175
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,860
A real station is that way, friends.

176
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,760
A free station.

177
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,620
The kind of station that will tell you the truth.

178
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,320
As if you wanted to know the truth.

179
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,080
Real truth.

180
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,480
And here's the parade of truths coming up the road.

181
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,140
Oh, this is...

182
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,300
Very awkward truths.

183
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,340
Very awkward.

184
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,040
Amazing truths.

185
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,380
Ugly truths.

186
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,200
Very ugly.

187
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,780
Ugly, indeed.

188
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,260
You know, I've noticed...

189
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,200
Drunken truths.

190
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,580
Some of these are falling down.

191
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,860
I've noticed that the Church of the Subgenius makes much ado about the articles of faith,

192
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,180
but like any articles on the commercial market, they come and go as they're packaged.

193
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,700
One week it's this article.

194
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,440
The next week it's a pair of shoes, perhaps from Brazil.

195
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,860
Brightly shined up to meet the neighbors.

196
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,600
If there are any left...

197
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:08,840
Yes.

198
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:09,660
That's so.

199
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,480
But don't you see...

200
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,400
Bob's a short-duration personal savior.

201
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,280
He's a short...

202
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,180
He's a tall man, too, isn't he?

203
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,880
Very tall.

204
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,260
Well, he's not as tall as he looks up on stage.

205
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:19,800
No.

206
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,440
You're right.

207
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,900
People often say that to Bob.

208
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,140
He's not as tall as I thought you were.

209
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,240
Yeah, it's like the way they used to shoot Richard Wagner and Alan Ladd in the old days.

210
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,340
Bob actually usually, when he's going to be dealing with the press and so forth,

211
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:40,760
he would duct tape an apple crate to each shoe so that he would look taller and more impressive.

212
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,760
You know, tall people...

213
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,100
That accounts for the clacking sound.

214
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,640
Yeah.

215
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:43,640


216
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:43,700
Yeah.

217
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,380
Yeah.

218
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,400


219
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,400


220
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,400


221
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,400


222
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,400


223
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,400


224
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,400


225
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,400


226
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,400


227
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,400


228
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,960
It was a psycho-mysterian experience when he'd walk into a room to hear that kind of thudding of an empty orange crate.

229
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,360
The clink, clink, clink.

230
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,400
And it was actually his mudden slippers.

231
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,060
Well, they almost...

232
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,540
But it was so impressive with Bob doing it.

233
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,360
I mean, it would look stupid with anybody else.

234
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,340
But somehow with him, it was perfectly stupid.

235
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,120
It did look magical.

236
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,700
And it was...

237
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,160
It got...

238
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:09,040
It would have been a fad and then a trend and then an army, a movement.

239
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,700
But Bob...

240
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,200
He actually, after a while...

241
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,920
He got tired of pretending to be something he wasn't.

242
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,180
Well, the thing is, really, only Bob could pull that off.

243
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,040
I mean, nobody else could really pull it off.

244
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,760
It's just, you know, he was the one with the Elan and, you know, just the...

245
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
Well, he had the seven virtues.

246
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,320
You know what I mean?

247
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,300
For crying out loud, he could have been Buddha, but he was a fat ass instead, you know?

248
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,880
What are the seven virtues?

249
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:40,080
Snakey hair, lovely feet, charming breath and overtures, a beautiful, billow-ish complexion,

250
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,320
strangeness when it comes to appertaining the mysteries of science and...

251
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,100
An ability to write art, great figutors and...

252
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,960
I guess that's nine.

253
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,220
So, you're not a very virtuous fellow, I suppose.

254
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,360
No, no, I have no virtues.

255
00:09:51,580 --> 00:10:01,760
I have the seven ugly vices, which consist of gluttony, sloth or sloth, avarice, which

256
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,060
consists of lust and...

257
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,800
What are the other ones?

258
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,700
Dave, can you hear this music in the background?

259
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:09,740
Yeah.

260
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,460
It sounds like...

261
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,680
It's not about eating too much.

262
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,300
It's like what we listen to at the...

263
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,900
Berkesgaden.

264
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,580
It's...

265
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,440
Berkenslaken.

266
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,100
It mixes with Tumble and Tumbleweeds, I think.

267
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,240
Is it Spike?

268
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,780
No, it's this music that we're playing in the background.

269
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:33,340
In fact, all of the music in the background, probably the whole show mayhaps, is from

270
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,680
something called...

271
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,640
A band called People Like Us, but it's really a woman named Vicky Bennett from England.

272
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Vicky Bennett.

273
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,020
And as David...

274
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,160
as the great Saint David Botner said,

275
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,380
if she's not already a subgenius minister,

276
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,640
she's definitely a latent subgenius.

277
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,800
The best way I can describe her audio work

278
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,600
is a satirical collage of old lounge records,

279
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,080
children's shows, bad British radio,

280
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,680
and country music with hilarious timing.

281
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,640
Her new album, Abridged Too Far,

282
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,700
is available online as an MP3 album

283
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,000
complete with cover artwork, CD label, and everything.

284
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,400
Apparently she finds that releasing her album

285
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,480
the conventional way is no longer worth the bother.

286
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,340
And the new album, Abridged Too Far,

287
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,320
can be downloaded at www.ubu.com.

288
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,800
U-B-U, as in King Ubu.

289
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:34,460
Ubu Roy, another Shordurper Sav among the subgeniuses,

290
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,340
and an old friend of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

291
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,600
And maybe from a pair of Ubu people around here, perhaps.

292
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,760
No, no.

293
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,380
Those are...

294
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,880
That's a modern-day rock band.

295
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,200
Bob used to hang around with Alfred Jerry.

296
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,420
I heard he did.

297
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,400
And Ubu himself, the real person.

298
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,360
The real Roy.

299
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:51,920
Right.

300
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,600
Yeah.

301
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,580
Yes, sir.

302
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,240
Yes, he used to drink absinthe

303
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,180
and fart slowly in the midnight hours.

304
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,120
He'd stare out his Montmartre window

305
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,600
and listen to the cobblestones crackle below him.

306
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,080
The old fish vendors walking by,

307
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,180
singing songs about fish and stuff.

308
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,620
Sometimes an errant one-eyed jackal would wander by.

309
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,300
You know, that can put the fear...

310
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:12,940
Bob Dobbs in you.

311
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,680
You know, you're staring out your window in the left bank

312
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,080
and suddenly you're staring at a one-eyed jackal or hyena.

313
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,280
And they're giving you transliminal subsequent messages.

314
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,420
And these are very hard to distinguish.

315
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,040
I've got the world on my string.

316
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,360
Sitting on my...

317
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,880
I've got you.

318
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,000
I've got you.

319
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,300
I've got you.

320
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:39,700
I've got you.

321
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,000
I've got you.

322
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,120


323
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,360
I've got you.

324
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,540
I've got you.

325
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,080
I've got you.

326
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,080


327
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,240
I've got you.

328
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,740
I've got you.

329
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,680
I've got you.

330
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,120
I've got you.

331
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,320


332
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,640
I've got you.

333
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,520
I've got you.

334
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:48,800
I've got you.

335
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,240
And look what we've all got.

336
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,560
There's a neatly exposed medulla oblongata.

337
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,080
We're making a decision all the way from north to south.

338
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,680
I've got you.

339
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,480
And we're going to cut out a little part right here in the middle flap.

340
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,260
And that's going to be our east-west direction.

341
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,360
Okay, I want you kids back in there.

342
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,720
Can you see me right there?

343
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,160
Can you see me?

344
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,920
Yeah, but what's that smell?

345
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,380
You wake up in your bed and...

346
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,140
Well, that's the barbecue flavor that we try to implant each one of our cadavers with.

347
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,140
Stay in Wonderland.

348
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:18,480
Especially, especially done for the research we do at Hadware Labs from the Church of the Subgenius.

349
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,400
And all these cadavers, believe me, are like within days, days fresh.

350
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,520
We don't let anything sit out in the sun too long.

351
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,700
And we can't, by law, let anything sit here too long.

352
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,900
If you look here, notice that this is a little epicanthic-looking fold here.

353
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,260
This piece of leathery yellow stuff is actually what keeps the subgenius brain intact.

354
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,200
If not, it'll just fall apart on all four.

355
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,000
Four north, west, east, south corners.

356
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,740
And leading to what many call the interior moxibustion collapse.

357
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,260
Which I wasn't seeing.

358
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,440
I know you can, though.

359
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,460
Just put your nose a little closer there.

360
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,960
Oh, no, I really would rather...

361
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,720
No, you've got to rub it in there if you really want to get the right kind of feeling.

362
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

363
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,260
Oh, I see you're one of the chosen ones already.

364
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,100
Your hair's turning pink.

365
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,140
That's lovely.

366
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,760
Oh, your hands are glowing.

367
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:07,460
Oh, that's disgusting.

368
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,760
You're one of us, baby.

369
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,980
Here, slap one right here.

370
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,440
Okay.

371
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,740
You're going to have to sign this, though.

372
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,820
You must shut down your transmitter.

373
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,700
Shut it down.

374
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,380
We're not serious.

375
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,040
I've got the clamp the lid on this business.

376
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,020
Stop these communications.

377
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,280
Oh, damn.

378
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,280
No.

379
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,180
It lies within your power, Mr. President.

380
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,520
You can declare a national emergency.

381
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,120
I don't have to.

382
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,380
It's here.

383
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,000
But I don't.

384
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,100
And not merely national.

385
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,060
Wait, I'm getting a no-go signal.

386
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,180
Now I'm losing one of the craft.

387
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,980
Hey, Bermuda, you getting it?

388
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,120
Oh, lost contact.

389
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,500
You're always all right, Dave.

390
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,140
Right.

391
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,280
I was.

392
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,700
I had a little mistake.

393
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,840
It's called the Reverend Haven Sting.

394
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:53,700
Oh, and speaking of mistakes, it would be a real mistake to let this amazing book go by

395
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,060
without your knowing about it.

396
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,440
Friends, I'm going to do a book review.

397
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,880
It's been a long time since we've done book reviews on the Hour of Slack.

398
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,040
Princess Wee has been skimming this book.

399
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,900
You know our friend Dr. Howell?

400
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,540
The great Dr. Howell of the Puzzling Evidence Show and so forth.

401
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:16,400
He has now a book out from Frog Limited Press.

402
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:18,840
Frog Limited?

403
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,060
Well, friends, the title of this book is

404
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,420
The Meaning of Lost and Mismatched Socks,

405
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:32,480
illustrated and written by Dr. Howell under the name of Dr. Perditus Pedale.

406
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,880
A rather official sounding name for a man who has no credentials whatsoever.

407
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,200
Which means lost socks.

408
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,100
I don't know how he can write a book.

409
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,580
He's not very fat of a volume.

410
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,700
Actually, no, it's not a real big book,

411
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:53,380
but it goes into quite a bit of detail as to what could possibly be behind the disappearance of,

412
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,240
you know how it is, lost and mismatched socks.

413
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:02,380
There's just never the, there's so many possible explanations for this thing.

414
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,160
Yes.

415
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,640
This phenomenon.

416
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,300
It is indeed a phenomenon.

417
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,500
We even explored it ourselves one time under the phenomenon, the car keys,

418
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,520
which are a phenomenon.

419
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:10,520


420
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,720
It's a form of, like in Greek mythology, the herpes or whatever.

421
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,740
No, the, the harpies.

422
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:14,920
Yes.

423
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,180
And it caused mischief in your life and your afterlife.

424
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,520
As, as doctor, actually, I should put on, uh.

425
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,740
His music.

426
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,360
A different, a different, uh, background.

427
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,460
Probably something exciting.

428
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:26,860
Music here.

429
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,740
Ensuring, like.

430
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,760
The innate hostility of the universe.

431
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,720
If losing socks is simply to be considered an aberrant habit,

432
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,040
then it can, like other forms of human behavior,

433
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,500
be modified.

434
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,100
Modified and ultimately eliminated.

435
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,620
Yet, throughout the years,

436
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,460
statistical and actuarial studies have revealed a startling increase

437
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:55,280
in the value of actual lost sock ranges over, over predicted values.

438
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:02,040
In simpler terms, human blundering falls far short of being the entire explanation of the problem.

439
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,480
It can only be concluded that the universe and the socks themselves

440
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,260
are up.

441
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,280
To something.

442
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,960
A down socks.

443
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,660
Did they?

444
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:29,960
Well, you know, life itself tends to organize itself from inorganic matter and reveals a propensity towards a move towards order.

445
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:40,220
And yet the overwhelming mass of the rest of the universe acts in precisely the opposite way and is actively engaged in devolving or

446
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:40,500
disorganizing.

447
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:40,500


448
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:40,500


449
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,640
The random factor.

450
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,480
This far more immense process has, within its vast complexity and subtlety,

451
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,940
a quality which, when viewed from a human vantage point,

452
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,660
may as well be understood as behaving like a malignant intelligence.

453
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:57,960
Yes!

454
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,420
That is, the universe is out to get us.

455
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,940
And don't you feel, my friend, that the universe is, in fact, out to get you.

456
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,500
And the lost sock is the least of your concern.

457
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:10,500


458
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:10,500


459
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:10,500


460
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,280
That is, the universe's past is going to be the beginning of your problems, I am well imagined.

461
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:13,940
Yes!

462
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,220
They take forms, they take shapes, they take different personalities.

463
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,900
Could be the old lady on the block next to your block head.

464
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,440
The universe is out to get you on the cellular level.

465
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,360
Not one of yourselves is getting better.

466
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,840
They're all getting older.

467
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:39,060
Everything comes apart, one way or another, as J.R. Bob-Bob once said.

468
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,200
And the teeth are getting even.

469
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:39,680
Well.

470
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:40,480
Not.

471
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:40,480


472
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:40,480


473
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:40,480


474
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:40,480


475
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:40,480


476
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:40,480


477
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:40,480


478
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,120
Oh, yes.

479
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,300
Then it crumbles.

480
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,740
They're taking you down molecule by molecule.

481
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,420
They're erasing your personality.

482
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,520
The last vestiges of flesh stretched out over this easy canvas which you...

483
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,820
You're so lapse-heartedly laxly...

484
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,740
You think you can get away with something I can't...

485
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,660
And you think you have it bad, Sam.

486
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,060
You think you've got it bad.

487
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,420
You think you've got it...

488
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,840
Think if you were a poor little chimpanzee.

489
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,820
A bonobo chimpanzee.

490
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,220
Those wonderful, beautiful, horny little relatives in the Congo.

491
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,780
The bonobo chimpanzees.

492
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,940
They wear diapers, don't they?

493
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,840
They wear French ticklers.

494
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,320
They wear all sorts of marital aids.

495
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,080
Because these chimpanzees, unlike the normal pantroglodyte chimpanzee,

496
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,240
these little yetis, as we call them,

497
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,040
have a society based on sex.

498
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,700
A matriarchal society.

499
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,460
Where if there's an argument between mom and son,

500
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,760
or dad and niece,

501
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,080
why, they just...

502
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,580
They don't fight.

503
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,220
They don't yell.

504
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,060
They have sex.

505
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,420
They make love, not war.

506
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,880
Yes, they make love, not war.

507
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,780
No matter who they're...

508
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,980
You know, who it is.

509
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,700
Boy, girl, chimp.

510
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,240
As long as it's a chimp.

511
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,400
Girl, girl, chimp.

512
00:19:59,480 --> 00:19:59,720
You know.

513
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,640
Mom, son, chimp.

514
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,800
They wouldn't do an Englishman.

515
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,960
Coconut that resembles a chimp over there by that rock.

516
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,720
Oh, sorry.

517
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:08,660
So...

518
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,120
It's rough, friends.

519
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,300
Being a bonobo.

520
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,680
These pygmy chimpanzees...

521
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,860
It's rougher than butter.

522
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,420
Have been, uh...

523
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,120
Harder than a sled.

524
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,760
You've taken it down.

525
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,820
You know all the numbers.

526
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,640
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

527
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,480
Only one in...

528
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:25,860
Yes.

529
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,520
How many?

530
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:27,580
Five.

531
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,460
Only bonobos.

532
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,000
Anyway, there aren't many bonobos left, friends.

533
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,260
Because they're being served in Belgian restaurants and so forth.

534
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:35,920
Unfortunately.

535
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,140
Ten euros gets you a bonobo.

536
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:38,940
Over easy.

537
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,020
Ha, ha.

538
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,420
Get it?

539
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:40,900
Over easy.

540
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,780
Oh, yeah.

541
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,700
Fresh love before they are brought to your table.

542
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,240
Oh, the special fluids.

543
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:50,980
Don't worry.

544
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,060
There are plenty of those.

545
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,860
And we braise them lightly.

546
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,780
Oh, yes.

547
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:54,840
The fluids.

548
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,800
The combination of central olives.

549
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,880
And then we flavor them with a clarified butter.

550
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,880
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

551
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,480
Shut the fuck up.

552
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,020
I'm afraid I must ask you to stop.

553
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,940
Oh, beloved monitor.

554
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,120
I'm sorry.

555
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,120


556
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,120


557
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,120


558
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,120


559
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,120


560
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,120


561
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,120


562
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,120


563
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,120


564
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,120


565
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,120


566
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,120


567
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,100
I believe, beloved, beloved...

568
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,160
Public hold what?

569
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,000
Get up, sir.

570
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,080
I'll be forced to take you in for counseling action.

571
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,540
Oh, beloved brother.

572
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,540
You have done much good.

573
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,060
Much good.

574
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,560
Bless you.

575
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,020
Bless you.

576
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,560
We do not ask for worship, sir.

577
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,040
Only cooperation for the common purpose.

578
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,200
I'm afraid I must ask for your literature.

579
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:33,840
Oh.

580
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:35,820
Oh.

581
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:36,920


582
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,160


583
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,300
Oh.

584
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,120


585
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,120


586
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,120


587
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,120


588
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,360
Oh.

589
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,500
You.

590
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,160
You.

591
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,320
You.

592
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:50,780
I'll be for what you know.

593
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,980
I hear you have taken all of these salt from the village.

594
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,400
What gives you the right to do this to our people?

595
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,820
I was chosen.

596
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,960
I was the one who was chosen.

597
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,060
I looked in the reflective waters.

598
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,280
I saw my own face.

599
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,120
That is how I know.

600
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,060
But you were chosen by whom?

601
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,760
The reflective face in your waters?

602
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,040
No.

603
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:14,740
No, senor, you cannot be, you can only be chosen by the St. Alpharetta Potinto that lives down by the, well, you know, used to live before she was canonized.

604
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,440
Well, listen, you can't do that.

605
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:22,340
Go to hell, we don't need no stinking popes or religions or Baptists or anything.

606
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,800
We need only our slack and our love and our flesh and our meat.

607
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,780
Lots of meat.

608
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,860
Tons of meat.

609
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:28,820
More meat.

610
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,460
A lot more meat.

611
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,520
Give me your meat, man.

612
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,980
Give me, you fool, give me more meat.

613
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,460
More meat for me.

614
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,960
I will have your meat.

615
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,280
You pink boy, I will make you a red charcoal broiled boy.

616
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,680
I need karate chops.

617
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,720
I will bury you and eat you.

618
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,900
Not in that order.

619
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,700
You know nothing.

620
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,660
I have learned nothing, I can say.

621
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,760
Come on, boys.

622
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,800
You don't know how to fight like that.

623
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,160
Why don't you be like the bonobos and make love?

624
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,020
Not fight.

625
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,280
What?

626
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,120
I need to make some rice.

627
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,360
I want to make some, um, yeah, yeah.

628
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:12,920
What's up with these?

629
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,640
Hey, pull the flamenco player, pull the flamenco player back away from the mic.

630
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,580
I need to make some pie.

631
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:17,900
That's better.

632
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,300
Yeah, okay.

633
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,860
Kill the fat flamenco player.

634
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,840
So good looking, though.

635
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,000
Suck.

636
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,320
Listen, he does know what the hell he's doing.

637
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:26,860
Listen to that.

638
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,200
Thank God.

639
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:36,180
What a silly man and what a silly group of people assembled here together to learn the magic truth.

640
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:36,920
Silly people.

641
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,360
We.

642
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,400
My favorite people.

643
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,620
Yeah, it's mine, too.

644
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:45,220
Especially when afterwards, when they accept the structure of the subgenius, we take them

645
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,760
out in the parking lot and liquidate them for their fat.

646
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,300
And as we render the fat down, we sell it back to the big oil companies for a lot of

647
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:53,600
money.

648
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,100
We got that idea from Fight Club.

649
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,460
Yeah.

650
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,320
That was, it was brilliant.

651
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,100
I'm not supposed to mention that one.

652
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,840
No, no, no.

653
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,060
We steal them when we can, don't we?

654
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,420
And we steal these foraging little peptudes wherever we can find them, too.

655
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,400
Look at the one with the red hair.

656
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,340
He's got lots of jumbo.

657
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:33,640
That's what they call it.

658
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:33,920
Hey mate,

659
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,500
kept up in all.

660
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:37,340


661
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:37,340


662
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:37,340


663
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:37,340


664
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,960
They know the sound.

665
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,920
Somebody help.

666
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,440
In any case, somebody will help.

667
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,720
Someone will answer your pleas.

668
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,480
I cannot fly in the face of 180 years of America.

669
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,980
No, don't fly in my face.

670
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,120
For God's sake.

671
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,520
I cannot start a war.

672
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,740
A month from now, we may not have the strength to fight one.

673
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,960
The Russians may have in their hands the power now.

674
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,720
Ah, we're re-militarizing.

675
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,620
This country will not launch a war.

676
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,880
George W. Bush is our leader.

677
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,340
U.S. Space Corps.

678
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,020
We've served a great many years together.

679
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,580
And there's never been a day when I couldn't happily go along with any decision of yours.

680
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,720
But I have a responsibility to this country, too.

681
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,260
And I can't stand by and see it destroyed.

682
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,500
Our difference is that I don't believe it.

683
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,300
It can be destroyed.

684
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,600
By 13 slips of paper covered with obscure symbols.

685
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,100
Yeah.

686
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,900
The Japanese Empire was destroyed.

687
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,180
Oh, there it went.

688
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:45,700
Oh, no.

689
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,060
The country's gone too bad.

690
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,080
Bummer, man.

691
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,400
13 obscure symbols, indeed.

692
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,720
If only you had learned the lessons that we're willing to teach him for a mere $30 American money.

693
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,500
But yet, slack was within their grasp.

694
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,860
It was inches away.

695
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,840
They had slack right in front of them.

696
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,640
And yet, they let it slip away.

697
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,860
Pig ignorant as they are.

698
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,320
Yes.

699
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,200
That's the word.

700
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,080
Ham-fisted and pig ignorant.

701
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,520
Yes.

702
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,480
Pathetic.

703
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,820
The pig clats.

704
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,260
The clats were called pig ignorant.

705
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:13,720
Yes.

706
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,040
Yes.

707
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:22,780
I can hear you in the distance calling out my name.

708
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:29,640
I can hear you up close stabbing me with your name.

709
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,400
I can see you getting closer.

710
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,040
Trying.

711
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,720
Trying to infect my brain.

712
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,740
My brain is not infected.

713
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,920
My brain is pure.

714
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,360
As is yours, sir.

715
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,140
Pure.

716
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,620
Pure.

717
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,360
Pure.

718
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,140
One brain cell.

719
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,420
One crystalline pure brain cell.

720
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,760
Don't need no more than one.

721
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,420
One's good unity.

722
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,980
The unity of all things.

723
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,380
The one.

724
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,100
One.

725
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:02,340
Get down inside your own brain, man.

726
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,340
Check it out.

727
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,100
To thine own self be true, dude.

728
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,180
The armature.

729
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,280
Turn off the TV.

730
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,120
Not the radio.

731
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,060
Just the TV.

732
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,480
Just relax and get into it, man.

733
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,320
You know, just stop.

734
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,960
Why do you let the world rush you along, man?

735
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,220
Don't let some robot traffic light boss you around.

736
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,640
So it turned red.

737
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,340
Are you going to take orders from the robot?

738
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:28,940
Red.

739
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,160
Don't let the robots push you around.

740
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,640
Blow off those traffic lights, man.

741
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,960
Use your hypothalamus.

742
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:38,560
By the way, the opinions expressed on this show are not necessarily those of the station

743
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,960
or the station management or the people singing in the background on the station shows or

744
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:52,080
the janitor who sutures the station manager together in emergency situations, which, if

745
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,600
this were an emergency, you would feel that you were overdosing on some sort of very bad

746
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,920
and strong psychedelic drug.

747
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,800
Thank you.

748
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,120
I guess that is.

749
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,920
This is exactly what has happened here.

750
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:15,140
Once again, these kids have just decided to get high instead of work or discipline themselves

751
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:19,200
or show any sort of interest in improving or learning.

752
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,560
These kids these days.

753
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,100
Some of them are 500 years old.

754
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:33,080
Whimpering wimps of negative nabobistic dobsism.

755
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:33,640
What's the next one?

756
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,060
Well, they're pretty old for kids, but yet look.

757
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,020
Listen to them.

758
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,800
They're like little flowers.

759
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,320
Some of them are wearing those real cute little pink slippers.

760
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,380
I like to shoot them in.

761
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,780
Oh, boy, makes their parents cry.

762
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,160
We chop their feet up.

763
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,760
Who keeps who's in the back of the train?

764
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,120
OK, who's back there fooling around with the switches?

765
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,280
I need to remind each and every one of you.

766
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,560
I'm following that.

767
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:15,240
I'm going to be doing a hell of a fine job steering things around.

768
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:22,660
We're navigating through a blizzard of confused ideas and some pretty rough water when it

769
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,780
comes to our actual compost.

770
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,440
You know, but we try.

771
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,020
I can't really remember what we're trying right now.

772
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,620
Oh, my God.

773
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,140
Come on, come on.

774
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,280
Oh, yeah.

775
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,620
Man.

776
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,660
OK, I'm going to start blowing rubble.

777
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,240
I have to.

778
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:46,920
Excuse me, sir.

779
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,220
Won't you come in, please?

780
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,220
How are you doing?

781
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,300
How do you do, Mr. President?

782
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,700
Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, I want to tell you, bring your boy with you.

783
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,060
I want to start with this whole business.

784
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:00,940
OK.

785
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,300
How would you use that?

786
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:02,760
I don't think so.

787
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,800
I'm not going to drag this out.

788
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,400
No, nothing.

789
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,500
Stop dragging things around.

790
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,120
Let's just get to business.

791
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,000
It's made it pretty fair to start on that, Mr. President, when you clamped the center

792
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,540
ship on us.

793
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,880
Have any further messages been decoded?

794
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,360
Or aren't we allowed to know?

795
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,940
I'm not sure, Mr. President.

796
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,500
There's no further messages to decode.

797
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,760
You must shut down your advancement.

798
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,720
Hey, now, shut it down.

799
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,400
Everyone, I'm steering.

800
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,040
I've got to clamp the lid on this business.

801
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,040
Stop these communications.

802
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,300
Oh, damn.

803
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,360
How can you ever stop them?

804
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,620
They come from so far away that they can't be stopped.

805
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:33,620


806
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:33,620


807
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:33,620


808
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:33,620


809
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,780
Nobody can reach them.

810
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,640
They can't, you know, they can't.

811
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,280
How are you going to stop them?

812
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,740
They never, never reach them.

813
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:37,920
No.

814
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,860
Once they begin pounding into your brain, you know, the first thing, the prefrontal lobe

815
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,540
starts to flatten.

816
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:48,400
And once you get into this syndrome where the prefrontal lobe starts to flatten, then

817
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,820
the next thing you know, somebody is spitting on you at the bar, you know, and they go like,

818
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,140
and then they can't express themselves, you know.

819
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,220
Next thing you know, they are defiled.

820
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,040
These are the kind of people they're looking for in the church house, I told you, you know.

821
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,440
These kind of idiots, they can go to a bar and they start, you know, talk to somebody,

822
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,180
they spit on them all over the place.

823
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,540
We're looking for people who like to draw.

824
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,500
There's a lot of art critics out there.

825
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,740
People want to be art critics.

826
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,100
Oh, yeah.

827
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,960
We need critics.

828
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,820
But we're not art critics.

829
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,440
We're looking for people who like to draw.

830
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,240
Drawing on a pipe.

831
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,380
Drawing on a pipe, Daddy.

832
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:18,960
Yep.

833
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,700
Drawing on a pipe above.

834
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,280
Yep, we like to sit back and hop setty, if you know what I'm saying.

835
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,260
Like, take the whole idea until the brain starts to melt and come out the ear canal.

836
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:33,060
Now, don't stick those tubes too high up in the ear canal and you can cause some pretty

837
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,420
bad things.

838
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,700
Yeah, I'd sniff it, you know what I'm saying?

839
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,500
Yeah, ah, makes your sinuses go.

840
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,120
Back your eyes, right there.

841
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,820
Crote, I guess the word, best word for it, crote.

842
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,880
Eyes are croting.

843
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,320
Grote in the scrote.

844
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:51,280
Friends, yes, we grow some great concepts deep down in the scrotes of our bodies where

845
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,160
we store our real soul.

846
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,260
You know, did you know that the soul is stored in a hairy sack?

847
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,720
Yes, it is.

848
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,820
Between the thighs.

849
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,160
Of a...

850
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,420
Of a...

851
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,360
That is so not true.

852
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:05,860
Your pet.

853
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,960
Your pet, depending on what kind of virtues it may have.

854
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,100
If you don't have a pet, you ain't got a soul or a good receptacle for it.

855
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,900
It may have to just hover around you.

856
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,620
You could find yourself a rabbit or a beetnik.

857
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,560
They like dogs or cats best.

858
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,280
Tomatoes is good if you...

859
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,120
But, you know, they'll go bad on you and they don't talk none.

860
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,240
Oh, wait, here they are, they're talking though.

861
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,680
Oh yes, oh yeah, right.

862
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,120
Oh look, they're going out to sea.

863
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,480
They're in the little boat now.

864
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,140
How long we been out here, man?

865
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,200
I don't know, man. I'm rooting for him.

866
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,660
I can't remember anything.

867
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,060
It seems like we've been out on this boat forever.

868
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,500
I can't take any more seawater.

869
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,840
I'm this old, parched, and hydrated.

870
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,740
I keep drinking.

871
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,460
You'll be all right.

872
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,080
It looks like an island in the distance.

873
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,340
Here, just blot your brow.

874
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:53,940
A little bit.

875
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,040
It's a mermaid.

876
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,000
Hey, this is not an island.

877
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,040
That's a mermaid's titty.

878
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,940
What is this titty in the brow?

879
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,700
She's beautiful.

880
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,240
She's so lovely.

881
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,360
I must get to the mermaid.

882
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,640
I want to see her.

883
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,120
No, me first.

884
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,640
She's so beautiful.

885
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,860
She smells.

886
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,220
That fishy smell.

887
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,720
Wait, what's happening?

888
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,680
She's changing.

889
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,640
She's too late.

890
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,380
My god, man.

891
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,520
There's no mermaid.

892
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:35,800
This is a creature that should have died 10,000 billion years ago.

893
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,860
I can't believe the smell of her.

894
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,520
I think she's dead.

895
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,160
My god, by all rights of man.

896
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,100
Oh, my god.

897
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,040
I'm out of your peace.

898
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,580
This foul thing should not exist.

899
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,560
Oh, my god.

900
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,880
What have we done?

901
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,340
Look, it's getting up.

902
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,740
It will not die.

903
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,720
It refuses to die.

904
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,920
We must kill this thing.

905
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,300
We've got to get out of here.

906
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,160
You mean?

907
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,820
This religion we've created.

908
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,180
It is turning against us.

909
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,260
That's what it is, man.

910
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,480
Stitched together as it was.

911
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,300
It's the monster of the air.

912
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,640
It's your own religion, you fool.

913
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,380
Look into the mirror.

914
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,220
No.

915
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,880
No, I refuse to admit it.

916
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,440
Yes, I admit we stole from dead religions.

917
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:18,680
Yes, I admit we dug up the corpse of Buddha, Jesus, and every other great teacher.

918
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,040
Yes, we did it.

919
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,980
And abused them.

920
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,340
Yes.

921
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:24,860
Threw them over our dashboards and had at them.

922
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,980
We buggered these other cults.

923
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,360
I don't think it would be.

924
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,960
We had the Lord and me.

925
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,540
We took the best from them.

926
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,240
And we sutured it together into this great thing.

927
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,400
The great thing.

928
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,080
The church of the subgenius.

929
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:43,880
Yes.

930
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:53,160
For we shall overcome the fools and the pig boys and the little pig men and the big pig men.

931
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:53,760
We will.

932
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,760
This is our Messiah, Frankenstein.

933
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,700
Oh, sorry.

934
00:34:59,100 --> 00:34:59,860
Where are you?

935
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,020
Where are you?

936
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
My medicines.

937
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,460
I need more of the drugs.

938
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,400
The drugs, you see.

939
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,320
The drugs seem to light up my brain.

940
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,100
I saw in an instant the power.

941
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,720
The power I had.

942
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,680
The power of slack.

943
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:26,580
The slack in my little finger had more power than the president, than the premier.

944
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,560
Even perhaps, yes, even more power than Bob.

945
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:29,900
Bob!

946
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,680
Could it be?

947
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,680
Could I be the chosen one?

948
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,820
He was the nexus of the universe in his mind.

949
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,020
Yes.

950
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,460
And so I trudged on into the night.

951
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,680
Sandals flipping in the wind.

952
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,760
Away from the ground.

953
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,860
With his robe glowing.

954
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,440
Away.

955
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,780
He sauntered on.

956
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,420
Worse and worse.

957
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,900
Thinking that he had become the one.

958
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:57,260
I am that one central focal point of all universal forces.

959
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,520
Yes, I.

960
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,360
Reverend Ivan.

961
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,600
I was the great genius.

962
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,180
The brilliant writer.

963
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:11,300
Who etched his flammable words onto the very skin brain of the followers.

964
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,560
And yet.

965
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:12,820
And yet.

966
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,600
The great swollen sack confused, man.

967
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,720
What?

968
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,820
The drifting angel of infantilism.

969
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,400
What is that silly voice?

970
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,960
Oh, that's my conscience.

971
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:24,880
That's disgusting.

972
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,300
I can ignore that easily enough.

973
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,680
I did idea.

974
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,580
But I need to feed.

975
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,820
A brain such as mine must have more power.

976
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,260
It must have nutrients.

977
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,820
Yes.

978
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,200
The souls of others would be good.

979
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:41,700
Yes.

980
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,220
The brain stems.

981
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:43,720
The medulla.

982
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,500
Can I help you, sir?

983
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,540
You've been staring at the freezer case for a long time.

984
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,040
No, actually.

985
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:48,880
Why don't you?

986
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,200
The manager asked me to see if I could help you.

987
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,580
Yes, you could help me.

988
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,060
You could help me, sir.

989
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,020
Please come back here into this dark alley.

990
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,660
Further back here into this dark alley.

991
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:57,660


992
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:57,660


993
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:57,660


994
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:57,660


995
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:57,660


996
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:57,660


997
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:57,660


998
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:57,660


999
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:57,660


1000
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,680
And this little closet.

1001
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,160
Here, into this broom cellar.

1002
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,080
All right, now!

1003
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,000
Now, take this.

1004
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,960
No, take this!

1005
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,420
I didn't know this!

1006
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,680
You're moving me along in this story much too fast.

1007
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,360
Oh, look.

1008
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,420
Oh, look.

1009
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,020
A little girl has come in.

1010
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,160
I'm now some kind of soap.

1011
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:20,120
The makers of new ideas for an old, tired mankind bring you Hitler's hand soap made

1012
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:27,500
from real hands and by Tokyo Rojo, the amazing new hair cream that makes you shine like FDR.

1013
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:27,660
Oh, my goodness.

1014
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:27,660


1015
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:27,660


1016
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:27,660


1017
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:27,660


1018
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:27,660


1019
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:27,660


1020
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:27,660


1021
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:27,660


1022
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:27,660


1023
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,000
scars.

1024
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,700
How come that man is wearing that from the hat?

1025
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,160
What happened?

1026
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,720
How come he's wearing all that goofy clothes and shoes?

1027
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,020
Look, he's got white and brown shoes.

1028
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:38,540
What's wrong with him?

1029
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,980
His shoes got like brown in front and white around his sides.

1030
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,000
...to try to convince the Taliban to hand over Osama bin Laden.

1031
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:54,720
Even professionals can't give you the fast, easy, affordable clean of the compact Z-Wizards.

1032
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:02,960
This is Angry Bob, the man with the industrial dick, coming at you loud and clear on WAR Radio.

1033
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,900
Rise and shine, folks.

1034
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,220
It's a beautiful day.

1035
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,720
Just look at that sky.

1036
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,820
It's a work of art.

1037
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,300
Ha!

1038
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,420
Nature never knew colors like that.

1039
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:16,480
And a friendly reminder, when you look at it, be sure to wear your shades.

1040
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,380
The radiation counts way up and the heat wave ain't expected to let up either.

1041
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,700
Weather control tell us it'll probably hit 100 and...

1042
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:24,700


1043
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,460
...10 downtown before nightfall.

1044
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,020
As for the good news, there is no good news.

1045
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,800
So let's rock with one of our golden oldies.

1046
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:41,140
Ladies and gentlemen, our mayor has asked that we all remain calm in this emergency.

1047
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,140
Everything possible will be done to protect you.

1048
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:50,040
On orders from Washington, the commander of strategic defense has alerted all branches of the service.

1049
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,700
This is not the usual flying saucer scare.

1050
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,700
This unidentified aircraft...

1051
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,720
...was seen by thousands as it flew through the Lincoln Tunnel.

1052
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,280
Hey, if they're not careful, they're gonna have accident.

1053
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,260
Anyone sighting a strange aircraft, phone your nearest branch of civilian air defense.

1054
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,640
What are we gonna do now?

1055
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,800
We either go to Mars or get shot down.

1056
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,380
So we'll go to Mars.

1057
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,340
We'll go to Mars.

1058
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:18,400
Sent Tuesday, September 11th at 4.53 PM.

1059
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,740
Hey, what happened, man? What happened?

1060
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,560
I got this, too.

1061
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,340
Two flags that I can see from my window here are both a half-mast, man.

1062
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,300
Who died?

1063
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,080
I'm kinda concerned.

1064
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:41,740
I hope another president didn't get assassinated and then, you know, another assassin get assassinated by the assassin's assassin.

1065
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,580
Because, you know, I'm sick of that.

1066
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:45,820
Um...

1067
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,800
Well, yeah, what happened?

1068
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,260
Well, anyway, by the way, you know what?

1069
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,340
Did you ever, you know...

1070
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,600
Did you ever notice that...

1071
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:58,800
When you pick the skin off your feet, even though, you know, I took a shower last night.

1072
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:04,520
But just, you know, just having my...

1073
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:17,000
Having worn the socks that I wore at Burning Man, like, 20 hours ago, you know, and my feet were clean when I put them in,

1074
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,580
makes the skin that I peel off my feet and eat taste like...

1075
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,360
Like, playa dust.

1076
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,120
Uh, which is very sweet, if you notice.

1077
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,240
It's really...

1078
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:28,800
It's very sweet.

1079
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,560
Did you ever notice that?

1080
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:29,940
Do that.

1081
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,240
You know, put on the socks that you wore at Burning Man, even just for a few minutes,

1082
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,380
and then peel the, um, the skin off your feet and eat it.

1083
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,640
And, uh...

1084
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:45,340
Peel the skin off your feet and eat it, says Michael Pepe.

1085
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,380
Well, somehow, the theme of socks and feet...

1086
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,880
Has overcome and come all over the...

1087
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,220
We... This was such a nice studio before, and now look at it.

1088
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,400
Yeah, it's covered with feet, man.

1089
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,120
It was all...

1090
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,060
It's full of socks.

1091
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,300
It was all renovated and...

1092
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,100
And...

1093
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,200
And good, and...

1094
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:06,320
We left it, yeah.

1095
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,840
And now all this, like, foot detritus...

1096
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,640
You know, like, the skin, the prenasal skin, what do they call that?

1097
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,260
The sound effects are all over the floor.

1098
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,060
And the metacarpal arch is dangling right underneath the head box.

1099
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,660
There you've got, like, five consoles.

1100
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,360
And not one of them...

1101
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,580
And not one of them has the right brain case.

1102
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,120
The music is broken.

1103
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,040
It's bright, but it's still broken.

1104
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,620
The song that refused to die...

1105
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,520
Refused to die.

1106
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,260
And it's...

1107
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,140
You know...

1108
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:32,860
God.

1109
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,360
And then more sandwiches here we can't eat.

1110
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,100
I noticed the last people in here left ten turkey and dressing sandwiches...

1111
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,580
Waste.

1112
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:39,820
What a waste.

1113
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,500
...and just take one bite and throw it on the floor.

1114
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,440
Nobody cares.

1115
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,880
It's like life these days.

1116
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,840
You use the clerks in the stores.

1117
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,260
People don't...

1118
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,640
They don't want to do their job.

1119
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,280
We are the...

1120
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:50,360
No, we are the...

1121
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:50,360


1122
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:50,360


1123
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:50,360


1124
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:50,360


1125
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:50,360


1126
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:50,360


1127
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:50,360


1128
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,840
Nobody wants to do their job.

1129
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,200
Nobody wants to do anything.

1130
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,220
They just want to sit and mope.

1131
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:57,640
Complain.

1132
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,040
Yeah, like...

1133
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,040


1134
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,240
That's all anybody ever does is complain.

1135
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,920
I'm so sick and tired of it.

1136
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,800
They cry about how sick and tired...

1137
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:03,860
Impotent.

1138
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:03,980
Improving.

1139
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,960
...and how stupid everybody else is.

1140
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,520
And they are.

1141
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,580
They're all so stupid.

1142
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:07,840
Impulsive.

1143
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,560
Every one of them.

1144
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,180
T.S.

1145
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:10,800
Elliott was right.

1146
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,960
We are the hollow men full of, I guess, nothing really for that hollow.

1147
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:19,220
But we can charge you extra if you want to take that out of the store.

1148
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,340
If you want to leave it in the store, you can.

1149
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:20,340


1150
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:20,340


1151
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:20,340


1152
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:20,340


1153
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:20,340


1154
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:20,340


1155
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,900
If you want to leave it in the store, we'll still charge you extra.

1156
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,500
You know, it's...

1157
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,700
You come and you go and you...

1158
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,980
It's like a revolving door.

1159
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:26,480
It's...

1160
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,020
Remember the old revolving doors that used to...

1161
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,900
That's evolution, man.

1162
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:31,800
It's harsh.

1163
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,580
Now you have doors that you walk in front of and they spring outward at you and knock

1164
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:39,020
you down before you can get back up and then climb back into the room.

1165
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,540
You know, I wanted help but not this much help.

1166
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,080
I can still walk on these two smelly old rutabagas feet I'm carrying around.

1167
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,320
I can still lift the load if it needs to be lifted.

1168
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,540
I just wanted socks that match.

1169
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,200
Me too.

1170
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,320
I just wanted...

1171
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,160
I just wanted to find my socks.

1172
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:55,720
One for each foot.

1173
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,660
That's all I asked.

1174
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,540
A pair.

1175
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:58,940
A pair.

1176
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,200
Is that too much to ask?

1177
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,040
Not...

1178
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,260
Not...

1179
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:01,420
No.

1180
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,320
How do you get socks over rutabagas feet?

1181
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,180
I don't understand.

1182
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:12,080
Well, it's like using a turnip to get off or it's like using a turnip to make the new

1183
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,240
sandal fit better.

1184
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:18,800
It's the same procreative process, only it's kind of urgent when it's done that way.

1185
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,420
Uh-huh.

1186
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:19,780
Yeah.

1187
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:19,780


1188
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:25,180
Some of the kids that have been doing it lately have had severe lesions around their neck

1189
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:25,500
muscles.

1190
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,000
Their eyes are actually popping out of their heads like they have a thyroid problem or

1191
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,160
something.

1192
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,080
It's really disgusting.

1193
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,300
Well, it's not that disgusting.

1194
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,940
It's just an urgent medical health matter that has to be addressed, stamped, mailed

1195
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,760
and sent right away.

1196
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,220
So if you want to send anything to the church or the subgenius...

1197
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,640
Do you have to like send a self-addressed stamped envelope inside of it or...

1198
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,080
Well, you could send your socks.

1199
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,220
That's the first thing you could do.

1200
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,180
Some clean socks.

1201
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,200
If anybody out there in the land of...

1202
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,360
I wonder has a freaking...

1203
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:51,640
What?

1204
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,840
How many do you need, Stang?

1205
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,880
It is distasteful for the scientific mind to indulge in raw speculation.

1206
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,600
It has long been thought that life must exist on other planets.

1207
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:07,580
These life forms most likely have appendages for the purpose of locomotion.

1208
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:13,660
It follows then that such beings have a practical need to keep these appendages warm, hence

1209
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,380
alien footwear.

1210
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,200
There you go.

1211
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,700
Alien footwear.

1212
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,180
I'm going to go get some of that.

1213
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:19,180


1214
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,560
That's right, friends.

1215
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,140
Somewhere, friends, there's a planet.

1216
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:30,020
There's a planet where your socks go and the socks of other creatures, other thinking beings.

1217
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,980
They may have more feet.

1218
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,160
They may have morphed feet.

1219
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:39,220
They may have hooves, but they have socks, one and all.

1220
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,500
And where do those socks...

1221
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,540
They all must end up somewhere, friends.

1222
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,220
That's a mystery.

1223
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:43,900
I have none.

1224
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,260
It's a mystery.

1225
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:45,980
Somehow morbid things.

1226
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:48,560
I'm reminded of the story of Lennon's overcoat.

1227
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,460
You know, he didn't have one because nobody else did.

1228
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,400
What about socks?

1229
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,180
Could you please...

1230
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,920
We need them real badly.

1231
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,340
Right here at...

1232
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:56,840
What's the address?

1233
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,640
The object of the firing of the space gun.

1234
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:07,720
They incite an unruly mob to come forward and smash the space gun.

1235
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:16,740
But it fires anyway, shooting a young, comely pair of youths into space, male and female,

1236
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,340
seeding the cosmos.

1237
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,860
Things to come.

1238
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,100
They seeded Earth.

1239
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,860
The seed of things.

1240
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,540
To the Indians for $24.

1241
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,140
To come.

1242
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,660
It was a mystery.

1243
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:29,700
Raymond Massey and Hal Robbins.

1244
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,920
A mystery wrapped in an enigma.

1245
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,480
A flying, rounded, and streaming milk chocolate.

1246
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,800
You know, I remember when Hal Robbins and, uh, what was the guy that did Perry Mason,

1247
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,340
the big fat guy, what was his name?

1248
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,300
He rode around in a wheelchair with little wings on him.

1249
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,040
Raymond Burr.

1250
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:48,200
Raymond Burr, I remember, used to hang around the YMCA at the, uh, I think it was the Port

1251
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:48,280
of New York.

1252
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:48,320
Yeah.

1253
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:48,320


1254
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:48,320


1255
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:48,320


1256
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:48,320


1257
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:48,320


1258
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:48,320


1259
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:48,320


1260
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:48,320


1261
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:48,320


1262
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:48,320


1263
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:48,320


1264
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:48,320


1265
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:48,320


1266
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:52,300
He was the first YMCA in San Francisco there.

1267
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,080
He used to teach, uh, the younger men, uh, some very, very strange physical movements,

1268
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:57,880
which he called yoga.

1269
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:03,720
And he used to also, uh, propel that, uh, chair around, uh, with, uh, some of their

1270
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,880
hair follicles and, and the pieces of, uh, skin that they'd used.

1271
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:08,680
Uh, I think...

1272
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,220
Sorry, in plastic.

1273
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,600
Oh, no, no, no.

1274
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:13,480
It's, it's, it's not the kind of story you want to tell your dad, see?

1275
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,980
Look over there, over there.

1276
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,200
Yeah, in the pasture there.

1277
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,220
See that cow?

1278
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,420
Yeah, that cow's got nothing to do but eat lots of milk all day.

1279
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:20,660
Yeah.

1280
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,260
Oh, that's sluggy.

1281
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:21,900
And chew on its own fud.

1282
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:22,260
Mm-hmm.

1283
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,200
Yeah, he don't worry about no war, no Hitler, no Taojaus.

1284
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,320
No, he's, he's content to eat that meadow grass and dream on.

1285
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,740
And someday, somebody's gonna come up and clip it on those breasts and...

1286
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,000
Slug.

1287
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,980
Just, just take all the milk out of him.

1288
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:34,380
Slug.

1289
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,080
Yeah, and he's, he's gonna cry.

1290
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:36,800
Slug.

1291
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,120
He's gonna cry, see, like a little baby.

1292
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:38,460
Slug.

1293
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,340
But I won't care because I'll be in the U.S. Army doing the depot work.

1294
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,440
I'll be standing up and, and passing out sandwiches, see, for all the other kids in the U.S.O.

1295
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,020
Standing up, passing out.

1296
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:47,540
Yeah.

1297
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,500
He's, he's passing out, right?

1298
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,100
He's passing out.

1299
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:50,320
J.R.

1300
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:50,320


1301
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:50,560
Bob Dobbs.

1302
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:50,940
J.R.

1303
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:55,180
Bob Dobbs was on the number one list of frauds and phonies for Time Magazine.

1304
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:55,460
Exactly.

1305
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,540
And I didn't know who he was.

1306
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:56,940
Exactly.

1307
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:57,640
And J.R.

1308
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,900
Bob Dobbs is the creator of the Church of the Subgenius.

1309
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,940
This guy, the Reverend Ivan Stang, is, is one of their...

1310
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:05,420
Disciples.

1311
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:06,420
Disciples.

1312
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,260
Disclipples.

1313
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,100
Yeah.

1314
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:08,880
All right.

1315
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,560
You know, it's funny.

1316
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,220
I don't think Jesus had a, a disciple named Dopey.

1317
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,300
Oh, but you are so wrong, Pinkboy.

1318
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:15,420
Pinkboy.

1319
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:15,420


1320
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,740
Jesus did in fact have three disciples named Dopey.

1321
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,080
And one named Grumpy.

1322
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,920
And one named Sneezy.

1323
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,520
Yes, and here comes Grumpy.

1324
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,700
And he's well named, too.

1325
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And better watch out for Sneezy or everything you know will be blown away.

1326
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:35,680
Shallow Pinkboy.

1327
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,360
Uh-oh.

1328
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:43,580
The most frozen and fearful of all the little dwarves, Shallow.

1329
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,420
Shallow can hardly get up.

1330
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,420


1331
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,420


1332
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,420


1333
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,420


1334
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,420


1335
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,420


1336
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,420


1337
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,420


1338
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,420


1339
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,420


1340
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,420


1341
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,420


1342
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,420


1343
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,420


1344
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:45,420


1345
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,100
I'm going to keep her together to do his whatever it is he, she, it is doing.

1346
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,080
It's...

1347
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,460
What, what is it doing?

1348
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,400
It's, it's making a chain of flowers.

1349
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,120
No, it's meditating.

1350
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:56,880
A way, a flower.

1351
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,180
Look, it's, no, it's not making, it's, it's making the flowers, but it's meditating on

1352
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,400
higher purple.

1353
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,420
The, the elastic thing I'm, what is that?

1354
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,100
It's thinking of new ways to kill.

1355
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:07,400
It's a art of clothing.

1356
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:07,400


1357
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:07,660
Ah.

1358
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:13,000
It's, it's one of the spandex t-t-t-t-t-t used to kill its victims.

1359
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,420
Slack takes many forms.

1360
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:21,200
My friend, killing is one, dying is yet another for some who pray to die.

1361
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:22,800
Others pray to kill.

1362
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,440
Which are you, my friend?

1363
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:34,320
Why don't you come into the bosom of Bab and, or Connie, who has actually a better bosom.

1364
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,120
Yes, a triple E bosom.

1365
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:45,300
And learn all that you can know about the forbidden sciences and about occult incantations.

1366
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:50,660
That can lead you to mastery and power over your own wallet and your own personal guardian

1367
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:50,920
demon.

1368
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,360
I wind the wand or the signet three times.

1369
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,860
Take the alabaster pepperoni and put it near your nostrils.

1370
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:04,100
The third nostril will expand and the magic door is not so magic anymore.

1371
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,800
Power and slack, I tell you.

1372
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,340
Beyond your wildest imaginings.

1373
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:10,620
Yeah.

1374
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,680
It is straight up power.

1375
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,280
Slack, it is called by way of power.

1376
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:15,280


1377
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:15,480
I have heard of people.

1378
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,320
We have yearned for slack for so many years.

1379
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,580
The name we use is slug.

1380
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,500
That sounds crude and simple to your people, I am sure.

1381
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:32,220
But one of these days we will master slug and climb from the slimy pits near the river

1382
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,120
where we have been banged.

1383
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,520
And we shall...

1384
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:37,880
What are we going to do?

1385
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,020
Look, there is the slack.

1386
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:42,000
Now climbing up the banks of the slimy river.

1387
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:42,240
I see it.

1388
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:42,280
I see it.

1389
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,220
Yes, it's...

1390
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,380
It's slipping down on the body.

1391
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:45,020
Harking and...

1392
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:45,060
It's slidding down on the body.

1393
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:45,260
It's slidding down on the body.

1394
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:45,260


1395
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:45,260


1396
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:45,260


1397
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:45,260


1398
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,200
It's slidding down on the body.

1399
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:46,680
That's the slack.

1400
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:46,840
How is this slack?

1401
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:46,840


1402
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,420
It is frat.

1403
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:47,980
You are asking me for slack.

1404
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,380
Look at that slack.

1405
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,520
Look at that slack hulking.

1406
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,580
That is majesticly looming.

1407
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,300
It is the grandest and greatest.

1408
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:58,520
No.

1409
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,020
No.

1410
00:49:59,060 --> 00:49:59,460
No.

1411
00:49:59,460 --> 00:49:59,720
No.

1412
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,080
Stay back.

1413
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:00,440
No.

1414
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:00,840
No.

1415
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:01,020
No.

1416
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:01,440
Ahhhh!!!

1417
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,500
Friends, you have been listening to the Subgenius

1418
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,900
radio ministry hour of Slack.

1419
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:15,260
If you want more information about the Church of the Slug, see the link below.

1420
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:15,260


1421
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:20,560
Subgenius, check our website, www.subgenius.com.

1422
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,440
By the way, Subgenius does not have an O in it.

1423
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,620
Although if you use one, you'll still get there.

1424
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,640
By magic.

1425
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,560
Yes, magic.

1426
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,620
I didn't want that.

1427
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,960
I didn't want an evil book.

1428
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,860
I don't want to.

1429
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,200
Even a man who is pure at heart

1430
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,300
and thinks he has his slack.

1431
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:47,340
Yet if he eats those pickles too soon,

1432
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,520
we'll have pimples on his back.

1433
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,280
They're pimples on their brains, aren't they?

1434
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,160
Pimples and milk.

1435
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,640
Good old pimples and milk.

1436
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,920
And pimples.

1437
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:05,280
Mmm.

1438
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,960
If you don't eat,

1439
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,140
your meat,

1440
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,440
you can't have any pudding.

1441
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,840
How can you have pudding

1442
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:27,260
if you don't eat your meat?

1443
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,820
There is so much to see

1444
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,400
and though there is so far for men to go,

1445
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,100
it's good to travel wide

1446
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:40,400
and then it's good to come back home again.

1447
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:43,380
MMm.

1448
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,680
Little toy.

1449
00:51:51,040 --> 00:52:00,020
Oh, it's just an outstanding Zhi Jun Yang

1450
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:00,500
and a little coda!

1451
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,860
The moon.

1452
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:03,940
Bjudji.

1453
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:04,440


1454
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:04,440


1455
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:04,760
This path is like the

1456
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:11,960
Secretary of Health's gonna kill me!

1457
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,220
I'll bless you, my friend.

1458
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,340
But he will talk again, he'll...

1459
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,200
You cursed rat!

1460
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,300
Look what you've done!

1461
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,580
I'm melting!

1462
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:40,860
Melting!

1463
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,620
Oh, my world, my world!

1464
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,260
Who would have thought I could love her like you

1465
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:49,720
for destroying my beautiful wickedness?

1466
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,340
Ah! The boat!

1467
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,520
The boat!

1468
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,060
I'm going home!

1469
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,180
Home!

1470
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,240
GIFT

1471
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:06,780
GIFT

1472
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,800
Destroy

1473
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:14,260
Long call, babe. Don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

1474
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:15,480
PHONE RINGS

1475
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:18,940
Are you a voyeur? Do you like to watch?

1476
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,620
Uh-huh.

1477
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,040
What's your name?

1478
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,000
Bob.

1479
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:23,940
Hi, Bob.

1480
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:24,920
How's it going?

1481
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:25,720
What can I do with it, Bob?

1482
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,940
Tell me. Tell me how you are.

1483
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,800
If I came in your room right now, what would you do?

1484
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:31,920
I don't know.

1485
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:32,620
I don't know.

1486
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,680
I don't know.

1487
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:34,920
I don't know.

1488
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:35,700
I don't know.

1489
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,180
I don't know.

1490
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:39,160
I don't know.

1491
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:39,180


1492
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:39,180


1493
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:55,700
Friends, I should mention once again, the music, well, a lot of the stuff in the background were collages by Fernanda Nde-Limer, Artemio Salina, I don't know, New Monet, the whole gang of idiots there in alt-binary slack.

1494
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:04,460
But this chopped-up music, the broken music in the background is once again from a band or something called People Like Us.

1495
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,100
Actually, Vicki Bennett in England.

1496
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,560
And you can download the whole album from www.vicki.bennett.com.

1497
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,500
www.ubu.com.

1498
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:16,780
That's www.ubu.com.

1499
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:23,600
And her previous albums are on her main website, www.peopellikeus.org.

1500
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:35,560
Like the subgeniuses, she apparently has found commercial, dealing with record companies to be too much trouble for the money.

1501
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,180
And I guess is sort of self-distributing her material.

1502
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:53,500
If you can get by cheap, you actually make more giving your stuff away in some cases than you do working with the conspiracy.

1503
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:56,200
Believe it or not.

1504
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,680
That's the way it's worked for me so far, my friends.

1505
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,320
Over there at www.subgenius.com.

1506
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,560
Thank you for listening.

1507
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,020
Stay tuned for the upcoming.

1508
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:09,580
Oh.

1509
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:10,560
Oh.

1510
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,660
Oh.

1511
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,000
Oh.

1512
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:24,840


1513
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:28,760
Oh.

1514
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,680
Oh Oh.

1515
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:31,880
Oh.

1516
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,160
Oh.

1517
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:34,160


1518
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:34,160


1519
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:34,160


1520
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:34,160


1521
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,020
Oh.

1522
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,360
.

1523
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,320
Oh my.

1524
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:40,480


1525
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:40,560
Thats what I want.

1526
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:40,560


1527
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:40,560

00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:40,560

But the other big carnivores are gone.

1568
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,140
That's exactly why I've decided to set the trap myself.

1569
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,520
Captain, look!

1570
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,980
Bye-bye, Fernanda Nende.

1571
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,060
Leemore.

1572
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:25,300
When you leave this room, the effect will continue.

1573
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:28,900
Inside of your own mind.

1574
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,920
Inside of your own skull.

1575
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:39,060
This concludes operations under the emergency hour of slack system.

1576
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,480
All broadcast stations may resume normal operations.

1577
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,080
Do you understand now?

1578
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,460
It was only a joke.

1579
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,280
Now I know how funny it is.
