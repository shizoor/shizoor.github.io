1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,940
The Self-Genius Power of Splat

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,600
Nothing is real

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:27,360
Before we do anything else, first, a song by Reverend Dr. Morgan Gutentag.

4
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,240
This is not a religion.

5
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,800
This is not a religion.

6
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,440
This is a fun-time joke.

7
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,500
Please don't turn this into something serious.

8
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,080
Again, this is not a religion.

9
00:00:59,460 --> 00:00:59,980
Again, this is not a religion.

10
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,180
Start your own religion.

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,180
You can make it whatever you want.

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,900
But this is not a religion.

13
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,280
Please don't ruin this for me.

14
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,980
This is not a religion.

15
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


16
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,740
Sure, there are some great takeaways that you can add to your own worldview.

17
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,680
But this is not a religion.

18
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,580
This is not a religion.

19
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,980
This is not a religion.

20
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


21
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,920
This is not a religion.

22
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,680
This is not a religion.

23
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,060
A timely song by Morgan Gutentag.

24
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,520
Though I think I may have written the main lyric recently.

25
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,960
Princess, we and I have realized that it is our duty to do what we love.

26
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


27
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


28
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


29
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


30
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,620
that we're going to be in Texas for so much longer that I'm going to run out of reruns and we have to

31
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:45,600
do an hour of slack live from Stang Ranch. And I don't know if this will be the first part of that.

32
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:52,800
I guess so. There's other ones that sound like a better first part and maybe we should cut to those.

33
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:19,700
Demmit, what's going on there boy? Must not be too bad because he came back. I hope he didn't get bitten.

34
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,060
Scares me now all the time. Well the other dog, I could hear the other dogs down the hill barking, the sheep dogs.

35
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,440
Did you hear them? Yes, now I do.

36
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,940
I think this is just a dog.

37
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,080
It's just something they do every day.

38
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,360
Hi Ralph. Hi Ed.

39
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,080
Hi Ralph. See ya Ed.

40
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,040
What he said at hour of slack live from Stang Ranch.

41
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,860
Oh boy. He said his piece.

42
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,480
Well we found another skeleton.

43
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,520
Princess Wee and I were interrupted in an

44
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:08,000
archaeological discovery. This is the fourth well-preserved skeleton we found out here.

45
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:16,120
We found skulls. There's a cyclops skull real close to the house that's amazing.

46
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,580
But there's nothing else to go with it. It's so huge.

47
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:29,180
There's a devil skeleton up by where the gate's down and over near the...

48
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,780
the concourse there's an alien skeleton, a grey.

49
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,220
And there's a... where is that cave subgenius?

50
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,080
He's right up here too in the same area.

51
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,140
We found a...

52
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,000
I guess another cave subgenius.

53
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,320
It's got a... it doesn't have a complete pipe but it has a partial pipe.

54
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:59,160
So for all we know it could be a cigar making this a cave rich guy.

55
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,920
But so we don't know if this is a cave subgenius,

56
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,800
cave rich guy, why not both? His heart strangely

57
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,680
enough has also been fossilized. That is definitely a heart.

58
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,120
And he's bandy-legged as all

59
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,040
of these prehistoric fellows are. In short,

60
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,880
they're probably not more than about four feet tall.

61
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,020
Like Lucy, the famous Australopithecus. And these I would say

62
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,620
date...

63
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,360
The alien may be more recent.

64
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,060
The devil is

65
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,160
probably from the Cretaceous.

66
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,580
I think that

67
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,920
that was the devil skeleton

68
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,480
is the fossil of something that

69
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,960
tormented dinosaurs.

70
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,980
The cave subgenius, well

71
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,840
they're not really that different

72
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,000
from those of today.

73
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,220
It's probably not that old.

74
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,180
Not more than

75
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,060
well, pre-Neanderthal

76
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,460
but post-Australopithecus.

77
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,140
Now technically

78
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,360
this could be

79
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,280
what we called Homo connectus

80
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,160
which was the very earliest

81
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,140
devolved

82
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,080
primate. Well not

83
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,160
devolved, it was a natural primate

84
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,900
that was force evolved

85
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,680
by the Exists

86
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,980
into the mighty

87
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,520
Yeti.

88
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,840
So this may be...

89
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,980
We may have two Homo connectuses. You know that

90
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,140
never occurred to me. The only way

91
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,520
to tell would be carbon dating

92
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,900
because these, as far as I know, would be the

93
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,560
only two skeletons discovered.

94
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,120
Judging by the proximal

95
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,040
difference between the

96
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,220
junk, the bones of the junk

97
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,880
and the skull, I would

98
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,500
say this is a

99
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,040
Yeti. The junk bone?

100
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,400
A Yeti?

101
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,460
Well it would be an infant.

102
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,120
It would be like that Cyclops skull

103
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,240
we found. Yes, an infant Utensin.

104
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,800
We thought it was so huge and then we realized

105
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,860
oh my god, this is a fetus.

106
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,040
This is a fetus Cyclops skull.

107
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,640
It was like the size of an elephant.

108
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,940
Elephant skulls used to be

109
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,680
mistaken for Cyclops skulls.

110
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,720
Or Mastodon skulls.

111
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,700
You know, that kind of thing.

112
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,420
Okay, well,

113
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,480
we need to photograph it

114
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,620
with the rulers and all that stuff

115
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,760
and notify Dr. Baugh

116
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,640
over at the Creationist Museum that we've got

117
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,700
another million dollar specimen for him.

118
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,980
We are going to either open our own

119
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,100
roadside attraction

120
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,500
and put that guy out of business

121
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,360
with his Creationist Museum

122
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,820
down the road, or

123
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,100
we'll make a million dollars per

124
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,840
skeleton when he buys them from us.

125
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,600
Or kill me.

126
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,020
Don't say that. This is

127
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,860
Texas, man. Oh, that's right.

128
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,320
Yeah.

129
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,220
We take that serious around here.

130
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,520
Oh, I have to get out of this sun.

131
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,160
Well, I'd hate to let you down, partner.

132
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,640
I was going to say something bad about you, but

133
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,880
I couldn't think of anything.

134
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,180
So I wasn't going to outright kill you

135
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,040
until you invited me to and I'd hate

136
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,940
to turn down an invitation.

137
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,040
Hmm.

138
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,000
Damn. We did it.

139
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,120
The Homo Connectus.

140
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,240
The prehistoric

141
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,020
Ur-Proto

142
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,120
subgenius.

143
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,000
Wow.

144
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,440
It's quite exciting.

145
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:14,960
Hmm.

146
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,960
Oh, the camera. The pictures. That's right.

147
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,340
I was getting kind of turned on.

148
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,540
Do you think this was a female?

149
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,720
It doesn't have the peen bun like the other one.

150
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,020
The other one had a very distinct

151
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,060
little peen bun. This one has

152
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,340
ear bones, which we've never

153
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,800
seen before in any of the

154
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,440
fossil skeletons here.

155
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,120
I'd say it's a good guess it's a female.

156
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,720
It does have the wider

157
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,980
pelvis. Hmm.

158
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,160
And the more intelligent

159
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,660
look to its skull.

160
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,860
A little bit less

161
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,140
brutish. Yes.

162
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,980
It's not as large, but

163
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,060
and it

164
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,560
doesn't have that

165
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,340
gigantic

166
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,200
spike coming out of its

167
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,320
knees that the males

168
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,460
have for some sort of ritual

169
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,280
display. It couldn't have been comfortable.

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,600
No.

171
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,040
Where you find one long bone,

172
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,340
you're gonna find there's gotta be a mommy

173
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,160
and daddy long bone and probably

174
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,820
baby long bones. You were right.

175
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,160
And sure enough,

176
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,360
we found a mommy and a daddy Homo

177
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,020
Connectus.

178
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,040
Unless these are

179
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,340
skeletons of fetuses.

180
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,640
It's like that humongous cyclops skull.

181
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,040
Hmm.

182
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,520
The sun has been kind

183
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,220
to her fossilized bones

184
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,240
and given her that kind of rosy

185
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,460
hue on the edges

186
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,400
of her cheeks. It's quite

187
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,880
flattering.

188
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,320
Yeah, it's hard to spot

189
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,460
these skeletons amidst this

190
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,860
rocky terrain, but

191
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,580
the trained

192
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,400
eye can

193
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,160
ferret out what is

194
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,080
bone and what's just a

195
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,860
you know, interestingly

196
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,760
eroded rock.

197
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,960
Well, okay.

198
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,200
Skip to work.

199
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,280
Excavating.

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,500
Tape your stomachs in.

201
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,860
God, you can't

202
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,480
see.

203
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,220
See, Dristan tablets shrink swollen,

204
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,560
congested nasal and sinus passages.

205
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,460
It was caused by public life.

206
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,960
I have always tried

207
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,480
to do what was best for the nation.

208
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,440
But the interests of the nation must

209
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,240
always come before any personal

210
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,080
considerations. Therefore,

211
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,740
I shall resign

212
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,540
the presidency effective at noon

213
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:48,820
tonight.

214
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,600
Vice President Ford

215
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,120
will be sworn in as president

216
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,660
of that office.

217
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,720
END OF ORDER

218
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,400
Fair share of photos

219
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,640
of some people

220
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:01,700
staring at them

221
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:01,700


222
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:01,700


223
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,040
die

224
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,540
z av

225
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,540
Euros

226
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:26,540


227
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:32,960
Cause precious and few are the moments we two can share

228
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,260
Baby, it's you on my mind

229
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,820
Your love is so rare

230
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,280
Being with you is a feeling I just can't compare

231
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,000
If I can't hold you in my arms

232
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,580
Can't hold you

233
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,620
Oh, it just wouldn't be fair

234
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,880
Wouldn't be fair

235
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:12,180
If precious and few are the moments we two can share

236
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,680
And if I can't find my way back home

237
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,840
Can't find my way

238
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,500
Oh, it just wouldn't be fair

239
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,700
Wouldn't be fair

240
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:39,120
Cause precious and few are the moments we two can share

241
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,200
Precious and few are the moments we two can share

242
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,060
Precious and few are the moments we two can share

243
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,320
Oh, oh, oh

244
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,580
Quiet and blue like the sky, I'm hung over you

245
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:06,960
And if I can't find my way back home, my pretty baby

246
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,300
We're taking a little break right now, let me come back

247
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,420
Oh, that just wouldn't be fair

248
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,780
Wouldn't be fair

249
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:17,800
And it's precious if you are the moments we two can share

250
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,680
Precious if you are the moments we two can share

251
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,560
That lovely cover was by the Rudy Schwartz Project

252
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,500
from the brand new album called Sunshine Supers

253
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:47,780
Here's to you, Rudy!

254
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,740
I think that's how you pronounce it

255
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,120
It's kind of weird because Supers Hits is spelled as one word

256
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,800
Okay, back to our location recordings

257
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,380
Okay, we're driving down the driveway

258
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,540
of the 9th Megafist Temple Lodge

259
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,180
of the Church of the Subgenius

260
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,000
the Texas Lodge

261
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,500
and the driveway we measured

262
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,380
is one half a mile long

263
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,020
However, it is made of dirt and gravel

264
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,780
It's not lined with statues of famous subgeniuses yet

265
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,620
and it doesn't have a Bob Colossus

266
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,180
straddling the gate

267
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,080
where you turn off the highway yet

268
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,420
We don't even have the life-size

269
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,240
blue concrete gorilla yet

270
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,480
But we know that the Subgenius is a great idea for us to see

271
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,140
We know where to get it

272
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:56,340
We may have to start with the midget Yeti of concrete

273
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,220
Oh, the Yeti

274
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,240
We know where to get that

275
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,300
They're only about a hundred bucks

276
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,740
Wonderful Yeti sculpture

277
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,960
Yeah, but we'd have to drive to Waco for that

278
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,640
That's true

279
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,300
So here on Stang Ranch

280
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,260
it has rained

281
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,480
which is a really unusual thing

282
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,640
It has rained mightily!

283
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,540
Yeah, and it looks like Cleveland

284
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,160
because the sky is all gray and it's drizzly

285
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,680
But we're going into town to go to the post office

286
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,440
visit our post office buddies

287
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,460
and they drop off the hour of slack

288
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,780
discs that are mailed to stations

289
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,640
and individual subscribers

290
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,900
Good Lord, what's normally a desert is a swamp

291
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,340
We're passing a wetland that's like

292
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,100
yeah, it's worse than a marsh

293
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,220
It doesn't have anywhere to go

294
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,760
as it was pointed out to us

295
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,160
It's rock right underneath the soil

296
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,680
and it's been dry for so long

297
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,360
Yep, this is a ranch

298
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,080
a working ranch where my brother raises goats

299
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,980
and rocks

300
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,460
Well, the rocks just grow

301
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,640
and cactus

302
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,240
But boy, if you like rocks

303
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,240
this is a great place to be

304
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,180
And birds!

305
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,760
Yeah, actually it's very birdy

306
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,180
We were recently a little disappointed to realize

307
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,640
that what we had been thinking of as noble hawks

308
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,440
were in fact ignoble buzzards

309
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,140
of turkey vultures

310
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,540
Vultures!

311
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,720
But they look beautiful soaring up in the sky

312
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,840
and they're always there

313
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,240
Jays!

314
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,400
Were you going to point out my sister's gnomes?

315
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,840
Uh, Jays! There are gnomes

316
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,660
in the sister yard

317
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,040
Gnomes

318
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,980
Gnome saying?

319
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,620
You know what you're saying

320
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,760
Yeah, we're just now getting to the end of the gate

321
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,280
Luckily it's not flooded

322
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,040
But there may be foam

323
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,620
And we're running into town also

324
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:09,000
not just to send hours of slack out

325
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,580
and membership packs and things

326
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,600
but to look at the river

327
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,500
In fact, that's where we ought to go first

328
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,660
is just go straight to the

329
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,540
to Big Rocks Park

330
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:25,040
Big Rocks Park in town is a beautiful park

331
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,240
But guess what?

332
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,560
We just discovered

333
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,060
about five days ago

334
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,100
that we have on Stang property

335
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,260
an equivalent hidden secret park

336
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,260
The Little Big Rocks Secret National Park

337
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,700
I think that pickup truck is still humping that old Corvette

338
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,580
It's the funniest thing

339
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,860
It's like an auto parts place

340
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,880
By the road, as an attention getter

341
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,200
they have a pickup monster truck

342
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,980
crushing the front of a

343
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,860
I'll call it a Corvette

344
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,700
A small white car

345
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:06,640
Yeah

346
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,540
Probably the car was already crushed

347
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,260
and the monster truck is blameless

348
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,840
But it looks like it's kind of mounting

349
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,940
the smaller car

350
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,640
It does

351
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,900
We're not that far from town

352
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,580
Once you get off of the driveway

353
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,580
one starts seeing businesses

354
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,580
and little houses of our subjects

355
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,420
These are where our subjects live

356
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,100
We live in the big house up on the hill

357
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,220
and all the townsfolk and the peasants

358
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,560
live down here

359
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,520
We, unlike many of us

360
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,060
many of our peers

361
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,720
of whom there are none

362
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,860
don't send servants to do our shopping

363
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,100
We actually go to the grocery stores

364
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,180
along with the regular humans

365
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,840
and we buy our own groceries there

366
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,760
among the hoi polloi

367
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,060
This little quote city unquote

368
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,680
is made of local stone mostly

369
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,500
It has a classic little Texas

370
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,920
and a county courthouse

371
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,260
A lot of the buildings are made of petrified wood

372
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,100
and they're very westerny looking

373
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,900
You know, they're really going for that general

374
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,780
western look that the town inherited

375
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,800
because, well, it is the west

376
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,940
It's west of Fort Worth

377
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,720
and Fort Worth is where the west begins

378
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,540
So this is pretty darn western

379
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,060
I mean, rattlesnake roundups, come on

380
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,800
We don't have those in Cleveland

381
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,400
Although I suppose we could have small

382
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,960
water moccasin roundups

383
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,080
Cottonmouth roundups

384
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,760
Probably don't have quite as many people up north

385
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,920
that hunt snakes as they do around here

386
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,120
I wouldn't be so sure

387
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,660
Out in rural Ohio is not that different from rural Texas

388
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,300
Except where there's Amish

389
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,180
I don't think we have nearly as many Amish

390
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,820
We have our own strange

391
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,620
version

392
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,520
Yeah

393
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,660
Texan version

394
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,260
Yeah

395
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,720
I can't remember their names right now

396
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,200
Sub-something

397
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,160
Sub-Mentat

398
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,420
Mennonite

399
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,200
Yeah, Mennonites, that's it

400
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,280
The Sub-Mennonites

401
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,260
They worship somebody named Smith

402
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,340
Joe Smith

403
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,600
No, that's the Mormons

404
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,460
The Mennonites just worship Jehovah One

405
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,440
Sub-Mennonites worship Jehovah One

406
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,020
But they're really fundamentalists

407
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,760
They don't think you should smoke a pipe

408
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,100
unless you're Bob

409
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,980
And you shouldn't get a haircut unless you're Bob

410
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,080
You shouldn't wear clothing unless you're Bob

411
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,920
So the Sub-Mennonite sect is

412
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,280
They pretty much have to stay in the woods

413
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,300
all the time

414
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,620
They're super fundamentalists

415
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,760
They want to be like yetis

416
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,000
and succeed somewhat

417
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,840
You know, they want to be closer to the yeti

418
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,180
and they send their women out into the woods

419
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,400
hopefully to be seduced by yetis

420
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,740
or vice versa, really

421
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,120
What the heck would a yeti want to have to do with a

422
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,680
horrible, hairless, humanoid woman sub-thing

423
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,680
Right

424
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,120
True

425
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,700
So, that usually doesn't work

426
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,760
but the rest of us sub-geniuses

427
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,740
have to admire the fact that they're not

428
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,320
They're tenacious stubbornness

429
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,840
and clinging to the old ways

430
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,760
The old ways are best, they say

431
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,260
Mm-hmm

432
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,600
Yeah, they're against technology

433
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,760
and they only use really old classic Macs

434
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,900
from 1984

435
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,040
and dial-up modems

436
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,180
They insist

437
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,720
I know it's funny, but they

438
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,000
You know, to them, that's the way

439
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,200
They're going to be around after the zombie apocalypse

440
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,740
You know, they're going to be ready

441
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,600
Readier than anybody else

442
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,660
the sub-Mennonites

443
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,680
Sub-men, they call them

444
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,000
Sub-men

445
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,900
Yeah, everybody around Walnut Springs

446
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,740
where the sub-Mennonites live

447
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,560
I see

448
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,480
Remember my brother said that life is cheap in Walnut Springs

449
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,520
Yes

450
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,380
Like in other horrible places

451
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,080
like Detroit and Chicago

452
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,440
He kindly left out Cleveland

453
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,180
because, you know, they wake up in the morning

454
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,240
and they look around at their town, Walnut Springs

455
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,640
and they go, well, I might as well be dead

456
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,140
This would be just the same

457
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,020
Probably be an improvement on being alive

458
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,240
in this piece of crap town

459
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,780
Since that rich man up on the hill

460
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,980
Bobby Hill owns everything

461
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,480
If only somebody would rise up against Bobby Hill

462
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,260
If only some slightly less rich, rich man

463
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,520
It would be best if it was a sub-Mennonite like me

464
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,180
but maybe even a sellout sub-genius is

465
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,980
maybe one of them could do it

466
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,280
They got money

467
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,760
Well, they got more money than me anyway

468
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
They'd go after that Bobby Hill

469
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,140
If the sub-Mennonites could command Bobby Hill's land

470
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,420
we'd control the corridor between

471
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,080
Texas State Highway 144 and 67

472
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,520
We'd be like gods, warriors

473
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,860
Warrior-God kings in the zombie apocalypse

474
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,480
Yeah, that's something to think about

475
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,560
Something to think about indeed

476
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,600
Yep

477
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,720
The rich man just admitted his sin

478
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,540
He said, yeah, два smoke

479
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,520
Let's end this

480
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:26,120
The poor old man said, yeah, well, who's 본

481
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,120


482
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:33,460
But in reality there's nothing more

483
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,640
Thank you.

484
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,160
Thank you.

485
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:41,940
Thank you.

486
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,040
Thank you.

487
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,040


488
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,560
Thank you.

489
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,140
Thank you.

490
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,380
Thank you.

491
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,000
Thank you.

492
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,820
Thank you.

493
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:01,940
Thank you.

494
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:11,660
Another amazing original brand new tune from the Psychoskeletons, which one subgenius band, can be found on

495
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,480
ThePsychoskeletons.com

496
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:28,060
But meanwhile, we will continue as if we know what we're doing, making a radio show in the middle of a forest.

497
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:36,760
Which we are in, even though our house is just a few hundred yards behind us, you can't see it.

498
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,060
And we could keep walking for a long way in this forest.

499
00:26:41,940 --> 00:27:00,540
Princess Wee was a little nervous about coming down in here today because on Easter Eve, when we were starting to hide eggs at night, just helping the Easter Bunny, you understand, when the kids went to bed, the grandkids, we found a snake in the yard.

500
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:08,340
Actually, damn it, Pappy's old hound dog found that snake and probably saved our fool lives.

501
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,540
Because it was a copperhead.

502
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,700
Very, very deadly poisonous monster.

503
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:19,620
And I, being the man of the house, hey, this isn't our trail.

504
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:19,880
No.

505
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
We're following dammit.

506
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,920
We're just wandering, following dammit.

507
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,560
Well, that's okay.

508
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,060
It doesn't matter.

509
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,040
We'll come to one of the obvious trails soon enough.

510
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,980
But we do have to watch out for snakes.

511
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:35,200
We did learn that that's, I've never seen one in all the years I've been coming out here.

512
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:41,920
But once I saw that thing, I realized I was going to have to put my expertise, learning, and my skills, into this.

513
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:41,920


514
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,540
And I learned from the video game called Monster Hunter into play.

515
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,600
And I did.

516
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,080
I beat him to death with a shovel and then chopped his head off with a machete.

517
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,300
Neither of which was in any way easy or fun.

518
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,620
You gotta do that head kill.

519
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,040
God, he's still moving.

520
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:01,860
He is.

521
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Okay, I think he is officially in pieces.

522
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,180
Damn.

523
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,100
That's a brand new machete.

524
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,920
He's dead.

525
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,580
Oh, he's dead.

526
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,560
No, his head's moving.

527
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,500
Yeah, I saw his tongue coming out.

528
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,660
He just lifted his head out.

529
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,940
Now you can really chop it.

530
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,300
This is so gross.

531
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,080
Jesus Christ!

532
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,880
It's still attached.

533
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,880
He's been totally smashed.

534
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,260
Oh, God.

535
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,680
It was really gross.

536
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:44,500
And I wouldn't have done it except that that's what you do with venomous snakes in your yard.

537
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,180
When you're going to have an egg hunt.

538
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,380
Especially when you're going to have an egg hunt.

539
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,020
And especially when you yourself are wanting to go around there at night.

540
00:28:52,100 --> 00:29:05,260
Anyway, that was another welcome to Texas moment, as was, I think on the same day, Princess Wee fired a handgun for the first time and discovered that it was kind of fun.

541
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,800
I didn't like finding that out, but I did find that out.

542
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,260
Hey, that shell hit my belly button.

543
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,080
I was going for the heart that time.

544
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,920
He's still coming.

545
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,080
That's kind of addictive.

546
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,080
I can see why people like doing that.

547
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,340
Sort of addictive.

548
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,100
Yeah.

549
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,540
So we're going to learn.

550
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:35,240
I'm going to relearn my gun safety and she'll learn gun safety for the first time.

551
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,000
My brother is the best possible teacher.

552
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,320
He's stillского by basta.

553
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:23,320


554
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:23,420
Oh, wow.

555
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:23,540
I love this teamunion.

556
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:23,540


557
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:23,560
Well, thanks for being here.

558
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:23,580


559
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:23,820
We'll see you next time.

560
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:23,820


561
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:23,860
I pretty much definitely.

562
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:23,860


563
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:23,860


564
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,020
You.

565
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:28,600
I gotta go drive Ric.

566
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:28,600


567
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,920
Jimmy Ryan did that and all the music in the background for these credits.

568
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,360
We've played music by the Flyin' Ryan Brothers for years on this show, and we will again.

569
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:54,280
But that was Jimmy Ryan's solo on the first of 37 instrumental needle drops, if you will, that he sent us for free.

570
00:30:54,280 --> 00:31:01,140
Although if I understand right, anybody can lease this music for industrial or commercial uses.

571
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,020
Smart.

572
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,580
But now, a dialogue with a billy goat.

573
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,720
That little waggy tail.

574
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,080
You butted my knee, goat.

575
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,480
That's why you're in that cage, buddy.

576
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,680
Big fish.

577
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,000
Wish I could scratch my groin with the end of my horn.

578
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,640
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

579
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,340
Baa.

580
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,360
What's that goat? That goat has a name. I can't remember it.

581
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:00,920
Baa.

582
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,400
I can't tell if it's a goat or you, by the way.

583
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,380
He's wondering if he can eat that recorder.

584
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,160
I'm sure he could.

585
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,960
Goats eat anything. They eat cans.

586
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,120
Oh, it's all frisky now.

587
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:18,820
Baa.

588
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,300
Baa.

589
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:22,920
Baa.

590
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,820
Baa.

591
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,080
So you're a goat whisperer.

592
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,700
Yeah. You didn't know that?

593
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,880
Or a goat bear.

594
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,180
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

595
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,820
Baa.

596
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,980
Louie, Louie.

597
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,180
Was she a girl or a goat woman?

598
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,400
Oh yeah.

599
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,820
Louie, Louie.

600
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,980
Are you a girl or a goat woman?

601
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,100
Those little pellets, when I saw them, I knew.

602
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,040
that my heart belonged to her.

603
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:43,360
I rode my bike past your window last night.

604
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,680
I roller skated to your door at daylight.

605
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,260
I rode my bike past your window last night.

606
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,980
It almost seems like you're avoiding me.

607
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,960
I'm okay alone, but you got something I need.

608
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:08,500
Well, I got a brand new pair of roller skates.

609
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,300
You got a brand new key.

610
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,980
I think that we should get together and try them out to see.

611
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,340
I've been looking around and, well, you got something for me.

612
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,240
Oh, I got...

613
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,460
You got a brand new pair of roller skates.

614
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,340
You got a brand new...

615
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:34,360
I ride my bike, I roller skate, don't drive no car.

616
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,940
Don't go too fast, but I go pretty far.

617
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:46,140
For somebody who don't drive, I've been all around the world.

618
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,100
Some people say I done all right for a girl.

619
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,680
I tell the world I gotta play drunk.

620
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,380
Can't stop thinking baby I can get a break.

621
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,040
I do know what you want, mother,

622
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,500
Say you gotta watch your riderети.

623
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,360
Make your laws, you got some rules set,

624
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,380
Get your car, you got no right to change.

625
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:13,380


626
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:13,440
It's right when thedogs don't like theưới

627
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,280
She said yes,

628
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,000
but you weren't alone.

629
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,000
Oh, sometimes

630
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,500
I think

631
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,880
that you're

632
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,880
You're avoiding me

633
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,980
I'm okay alone

634
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,080
But you got something I need

635
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,760
Well

636
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,780
I got a paragraph

637
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,740
Why do you keep calling me?

638
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,560
I got a question

639
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,280
What the fuck are you trying to do?

640
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,980
I got a paragraph

641
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,420
Why are you doing this?

642
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,660
I got a paragraph

643
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,160
Why can't you just leave me alone?

644
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,080
I got a paragraph

645
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,600
Why can't you just leave me alone?

646
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,860
I got a paragraph

647
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,280
The Rudy Schwartz Project

648
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,180
Brand New Key

649
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,800
From the new CD

650
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:32,900
called Sunshine Supers Hits. We're making our way down this rugged rocky ground. It

651
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,540
really is made of rocks and the rocks are made of shells, ancient shells. And

652
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:44,280
look there is our cairn that denotes I think clearing number two. So clearing

653
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,440
number one has two cairns and clearing number two has one cairn. Right this is

654
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,540
clearing number two. I can see Dammit down there. See his tail. He's already heading down to

655
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,300
Ali Baba's Grotto. But we don't have to go that way. I was thinking we could walk

656
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:06,860
along the cliffside slope trail. We've been naming landmarks around here just

657
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,940
to help us be able to tell each other where we're going to meet up or go. Some

658
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:17,840
landmarks are humble like the Rusty Can and the Second Rusty Can.

659
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:23,320
Other ones are spectacular like the hay barn which is kind of old and spooky

660
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:29,780
looking is now called Frankenstein's Hay Barn. And since it's it leads to the

661
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:34,520
forest of the werewolves then it kind of makes sense to make our house Dracula's

662
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:43,320
castle. Yes it does. Just as an example and that's been really fun. This end of

663
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,600
the property this big hill that my dad and mom's house

664
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:55,800
is on is called Dockstock Mountain. My sister's clan has the other third for

665
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:06,640
building houses and and the Stang clan. You Stang clan got against the Dockstock

666
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,880
Mountain area. Although we all share. And the secret National Park isn't in

667
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,020
anyone's area but we can't tell you about that. It's a secret. Oh it would make

668
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,580
everybody too jealous. Seriously. Well I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure.

669
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,960
Well we tell a secret it's no longer a secret. So right. So yeah yeah the Church

670
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:29,920
of the Subgenius has decided to reassign me the sacred scribe to Texas for half

671
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,780
the year. That's become official. And so this we got to get used to doing hours of

672
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,760
slack from here. I don't have the radio stations mix board. In fact I didn't

673
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,980
bring my radio Shack mix board from home. But I never used that anyway. What the

674
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:51,800
heck. Praise Bob. Praise Bob. But don't we have something better to do than

675
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:57,120
introduce this hour of slack. Well I can't share. I did want to describe to the

676
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:05,080
listeners the beautiful ground. It is not all rocks. Some of the ground is brown. A

677
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:11,420
soft soft brown that is all the cedar needles that have dropped and made a

678
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,900
carpet of dark brown. Then studying the dark brown our little

679
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:22,760
white snail shells scattered everywhere. They sort of look like pearls until you

680
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,800
get closer and you see the spiral in them that makes them a snail shell. And

681
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:33,660
then about the same size are also blue juniper berries from the trees. So that is

682
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:38,960
the carpeting that this princess gets to walk on when it's not rocks. And plus the

683
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,480
lichen. Oh yes. The multicolored lichen that covers both the rocks and the sparse soil

684
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,060
and the trunks of the...

685
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:55,500
incredibly numerous cedar trees. Which as invasive as they are they make this place

686
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,220
really look beautiful. Whether they are dead or alive. And they make it smell good too.

687
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:06,340
Hey is that a dead lizard or a live one? He's pretending. He's a live lizard. I never would

688
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:12,200
have spotted him in a million years. He's the exact same color as the rock. Kind of

689
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,760
a light brownish whitish grayish with spots.

690
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:22,360
And if I was 12 years old I'd know exactly what that guy is. Boy he sure is

691
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:29,060
cute whatever he is. Well yeah. He's not a Gila monster so you know he's cute. We

692
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,500
don't have Gila monsters here. We have snakes but we're not lucky enough to

693
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:38,960
have the single known venomous lizard. Komodo dragons can poison you but that's

694
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,040
not with injected venom. That's because they're slobber that when they chew on

695
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,060
you is so horrible.

696
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:53,860
We need to get some tougher boots. Yes. Wee Ma. Yes Dee Daw. We spent the Easter weekend

697
00:40:53,860 --> 00:41:00,720
with our grandchildren and my daughter and her husband. And in that world I'm Dee Daw

698
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:08,120
and she's Wee Ma. I like being a spoiled grandma princess. Well but we're still waiting on

699
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:14,900
Wee Ma Ma hand and foot. She's our Ma. That's true. She's a great grandma. So we should

700
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,960
put her on the show. Yes. It's always fun. She's a great grandma. She's a great grandma.

701
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:16,960


702
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,560
I forget she's really route. She's runt. Yeah if something else I should teachencias not

703
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:37,860
going to cut because we need time. So a 산Erl茂 mira is the groove of life.

704
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:37,860


705
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:46,960
muy levesh partir Мы assumем

706
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,320
Shit about a peck.

707
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:55,780
As he puckered up his little asshole.

708
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,720
Asshole, asshole, asshole, asshole.

709
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:11,480
As he puckered up his little asshole.

710
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,500
Asshole.

711
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,480
Asshole.

712
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:47,880
Asshole.

713
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,280
Asshole.

714
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:50,480
Asshole.

715

Asshole.

716

Asshole.

717
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:23,580
desert or forest or whatever this thing is so we've been living it up and we're

718
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:28,660
gonna we're gonna we have to come back to Cleveland to take care of our house

719
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:33,660
and our dental surgeries that went unfinished when we left and a few other

720
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:39,340
things but we just got to looking at the dates we've got to be back in Ohio for

721
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:45,520
x-day and Starwood but the week after Starwood what happens in Cleveland the

722
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:53,900
Republican National Convention with open carry so I'm thinking that maybe we

723
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,520
should go back to someplace safer immediately after Starwood someplace

724
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:05,540
much safer than Cleveland with open carry Republicans yeah with the Trump

725
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,760
the Trumpies and the cruisers ready to

726
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:14,740
shoot it out which God that would be great but I have a feeling rural Texas

727
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:18,400
might be a little safer I think you might be right about that Reverend

728
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:26,580
staying the least of people around here have always been carrying guns and they

729
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:33,080
don't usually go off accidentally as often with ranchers and cow pokes and

730
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,300
such like I don't want to step on that lizard we should get away from here

731
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,840
before I start wandering around more

732
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:45,500
I can't for how do we know where there's not a lizard every three feet

733
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:52,540
there probably is or a copperhead for that matter that's the whole idea still

734
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:57,640
sitting right there exactly in the same position he hasn't moved a muscle well

735
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,940
he's he's in the sunlight and if he does move a muscle you and me might not do

736
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:06,560
anything but that buzzard two miles away well swoop down here just like that and

737
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,840
snap him up like a tasty hors d'oeuvre

738
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:17,220
that's what I do there's that good dog the dog just walked up but he still

739
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:23,660
didn't budge and if even if that losers dead there's nothing we can do for him

740
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:27,540
because Bob ain't here that's right I don't have Bob's shower I'm not the

741
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:36,760
Messiah I had to explain to people this is not a religion actually it is but not

742
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,700
that kind

743
00:45:39,340 --> 00:46:07,360
of political

744
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,540
Oh, man.

745
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:13,600
Okay, well, I think we should get back to what we were getting back to.

746
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,000
Okay, I have one more question.

747
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:19,340
Reverend Stang, how does that cactus grow out of a stone?

748
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,020
Oh, wait a minute.

749
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,120
It's growing out of another cactus that's laying on the stone.

750
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:23,920
Okay, I understand.

751
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:24,820
Thank you.

752
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:29,780
Well, and the one that's laying on the stone is probably growing out of a tiny crack in the stone.

753
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,380
Right.

754
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,340
We've come to realize that the way these plants grow is by their roots go sideways.

755
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,300
They can't really go down very far.

756
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,640
About an inch before they hit a flat rock.

757
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,040
But boy, do they go sideways.

758
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:51,740
And even if the wind or rain or erosion pushes a tree over, even if it's hanging off the edge of a cliff, it will continue to grow upside down.

759
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,400
I never saw so many upside down trees.

760
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,440
Well, it's because I never explored my family's property like this before.

761
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,700
Or as many twisty, turny, curvy trees.

762
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,860
Yeah, it's pretty trippy, one might almost say.

763
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,120
One might almost say.

764
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:17,860
There's galleries kind of buried on subgenius.com that one can find that show the pictures.

765
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:20,820
Oh, well.

766
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:23,820
Over and out.

767
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,320
Over and out.

768
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,580
Over and out.

769
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:42,080
Over and out.

770
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,180
Over and out.

771
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,240
Over and out.

772
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,680
Over and out.

773
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,060
Over and out.

774
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,420
Over and out.

775
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,900
Over and out.

776
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:57,060
Over and out.

777
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:57,100
Over and out.

778
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:57,440
Over and out.

779
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:57,440


780
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,020
Over and out.

781
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:58,660
Over and out.

782
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,160
Over and out.

783
00:47:59,160 --> 00:47:59,160


784
00:47:59,160 --> 00:47:59,320
Ok.

785
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:05,320


786
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:05,320


787
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:05,320


788
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:05,320


789
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,780
guitar solo

790
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,140
guitar solo

791
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,840
guitar solo

792
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,480
guitar solo

793
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,640
guitar solo

794
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,400
guitar solo

795
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,660
guitar solo

796
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:17,720
guitar solo

797
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:27,280
Jimmy Ryan did it again from his brand new library of short instrumental needle drop type all purpose butt kick grog rock.

798
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,080
Testing, testing.

799
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,200
Microphone, microphone.

800
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,740
Blah, blah, blah.

801
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:44,020
Yes, we're here at Jelly Creek on Stang Ranch with my grandson.

802
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,420
Oh.

803
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:46,600
Yes!

804
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,160
I don't have a secret name for you yet.

805
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:50,900
What are you guys doing?

806
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,200
We're on the Hour of Slack.

807
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,420
What Slack?

808
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:59,300
Huh? What Slack? What kind of, what if your parents have been not teaching you?

809
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:03,900
This is the radio show, the Hour of Slack. We're on the air right now.

810
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,920
And these guys are just throwing rocks.

811
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:16,920
They could stand out here by the creek throwing rocks all day and all night.

812
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,420
Throwing rocks into the water.

813
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,500
Just to watch them splash.

814
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,800
One thing we have lots of is rocks.

815
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,500
Pretty soon we won't have any water left because it'll all be filled up with rocks.

816
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,720
Water will have to go someplace else.

817
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,780
This is my microphone.

818
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,020
Microphone.

819
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,160
Say hello to the Hour of Slack audience.

820
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:35,980
Hello!

821
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:37,960
There you go.

822
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,880
Say, praise Bob.

823
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,380
Praise Bob! Nice to see you!

824
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:44,600
Okay.

825
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:46,500
Yeah.

826
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,680
Hey guys, go, go, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya for me.

827
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:54,060
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya.

828
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,300
It's the whole family.

829
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,540
Let's do it together.

830
00:50:58,740 --> 00:50:59,180
Yeah!

831
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,660
Oh, that's a weapon-looking rock.

832
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,840
It looks like a hatchet.

833
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,160
It cut through the water.

834
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,140
It's a dinosaur brain.

835
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:10,760
It is very neat.

836
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,840
It's a rock, but it's like...

837
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,200
It's a fossilized Tyrannosaurus brain.

838
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,280
This weird, convoluted-looking thing.

839
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,420
Hello, we are at Jelly Creek Silly.

840
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,140
Swimming.

841
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,180
Ah!

842
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,220
Ah!

843
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,600
Ow!

844
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:32,560
Whoa!

845
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:32,800
Ow!

846
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,280
Meow.

847
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,400
Meow.

848
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,140
Meow!

849
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,140
Meow.

850
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,780
Swish!

851
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:42,560
Oh!

852
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,340
Shhhhh.

853
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:46,860
Mmm.

854
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,200
OMG!

855
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,360
Mimi!

856
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,120
Oh, shit!

857
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,500
Okay, cut.

858
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:49,240
That's quite a chorus of waterfalls.

859
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,060
Waterfall chorus.

860
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,000
Okay.

861
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,420
It is. It's the waterfall chorus of Alibaba Grotto.

862
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:09,040
The beautiful first of the Hidden Valley Grottos.

863
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:14,720
Further downstream we come to Twin Grotto.

864
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:19,020
Then Valentine Grotto, which has a V.

865
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:24,280
One side going up to the Uber Grotto, which is...

866
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:30,400
I wouldn't say it was necessarily the most beautiful, but it's the most colorful.

867
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,060
With green moss.

868
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:39,340
And if you go the other way down the V from Valentine's Grotto, you get to Greater Fern Gully Grotto.

869
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:44,380
Which is a very impressive tall grotto.

870
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,660
The Uber Grotto is large.

871
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:55,160
Yes, it is large and it has a wonderful view down the ravine of all the grottos.

872
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:01,700
The grottos were practically forgotten.

873
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,080
And very hard to get to when we got here.

874
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:09,020
But now they are fully mapped.

875
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:16,980
Their GPS locations known down to about 16 square feet accuracy.

876
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:21,800
And most importantly, they're very accessible by trails.

877
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,360
That were carved by Princess Wee and myself.

878
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:31,560
Lopping cedar branches and mesquite branches and other tenacious...

879
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,840
Overabundant plants.

880
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,820
Branches out of the way and making trails.

881
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:43,060
So that now we can get from Pappy and Mammy's house.

882
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,520
Which is now our house.

883
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:51,140
Down to the Alibaba's Grotto in about five minutes with the dog.

884
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,680
Oh my God.

885
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,900
Dammit is here.

886
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,000
Oh my God.

887
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,040
He's going to stay here.

888
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:59,720
Because he's the last of the true dogs.

889
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,600
Except that...

890
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:06,380
A lot of ranchers, old timey ranchers around here have dogs that run loose.

891
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,640
He has been running loose his whole life with no collar.

892
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,260
He was well trained by Pappy.

893
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,820
But he, nonetheless, he did run loose.

894
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,860
And he loves running loose with impunity.

895
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:29,260
When we go out exploring, that means he has permission.

896
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:30,600
And...

897
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,180
He circles around us constantly.

898
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:38,020
Just within eyesight of his white tail.

899
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,700
He's an English Foxhound.

900
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:43,500
He's very big and skinny and friendly.

901
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:45,300
Because...

902
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:49,760
Well, they removed his testicles when he was a little fella.

903
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,200
Well, he's especially hungry...

904
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,080
Friendly when he's hungry.

905
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:53,780
Yeah.

906
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,540
And it's past his dinner time.

907
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,780
Oh, and it is. It's half an hour past dinner time.

908
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:00,200
And he's being a good boy. Not up there barking and barking at market.

909
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,040
Wee Mama.

910
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,700
He met the sheepdogs today and didn't have a fight with them.

911
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,060
That was a really good sign.

912
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,440
Yeah, he's a good dog.

913
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:12,380
There are three sheepdogs that guard my brother's goats.

914
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:19,280
Because this is actually a real ranch where goats are grown.

915
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,900
But mostly it's rugged.

916
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,380
Rocky.

917
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,940
Cedar covered.

918
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,880
Hill country territory.

919
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,280
And it's beautiful.

920
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:38,080
Oh, thank you, Reverend Sting.

921
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,860
It's much more beautiful when you can get...

922
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:46,740
When you don't have to wear a hard hat and force your way through branches.

923
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:57,580
And with my handy loppers, I, the trail master, son of Stangor, and...

924
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:57,880
And...

925
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,620
Pappy.

926
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:00,980
Whatever.

927
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:10,020
Have been making real life trails just like playing Minecraft only in real life.

928
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:15,640
Carving tunnels through thick and thin, mostly thin vegetation.

929
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,080
Because dammit shows us the ways.

930
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,020
Yes.

931
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,300
Did I see dammit gallop by?

932
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,500
If it wasn't dammit, then what was it?

933
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:24,860
I don't know.

934
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:26,460
Agya Scutis?

935
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,580
Could be.

936
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,400
Full of gyas scutises, I'm telling you.

937
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,660
This place is full of gyas scutises.

938
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:31,340
Hey, wait a minute.

939
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:36,920
Oh, is this the egregious unseemliness that I left?

940
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,460
This is the egregious unseemliness that I was...

941
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,160
Hold the recorder.

942
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,700
Okay, you're going to hear the mad skills of the lopping Reverend Stang.

943
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:45,740
These are tiny.

944
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,900
Well, but they're going right across the path.

945
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:49,220
Right, yeah.

946
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,540
They're not princessly.

947
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:51,220
No.

948
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,300
They're not seemly.

949
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,840
They're most unseemly.

950
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:54,620
All of this stuff.

951
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:55,840
It's small.

952
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,880
It's niggling.

953
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,160
It's unseemly.

954
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:57,820
It's not niggling, but it's...

955
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,020
It's on trail lock.

956
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:00,520
It's right on the trail.

957
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,360
It makes you feel...

958
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,800
It makes you question whether you're on the trail, and that's not a good feeling.

959
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:11,240
And it's not like cedar branches are an endangered species around here.

960
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,480
That's for sure.

961
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,140
Oh my God.

962
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,840
Oh my God.

963
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,020
It's finally happened.

964
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:20,820
I have had a vision.

965
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,940
I have had a vision from Bob.

966
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,860
And Bob has pointed out that I'm not a princess.

967
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:26,860


968
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:26,860


969
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:26,860


970
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:26,860


971
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:26,860


972
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:26,860


973
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:30,920
He has pointed out to me in a way that can never be denied.

974
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:37,520
He has told me his one true vision for this week.

975
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:51,180
It is true, and it will never not be true, that the more effort you put in to gaining

976
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:55,720
slack, the more slack you will have.

977
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,200
Unless you put in too much effort, obviously.

978
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:12,140
A thank you, Reverend Priest.

979
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:20,260
You've been listening to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

980
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:25,700
For free information, write to p.o.

981
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:25,700


982
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:25,700


983
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:43,000
Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118 or see www.subgenius.com.

984
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,080
Praise Bob.

985
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:52,680
And now, a little bonus.

986
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:55,500
A recording of a discussion about deafness.

987
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:55,680
Let's go.

988
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,840
A recording of a conversation about deafness.

989
00:59:59,480 --> 00:59:59,960
Let's go.

990
00:59:59,960 --> 00:59:59,960


991
00:59:59,960 --> 00:59:59,960


992
00:59:59,960 --> 00:59:59,960


993
00:59:59,960 --> 00:59:59,960


994
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,740
I said, hey, there's some really good cricket sound here.

995
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,540
This would be a great time to do some Hour of Slack stuff.

996
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,220
Don't you hear them?

997
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:09,320
Listen, the crickets.

998
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:14,780
And he just, uh ... I looked at her like, why are you being so cruel?

999
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,500
And he laughed.

1000
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:20,620
I hear those, I hear crickets and cicadas all the time, even on snowy days in Ohio.

1001
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,680
It's funny, uh, somebody emailed me and said he was looking at the clock and said,

1002
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:25,680


1003
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:25,680


1004
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:25,680


1005
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:25,680


1006
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,500
I'm looking forward to this show because ... it was this guy that did that music.

1007
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,440
Um, he was looking ... or girl, I don't even know.

1008
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:34,600
I never know.

1009
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:37,440
Um, even after I see him.

1010
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:43,900
Anyway, this guy said he was looking forward to this, uh, Stang Ranch show because he wanted

1011
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:50,660
to hear if the noisy bugs in Texas were as ... like the noisy bugs where he is.

1012
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:55,660
And I had to explain to him that, uh, that I can't hear them.

1013
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:55,660


1014
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:55,660


1015
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:55,660


1016
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:55,660


1017
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:55,660


1018
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:55,660


1019
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:55,660


1020
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:55,660


1021
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:01,540
And I don't wait to find out either because I hear noisy bugs all the time due to, uh,

1022
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:08,820
due to listening to 1,569 hours of Slack.

1023
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:12,880
That's what ... that's a good way to get tinnitus.

1024
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,620
They're teeming here.

1025
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,320
So the crickets are real this time.

1026
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,100
Yes.

1027
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:18,540
That's it.

1028
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,680
They're real this time.

1029
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,760
The ones that you're hearing, they're not just in your ears.

1030
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,660
Well, that's why I didn't know that I was suffering from a crickets.

1031
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:30,520
I've been suffering from tinnitus for about five years because I grew up in Texas and

1032
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,900
it always sounds like this all summer long.

1033
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:13,920
I'm, she's talking to a male.

1034
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,000
I came back that day and her Wenty and tried to bribe the operator for another sympatica

1035
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:14,020
some comen Laser beam and she did.

1036
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:21,600
But we didn't know if I was good len the other thing, catch you later.

1037
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,560
Yeah, you're right.

1038
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:55,640
Thank you.

1039
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,860
Thank you.
