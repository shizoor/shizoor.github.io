1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
From PR News in Washington, I'm tackled by two people and shot in the leg with a .44 Magnum.

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,540
The United States is closed this week.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,520
PR's report reports the U.S. is on the alert for a psychiatrist attack.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,920
The U.S. complained about PR News here in Washington.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,980
The U.S. is also urging Americans to leave.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,540
The Dow Jones 9358.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,900
The man who shot and killed three people yesterday says you're listening to PR.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,700
State Police in Ross Township broke out during today's PR News in Washington.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,340
Let's go to the Gigolo Club over in Yancey.

10
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,560
They've got a subgenius powerhouse.

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,720
I say this calls for action and now nip it in the bud.

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:44,680
Ah, shut up.

13
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,560
Come closer.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,320
Take this to your people.

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:01,340
And tell the people the day of their deliverance is at hand.

16
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,640
Modesty, but no humility.

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,560
My father imprisoned a friend of his in this room for three years.

18
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,200
When he was released, he could never again bear to look at the sun.

19
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,260
Or even a daffodil.

20
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,780
How cruel.

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,440
Cruel?

22
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:35,020
It was simply a test to prove how easily a man's mind can be controlled and twisted.

23
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,660
My family have always been interested in such things.

24
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,420
Somewhere in the mind is the key to our existence.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,180
My ancestors tried to find it.

26
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,080
To open the door that separates us from our creator.

27
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,000
But you need no doors to find God.

28
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,700
If you believe...

29
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,060
Believe?

30
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:06,220
If you believe, you are gullible.

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,540
Can you look around this world and believe in the goodness of a God who rules it?

32
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,860
Famine, pestilence, war, disease and death.

33
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,940
They rule this world.

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,940
There is also love and life and hope.

35
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,080
Very little hope, I assure you.

36
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,440
No.

37
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:25,880
No hope.

38
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:25,900


39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,760
No hope.

40
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,100
If a God of love and life ever did exist, he is long since dead.

41
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,620
Someone...

42
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,200
Something...

43
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,340
Rules in his place.

44
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,960
Let me speak to you about the anatomy of Bob.

45
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,820
What would you know of Bob Ralfredo?

46
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,880
Your senses are much too blunt.

47
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,680
What is Bob-Bob-Bob?

48
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,200
Come.

49
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,360
He's not...

50
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,340
He's not...

51
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,080
Silence.

52
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,400
Listen.

53
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,720
Instructions are to prepare for an attack by an unknown enemy.

54
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,380
Who do you think you are, anyway?

55
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,560
Yes, it came from outer space.

56
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,600
What was it?

58
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,280
There's something behind this.

59
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,860
Something we don't understand.

60
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,760
Where did it come from?

61
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,320
It came from outer space.

62
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,320
What is it?

63
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,020
Something we don't understand.

64
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,720
We don't understand.

65
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,620
We don't understand.

66
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,760
We don't understand.

67
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,560
We don't understand.

68
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,760
We don't understand.

69
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,000
Ah.

70
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,460
I have never seen any

71
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,700
But I've met many a darkness

72
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,140
And there are plenty of signs just scattered around

73
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,060
The biblical stories

74
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,280
The Sumerian society

75
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,020
Are you picking up what I'm putting down?

76
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,420
Oh, I'm not saying it's any of the Italians

77
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,440
No, I'm not saying it's any of the Italians

78
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,720
No, I'm not saying it's any of the Italians

79
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,380
No, I'm not saying it's any of the Italians

80
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,760
No, I'm not saying it's any of the Italians

81
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,240
No, I'm not saying it's any of the Italians

82
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,880
The Sun in the world of technology

83
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,120
Ancient celestial cartography

84
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,640
Can you explain to me how you can ace the cows?

85
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,780
The Kiru and the Anunnaki

86
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,960
You may say it's all malarkey

87
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,460
But the evidence is sure does us dumb

88
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,420
Oh, I'm not saying it's any of the Italians

89
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,420


90
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,420


91
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:35,440
Oh, I'm not saying it's any of the Italians

92
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:05,440
It's aliens, but it's aliens

93
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,280
Velcro

94
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,320
Anal Brunch

95
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,000
Human Minds

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,400
Puppet Shards

97
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,480
Internet

98
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,460
Experiments

99
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,780
Radio

100
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,860
Torture

101
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,560
Creationists

102
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,120
Atheists

103
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,680
Aliens

104
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:35,060
Oh I'm not sure you're

105
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,060
It's aliens, but it's aliens

106
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,460
No, I'm not sure you'll tell me

107
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:42,700
you're

108
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,460
It's aliens, but it's aliens

109
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,360
No, I'm not sure you'll tell me

110
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:22,640
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

111
00:07:42,580 --> 00:08:05,040
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

112
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:35,040
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

113
00:08:35,060 --> 00:09:05,040
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

114
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:35,040
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

115
00:09:35,060 --> 00:10:05,040
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

116
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:35,040
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

117
00:10:37,820 --> 00:11:04,460
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

118
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:35,040
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

119
00:11:35,060 --> 00:12:04,660
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

120
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:35,040
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

121
00:12:35,060 --> 00:13:04,680
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

122
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:35,040
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

123
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,620
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

124
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,560
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

125
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,060
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

126
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,540
I love not sanitarians, but Italians

127
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,720
Orel, come in!

128
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,760
Juh... juh...

129
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,120
Bob?

130
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,380
Yo... Yes!

131
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,400
Not Jesus?

132
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,880
No! Not quite, but between you and me you got the better butt.

133
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,760
Yeah but-

134
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,220
I know, it's a big butt!

135
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,020
I just can't, Mr. Armature!

136
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,000
Orel, he's Bob!

137
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,740
And there's a great song-

138
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,760
G... g-get a load of it!

139
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,040
It's a great song!

140
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,880
Bouncy as the...

141
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,340
I hate you, Jesus, you rotten little thing.

142
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,420
Your sermon never pleases and your parables all stink.

143
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,420
Your eyes are beady noses with a goofy basket case.

144
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,500
I'd like to take your stupid beard and rip it off your face.

145
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,960
Prancing gaily on the water.

146
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,260
What, what, what?

147
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,380
I can't imagine ever singing that in a million years!

148
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,240
You're nuts! It's totally in your range with everything.

149
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,320
I cannot play.

150
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,380
BAM!

151
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,660
Come on, give it a try.

152
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,180
Hit it!

153
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,960
I hate you, Jesus, you rotten little thing.

154
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,460
Your sermon never pleases and your parables all stink.

155
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:44,740
Cut!

156
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,660
Kid, you're killing me.

157
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,580
I just can't. I guess I'm not a good enough for you to really hate.

158
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,040
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.

159
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,540
Think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think, think.

160
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,400
I got it, got it!

161
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,780
You can be a good Christian.

162
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,080
I can?

163
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,280
Sure. I mean, if you look at it in the grand scheme of things,

164
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,520
it would never be Christianity if it wasn't for Bob.

165
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,120
Oh.

166
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:12,440
In fact, you might even call Bob one of the bigger heroes of Christianity.

167
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,380
A hero?

168
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,360
You betcha! He's real important to the religion.

169
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,160
Hmm. Then you know what, Mr. Armature?

170
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,080
What, Oral?

171
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,800
I think I can...

172
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,420
Bob, Bob, Bob.

173
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,320
Well, hello, Fresbo, you silly clown.

174
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,220
Say, why aren't you up on your flying trapeze today?

175
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,880
Well, today is Sunday, and Sunday is...

176
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,220
Ow! Fresbo, you hit me!

177
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,800
Heheheheheheh...

178
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,220
You've got to turn the other cheek.

179
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:40,840
Ow!

180
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,880
Turn the other cheek.

181
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,320
Ow!

182
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,060
Show the world how strong you are by simply acting weak.

183
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,160
Inherit all the world someday, cause you will be the meek.

184
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,560
I'm a god!

185
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:48,940
Shoo!

186
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,980
Inherit all the world someday, cause you will be the meek.

187
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,580
Ow!

188
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,100
And just tell me when you turn the other cheek.

189
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,400
I hate you.

190
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,980
Hate away, sister.

191
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,420
Hate away.

192
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,680
Alright.

193
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,180
Oh!

194
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,920
I know I'm drunk now.

195
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,780
Ladies and gentlemen, I forgot my favorite man sitting over there.

196
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,820
His name is...

197
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
Mr. Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina.

198
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,240
Mr. Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina.

199
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,640
Mr. Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina.

200
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,060
Mr. Mr. Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina.

201
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,440
Mr. Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina.

202
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,780
Mr. Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina.

203
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,240
Mr. Bob Dove Lina-

204
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,280
Mr. Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina.

205
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:39,400
Mr Dovelina, Mr. Bob Dovelina!

206
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:39,560
Mess the up.

207
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,180
Mess it up to **** You made me sick with, via, a thousand words,

208
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,700
Why don't you be handy, little rug rat?

209
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,640
Take a little tip from the tabloid

210
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,200
Because I know I'm not paranoid

211
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,100
When I say I saw you trying to mock me

212
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,540
Now you and your crew are on a mission trying to hawk me

213
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,840
But it isn't happening, you fraudulent foes

214
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,020
You used to front big time, now I suppose

215
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,140
That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted

216
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,820
You used to make fun of, but now you wanna rock it

217
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,500
So you gotta kick it with the homies

218
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,980
But D.E.L. is already hip to your cronies

219
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,800
Me and CM Phoenix thought about this

220
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,200
And never have we seen a brother who would hover like

221
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:43,180
Mr. Mr. Mr. Davalina

222
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,580
Mr. Davalina, Mr. Bob Davalina

223
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,980
Mr. Davalina, Mr. Bob Davalina

224
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,360
Mr. Davalina, Mr. Bob Davalina

225
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,280
Mr. Bob Davalina

226
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,240
Mr. Bob Davalina

227
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,260
Ooh, ooh, Mr. Davalina

228
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,820
You thought you could manipulate, you thought you could fool me

229
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,020
Ooh, ooh, Mr. Davalina

230
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,620
Cheech Wizard put me on a stumper, then he schooled me

231
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,840
Prince could be fraudulent, just you wait and see

232
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,480
First he was my money grip, then he stole my honey dip

233
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,000
Mr. Davalina is a serpent, don't you agree?

234
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,600
The little two-timer resembles Aunt Jemima

235
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,180
Would you marry me?

236
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:13,180


237
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,460
I'm wearing jeans and a dirty white hoodie

238
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,960
Seems like you wouldn't be a snake, or would he?

239
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,360
Disguises come in all sizes and shapes

240
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,080
Notice the facade of the snakes

241
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,100
They all catch the vapes even though last year they was GQ

242
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,120
Took a lot of time before the D.E.L. could see through the mask

243
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,620
All I had to do is ask the Emperor and Kwame

244
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,380
And my maris thought if they were bombing

245
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,660
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules

246
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,140
The way you're on my dick must really hurt your knees

247
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,740
You need to take heat and quit being such a groupie

248
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,020
Ever since I did a little show in Guadalupe

249
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,600
I never saw a groupie like you

250
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,180
But when it's time to go, I'ma show you

251
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,180


252
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,960
The fun is you wanted to be down with my crew

253
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,680
But D.E.L. is not down with any clowns or jesters

254
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,180
So I would suggest that you try to impress some professor, Davalina

255
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,700
Because you don't impress me, Davalina

256
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,000
The style of dress is not the key, Davalina

257
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,680
It's all in the mind and the heart

258
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,040
So you should start by remembering

259
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,900
You gotta pay a fee, Davalina

260
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,700
Mr. Davalina, Mr. Bob Davalina

261
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,020
Mr. Davalina, Mr. Bob Davalina

262
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,460
Mr. Davalina, Mr. Bob Davalina

263
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,820
Mr. Mr. Davalina, Mr. Bob Davalina

264
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,520

Mr. Double Leader

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,700
Mr. Double Leader

301
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:30,700


302
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,020
Mr. Double Leader

303
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,260
Mr. Double Leader

Mr. Double Leader

Cold sores, deep green spiky, and even frozen turds on a stick

Throw in my lips are riddled with cold sores

00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:22,420


318
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:22,460
Hi

319
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,260
Aku

320
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:35,260


321
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:35,260


322
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:41,060
D Sturizen

323
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,840
Never?!

324
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,260
uh yes

325
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:58,980
oh

326
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:05,700
man whoa that's intense

327
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:15,800
that was uh not the rudy schwartz project although some long-time listeners would recognize that tune

328
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:23,240
as the instrumental called moe mars tractor by rudy schwartz project but it wasn't by rudy

329
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:32,360
schwartz project it's being covered by a band called purple johnson blimp situation

330
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,440
you hadn't heard that before

331
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:35,680
you hadn't heard that before

332
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:35,680


333
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:43,600
no it's our reverend peter because no i had not it was it was just submitted with two other pieces

334
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:51,800
of music this week by reverend peter because and uh the other piece that we've heard that he did

335
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:59,900
was uh that opening song for this show about i'm not saying i'm not not saying it's aliens but it's

336
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:05,280
aliens that was uh purple johnson blimp situation as well

337
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:12,760
which i thought deserved special attention wow um let's see what else uh after

338
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:21,980
his song uh i'm not saying it's aliens there and before there were some collages by the great

339
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:29,540
lee murr and also by reverend exister of ministry of slack who sent us a big mess of stuff last week

340
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:34,120
including that uh mixed up rant by papa joe mama

341
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,260
the인�werd tour was the pre

342
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,140
their second album had a song called,

343
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,260
that went Bob Dabolina, Mr. Bob Dabolina.

344
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,520
But that's all it did.

345
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,280
It kind of did that in chorus like a loop.

346
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,240
I mean, it was really the monkeys imitating future loops.

347
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,160
The monkeys were ahead of their time in strange ways.

348
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:23,740
Yes, they were.

349
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,860
We heard some cut-ups by Reverend Exister, yes,

350
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,740
who did Brought to You By and some others.

351
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,860
Oh, and the Rainmakers did the song Wages of Sin.

352
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,560
An old favorite of mine, this was a live version,

353
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,380
a recent live version from a live DVD,

354
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,740
they have out celebrating 25 years of rainmaking

355
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,740
and lonesome cowboy Dave.

356
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,440
All the more so thanks to you.

357
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,080
All the more so for the porso in the torso.

358
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,240
And all under an orange-colored sky.

359
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,820
Is it truly orange-colored where you sit right now?

360
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,100
Yes.

361
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,740
The sky is actually the color of orange sherbet here.

362
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,120
And it reminded me of this song from my parents' era.

363
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,800
I was walking along, minding my business,

364
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,360
when under an orange-colored sky.

365
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,720
Wham, bam, alakazam, wonderful you walk by.

366
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,520
That was the era when all the songs sounded like advertisements.

367
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,200
It is kind of surreal here.

368
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,780
They had a very delicate song.

369
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,020
They had a very strong.

370
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,620
They had delicate song structure.

371
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,740
It's back to the common rock and roll song structure of today.

372
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,440
Sometimes they would start with an interlude

373
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,160
and then revamp again on it later.

374
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,740
They would set up the tune and do a variation on it

375
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,480
and then somebody would start singing something

376
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,900
that didn't seem to make any sense

377
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,200
and they would slap together.

378
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,180
Then suddenly it would be over.

379
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,860
And that's how we do the Hour of Slack.

380
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,180
Thank you for listening, friends.

381
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,600
Wham, bam, alakazam.

382
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,160
Yeah.

383
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,120
But is that...

384
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,440
Is it true that the sky is orange?

385
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,580
It is orange.

386
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,560
The sky is literally orange here.

387
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,640
Well, isn't that a sign of some sort of danger in the atmosphere?

388
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,920
No, it's a sign of low clouds over a big city

389
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,340
with old, aging orange lights.

390
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,360
Cleveland, in other words.

391
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,540
I thought it was a sign of snow.

392
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,520
The glowing rust belt.

393
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:29,060
Yeah, it glows orange, like the color of rust

394
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:32,080
and the hearts of its people.

395
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,540
Rust color.

396
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,240
Are you sure you may not want to take...

397
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,880
slower breaths once you leave the building, however?

398
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,680
Slower breaths?

399
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,180
Well, you know, it's funny.

400
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,340
We were just talking on the way down here.

401
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,140
We were passing the ancient ruins

402
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,740
of the universities and museums,

403
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,840
which they fixed up.

404
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,180
You know, they sandblasted.

405
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,440
Those things had turned black.

406
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,940
Those ancient buildings from the 1700s,

407
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,020
Cleveland or whatever,

408
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,120
had turned black.

409
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,160
And from the...

410
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,360
pollution of the steel mill days

411
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,880
when we were prosperous here.

412
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,780
And then they got sandblasted carefully.

413
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,920
And now they're all white,

414
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,080
but they're still ruins

415
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,980
full of students

416
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,380
whose minds are in ruins.

417
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,240
Some of them.

418
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,160
Little enclaves of houses

419
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,700
that had little actual yards in them

420
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,660
in the front and stuff

421
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,220
are now enclosed in weird iron bars

422
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,820
and strange fortifications

423
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,860
so they can keep on having a party

424
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,240
in a place where there are no more...

425
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:35,780
parties.

426
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,480
Except for the Robitussin party

427
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,360
of the egalitarian empire.

428
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,240
That's an actual trade name,

429
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,440
so it was just a...

430
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,980
Those were some great parties.

431
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,720
I used to get invited to those,

432
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,340
but, you know,

433
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,060
just over the years,

434
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,300
you stop getting invited

435
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,140
to the young people's parties.

436
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,360
Yeah.

437
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,240
Once your cough is incurable...

438
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,140
Oh, Reverend Sam,

439
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,800
you can't make it with your cough?

440
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,020
Oh, we're so sorry.

441
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,840
Sorry, you can't make it,

442
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,520
Reverend Stan.

443
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,880
You weren't invited anyway.

444
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,480
Remember the old days

445
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,820
when the hippies used to smoke,

446
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,060
what is it,

447
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,620
nitrous...

448
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,640
Neutrogena.

449
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:20,900
Neutrogena.

450
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,800
As a scrub or as a bomb.

451
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,220
Either way, they would drink it.

452
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,860
They'd scrub it and drink it

453
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,820
and bomb it.

454
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:30,960
With a marijuana.

455
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,080
Yeah.

456
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,720
Yeah.

457
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,120
Marijuana.

458
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,820
Marijuana is the fuse

459
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,400
and Neutrogena is the bomb.

460
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,380
Bum, bum, bum, boom.

461
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,300
Bum, bum, bum.

462
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,160
Oh, our music in the background,

463
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,560
by the way, friends,

464
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,560
is a tune or something

465
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,920
called The Lotus Eaters

466
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,140
by Cult of Zere,

467
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,500
also known as our friend Dr. Zeronius.

468
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,860
Praise Dr. Zeronius.

469
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,800
On one later on, he sings.

470
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,280
Praise the name Lotus Eaters.

471
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,900
But it's got a filter.

472
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,460
We're on.

473
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,600
It's a kid in a car.

474
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,240
It's a...

475
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,080
It's a...

476
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,600
So I hope he doesn't say anything cuss-worthy

477
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,740
because this is a live show

478
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,060
broadcast from the studios

479
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,200
of WCSB Cleveland,

480
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,020
but not necessarily

481
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,420
what you're listening to right now

482
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,060
because we do send the show

483
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,480
to other stations,

484
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,200
worthy stations.

485
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,860
To fruits and animals of all time,

486
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,900
to reptilians and creatures of magma,

487
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,860
and those,

488
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,260
those who live in the atmosphere

489
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,180
as tiny little spherical atmospheric spheres.

490
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,020
And we also have our own fears

491
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,000
for as you look below,

492
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,640
the sky is not only orange,

493
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,960
but the ground and all of the pavement

494
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,260
and all covered with an orange slime.

495
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,620
It's quite tasty, though,

496
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,560
if you don't mind the acerbic reaction

497
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560
at the beginning.

498
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,920
The tang.

499
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,840
You show it while you feel your tongue dissipate,

500
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,120
and you're not even in the air.

501
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,420
The cloydus,

502
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,460
your bambus,

503
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,620
like your interruptus,

504
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,640
will also fade into the...

505
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,780
What's that smell in here?

506
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,180
It's been nice knowing you, Dave,

507
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,140
now that we all turn orange,

508
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,880
slowly but surely.

509
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,460
Our clothes,

510
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,300
our skin,

511
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,400
our eyes.

512
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:31,840
Caution.

513
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,840
Caution.

514
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:33,780
Eardrums.

515
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,120
Caution.

516
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,840
Caution.

517
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,460
We're becoming fully orange now.

518
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:42,160
Or orange, you glad I didn't say orange.

519
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,200
Aren't you happy?

520
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,200
We can live among the citrus fruit

521
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,320
and still survive.

522
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,220
Others have passed this way

523
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,840
and have not crossed the river.

524
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,320
But we shall.

525
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,200
We shall.

526
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,440
We shall.

527
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,840
We shall.

528
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,880
We shall.

529
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,240
Shall.

530
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,140
Shall.

531
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,760
Yes.

532
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,120
Yes.

533
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,680
Screw you, pumpkin.

534
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,180
It's all a bunch of lies.

535
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,820
Can't you tell?

536
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,480
Look at his eyelids.

537
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,640
Look at his eyelids.

538
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,200
Can't you see that thing hanging down there?

539
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:14,920
Ew.

540
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,520
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's...

541
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,540
You ain't gonna cross no rivers dressed like that, boy.

542
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,040
Now, hit your pants up

543
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,200
and get your boots on

544
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,540
and cross the dang river.

545
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,320
I see the other side, my friends.

546
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,700
I can smell the other side.

547
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,300
I can smell the other side of that river.

548
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,120
Bob's on the other side of that river.

549
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,420
And he's toking up on his Borkham Riff

550
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,340
or whatever he smokes.

551
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,200
It's not marijuana.

552
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,320
Everybody thinks that.

553
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,480
It's some kind of cheap, horrible-smelling pipe tobacco.

554
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,680
He gets it at Walgreens.

555
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:47,920
Very, very smelly.

556
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,640
Yeah, awful.

557
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,000
You can, but you know it's Bob.

558
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,100
That's the way you know.

559
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,500
You can smell him coming.

560
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,200
He's not coming.

561
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,000
I don't smell him.

562
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,640
I don't know.

563
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:58,760


564
00:37:59,220 --> 00:37:59,640
I don't know.

565
00:37:59,640 --> 00:37:59,940
I don't know.

566
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,280
I don't know.

567
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:00,620
I don't know.

568
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:00,960
I don't know.

569
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:01,660
I don't know.

570
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,180
I don't know.

571
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:02,260
I don't know.

572
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,280
I don't know.

573
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,300
Will thou come unto us

574
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,180
and deliver us sucor and slack

575
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,260
as promised on page four, paragraph 19,

576
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,340
indentation number three, B.

577
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,200
The subgenius must have slack.

578
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,860
After all, that's what this is all about, isn't it?

579
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:25,920
Bob!

580
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,320
Oh, Bob's not listening.

581
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:28,840
Who cares?

582
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,780
Why am I sitting here muttering to myself?

583
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,640
Hmm.

584
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:32,660
Good.

585
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,600
Bad, bad.

586
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,020
Now, little fella, you're not muttering to yourself.

587
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,360
You're muttering to the world at random.

588
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,320
Yes, to a listenership of at least 15 people.

589
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,580
What does it say on the, uh...

590
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,780
Oh, actually, we have a high number.

591
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,680
We have a record high number of internet listeners.

592
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,340
That's odd.

593
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,360
Princess Wee, it's your fault, isn't it?

594
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,540
It is.

595
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,020
Princess Wee said on Facebook.

596
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,740
See, she's on Facebook.

597
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,400
I'm not.

598
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,040
But she is.

599
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:00,760
And she's very much on Facebook.

600
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:00,760


601
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:00,760


602
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:00,760


603
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:00,760


604
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:00,760


605
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:00,760


606
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:00,760


607
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:00,760


608
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,160
And popular.

609
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,960
And I have no brain waves currently.

610
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,660
No, no ones that I have to declare.

611
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,380
So there.

612
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,100
I am powerless in the face of Facebook.

613
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,460
I'm smooth as a baby's arm.

614
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,260
How are the words forming?

615
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,100
Well, someone else is maybe doing it.

616
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,600
No, that's not really such a bad idea.

617
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,520
No.

618
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,960
It's a happy, happy, happy way to go.

619
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,420
Let's examine those undershores one more time.

620
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,340
Trooping, siding, windows.

621
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,760
I'm not ready.

622
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,940
I'm not ready.

623
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,820
I'm not ready.

624
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:37,900


625
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:38,780
I'm not ready.

626
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:38,780


627
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:38,780


628
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:38,820
I'm not ready.

629
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,480
Roofing, siding, windows.

630
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,380
Roofing, siding, windows.

631
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,060
And that's what we're all about here at the Hour of Slack, friends.

632
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:48,720
Roofing, siding, windows and lonesome cowboy Dave.

633
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:56,920
This is the psycho skeletons heard in the background with the song, Roofing, Siding, Windows.

634
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,080
And it had enveloped our Dave.

635
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,760
You have to do something.

636
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,480
You have to think of Bob Dobbs.

637
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:08,740
And when you were speaking out so clearly about your desire for succor and volum.

638
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,600
Yeah, succor.

639
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,660
I'm a sucker for succor.

640
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,760
Succor and lollipops.

641
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:18,440
We have to furthermore think of Bob as a form of structural canopy under which we can hide

642
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,160
our vices and virtues and live in virtual mental squalor.

643
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,220
We have to remember that all around there's closets full of suitcases that don't belong

644
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:27,880
to us.

645
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,360
And if we poke around in the wrong one.

646
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,360
Who knows?

647
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,900
A dog sniffing drug could explode in our underpants.

648
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,060
Once again reducing us to the same level of...

649
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,160
Of zombie-ism.

650
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,500
Because that's what happens when you go sneaking around looking at other people's luggage.

651
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,560
You turn into a zombie.

652
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:52,920
And that's what all the freemason camps are all about.

653
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,080
At least as I've heard.

654
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:00,740
They are building thousands of freemason camps around the city.

655
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:00,740


656
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:00,740


657
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:07,880
center of the universe so as to sexploit, or in other words, disengorge the human race

658
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,860
of its most valuable and least valuable vacuum.

659
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,000
Wow.

660
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:16,240
But that's okay, because Gregory, the cockroach will come and save us.

661
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,540
Well, I'm going to try and be one of the cockroaches.

662
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,240
Somehow.

663
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,460
I've got to fix it in.

664
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,460
I've got a scrawny, weird little face with big, huge buggy eyes.

665
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,680
You can see both directions at the same time, different angles.

666
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:31,980
Yeah.

667
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,680
La cucaracha.

668
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,400
No, no.

669
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,640
No, no, no, senor.

670
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,080
El cucaracho.

671
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:41,900
Con nariz rojo.

672
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,460
Equipo de partita.

673
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:54,280
The loudness of this music is a puzzling evidence to me.

674
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,340
The music.

675
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,840
The music is, likewise, by Purple Johnson Blimp Situation.

676
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,980
It is a piece called Gregory the Cockroach.

677
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,100
Well, why did he have to have such a funny name?

678
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,940
What was the name of this band again?

679
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,620
Gregory the Cockroach.

680
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,180
No, it's the Purple Something Experiment.

681
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,780
Oh, the name of the band is Purple Johnson Blimp Situation.

682
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,320
Duh, everybody, where have you been, Dave?

683
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:26,220
I didn't know you were talking about Gregor Samsa, who awoke one morning to find himself

684
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:30,040
transformed into some sort of monstrous German.

685
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,840
No wonder it's Gregory the Cockroach.

686
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:34,860
Yeah.

687
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,640
Yeah, see, that's a literary.

688
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,680
That's one of your literary references.

689
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:45,220
Like when that Rainmaker's Guide where it says me and J.D. Salinger were sitting on the porch or whatever.

690
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,020
You know, it's like a show that you're smart enough to read a fancy book.

691
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:55,420
Like Molotov-Kovka or one of them other famous writers.

692
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,160
Remember Molotov-Kovka?

693
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:11,720
The famous Japanese-American angstist wrote angst novels about people that turned into little Pokemons and stuff.

694
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,000
It's horrible. It's scary.

695
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:21,880
I thought you were talking about Professor Mitch Kaku, who claims that if you look at yourself,

696
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,200
whether disguised as Gregor Samsa were, the cockroach...

697
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:30,480
eyeball person, himself, or another individual, doesn't matter.

698
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:39,920
When you look in the mirror, you're seeing yourself one billionth of a second later than when you actually are seeing yourself because of the speed of light.

699
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,000
Go figure it out, man. I dare you.

700
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,580
See, you think you're bobbing on me.

701
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,940
That sounds like...

702
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,640
Because you're described that you don't know all the science and stuff about paleolithic.

703
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:53,400
Yeah.

704
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,020
Yeah.

705
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:55,540
Yeah.

706
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,900
He's talking all that time control stuff.

707
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,760
This is Dr. Zier in the background. Dr. Zieronius.

708
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,240
Wow.

709
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:03,620
Singing.

710
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:04,360
Listen.

711
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,400
Beautiful voice.

712
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,160
It didn't sound...

713
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:26,140
Back to guitar keyboard with a fuzz drill and an apocalyptic ending.

714
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,180
Yeah, I don't know how they do that stuff.

715
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:42,240
Actually, his sound machine is homemade, self-constructed, and has all manner of little toys inside that work,

716
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,540
along with the electronics that make the bent, twisted music of cult of Zier.

717
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,920
I know this because I've seen he actually performed at X-Day at least once,

718
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,900
and also at the Portland Devival.

719
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,140
We first saw his box of weird tricks.

720
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,460
Then there's Gadgetto, the band in Portland.

721
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,540
It's a one-man band.

722
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:08,560
He's got a wooden box with four or five tape recorders,

723
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:14,640
gold cassette decks in it, bolted inside the box, and they only run loops,

724
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,680
maybe 10-second long loops.

725
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:23,280
And he just drops one little cassette of loops after another into each of the five cassette boxes

726
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,320
and runs them in different...

727
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,200
...sets.

728
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,580
...somewhat planned ways.

729
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,220
That is the music of Gadgetto, as not heard here.

730
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,120
Although they're both in Portland.

731
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:40,080
Dr. Zeronius and Gadgetto both live in the benighted city of Portland,

732
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:48,820
which, by the way, has the highest rate of methamphetamine-related burglaries and theft.

733
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:55,740
I just wanted to let people know that because those Portland snark people like to brag about,

734
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:55,940
they're just as good as the people who have the most money.

735
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:55,940


736
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,020
So, I'm from Portland.

737
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,980
We're so painfully hip here.

738
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:03,880
So utterly painfully Starbuckianly hip.

739
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:12,060
Then I'd like to point out they actually have a higher rate, much, much higher crime rate

740
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,900
than, say, Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

741
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,180
Not to be confused with East Cleveland or Downtown Cleveland.

742
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,740
Or Cleveland Loads.

743
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,080
Loads?

744
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,980
Is that what they call the lowlands around there?

745
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:25,720
There's Cleveland Heights.

746
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,020
And Cleveland Loads.

747
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,780
It's mostly Loads.

748
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:30,100
Yes.

749
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,060
Yes.

750
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,160
It's mostly Cleveland Loads.

751
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:38,880
Especially with the Sheep Lady and the mass spanking, I would be willing to measure,

752
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:45,160
at least in a fathom or two, that most of the listless listeners around there,

753
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:50,440
throughout the land, have never heard of the Sheep Lady, which lived on Euclid Avenue,

754
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,620
on your way to, no, the one adjacent, the one right next over, not Lake Sheep.

755
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,880
I had a friend that lived right next to the Sheep Lady.

756
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,420
You know of the Sheep Lady?

757
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,100
Yes, I do know of the Sheep Lady.

758
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,380
There was a lady that was raising sheeps.

759
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,100
The talk-on girl.

760
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,620
That ain't like Pig Man, is it?

761
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,360
No.

762
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,680
Not like Pig Man?

763
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,420
These were actual, very dirty sheep.

764
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:18,140
And there were things like Arby's and McDonald's right next door to where her sheep farm was.

765
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:19,820
That's terrible.

766
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:25,500
There was some little glitch in the law going back to the days of the 1790s and

767
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:25,600
now it's a little bit different.

768
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:25,600


769
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:25,600


770
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:25,600


771
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:25,600


772
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:25,600


773
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:25,600


774
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:25,600


775
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:25,600


776
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:25,600


777
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:29,960
And Moses Cleveland, what a wonderful man he was as far as the Native Americans are concerned.

778
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,740
But anyway, I can't get away from that.

779
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:39,700
And there was some sort of clause that a woman could, not a woman, but that anyone could

780
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,560
have a sheep pasture.

781
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,960
You couldn't have cows anymore.

782
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,020
We're a city now.

783
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:43,480
We can't.

784
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,980
But there she was right in the city limits with a sheep pasture.

785
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:52,460
And she had the Bo Peep weird stick thing with the, you know, with the, you know.

786
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:52,880
Yeah.

787
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,220
It was wild.

788
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:54,500
Yeah.

789
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,780
She had the full-

790
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,280
She was more like a babushka looking lady.

791
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:57,500
Yes.

792
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,340
But she was still 107.

793
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,120
Yes.

794
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,020
She looked like a yogurt commercial.

795
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,020
Mm-hmm.

796
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,040
And she fought the law and the law won.

797
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,060
Mm-hmm.

798
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:07,940
Yes.

799
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:12,760
The law won and she got to keep her sheep farm right up there next to the McDonald's

800
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,380
and the Arby's.

801
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:22,420
And then finally the law of nature won and the sheep farm got moved to another

802
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:22,840
dimension.

803
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:23,880
Yeah.

804
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,660
That's some funny stuff, right guys?

805
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,020
And now that sheep farm lives in the twilight zone, are you saying?

806
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,600
No, I haven't seen her.

807
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,000
I thought she disappeared.

808
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,600
Poof.

809
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,380
Just like that.

810
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,980
Like a magic spell, a puff of smoke.

811
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,100
But the sheep are still there.

812
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,960
And they're voting.

813
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:45,900
And they're what?

814
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,960
They call each other sheeple all day long.

815
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,620
You're all a bunch of sheeple.

816
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:52,940
Meh.

817
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,200
I don't know.

818
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,200


819
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,200


820
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,200


821
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,200


822
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,200


823
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,200


824
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,200


825
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,200


826
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,200


827
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,200


828
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,200


829
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,200


830
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:54,200


831
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,320
I don't care about you.

832
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,940
You're just a bunch of sheeple.

833
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,740
They're all saying that.

834
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:00,840
I know.

835
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,300
Thousands and thousands of them, especially on talk radio and internet forums.

836
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,920
All the sheeple are so blind.

837
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,980
They haven't pulled the wool off of their own eyes.

838
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,940
I'm blind too, but at least it's my wool.

839
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:24,000
That's what the subgenius kook says actually.

840
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:24,180
It is.

841
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


842
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


843
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


844
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


845
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


846
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


847
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


848
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


849
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


850
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


851
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


852
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


853
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


854
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


855
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


856
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


857
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


858
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


859
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:24,180


860
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,420
It's nice and warm and very pleasant.

861
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:29,760
Well, I could certainly not test that because that's what I hear seeing coming and going,

862
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,140
man.

863
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,940
And I wish that that had never been, because like 20 years ago when you said you're all

864
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,820
sheeple, that was kind of semi-funny back then.

865
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:41,080
First time I ever heard it was Chaz said it.

866
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,060
Yeah.

867
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,880
In this chair right here.

868
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,220
Yeah, I told her.

869
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:51,320
It was some shortwave radio program that was out there warning the people of the government

870
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,620
takeover of their guns.

871
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:58,240
And I told him and we listened to it one night and he called everyone sheeple.

872
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,240
And then he caught on.

873
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,900
He was some sort of a megalomaniac from Texas.

874
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,520
Who are you talking about?

875
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,520
Alex Jones or Ivan Stang?

876
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:11,580
One of those crazy- Early day Alex Jones.

877
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,160
Perhaps one of Alex Jones' heroes.

878
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,120
Uh-huh.

879
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:15,480
Right.

880
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,700
An early sheeple accuser.

881
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:19,560
Yeah.

882
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,560
When people would listen to shortwave radio.

883
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:26,100
I was listening to it on the radio because not everything was available on the internet.

884
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,820
Well, you know how it really started, how that whole thing started out, that sheeple

885
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:30,060
thing?

886
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:38,280
It was a bad rip off of Princess Wee's rant routine where she would go, wake up, sleeple.

887
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,220
She called him sleeple.

888
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,320
That was her word.

889
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,940
And Alex Jones and his people heard that.

890
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,120
They went, oh, wake up, sheeple.

891
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,080
That's real clever.

892
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,580
No, it was the original was wake up, sleeple.

893
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,600
So they stole from women.

894
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:52,600


895
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:52,600


896
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:52,780
Wee.

897
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,840
Quickly tide down

898
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,720
Very good.

899
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,720
Re- lean properly, and did you see what she did to that sheep?

900
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,240
She didn't.

901
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:01,240


902
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:01,240


903
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,180
Things that don't think are real-

904
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:07,760
A thing thatallah does.

905
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:07,760


906
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:13,780
전 acute weak pulled out that's wrong.

907
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:13,780


908
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:22,540


909
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:29,160
so that we could say that we and I, we, we, we?

910
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,580
We, we.

911
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:31,460
We, we.

912
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,680
So, yeah, I thought that it was all.

913
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,460
And then there's the people who call her Princess Wei.

914
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:41,160
That's how you know they never heard the hour of slack, not even once.

915
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,760
They're way off.

916
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:43,900
Yeah, they're way off.

917
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,440
Because we say, we!

918
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:50,560
And also what they're doing is they're pronouncing it like Feng Shui or something,

919
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,840
or Shu-i or, here's your, uh.

920
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:56,040
I like to, yeah, Sheng-Fui is what I say.

921
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:00,260
I'd like to, I'll lay some Sheng-Fui on this room here.

922
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,320
I'll lay your guts and black soil and your red, blue, snitching, scabby eye oil.

923
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,920
You know I'm going to do it right now.

924
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,000
Sorry.

925
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,800
It's good that we're all weighing in on this.

926
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,380
No, I have to we in pretty soon.

927
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,340
You have to we in?

928
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,340
I have to we on in a minute.

929
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,460
If we, if this showed an end.

930
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:20,980
In pretty soon.

931
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:21,940
Actually, I'm okay.

932
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,020
I took care of that.

933
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,720
That's why I had the half hour of recorded stuff on first.

934
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,860
So I knew I was going to have to.

935
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,760
Keep running back and forth.

936
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,700
Keep running, yes.

937
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,140
Keep the water running.

938
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,060
It's just, I'm happy.

939
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,680
As long as it's running, I'm not going to complain.

940
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:41,140
It's when it backs up, that's when you've got to worry.

941
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,780
Rush to the hospital and form a new relationship with the nurse.

942
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,140
As my dad put it.

943
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,140
To my head.

944
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:50,880
To my head.

945
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,500
Under duress.

946
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,840
Did we give all the credits?

947
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:58,060
This music in the background just now has been Einstein's secret orchestra.

948
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,380
And that was Dave himself you heard playing the guitar.

949
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:05,860
And Chaz Smith's organly music.

950
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:09,420
And Michelle George on violins.

951
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,560
Back in the days when everything was.

952
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:12,980
Robert Mosick on percussion.

953
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,800
Right, Bob, the real Bob on percussion.

954
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,260
The real Bob.

955
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:16,980
Yep.

956
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,000
Then were the days when everybody was happy and healthy.

957
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,580
And nobody was dead.

958
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,900
And we all had.

959
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,040
We didn't have any more money than we do now.

960
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,100
But it sure went a lot further.

961
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:28,980
Yep.

962
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:34,600
You could get five cups of coffee for $500 then.

963
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,440
That's not the only thing that's inflated nowadays.

964
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,640
You should see my feet from walking around in the snow.

965
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,580
They're as big as balloons.

966
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,940
Dave, if you've been walking around in the snow barefoot again to be cool.

967
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,060
It's not really.

968
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,000
Just because everybody's doing it doesn't mean it's that.

969
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:50,560
Cool, man.

970
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,900
Wake up, sleeper.

971
00:53:53,300 --> 00:54:00,980
I've just seen so many people, as if zombies, as if actual sleeper, walking around in the snow.

972
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,500
And I know some of them don't have houses.

973
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,060
And I don't.

974
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,960
Warm up, Friesel.

975
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:07,700
Because it makes me sad.

976
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,540
And that's for real.

977
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:11,020
So I better go back to the character.

978
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:19,340
It is sad because none of us know how long we'll be under roofs with a heater.

979
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:20,040
It's really.

980
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:20,400
It's really sad.

981
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,280
It's scary.

982
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:21,720
Yeah.

983
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,160
Think of people that don't have a cover.

984
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,360
Things sure have changed since them days of witch disco.

985
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:32,600
We'd get a pizza and there'd be little golden rings that were hidden by the pizza.

986
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,300
No, I'm sorry.

987
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,500
Golden rings hidden in pizza.

988
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,480
We're out now.

989
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,680
Things have changed, yes.

990
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,460
Well, we knew that was going to happen.

991
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,800
It all came true just according to what we were predicting.

992
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,740
We said it was going to be.

993
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,780
Bob said it was going to be a bummer.

994
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,580
He said that.

995
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,000
And people did.

996
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,620
Some people didn't pick up on it.

997
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,840
But was Bob right or what?

998
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,700
Yeah, Bob was right.

999
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,080
It was going to be a bummer.

1000
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,640
It did turn into a bummer.

1001
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:02,980
Yeah, Bob and the Buddha.

1002
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,260
But I'm not going to let it bum me out.

1003
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:04,660
No, sir.

1004
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,880
Because I'm a man of Bob.

1005
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,520
I have faith in Bob.

1006
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,800
I keep up the FIB.

1007
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:14,580
It's harder to keep the FIB up when you're my age.

1008
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,860
But by golly, I try.

1009
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,500
With the help of Bob.

1010
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:19,060
Bob.

1011
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:19,100


1012
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:19,220
Bob.

1013
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:19,440
Bob.

1014
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:19,740
Bob.

1015
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:19,740


1016
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:19,740


1017
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:19,740


1018
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:19,740


1019
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:19,740


1020
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:19,760
Bob.

1021
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:19,760


1022
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:19,760


1023
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,140
And to keep up the FIB.

1024
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,480
I mean the FIB.

1025
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,040
The faith in Bob.

1026
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,280
Yeah.

1027
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:31,480
No grander scheme could have ever been exposed under plundered eyes.

1028
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,380
That's what they used to say back in the cowboy days.

1029
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:43,240
After the conquistadors got there, that's when guys like Bob started popping up all around the place.

1030
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:44,700
Of course, there's only one.

1031
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,380
Of course.

1032
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,500
One true Bob.

1033
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:47,960
Yeah.

1034
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,400
The salesman.

1035
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:54,980
Now, friends, Bob's going to sell you the greatest story ever told.

1036
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,460
The greatest joke ever told.

1037
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,000
If Earth can make it to the punchline.

1038
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,120
And you can help.

1039
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:01,580
But how?

1040
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:03,540
Well, that's up to you.

1041
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:07,560
But you can get some hints if you want to look at subgenius.com.

1042
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:17,860
Which, by the way, if you poke on the radio link, you can download every previous episode of this show going back to number 200 or so.

1043
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,360
But you really have to look.

1044
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,240
Now, we have to go.

1045
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:28,440
Because I'm going to play a song, a love song, to Bob pretty soon here.

1046
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:35,060
They can often listen to live shows on WCSB 89.3 FM in Cleveland, too.

1047
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:43,020
Just by going to, downloading the show and listening to it and grumbling and throwing crackers at the kitten.

1048
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,380
Well, that's WCSB.org.

1049
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,760
Archives the shows for like a week.

1050
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,340
A week or so.

1051
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:57,100
But subgenius.com archives the subgenius shows forever and ever and ever.

1052
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:02,100
Well, if not subgenius.com, David Bauchner does anyway.

1053
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,480
Praise Reverend St. Bauchner.

1054
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:09,100
I have never, ever thrown crackers at a kitten.

1055
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,320
No, you ain't lived, honey.

1056
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,700
You don't learn nothing.

1057
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,340
For all of the people of my village here.

1058
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,200
You know, it's the only entranceway.

1059
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:19,640
The icon.

1060
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,260
The son of Bob.

1061
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:21,800
Adorned state.

1062
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,640
Tampa V.

1063
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,180
The distance.

1064
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,520
The front.

1065
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,180
Front of the queue.

1066
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,140
And, uh, what do you think?

1067
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,360
Maybe we'll enjoy it.

1068
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,720
They call him Bob.

1069
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:39,800
Sick, walking sick and gold watch Bob.

1070
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:44,620
Every other dude looks like a slob.

1071
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,560
Compared to Bob.

1072
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:47,940
Bob.

1073
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,140
They call me Bob.

1074
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,600
Just looking good.

1075
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,260
That's my whole job.

1076
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,460
When I split down the street, I draw a mob.

1077
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,360
They follow Bob.

1078
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:03,920
Bob.

1079
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:07,260
Now, everybody.

1080
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,780
Everybody wants to have a job.

1081
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:17,580
With the one and only.

1082
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:18,240
Bob.

1083
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:18,440
Bob.

1084
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:18,960
Bob.

1085
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:19,120
Bob.

1086
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:19,380
Bob.

1087
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:19,520
Bob.

1088
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:19,980
Bob.

1089
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,000


1090
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,760
They call me Bob.

1091
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,060
Ma'am.

1092
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:24,140
Bob.

1093
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:27,080
He makes the lady's hearts all throb.

1094
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:31,480
You could always hear some poor girl's song.

1095
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,060
On the radio.

1096
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:33,800
Bob.

1097
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,320
On the radio.

1098
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,060
Bob.

1099
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:41,460


1100
