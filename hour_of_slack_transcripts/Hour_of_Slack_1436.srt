00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:10,120
Wherever you go, whatever you do, it's always wise to keep an eye open for the black and yellow public fallout shelter signs.

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,360
Each one marks a place that's been thoroughly checked for proper shielding against radioactive fallout,

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:22,520
and in many cases, already stocked with emergency food rations, water, and basic survival equipment.

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,720
Knowing where the nearest one is could save you crucial minutes in time of emergency.

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,760
If your local government has instructed you to go to a specific public shelter in event of nuclear attack,

6
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,880
find out exactly where it's located and the best way to reach it promptly.

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:48,160
Check on whether there's a shelter in or near your child's school, and if not, find out what other actions would be taken by the school authorities to protect him in emergency.

8
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:56,560
In short, take time now to make a family emergency plan, and then make sure every member of your family knows it.

Uuh?

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,900
Get the hell outta my-

tá

14
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,480
What??

15
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,400
I want to take a pardon!

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,440
That's the way of theわくわく

17
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,700

Don't know the ball

As with any art

22
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,300
As with any art

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,120
As with any art

26
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,780
I'm alone

27
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,620
You and me together

28
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,660
Everyday's gonna be alright

29
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,280
Everyday's gonna be alright

30
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,800
Everyday's gonna be alright

31
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,700
Everyday's gonna be alright

32
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,720
That's the way Bob

33
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,760
has set that system

34
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,260
to have you

35
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,860
mental slavery.

36
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,020
So if you could just free yourself

37
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,040
from mental slavery

38
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,680
that is the key.

39
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:51,480
Yeah

40
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,440
This girl

41
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,300
is on fire

42
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,000
She's walking on fire

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,220
She's walking on fire

44
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:02,660
She's walking on fire

45
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,200
This girl is on fire

46
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,480
I am the champion

47
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,120
And you're gonna hear me roar

48
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,640
I am the fighter

49
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,180
Dancing through the fire

50
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,920
I am the champion

51
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,680
And you're gonna hear me roar

52
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,660
Louder

53
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,320
Louder than the wind

54
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,560
Louder than the wind

55
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,340
Booing and screaming

56
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:42,340


57
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:42,640
bodies are shining

58
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,060
outwards

59
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,140
outwards

60
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,940
brming in

61
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,640
Like a

62
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,160
Poet

63
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,320
Poet

64
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,320


65
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,320


66
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,320


67
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,320


68
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,320


69
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,320


70
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,320


71
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,460
Better

72
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,300
Stay

73
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,120
If I ever lose my faith

74
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,640
If I ever lose my faith

75
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,820
If I ever lose my faith

76
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,400
If I ever lose my faith

77
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,040
I was driving through the Mojave Desert about ten years ago

78
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,580
when I saw a figure by the side of the road.

79
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,500
And there was a man carrying a motorcycle on his back.

80
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,840
And it was quite a sight to see.

81
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,560
And I pulled up alongside and looked at him.

82
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,940
And this guy had this, looked like a 250cc motorcycle,

83
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,880
slung across his shoulders like it was nothing,

84
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,920
was puffing on his pipe, had a big grin on his face.

85
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,260
And he looked at me and he said,

86
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,800
Yeah, man, the gas mileage.

87
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,980
Oh, the gas mileage.

88
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,100
It was something new to Bill,

89
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,620
this business of nocturnal emissions.

90
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,100
You all know what sperm is?

91
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,580
You all know what sperm is?

92
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:59,160
I don't know.

93
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,380
I don't know.

94
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,120
I don't know.

95
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,140
I don't know.

96
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:03,420
I don't know.

140
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,300
Thank you so much, G. Gordon Gordon.

141
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes, that was the great old Dr. G. Gordon Gordon ranting earlier a bit in the show.

142
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,300
There'll be more of that in future shows to come.

143
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:56,780
And thanks to the Rudy Schwartz Project, which did that long piece of freaked out music there called...

144
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,120
Uncle Pinkerton Explains.

145
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,240
Uh, yes.

146
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,980
And Phineas Narco did the shelter warning at the very beginning.

147
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:15,100
But the rest of this whole show was and will be a subgenius mix by the large.

148
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,860
Using a little bit of everything once we stop talking.

149
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,260
Freezy friends, the phone is dead.

150
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,000
Yes, the station phone is temporarily out of commission.

151
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,260
Lonesome Cowboy Dave will stay lonesome.

152
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,360
And we're lonesome.

153
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,140
But we've got you, the listener, with us.

154
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,040
Me and Princess We Are Doe.

155
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,480
Yes.

156
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,560
And we're going to read to you tonight from the best of Scrub Genius.

157
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:11,160
Scrub Genius Forum on Google Groups, which for those who don't read, but only know of Church of the Subgenius through this show and Susie the Floozy Show and Puzzling Evidence Show.

158
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,320
Yes, there's a sort of a text version of the church.

159
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,880
It started out in books.

160
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,380
Not stored in souls, but still available if you know where to look.

161
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,820
And on the Internet in various forums.

162
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,580
We don't use alt.slack on Usenet anymore.

163
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,560
We left that for the, well, you'd have to see it to believe it.

164
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:56,420
But we, the subgenius ministers, dues paying ministers, actual authorized subgeniuses, many of them use a thing called Scrub Genius, a little forum on Google Groups.

165
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,400
And a lot of people use Facebook.

166
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,080
There are a number of Facebook subgenius pages, hundreds of them unauthorized.

167
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:12,940
And by the way, I'm pretty sure that not a single one of the Bob Dobbses on Facebook are the Bob Dobbs.

168
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:18,320
Although there probably are a few people whose actual name is Bob Dobbs.

169
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,440
But mostly not the ones who say it is.

170
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,320
Anyway, yeah, there's an official subgenius.

171
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,260
Foundation Facebook page and an official church of the subgenius Facebook page.

172
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,640
You can tell they're official because they have 10 or 20,000 people involved.

173
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,480
But the best one is not official.

174
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,540
It's called Slack Hole.

175
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,880
Slack Hole 2.0 because the first Slack Hole got censored.

176
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,780
Well, somebody did something bad and they had to erase the whole thing forever.

177
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,120
But the current Slack Hole is somewhat policed.

178
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,180
And.

179
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,240
But not too policed.

180
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,400
And it's got really funny graphics and funny short talk.

181
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:09,920
If you like the funny, long, thoughtful talk and rants, such as we're about to read tonight,

182
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,440
you find those on Scrub Genius.

183
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,780
But it's members only.

184
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,820
So that probably.

185
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,120
That probably means not you, Fred.

186
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,580
Not you, Martin.

187
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,200
Not you, Bob.

188
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,180
I'm just grabbing names at random.

189
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,040
So if your name happens to be Fred or Bob or Martin, don't freak out.

190
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:39,540
Unless you never officially join the church, in which case you should be freaking out.

191
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:46,580
Oh, you should be freaking out to the very bottom of the soles of your feet.

192
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,360
And because your soul is in danger.

193
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,980
Now, let's.

194
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,920
Let's switch over.

195
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,900
We are going to go back to the media barrage by the great the large soon.

196
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,140
But first, I'd like to read this.

197
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,780
A letter from a little girl.

198
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,280
Some of you may be familiar with this.

199
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:12,800
I don't know.

200
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,520
Dear editor, I am eight years old.

201
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,920
Some of my little friends say there is no Jack the Ripper.

202
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,520
Papa says if you see it in the sun, it's so.

203
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,340
I guess that's a newspaper.

204
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,080
Please tell me the truth.

205
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,640
Is there a Jack the Ripper?

206
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,820
Virginia O'Hanlon, 115 West 95th Street.

207
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,180
And here's the answer.

208
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,840
Virginia, your little friends are wrong.

209
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,600
They've been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age.

210
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,880
They do not believe except they see.

211
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,960
They think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their little minds.

212
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,520
All minds, Virginia, whether they be men's or children's, are little.

213
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:15,720
In this great universe of ours, man is a mere insect, an ant in his intellect,

214
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,480
as compared with the boundless world about him,

215
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:24,700
as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.

216
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,860
Yes, Virginia, there is a Jack the Ripper.

217
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,300
He exists as certainly as hate and greed and evil exist.

218
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:40,000
You know that they abound and give to your life its greatest terror and misery.

219
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,160
How wonderful would be the world if there were no Jack the Ripper.

220
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,120
It would be as wonderful as if there were no Virginias.

221
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,980
There would be faith, then, poetry, romance,

222
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,480
to make tolerable this existence.

223
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,360
We should have enjoyment in sense and sight.

224
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,920
The eternal light with which childhood fills the world would be brightened.

225
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,700
Not believe in Jack the Ripper?

226
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,200
You might as well not believe in vampires!

227
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:18,600
Sure, you might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the alleys of White Chapel to catch Jack the Ripper.

228
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,400
But even if they did not see Jack the Ripper, what would that prove?

229
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:27,900
Nobody sees Jack the Ripper, but that's no sign that there is no Jack the Ripper.

230
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:33,840
The most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see.

231
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,440
Did you ever see demons dancing on a grave?

232
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,520
Of course not, but that's no proof that they're not there.

233
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:49,400
Nobody can conceive or imagine all the horrors there are unseen and unseeable in the world.

234
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,380
You may tear apart a baby to see what makes the screams inside,

235
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:01,680
but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the most mystical man

236
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:07,640
nor even the united incantations of all the most mystical men that ever lived could tear apart.

237
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:13,900
Only horror, hallucination, hatred, and madness can push aside that curtain

238
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:19,320
and view and picture the supernatural beastliness and gore beyond.

239
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,980
Is it all real?

240
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,620
Yes, Virginia.

241
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,040
In all this world, there is nothing real and abiding.

242
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,380
No Jack the Ripper?

243
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,120
Hail Satan, he lives and he lives forever.

244
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,900
A thousand years from now, Virginia, nay, ten times ten thousand years from now,

245
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,200
he will continue to rip the entrails from prostitutes everywhere.

246
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,340
By Reverend...

247
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,460
And Ride Theory.

248
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,580
Answering the question, is there a Jack the Ripper?

249
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,600
It was so beautiful.

250
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,280
It gives you faith, you know?

251
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,580
Faith in something.

252
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,800
The music in the background goes perfectly with that.

253
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,720
It's from Kenneth Anger's movie, Lucifer Rising.

254
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,220
It was recorded in a prison.

255
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,080
And one of the main musicians was one of Charlie Manson's boys.

256
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,020
Hmm.

257
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,580
And Kenneth Anger specifically told me to my face

258
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,060
that I shouldn't use this music on the Hour of Slack.

259
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:28,740
Oh.

260
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,660
But there's still a Jack the Ripper, there's still a Santa Claus,

261
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,980
and there's still a J.R. Bob Dobbs.

262
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,960
And a defiant Reverend Stang.

263
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,620
Well, um...

264
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,700
As a...

265
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,400
To quote weird Al Yankovic,

266
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,360
Al Yankovic,

267
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,280
somebody asked him,

268
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,700
aren't you ripping off the subgeniuses and Bob Dobbs,

269
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,260
this Dare to Be Stupid video?

270
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,440
As Weird Al said,

271
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,060
can't be helped.

272
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,180
So...

273
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah, all us weirdo artistes and devil worshipers and satirists

274
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,120
have to stick together.

275
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,240
Okay, let's change the music, though,

276
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,840
to Rudy Schwartz Project,

277
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,940
something evil sounding,

278
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,940
to go with this rant by...

279
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,500
the good Reverend Roger,

280
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,100
which he apparently wrote August 24th

281
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,360
of the year men call 2013.

282
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,280
Hugh men.

283
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,960
And it's a little rant called

284
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,460
The Weaponized Ape.

285
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,700
I should probably turn the volume down and lean back.

286
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,680
Because you have to yell this one, friends.

287
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,220
I am the weaponized ape.

288
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,660
I am the spun-out bearing housing,

289
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,840
the loose neutral,

290
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,940
the other half,

291
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,240
of Mama Cass's ham sandwich.

292
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,060
I am the ghost in the machine,

293
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,020
the sand in the gears,

294
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,440
the last surviving meanderthal.

295
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,620
I run on caffeine,

296
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,520
bourbon,

297
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,900
and huge parasitic worms,

298
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,320
with which I destroy public toilets forever.

299
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,220
I ain't here to save the world,

300
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,620
and I ain't here to wreck it.

301
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,020
I'm here to eat popcorn

302
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,860
while the monkeys tear themselves apart

303
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,040
in a whirlwind of righteous butthurt,

304
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,820
and for this,

305
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,700
I am philified.

306
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,440
And what of it?

307
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,360
The same people that screech at me for laughing

308
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,920
are the same people causing the problem.

309
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,680
If they liked me,

310
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,580
I'd have to re-examine my values.

311
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,880
No, I'm the man behind the hate ball.

312
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,220
The guy with the mind control lasers.

313
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,400
The jackass pointing out what's really going on.

314
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,500
The bastard braying laughter and spittle

315
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,920
in the bewildered faces of the humans.

316
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,420
The man who's been trying to get me out of this mess

317
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:50,420


318
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:50,420


319
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:50,420


320
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,320
They don't understand what went wrong

321
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,780
because they can't admit their own actions or inactions

322
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,440
made this mess.

323
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,720
I, on the other hand, understand doom.

324
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,540
And I hope you do too, brothers and sisters.

325
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,080
They don't understand,

326
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,000
and I don't expect them to understand.

327
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:14,000
Let them ignore their stupid decisions and complacency

328
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,780
and blame it all on my bad attitude.

329
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,480
The results will be the same.

330
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,860
Their mortgages will go upside down,

331
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,480
their jobs will go to Malaysia,

332
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,580
and their kids will turn to drugs

333
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,860
while these idiots pray for a solution.

334
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,480
Think on that for a minute.

335
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,080
Put yourself in God's shoes.

336
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,380
Here's all these primates, right?

337
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,220
And you give them opposable thumbs

338
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,780
and a brain designed for engineering

339
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,360
and a great big planet to live on.

340
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,560
So the first thing they do is write universal rules

341
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,940
that are designed to make them miserable.

342
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,920
Then they breathe life into their bodies.

343
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,300
They're like flies.

344
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,540
Then they take a perfectly functional golden goose

345
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,840
and have Goldman's socks slice it open from butt to breakfast

346
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,800
looking for all the golden eggs.

347
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,080
Then they insist that all these things are necessary

348
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,640
and that the problem is that they didn't do it enough.

349
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:14,240
And then they pray to you to come unscrew up everything

350
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,780
while they're continuing their efforts

351
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,520
to find new and better ways to screw up everything some more.

352
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,800
Is it any wonder that God hasn't said a word in 2000 plus years?

353
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,020
Would you?

354
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,840
Hell no, he's probably off starting over

355
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,520
somewhere with a species that doesn't start out

356
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,640
by throwing excrement at each other.

357
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,300
But wherever he is, we're here.

358
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,580
I'm here, a 240 pound monkey

359
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,560
with projectile weapons and motorized transport.

360
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,380
For I am the Weaponized Ape.

361
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,520
Or kill me.

362
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:13,100
And thank you, Reverend, the good Reverend Roger

363
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,460
for that great rant, the Weaponized Ape

364
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,360
as it appeared on Scruff Genius.com.

365
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:22,300
And thank you, The Psycho Skeletons,

366
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,460
for this little tune in the background,

367
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,820
which I think is either power trip or quantum sexy.

368
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,360
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

369
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,360


370
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,360


371
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,400
That was wonderful.

372
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,460
Well, we could go back to playing some of the largest thing

373
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,280
while we regroup.

374
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,500
The large, the large is so great.

375
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,540
Well, he is...

376
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,440
He's great.

377
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,580
He's great in size, yes.

378
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,520
Yes, great.

379
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,940
This is The Psycho Skeletons in the backyard also.

380
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,620
Oh, speaking of which, the...

381
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,340
Now, this doesn't affect the audience,

382
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,780
listeners at our darling, beloved sister stations,

383
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,400
but for the Cleveland listeners,

384
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,440
Princess Wee and I will be attending

385
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,340
the WCSB Annual Halloween Masquerade Ball.

386
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:30,840
Woo-hoo!

387
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,800
Which is always a great party.

388
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,700
Fabulous costumes, a lot of people.

389
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,340
And I've been asked to prepare a video...

390
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,680
video projections on the party's theme,

391
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,400
which is Godzilla.

392
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,320
And so I've been godzillaed and kaiju'd up like crazy

393
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,700
and assembled about five and a half hours

394
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,720
of collaged Godzilla footage,

395
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,820
best of Godzilla and a thousand and one other Japanese monsters

396
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:07,080
of the most mind-ruining designs,

397
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,400
which will all be projected on the brick ceilings

398
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,660
of the Cleveland Public Theater building.

399
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,300
Yes.

400
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,340
Well, sort of the corners of the room,

401
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,240
just to the right and left of the stage.

402
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,100
Yeah, this will be the third year we've done that.

403
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,620
But luckily, you can just leave the DVDs playing

404
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,920
and go downstairs and mingle around.

405
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,720
So, friends, if you see Bob there,

406
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,880
it's probably not the real Bob Dobbs.

407
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,480
It might be me or Princess Wee Ardo

408
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,000
in a remarkably realistic, if oversized,

409
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,140
and badly sculpted J.R. Bob Dobbs head.

410
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,740
It's not that badly sculpted.

411
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,560
You can tell.

412
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,200
See, I think those were made by a company

413
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,360
called Monster Makers near Cleveland

414
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:56,120
at the behest of the mysterious Pope Jimbo of Cleveland,

415
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,880
who we haven't heard from in a long time.

416
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,440
But you know those Dobbs heads that are all...

417
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,140
Are you guys in this cult business just for the bucks?

418
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,220
Yes.

419
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,640
I've always wanted to answer that the right way.

420
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,620
I'm sure there's a way that they could possibly

421
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:34,640
help build the best craft in England in the world,

422
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:34,760


423
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:34,760


424
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:34,760


425
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,160
And that's how well I've reached.

426
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,160


427
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,160


428
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,440
I mean, everything we've told...

429
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,120
Don't worry.

430
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:36,940
One of our two shows from Patreon

431
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:36,940


432
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,160
as we look forward to talking more

433
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,120
about different films to the next show of this year.

434
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,880
We'll be right back.

435
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:40,980
We'll be right back.

436
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,000
That's what they all say.

437
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:49,100
Friends, that's the amino acids from their new EP,

438
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,720
or actually it's a vinyl record album,

439
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,220
an albino one, albino vinyl,

440
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,440
called Theme from the Slack Hole.

441
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,240
In fact, we just heard the tune

442
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,800
Suppressive Persons Limited and Theme from the Slack Hole,

443
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,380
and the one in the background is Run, Human, Run,

444
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,240
and that is what you should do

445
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,840
because now we're going to go back to playing

446
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,980
the collage by The Large and everyone else.

447
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,200
Bye.

448
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,280
What if mom was one of us?

449
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,200
Last night, let it, let it die.

450
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,140
Last night, let it, let it die.

451
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,900
Thinking about last night, let it, let it die.

452
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,480
Bald guys with mustaches.

453
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,060
Yeah.

454
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,700
I don't think you get what this whole portraiture thing is about.

455
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,640
This is how we want to be remembered,

456
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,700
like Nefertiti and things like that.

457
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,860
This is not what actually happened to our...

458
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,480
Well, I'll get my head shot, but I'll get through the famous...

459
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,120
We're going to shock.

460
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:10,680
These are...

461
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,720
This outside...

462
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,140
This outside thing is not what I am, so...

463
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,820
We're just going to unzip it.

464
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,700
We're going to unzip our external shell

465
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,780
and show the glorified self,

466
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,160
that glorified state that we all want to...

467
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,480
Forget about the glorification,

468
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,000
about the romance.

469
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,080
Aspire to.

470
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,540
The romanticification.

471
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,400
Forget about it all.

472
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,120
Okay, I forgot.

473
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,080
Start with the real life.

474
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,920
I forgot.

475
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,700
Breaking up and stuff like that.

476
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,060
Yeah!

477
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,440
Not that useless stuff that you are used to

478
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,820
in your everyday mundane life.

479
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,700
In your mundane, stupid life.

480
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:45,980
Murder.

481
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,820
The normal life.

482
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,080
The Bob way of life.

483
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,500
The way that Bob sees you and your life.

484
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,660
Murder.

485
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,660
Wouldn't you like to be like that?

486
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,120
Wouldn't you like to be like that?

487
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,420
Oh, he's taking over the life!

488
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,800
And what is that?

489
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,560
Those three-way...

490
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,060
Murder!

491
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:08,900
Murder!

492
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,500
Murder!

493
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:10,900


494
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:11,320
Murder!

495
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:11,740
Murder!

496
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:11,820
Murder!

497
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:11,920
Murder!

498
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,360
What was that?

499
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:16,600
Well...

500
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,620
Boy, that was an enlightened caller,

501
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,100
but I don't know what happened to him.

502
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,680
Yeah, I think he went around the dark side.

503
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,720
How refreshing it was to hear that...

504
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,680
I hope he's going to be at the beautiful little

505
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,340
October Portland thing.

506
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,460
Mm, me too.

507
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,340
Because...

508
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,500
Yeah.

509
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,100
Yeah.

510
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:47,600
But what would a smart, pretty, talented young woman know about one of the scariest gums around?

511
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,020
Did you ever think that you would become addicted?

512
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,100
Not in a million years.

513
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:58,980
I never thought that any of us would ever be able to overcome every aspect of my life the way that bath salts did.

514
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,080
What was Hannah like before she got into the bath?

515
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,980
Oh, gosh.

516
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,960
Well, every parent thinks their kid's just great, but she really was very sweet, very gentle.

517
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,220
Everybody loved her.

518
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:14,480
Her grandparents adopted Hannah when their daughter, Rachel, gave birth at age 16.

519
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,420
Mother and daughter grew up more like sisters.

520
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,760
After Rachel moved to Colorado, Hannah visited her for about a month.

521
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,960
That's when they started using bulb together.

522
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,520
What did you think when you first started using it?

523
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,360
I just thought of it as almost like buying an energy drink.

524
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,240
Or sometimes in gas stations they have the vitamin packs or the energy packs, something like that.

525
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:38,540
Because that's how it felt at first, just a stimulant that gives you energy.

526
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,200
Did you ever think that you would become addicted?

527
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,200


528
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,200


529
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,200


530
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,960
Did you ever ask Hannah if she was using drugs?

531
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,740
Yes, she denied it.

532
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,220
Absolutely denied it.

533
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,620
She admitted in the past that she had tried a few things.

534
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,260
She's always been open before about the few things they had tried with friends.

535
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,580
And she's always, always, this is the hard part, she's always been so totally honest before this.

536
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,620
How quickly addicting is it?

537
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,560
Pretty quickly.

538
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:07,280
Basically, from when I first started, I had to have it every day, even though it was changing my life and my brain.

539
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:14,360
It's like a personalized hell for, you know, for whoever you are, and specified individual hell just for you.

540
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:19,480
By the time she returned home from her Colorado visit, Hannah was hooked and it was horrible.

541
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:24,980
Starting with paranoia and ramping up to hearing voices and having vivid hallucinations.

542
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,360
I thought I'd been abducted by aliens.

543
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,720
I am, the voices told me I had spiders in the back of my throat and I would see them.

544
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,280
And at one point I thought I was turning into a giant spider.

545
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,360
I felt that I had bug in my skin.

546
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,260
And they would always tell me, I'm not going to do this.

547
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,240
They would only bite me, and I would feel them bite me, if I would try to remove them.

548
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,660
Nobody feels really bad around Bob, unless you get bit by a...

549
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,540
...soul genius.

550
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,960
Power of the soul.

551
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,700
What?

552
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,280
You'll finally get to see why they call me Bob.

553
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,940
She's losing interest. She doesn't want to really go to work anymore.

554
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,560
So she starts being late to work, so eventually that job is lost.

555
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,860
She doesn't want to go back to school now.

556
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,560
And so, this is not my child anymore.

557
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,240
And it just...

558
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,000
...continues to get worse and worse.

559
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,980
Now that's former

560
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:13,980


561
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:13,980

00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:13,980


563
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:13,980


564
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:13,980


565
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:13,980


566
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:13,980

Thank you.

Thank you.

586
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,600
Well, we can learn a lot.

587
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,920
I looked at all the people I have chosen.

588
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,000
From crossing the

589
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,060
painful threshold

590
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,120
to feeling the piercing

591
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,260
ranting pain

592
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,600
multi-dotted face of J.R. Bob

593
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,040
Downs.

594
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:26,700
This is, but I don't like

595
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,560
them. Don't like whom,

596
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,340
my boy?

597
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,940
Oh, everyone.

598
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,240
Every dot in Bob's

599
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,140
face? For that is

600
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,080
what everyone is.

601
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,860
Because I am equally public in my comments.

602
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,860
And that's incredible, ladies and gentlemen.

603
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,680
That's the way it is.

604
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,200
That's truly fantastic.

605
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,840
I was just editing all that.

606
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,440
And here's a funny thought.

607
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,000
Okay.

608
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,620
And it's 9-11.

609
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,160
2009.

610
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:57,840
Friday.

611
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,500
4-51.

612
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,900
It's that big, bulbous mob again.

613
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,900
Bulging and barging into our show.

614
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,660
All real Americans love the sting of Bob Dobbs.

615
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,500
Natural fluid.

616
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,620
The sting of Bob Dobbs.

617
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,200
We have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have, we have.

618
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,060
He's out your sister yet, took you away.

619
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,500
I got your family back, but you got your smile.

620
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,440
And your clothes, it's just sister that you never wore.

621
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,060
Bye.

622
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:37,640
Yeah.

623
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,040
He's out your sister yet, took you away.

624
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,480
I got your family back, but you got your smile.

625
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:53,480
And your clothes, it's just sister that you never wore.

626
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,200
Bye.

627
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:54,640
Yeah.

628
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,180
I did.

629
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,860
I kind of sucked it up and said hi to him.

630
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,900
And he mumbled something to me.

631
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,480
And we went in this little room.

632
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,960
It was about a 12 by 12 room that I'd rented at the airport.

633
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,280
And, uh, but his, remember his face was beet red.

634
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,640
So we go in the door.

635
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,080
I shut the door, sit down.

636
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,620
Probably 12 seconds has expired.

637
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,560
And I'm looking at him and he's looking above me.

638
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,960
He's looking at the wall in back of my head.

639
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,080
And this is about 12 seconds between beet red and white as a sheet of paper.

640
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,900
He's white as 10,000 sheets of Xerox paper.

641
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,600
And then his shoulders drop.

642
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,440
And I thought he's gonna, he's having a heart attack.

643
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,200
He's gonna die on my shift.

644
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,340
I don't think this is good.

645
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,940
Or he's having a stroke or both.

646
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,580
And I start to talk and I feel this check.

647
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,840
It's almost like a hand went in front of my mouth.

648
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,140
Mike, don't say a word.

649
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:45,400
I'm taking care of this.

650
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,420
And so four or five minutes go by.

651
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,160
It seems like an eternity.

652
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,200
I don't say a word.

653
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:49,840
He doesn't either.

654
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:58,000
Then he starts to mumble and he says, uh, uh, we'll, we'll pay you.

655
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:02,760
And I thought, did, did I hear what I think I just heard?

656
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,740
And he goes, we'll pay you.

657
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,160
And then about four or five minutes later.

658
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,600
The color comes back to his face.

659
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,960
His shoulders come up and he just looks at me for the first time, somewhat friendly.

660
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,860
And he goes, I think I'll go back to Colorado.

661
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,760
And I said, Bob, okay.

662
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,000
Those are the words.

663
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,200
I only words I said was Bob.

664
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:19,580
Okay.

665
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,220
Bob.

666
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,080
Okay.

667
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:31,660
Now, uh, we're, we're still doing, uh, best of, uh, scrub genius.

668
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,480
And I have a little rant here from Reverend Nigel.

669
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:36,840
I have.

670
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,120
I can.

671
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:37,260


672
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:37,780
I can't do it justice.

673
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,920
I used to think I was screwed on a fairly regular basis.

674
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:48,460
Then I came to recognize a simple fact.

675
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:53,260
The bar by which I was being measured was crafted by people just like me.

676
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,600
So I was being measured by a measurement.

677
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:01,720
I alone had crafted for the express purpose of making people just like me feel inadequate

678
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,460
to measure the worth of anyone but themselves.

679
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,240
And, uh, that, uh, that's not.

680
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,920
was not only okay, but also the law.

681
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,560
The entire planet is faking it until they make it.

682
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,260
If you ever doubt that,

683
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,620
simply call out anyone's heartfelt,

684
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,480
inner, deep-down philosophy to the point

685
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,800
they actually have to read books to defend their position.

686
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:32,460
99.5% of them will fold like a house of cards upon challenge.

687
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:37,040
The other 0.5%, they'll pull out every intellectual stock

688
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,680
to refute your counterpoints.

689
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,200
If you actually run into that person,

690
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:47,240
you should strip down and copulate the very soul out of them

691
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,920
because you will never meet the like of them again

692
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,340
in your lifetime on this rock.

693
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,500
If it turns out you don't have anything in common,

694
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,680
at least you'll have that one burning conflict

695
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,420
that makes your breakup better than most pinks' relationships.

696
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,940
And if you do have things in common,

697
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,420
you'll likely spawn the next generation

698
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,020
of superstars.

699
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,800
Subgeniuses on planet Earth-Mars.

700
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,060
Being a subgenius doesn't require more reading.

701
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,700
It doesn't require more thinking.

702
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,160
It doesn't require even more slacking.

703
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,940
What it does demand is an unwavering devotion to the truth

704
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:26,300
and a sense as to what that responsibility means.

705
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:32,480
Knowing the truth is vastly different than believing the truth

706
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,280
and requires so much more personal commitment.

707
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,820
It's not for everyone,

708
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,660
you have to know your limits.

709
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,520
So, know as opposed to believe,

710
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,800
and you may have a chance.

711
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,160
And if that turns out to be false,

712
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,300
don't blame me, I know I'm right.

713
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,360
Thank you, Reverend Nigel.

714
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,480
And thank you, the Flyin' Ryan brothers,

715
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,320
for the music in the background.

716
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:02,240
Praise Bob.

Back to you, Bob.

Did you put Mom sleeping with Bob?

723
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,320
Where'd that come from?

724
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,180

They're too soft.

729
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:57,640
Back to you, Bob.

730
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:58,720
You're reaching.

731
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,380
I mean, why would your mom be sleeping with Bob?

732
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,120
Your dad's the perfect male specimen.

733
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,400
I don't know, but I think they are.

734
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,080
You're just looking for conflict.

735
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,820
Everything's a potential script to you.

736
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,580
Accept your perfect life.

737
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,280
It's a reality.

738
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,500
5982.

739
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:12,080
Back to you, Bob.

740
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,160
Cleanup continues to...

741
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:15,880
982.

742
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,340
Back to you, Bob.

743
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:35,820
– Bob. – Bob.

744
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:52,640
Joe.

745
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:56,440
Joe.

746
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:57,980
I'm talking to you.

747
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:58,640
You're listening to me.

748
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,360
What's the answer?

749
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,940
Then. . . . a word for my name.

750
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:02,680
Oh.

751
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:03,500
Ahem.

752
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:04,960
Ah. . . .

753
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,540
You're giving up quicker than usual, Tony.

754
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,740
Just tell me the goddamn word.

755
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:09,300
Palindrome.

756
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,260
Your name's a palindrome.

757
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:12,860
Palindrome?

758
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,780
What's that, huh?

759
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,840
You making fun of me?

760
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:17,860
Is that something bad?

761
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,000
Spelled the same way forwards and back.

762
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,580
It's like the phrase,

763
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,020
Madam and Eden, I met him.

764
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,060
It's a palindrome.

765
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,380
Ends the same way it begins.

766
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:27,820
Oh, I get it.

767
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,100
So it's like the name Bob.

768
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:31,980
That's one too, right?

769
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,640
Viva Melia.

770
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,740
Viva Melia.

771
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:53,780
Viva Melia.

772
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,700
Viva Melia.

773
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,500
Viva Melia.

774
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,540
Viva Melia.

775
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:16,720
Viva Melia.

776
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,980
Viva Melia.

777
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:20,280
Viva Melia.

778
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:23,660
Viva Melia.

779
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,700
All American family.

780
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,120
Yeah.

781
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,780
The winds go down.

782
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,060
The ripples go.

783
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,360
They all sing.

784
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,680
Jabba dabba doo.

785
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,140
Jabba dabba doo.

786
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,100
Viva Melia.

787
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,180
Viva Melia.

788
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,320
Viva Melia.

789
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:43,960
Viva Melia.

790
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,440
Viva Melia.

791
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:44,520


792
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:44,520


793
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,760
American family.

794
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:46,960
Yeah.

795
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,960
The Flintstones have

796
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,980
the rebel stuff.

797
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,240
They all say

798
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,000
yabba-dabba-doo, yabba-dabba-doo.

799
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:57,920
Yeah.

800
00:50:58,880 --> 00:50:59,240
Yeah.

801
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,560
Meet Samantha.

802
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,160
Oh my God, no. I hear people die.

803
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,560
Meet Samantha. Oh my God, no.

804
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,040
I hear people die from jiving.

805
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,220
She's a perfume-wearing, pink-loving,

806
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,240
pampered princess. I want you to do it,

807
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,180
please. Who's afraid of her own shadow.

808
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,020
Bugs scare me. Heights scare me.

809
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,060
Spores getting hurt. Oh yeah, that

810
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:20,240
scares me. Bugs scare me. Heights scare

811
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,940
me. Spores getting hurt. Oh

812
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,260
yeah, that scares me.

813
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,140
But now Samantha's ready to trade

814
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,020
in her lipstick for a different kind

815
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,720
of stick. Do you have any in pink?

816
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,020
Duh, duh, duh. And be

817
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,100
made into a fierce and fearless hard

818
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:34,760
ass tough.

819
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:36,800
It's only hands cream.

820
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,500
It's only hands cream.

821
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:41,300
I can't get hurt on that ice. Oh my gosh.

822
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,260
It's just Bob is what it is.

823
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:43,920
It's just Bob.

824
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,120
It's literally Bob.

825
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,720
When the sunshine will shine

826
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,840
together. Told you I'll

827
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,940
be here forever.

828
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,820
Said I'll always be your friend.

829
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,620
Took an oath I must to get out to the end.

830
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,360
Now that it's raining more than ever.

831
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,100
Know that we'll still have each other.

832
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,540
You can stand under my umbrella.

833
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,440
You can stand under my umbrella.

834
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:30,140
You can stand under my umbrella.

835
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:30,920
They say Bob's behind the times.

836
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,140
They say Bob can relate to the X generation.

837
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,860
Well you know what Bob says to that? To horse hockey.

838
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,880
Bob's here to set the record straight. Bob has his finger on the pulse of American youth today.

839
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,920
If Bob was an old fart, could he pound this much

840
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,120
Jagermeister this fast and not drop dead?

841
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,480
Oh no. No. Real. It's a bottle.

842
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,720
Bob's hip. Bob's with the times.

843
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,840
Bob lives up on Capitol Hill but he'd rather be in the Marsh Pit with you.

844
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,020
Bob knows what it's like to be young. To be alienated.

845
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,580
Disenfranchised and hassled by the man.

846
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,100
Bob knows who the man is. And Bob's not afraid to take the man on.

847
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,220
Running against the Democrats is a death trap. It's a suicide rap.

848
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,240
We gotta get out while we're young and baby Bob was born to run.

849
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,100
Run this country.

850
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,960
We can run and we can step to the moving car.

851
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,860
Two squares cut the gift they chose at Doc Tom for punk.

852
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,400
We can run and we can step to the moving car.

853
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,400
Two squares cut the gift they chose at Doc Tom for punk.

854
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,960
We can run and we can step to the moving car.

855
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:20,200
Two squares cut the gift they chose at Doc Tom for punks.

856
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:23,340
We can run and we can step to the moving car.

857
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,440
Two squares cut the gift they chose at Doc Tom for punk.

858
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:31,120
Too much is always better than not enough.

859
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,460
Too much is always better than not enough.

860
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,040
Too much it's always better.

861
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,440
Too much is always better.

862
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,720
Too much is always better.

863
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,120
Too much is always better.

864
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,440
But not enough.

865
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:24,460
But not enough.

866
00:54:53,900 --> 00:55:12,160
But not enough.

867
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,360
But not enough.

868
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,860
Only J.R. Bobcots!

869
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,780
Only J.R. Bobcots!

870
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,720
Only J.R. Bobcots!

871
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,380
Only J.R. Bobcots!

872
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,860
Yes, dear friends.

873
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,400
Thank you, The Large, for that.

874
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,920
By the way, The Large is located in...

875
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:43,700
Finland.

876
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,700
Did you know that?

877
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,600
No, I didn't know that.

878
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:46,900
No.

879
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,100
Now, he's one...

880
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:51,720
I don't know whether he's an American in Finland or a Fin...

881
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,100
Or what.

882
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:58,340
I often wonder if that's him talking on the Puzzling Evidence shows.

883
00:55:58,660 --> 00:55:59,900
Clips that he sends.

884
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:00,500
Mm-hmm.

885
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,420
Because that was Puzzling Evidence.

886
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,060
Dr. Hal, Dr. Philodrumon in Puzzling Evidence himself.

887
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,200
We heard several clips.

888
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,120
You're listening to The Hour of Slack.

889
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:12,920
Number one.

890
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:15,480
1,436.

891
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:16,740
Phew.

892
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,940
From the Church of the Subgenius.

893
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:24,840
For more information about the church, feel free to look at subgenius.com.

894
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,600
Dr. Sinister's show is next, at least here in Cleveland.

895
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,620
And we just got some good news for everybody all around.

896
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,260
Dr. Sinister said yes.

897
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,220
And...

898
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:40,160
So, if Reverend Bucky is listening,

899
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:42,740
you can go ahead and start...

900
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:43,800
Booking, Bucky.

901
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,700
We're very excited.

902
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:49,880
I don't want to go into what the details is, because that, you know...

903
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,240
Yeah.

904
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:50,860
Yeah.

905
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:56,780
We're going to read a newsletter from Truman Bentley Jr.

906
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,840
We'll have to save that for next time.

907
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:05,400
One of our radio subscribers, Reverend Johnson, sent this amazing rant in.

908
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,420
And we've been enjoying...

909
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,200
It's tricky to read.

910
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,160
Anyway...

911

So large.
