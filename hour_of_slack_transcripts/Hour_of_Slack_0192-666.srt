1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,520
Stay tuned please for the American Hour of Slap.

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,720
No, here it comes.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,060
Do we dare to do it?

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,020
Do we dare to turn on to Farm Road 666?

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,800
Okay, here we go.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,480
Oh, it's the bad road.

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,380
This is the bad road, Doug.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,160
I can tell because there's a Michelob truck in front of us.

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,780
And this is Dead Man's Pass.

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,480
It says you must pass here to die.

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,680
And 24 miles to Sanders.

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:52,200
And Sanders, the home of the chicken man, will be safe.

13
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,140
We'll be back on the interstate.

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:00,200
If we can just make it this far across 666.

15
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,760
You'll make it.

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,360
Yeah, well, it's easy for you to say.

17
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,940
Is it that we usually ignore the fourth dimension?

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,200
You see, we can move in the other three.

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,180
As the doctor said, up, down, forwards, backwards, sideways.

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,960
But when it comes to time, we are prisoners.

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,220
The human race lulled into a false sense of security except for one scientist.

22
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,820
Who dared probe the secret of this terrifying plan?

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,820
Reverend Ivan Stang.

24
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,240
Who dared probe the secret of this terrifying plan?

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,440
Going to destroy us.

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,980
He'll kill everyone we've got to stop now!

27
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,220
Easy, Doug, easy.

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,960
They're here, they're here, they're...

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,640
The Subgenius.

30
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,140
Hour of Swatch.

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,080
Impossible.

32
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:49,540
Unbelievable.

33
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,780
Fantastic.

34
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,620
But I tell you, it could happen.

35
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,980
It could happen.

36
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,120
It could happen.

37
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,680
It could happen.

38
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,640
Yes, it could happen.

39
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,120
THE SUBJECT OF A FALSE STORY

40
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,020
Every time I sit down on my kingdom's throne

41
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,580
I reach out for the good book that will save my soul

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,820
Save me from the lodges of conspiracy

43
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,620
Save me from the chains of time

44
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,060
Save me from the men in black

45
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,400
Never subgenius

46
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,860
The sass like praise boss

47
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,800
Praise boss

48
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,520
Praise boss

49
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,100
Praise boss

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,620
Praise boss

51
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,240
Praise boss

52
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:17,580
The soft boys read it though, he said it was really scary.

53
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,560
Good.

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,640
You have to scare some people just to get their attention.

55
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,940
Should we allow these people to find themselves in the tribulation period scared to death?

56
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,820
Or get their attention now while something can be done?

57
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,080
You know, unless you gals open your minds and your hearts

58
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,160
I'm afraid one of these days you're going to be in for a rude awakening.

59
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,580
Yes, no kidding.

60
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,760
A rude awakening indeed.

61
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,940
And you can have that rude awakening.

62
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,580
Please, please do.

63
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,000
By continuing to listen to the word of Bob here coming up.

64
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,080
Oh, it's okay honey.

65
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,220
No problem.

66
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,820
Just call Will here.

67
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,520
823-7490

68
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,720
Father turned against son.

69
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,840
People changed into strange weird animals.

70
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,440
Capturing humans at will for their own sinister purposes.

71
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,580
Turning them into diabolical instruments of destruction.

72
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,000
We're fantastic beings of a super intelligence.

73
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,440
Ruling a race of synthetic humans.

74
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,600
And pitting them against mankind's dream to conquer the universe.

75
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,180
Patty Jo Myers.

76
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,160
Do you wish to renounce your faith in your God?

77
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,000
And receive your identification?

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,300
Either on your right hand or in your forehead.

79
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,060
As set forth by Brother Christopher in Article 17A.

80
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,180
If so, answer I do.

81
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,160
And you will be returned to your rightful place in society.

82
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,860
And he has power to give life unto the image of the beast.

83
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,080
That the image of the beast should both speak

84
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,700
and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.

85
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,580
Because of all.

86
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,980
Both small and great.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,520
Rich and poor.

88
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,480
Free and enslaved.

89
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,740
To receive a mark.

90
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,640
In their right hand.

91
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,680
Or in their foreheads.

92
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,740
And that no man might buy or sell except he that has the mark.

93
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,520
Or the name of the beast.

94
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,400
Or the number of his name.

95
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,020
Mark.

96
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,820
Name of the beast.

97
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,400
Or the number.

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,780
Of his name.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,500
Here is wisdom.

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,600
Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast.

101
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,560
For it is the number of a man.

102
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,520
The number of a man.

103
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,920
His number is six hundred three score and six.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,720
I want the mark.

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,340
I want the mark.

106
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,760
I want the mark.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,720
The mark.

108
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,920
The mark.

109
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,680
There is no escape for me.

110
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,500

111
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,660

Your death will be indescribable

113
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,220
Fool humans there is no escape.

Pray for these people.

We all need to love and pray for these people as they continue to spread life

152
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,300
through the community.

153
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:44,260
They have cast out lepers containing many lives and attacking the church and Christians.

154
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,080

I lost both he and his mother.

169
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,620
My husband was a Christian.

170
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,920
Five days after he disappeared,

171
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,380
Billy was born.

172
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,120

Oh, God, give me strength.

I'll fight it off.

176
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,360
I'm not afraid.

177
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,920
And I run out across the road,

178
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,280

I summon all of you to attend.

183
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,280
Be silent, all of you.

184
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,900
I've opened the surface of the earth.

185
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,800
It's time to attack.

186
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,240
I've given the earthlings an ultimatum.

187
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,260
Either they agree...

188
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,340
...to become my slaves,

189
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,740
or they'll be destroyed.

190
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,960
What if someone were not a believer?

191
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,580
My advice to that person would be

192
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,960
stay alive as long as possible.

193
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,040
God is a groovy guy, huh?

194
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,000
Get down.

195
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,920
God is a groovy guy, huh?

196
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:01,780
Good God.

197
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,540
He sits up there so high in the sky,

198
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,680
examining everything,

199
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,260
with a smile on his face.

200
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:06,260


201
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,340
He's got that critical eye.

202
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,560
If a sparrow falls,

203
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,100
he wants to know the reason why.

204
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,100
Cause God is a groovy guy, huh?

205
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,080
Get down.

206
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,020
God is a groovy guy, huh?

207
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,860
Good God.

208
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,060
If you find yourself hungry,

209
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,520
he'll send you a famine.

210
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,840
If you find yourself thirsty,

211
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,200
he'll send you a drought.

212
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,460
If you bother to complain,

213
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,920
he'll break your fingers.

214
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,060
Cause God is a groovy guy, huh?

215
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,940
Get down.

216
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,940
God is a groovy guy, huh?

217
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,820
Good God.

218
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,900
From the moment you're conceived,

219
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,280
you're on parole.

220
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,900
There's no plea, bargain, or way.

221
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,360
The sin's in your soul.

222
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,720
If you try to make amends,

223
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,200
you'll just dig a deeper hole.

224
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,240
Cause God is a groovy guy, huh?

225
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,180
Get down.

226
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,160
God is a groovy guy, huh?

227
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,020
Good God.

228
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,780
You can't run and you can't hide.

229
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,600
Cause if you do, your bacon is fried.

230
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,440
God knows everything that you do.

231
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,460
He's just like Santa Claus, huh?

232
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,380
Get down.

233
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,360
He's just like Santa Claus, huh?

234
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,300
Good God.

235
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,280
God is everywhere.

236
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,660
God is everywhere.

237
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,880
He's in your sight.

238
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,300
He's in your solid ball.

239
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,820
He's in your pubic hair.

240
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,340
He's crouching in the closet.

241
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,780
He's lurking in the restroom.

242
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,100
He's hanging from the ceiling.

243
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,740
He's under every fork and spoon.

244
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,860
He's pushing you when you're old.

245
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,360
He's pulling you when you're a-bawning.

246
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,900
He's in the thick yellow crust

247
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,920
that you find in your eyes

248
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,940
when you first wake up in the morning.

249
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,480
He will take you to the cleaners

250
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,500
if you covet your neighbors.

251
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,880
Why, if he'll give you a rabbit punch,

252
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,300
if you make a graven image,

253
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:35,880
you'll shiver.

254
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,460
He'll short sheet your bed

255
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,640
if you bear false witness.

256
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,060
He'll rack you up and string you out.

257
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,900
He'll break your jaw and give you gout.

258
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,540
He'll visit you with locusts.

259
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,760
He'll visit you with plague.

260
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,200
He'll visit your apartment,

261
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,620
steal your spoons and break your legs.

262
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,320
He'll cover you with cooking oil

263
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,380
and burn you on a spit.

264
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,100
He'll loosen up your bowels

265
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,300
and then rub your nose in it.

266
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,740
He'll fill your heart with hope

267
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,100
and then he'll take it all away.

268
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,920
He'll stop and crush your testicles

269
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,040
while you try to pray.

270
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,420
Put glass under your tire,

271
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,880
put some sugar in your tank,

272
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,260
make you stand in long lines.

273
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,620
He'll have to mark you at the bank.

274
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,200
He'll fill you with diseases

275
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,520
and make your teeth turn brown.

276
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,080
He'll be eaten up by maggots

277
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,320
when you're six feet underground.

278
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,140
He does all these things

279
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,860
cause he loves everybody.

280
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,800
If you disagree,

281
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,340
he'll break every bone in your body.

282
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,500
Cause God is a groovy guy.

283
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,060
Uh-huh.

284
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,160
Get down.

285
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,640
Uh, that was Fish Karma,

286
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,120
and this is Doctors for Bob.

287
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,260
As the doctor said.

288
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,400
You can't hide from God

289
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,680
cause he's bigger than you.

290
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,840
Help me, somebody.

291
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,080
You can't hide from God

292
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,860
cause he's bigger than the whole planet.

293
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,900
You can't hide from God.

294
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,260
He's bigger than all the universe.

295
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,260
You can't hide from God

296
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,620
cause he's bigger than all infinity.

297
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,500
He's bigger than all reality.

298
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,780
Help me, somebody.

299
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,800
You can't hide from God.

300
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,260
You can't hide from God and the reefer.

301
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,680
You can't hide from God and a glass of alcohol.

302
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,420
You can't hide from God and a pussy.

303
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,840
Cause he's bigger than you.

304
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,960
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs cause he's stupider than you are.

305
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:12,740
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs cause he's got more black and white little dots in his face than you do.

306
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:22,120
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs cause his face has been mimeographed and put up in more places than yours has.

307
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,380
You can't hide from God.

308
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,480
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs cause more people worship him than worship you.

309
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,460
You can't hide from Dobbs cause he's stupider than you are.

310
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,420
Who the hell is somebody?

311
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,760
You can't run from your own legs.

312
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,880
How you gonna run from your own legs?

313
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,340
Cause if you run from your own legs, where you gonna run from them with?

314
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,220
If you use them to run.

315
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,400
Run from them with.

316
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,920
Where you gonna run away from?

317
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,180
You can't run from your own legs.

318
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,200
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs cause he's stupider than you.

319
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,460
You can't hide from God cause he's bigger than you.

320
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,740
He's bigger than all reality.

321
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,940
He's bigger than all infinity.

322
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,260
Help me somebody.

323
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,540
She ain't got no legs.

324
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,820
Pull the lever down and go.

325
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,960
My legs are on fire.

326
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,560
I need some help.

327
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,000
Praise God.

328
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,060
Oh my poor little pain!

329
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,540
Please help me a little!

330
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:35,540
That's what it's like to grab the bunun con Kubernetes

331
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:35,540


332
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:35,540


333
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:35,540


334
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,780
You can't washsoap.

335
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,760
How you gonna wash soap?

336
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,140
You gonna try to cut it in half and rub the two ends together?

337
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,860
You can't wash soap!

338
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,020
You gonna try to throw it in the washing machine?

339
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,560
You gonna try to slide it through a car wash?

340
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,720
You can't wash soap.

341
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,540
But let's leave things of this world behind

342
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,820
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack

343
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,280
from the Church of the Subgenius.

344
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,220
Oh, yes, praise Bob, friend.

345
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,020
This is Reverend Ivan Stang.

346
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,600
Come to tell you the truth, the truth about the path to slack

347
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,740
through hyperventilation.

348
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,200
Yes, my friend, you can get high from hyperventilation.

349
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,320
And it's legal, and it's an exercise we're preaching.

350
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,840
And if you can learn to talk like me and talk this way all the time,

351
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,640
then everybody you meet will be your friend.

352
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,560
And you will get so high, you will get so high, you will meet Bob.

353
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,760
You will not be able to stop seeing Bob

354
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,940
because you will have so much slack in your brain

355
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,140
there won't be any more room for thoughts.

356
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,140
And when your mind is free of free thoughts,

357
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:42,720
you will be free.

358
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,120
Then you will have the slack, the slack you need in your life.

359
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,980
Praise Bob. Help me, somebody.

360
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,540
Do I hear a praise Bob?

361
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,960
Let there be slack.

362
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:34,620
Not some high music all over America,

363
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:34,700
thisゞ

364
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:42,580
people. Pray for these people. Pray for these people.

365
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,760
See, Bob is a salesman, and Bob is going to try to prevent the planet Earth from being sold.

366
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:57,500
So when Bob goes to talk to these men from Planet X, he has to have a representative constituency here on Earth.

367
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,620
Because the men from Planet X, well, they're businessmen. Pure and simple businessmen.

368
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,120
And they're going to say, Bob, your proposal sounds good, but I've got to see numbers.

369
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,340
I've got to see hard data. Show me the numbers of subgenius on this Earth, and it's your planet.

370
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,220
And we'll know it's worth saving. See, that's Bob's job, is to...

371
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:22,200
Someone's got to explain to those aliens, in ways they can understand, why the human race is the way it is,

372
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,260
so that they don't put us out of our midst.

373
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,220
And they understand the bottom line.

374
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,360
Which is why we're the world's first industrial church, the church of love and money.

375
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,600
It certainly is.

376
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,800
Bob, of course, studied 18 months longer than I.

377
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,340
Bob, where have you trained?

378
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:41,440
Well, I had calculus and logarithms in elementary school in Washington, USA.

379
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:45,380
Then I spent one year in the Space Flight Center at Houston, USA.

380
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,320
Another year in Moscow on advanced power and propulsion systems.

381
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,000
Six months in England at the Academy of Celestial Navigation.

382
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,440
And then back to Houston for advanced computer technology.

383
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,500
Bob?

384
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,440
Bob?

385
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,440
Bob?

386
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,980
The message is now part of and registered in every U.C.G.

387
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,400
Ahhhh.

388
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,880
And, uh, yes, dear friends, well, ye, uh, uh, regular listeners may be wondering

389
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,600
why we're not continuing the, uh, story of how we spent our lives in the Earth.

390
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:39,260
family vacation last time. This time. And well, I don't know. I got home from last week's show

391
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:44,540
and thought to myself, that was a pretty crummy show. And I said to my wife, you know, I don't

392
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:50,180
know if that show was all that good. And wives, of course, are supposed to say, oh, it was perfectly

393
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:57,780
good. It was great. But no, a subgenius wife says, you're right. It wasn't that good. It was okay.

394
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:08,660
Okay. So I'm going to blow off the endless travelogue. We're obviously working on the

395
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:19,020
theme of 666 or 999 for those of you who are more optimistic. The number of the beast versus

396
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:27,760
the number of Bobby. And, uh, oh, oh, I, now I remember why I came on the show.

397
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:33,920
I've got to flip a tape. It's funny. You could just get on the air and just continue talking and

398
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:41,580
talking, but, uh, and you can, you can too, friends, you can too. You can call the Willa Dobbs here

399
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:48,320
and find out just what in the hell we're talking about. I bet you started to wonder about now,

400
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,920
if this is the first time you happen to tune into this show going, what, what's that show?

401
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,600
Well, it's the subgenius radio ministry hour.

402
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,720
We're of Slack here on KNON and affiliated stations.

403
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:09,440
In the meantime, I'm sure I could probably think of something important, significant,

404
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:15,940
something with socially redeeming value to say, but you know, even if I could, I don't,

405
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:20,580
I don't know if I'd want to, are you worth it? Well, you'll have to prove that friend.

406
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,840
You're going to have to write to Bob. You're going to have to tell him exactly what you think.

407
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,760
We want to know.

408
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,680
Don't call.

409
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:33,340
Don't tell the station when, uh, we're not here and cuss about us. Call us and cuss about us.

410
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,640
Don't tell the station manager what we've been doing, whatever you do. Okay.

411
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:46,160
And, uh, Oh, welcome to our, our guest here, uh, who you're not hearing, uh, Reverend Gazecki from

412
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:53,140
Los Angeles, who has come into, um, uh, uh, take notes on just, uh, what we're doing,

413
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,520
why we're doing it and, uh, possibly, I guess, give it to the, uh,

414
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,760
the great finger in the sky, which rules us all, but probably not.

415
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:09,400
That's an inside joke friends. And, and I know that you want to know what all those inside jokes are about.

416
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,280
Don't you? Well, just stay tuned and, uh, you'll be more confused than ever. Thank y'all.

417
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,280
.

418
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:25,880
.

419
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:25,880


420
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:25,880


421
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,440
I get it.

422
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:35,240
You leave it up to, uh, friends. I want to explain to you why they call it subgenius.

423
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:45,380
Um, this guy's helping to tell me, tell you and me both, uh, subgenius by definition, of course,

424
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:51,740
means just below a genius or anything below a genius could be an amoeba.

425
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,560
You know, anybody can qualify, obviously.

426
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:01,520
And I have, um, by, actually by miscuing this tape.

427
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,240
Let's see.

428
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,120
I had, funny to hear all that Chinese.

429
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:05,820
.

430
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,840
I don't sleep.

431
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,680
64 years into the terrifying future, a beautiful, horrible cave world you've never dreamed of.

432
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:22,380
That unleashes a hurricane of power to almost completely shield you from outside sound and shock.

433
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,420
.

434
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:23,980
.

435
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:23,980


436
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,960
I'm a dumb, 라는 landowner.

437
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,240
The thing is, I've still got over-

438
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
.

439
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,240


440
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,720
. time.

441
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,600
cosmic plague. A new Adam and Eve are the only male and female left to repopulate the world.

442
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:08,120
I value my freedom more than this. The jealousy of a she-devil frees the bloodthirsty killer slaves.

443
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:13,420
Follow me, soldiers of revenge! The last survivors of the human race are doomed to murder

444
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:19,840
in a killer orgy by vicious subhuman retents. Will you die 64 years from today?

445
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:29,100
After the Christians disappeared, life just went on. There wasn't much different at first.

446
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:39,220
But then, I'm afraid. I don't know why we're here. I know how you feel. The same thing happened to me.

447
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,300
But you want to know something? I'm not afraid anymore.

448
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,520
Well, I was walking down the street, looking for a job.

449
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,820
I ran to the grocery store. I was looking for a job. I was looking for a job.

450
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:49,820


451
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,320
I ran into a man. Called himself Bob. Well, I forgot. I forgot I even needed a job.

452
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,120
It's all happened to me when I ran into a guy named Bob.

453
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:12,040
I was fresh in town. Didn't have a dollar. I was so poor, I was starting to holler.

454
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,200
Then I ran into a man. Called himself Bob.

455
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,600
And I plumb forgot about the fact I had no money and no time.

456
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:31,680
Well, Bob is hot. Bob is cold. Bob is young. Bob is old.

457
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,820
But I forgot. I forgot I needed to know anything else.

458
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:42,200
I just took my own personality and put it up on the shelf.

459
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,180
I just took my own personality and put it up on the shelf.

460
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:10,840
Dad for real now?

461
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:11,600


462
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:11,600


463
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:11,600


464
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,940
Kept set?

465
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:13,940


466
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,040
got no legs, pull the lever and down you go. Preacher, my legs are on fire and each

467
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,260
man needs to have praise jobs.

468
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:31,040
Jesus said in John 14, 6, I am the way, the truth, and the life. And no man cometh to

469
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,700
the Father but by me.

470
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:41,920
He weighed 20 pounds and was hairy as a monkey. When he was 10 years old, he was big as I

471
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:50,600
was. Accidents were happening all the time. Dogs falling in the well. I even found chickens

472
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:56,100
with their heads bit off. I knew he'd done it. I hit him with a tire and I split his

473
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,140
face wide open. I thought I'd killed him.

474
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:08,340
Bob's brain, so damn big. He'll make you look like a greasy little pig. Oh, you'll forget

475
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,020
about your whole personality.

476
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:22,060
As soon as you give your entire brain to Bob and me. If you're young and you're looking

477
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:28,960
for a job, just look for a guy whose name is Bob and you won't have to worry about getting

478
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:39,620
a job. You won't have no money, but you'll have Bob. Yes, you'll have Bob.

479
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,740
It would be

480
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:41,900
beautiful.

481
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,940
If it was neutral to fight them with military power, it would lead to defeat. The end of

482
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,380
civilization.

483
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:52,800
And once you start seeing it and looking at it and see the game they play, none of you

484
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,120
want to deal with reality because you're all hooked up into that other thing. Well, you're

485
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,480
fixing to lose all that mess.

486
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:07,300
They use their tongues to deceive. The venom of snakes is under their lips. Their mouths

487
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:11,900
are full of bitterness and curses. And in their paths, nothing but rage.

488
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:23,760
They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders. They have recruited the rich and

489
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,900
the powerful. And they have blinded us to the truth. Our human spirit is corrupted.

490
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:40,340
Why do we worship greed? Because outside the limit of our sight, feeding off us, perched

491
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,900
on top of us from bed to bed, we are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the

492
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,160
frightening.

493
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:52,200
They prey on us, not us. I'm telling you, the rebellion is at the top, not us.

494
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,480
Yet at the very top, they devour us.

495
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,100
Our Всемur wollen uns sch consortium.

496
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,500
We bite their tongue- Mud Made exercise've gl Schars laufen.

497
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


498
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


499
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


500
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


501
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:05,200
Can't digest your own stomach? You're going to digest your own stomach? You are not a

502
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,340
man or woman in auditorium or in hall tonight who can digest their own stomach? You can't

503
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,880
digest you own stomach, you can't swim through it. You can't drink alcohol or even drink

504
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:11,880


505
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,000
wallow your own throat. You can't run from your own legs. You can't hide from Jarabai Dobbs because

506
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,400
he's stupider than you. You can't hide from God because he's bigger than you. He's bigger than all reality.

507
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:28,460
Help me somebody. Pull the lever down and go. Preacher, my legs are on fire. Need some help? Need some help?

508
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,540
Praise Dobbs.

509
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:40,720
That's not my bar. That's not my bar. That's not my bar. That's not my bar.

510
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:50,520
That's not my bar. That's not my bar. That's not my bar. That's not my bar.

511
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,740
But still you can't forget that you're alone. An outsider.

512
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:00,280
Ginny thinks that she has the key to popularity. Parking in cars with the boys at night.

513
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:06,100
When Jerry brags about taking Ginny out, he learns that she dates all the boys.

514
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,160
And he feels less important.

515
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,660
What about Ginny?

516
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,140
Bill.

517
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,960
Does that make her really popular?

518
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,120
Here, Ginny.

519
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:20,380
No. Girls who park in cars are not really popular. Not even with the boys they park with.

520
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:26,600
Is it because they like the way she looks and dresses? Because she seems as interested in girls as in boys?

521
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:32,720
Because they've heard no scandal about her? Perhaps they'll bring another couple home with them. That would be fun.

522
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,680
But what about the rich guy who does nothing while I do the work?

523
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,120
The Rich Guy

524
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:53,000
In order to protect our freedoms, American Labor, Management, and Capital, the greatest production team in the history of mankind, have made the United States the industrial master of the world.

525
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,200
The Rich Guy

526
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,200


527
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,520
Bill.

528
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,380
Bill.

529
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:57,740
Bill.

530
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:57,900


531
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:57,980
Bill.

532
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,140
Bill.

534
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:34,500
The true education facilities is in the top of your head.

535
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,120
Not in no college or university.

536
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,160
Controlled by the same force that controls the universe.

537
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,340
You can't wet water.

538
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,840
Water is already as wet as it can possibly get.

539
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,220
You can pour water on water but you're just going to have more water.

540
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,420
You can't wet water.

541
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,280
You can't digest your own stomach.

542
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,480
You can't swallow your own throat.

543
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,560
You can't run from your own legs.

544
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,180
You can't hide from Gerald Bob Dobbs because he's stupider than you.

545
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,420
You can't hide from Guy because he's bigger than you.

546
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,520
He's bigger than all reality.

547
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,280
Help me somebody.

548
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,060
Mobile every day.

549
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,560
Down you go.

550
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,900
My legs are on fire.

551
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,660
Need some help?

552
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,240
Need some help?

553
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,420
Great job.

554
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,400
Then Joe will come.

555
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,640
He will continue to be the king of the workers of the world.

556
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,660
You said it brother.

557
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,560
Tenacide.

558
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,940
Tenacide.

559
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,040
Tenacide.

560
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,000
Tenacide.

561
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,680
My leg.

562
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:42,400
So you see, it would have been better if I had died in the hospital than to look the

563
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:42,960
way I do.

564
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:50,740
I couldn't even go to Nick's funeral or the funerals of all those people in the other

565
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,000
car.

566
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,120
I didn't know.

567
00:35:53,060 --> 00:36:00,020
And I, as I said before, I've had my last date.

568
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,100
This boy and girl coming home from school look quite content with life.

569
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,320
And why not?

570
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,980
They're looking forward to an important date.

571
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,840
I think I know.

572
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,940
I don't know.

573
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,300
I think I know.

574
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:19,880


575
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:20,260


576
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:20,580
I don't know.

577
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:20,980
I don't know.

578
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:20,980


579
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:20,980

00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:20,980


581
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,180
I think I know.

582
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,460
Do you?

583
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,920
I don't know.

584
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:29,920


585
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:30,460


586
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:30,460


587
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:30,460


588
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,460
Ah would you like a bite?

589
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,380
Just kidding.

590
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:34,380

593
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,080
Fuck that.

594
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,080

599
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,480
and a side order of french fries with white gravy.

600
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,200
Damn good grub.

601
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,680
When I left, I noticed the fry cook was talking to the waitress.

602
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,700
He was kind of a tall, distinguished-looking guy for a fry cook

603
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,840
and was smoking a pint.

604
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,600
Pleasant-looking fellow.

605
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,120
I noticed his name, Bob, in a stitched monogram on his white fry cook shirt.

606
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:24,040
Well, I went out into the cool Texas night and drove off into the future.

607
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,100
I never caught Doc Burrows.

608
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,920
I missed Jack Kerouac.

609
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,100
Before I knew it, I was too old to wear my hair long

610
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,020
without feeling self-conscious about it.

611
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,560
So I was pretty much of an outcast.

612
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,380
I couldn't find my social niche.

613
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,160
Where was my peer group?

614
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,800
I was irrevocably trapped between hipster and hippie.

615
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,820
The new-age mutants were trying to out-punk me,

616
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,620
snapping at my heels.

617
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,960
My life came apart.

618
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,540
I turned to drugs and it all went downhill.

619
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,440
And then one day I saw that face again, looking at me from a page.

620
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,780
Hey, I said, I've seen that guy before.

621
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,920
Maybe I'm just having an acid flashback.

622
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,100
I found out it was a man named Bob.

623
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,080
Bob Dobbs from Dallas, Texas.

624
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,300
And suddenly the complex pieces of the puzzle

625
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:27,400
that I'd been accumulating for 25 years in the back of my head

626
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,560
all dropped into place.

627
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,700
I sent them all my money.

628
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,400
They sent me the word Bob.

629
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,740
And now I know exactly what I am

630
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,680
and how I came to be that way.

631
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,380
And now I work only for Bob and the church.

632
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,540
And now I can tell people what I do for a living

633
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,200
without being ashamed.

634
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,360
And that's how this song came into being.

Until that X day

681
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:27,400
Oh yes, friends, it's the Bob Rogers revival in downtown Dallas, Texas tonight.

682
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

683
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,640
Right, Buck.

684
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:35,460
We've got these traditions and we do these things and we have these revivals regularly and irregularly as possible.

685
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,760
Yeah, irregularly is right.

686
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,020
Thanks, that was Buck naked in the Jaybirds, the very last little thing there.

687
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,540
I think before we, we're running into our last 15 minutes of slack.

688
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,820
And I should give some credits before I forget.

689
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,960
We've been hearing a lot of media barrage tonight.

690
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,460
Like I say, I wasn't going to spout.

691
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,780
It didn't work last time.

692
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,280
So I chickened out, man.

693
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,180
I chickened out.

694
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:03,880
I ain't going to do it again.

695
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:13,000
Nancy Regalia sent a new media barrage called Signs of the End Times.

696
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,920
Which I've been using a lot of here.

697
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:21,600
Nancy, by the way, has a book out this week called Sunglasses After Dark.

698
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,000
An erotic horror novel, dear friends.

699
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,640
Which you'll probably enjoy.

700
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,940
I haven't actually read it yet, but no doubt, no doubt at all.

701
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,980
It's a wonderful, sick thing.

702
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,100
Something to read the kids.

703
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,760
It's under her fake human name of Nancy.

704
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,800
Look for Sunglasses After Dark by Nancy Collins.

705
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,740
I have a dead cat on the line.

706
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,700
I have a dead cat on the line.

707
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,820
The society is moving like it's hot.

708
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,240
And there's a dead cat on the line.

709
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,760
They tell me that once upon a time,

710
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,140
they had some chump trying to get a message over the telegram box.

711
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,500
The company sent a man out to inspect the line.

712
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:35,860
In making his report, he said that he found that a cat had gone up the telegraph pole

713
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,840
and died on the line.

714
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,820
And that was the reason why they couldn't get the message over the line.

715
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:51,920
What we don't see is so.

716
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,680
They didn't have the cursive for it to envie the

717
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,060
people to go to the station, right?

718
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,460
Listen to what's under her fake human name name after that.

719
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,440
They tell me that you are her father?

720
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:03,900
Listen to what they tell you.

721
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,320
Anytime you are here, you get the same thing.

722
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:07,320


723
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:07,320


724
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:07,340
What pelo?

725
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,060
Yeah.

726
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,400
It doesn't matter whether your child's famous, your mother or not.

727
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,940
She knows that it's her child.

728
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,440
I suppose then you know your children's father?

729
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,540
Well, yes, I think I know my last children's father.

730
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,000
Yeah, you think you know.

731
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,940
Well, you may not know.

732
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,160
But if you don't know, you've got the last word on the plate.

733
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,820
I am one man that thinks all children.

734
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,820
Just feel the left palm.

735
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,420
All right.

736
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,400
Did you hear me?

737
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:49,760
Yeah.

738
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,160
Oh, yeah.

739
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,180
I think that's enough.

740
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:55,420
Well, don't say that.

741
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,420
I got one child on the field me and so.

742
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:57,900
Hmm?

743
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,800
No, sir, don't say that.

744
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,640
And don't talk like it.

745
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,160
No, sir.

746
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,760
And don't talk like it.

747
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,160
No, sir.

748
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,980
Have that color like it.

749
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,440
No, sir.

750
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,540
But there's a dead cat on the line.

751
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,060
That's right.

752
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,240
I agree.

753
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:12,900
That's right.

754
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:13,260
Absolutely.

755
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,960
That was DK Jones.

756
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,520
And this is Glass Madness, dear friends.

757
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,800
You've been hearing him singing all along here.

758
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,120
Well, I just got a little shirt to me sent to me by Bob.

759
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,760
Bob sent me a subgenius T-shirt, and I'm so damn proud I'm wearing it.

760
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,880
And I just got to sing a song.

761
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:35,700
I'm wearing the T-shirt that Bob Dove sent me.

762
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,800
It came to me in the mail.

763
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:49,480
When I'm wearing the shirt that Bob Dove sent me.

764
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:58,840
Nothing I do is going to fail.

765
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:07,760
I'm wearing the T-shirt that Bob Dove sent me.

766
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,160
It came.

767
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,440
It came to me in the mail.

768
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:15,720
Ow.

769
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:23,180
And when I'm wearing the T-shirt that Bob Dove sent me.

770
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,960
Oh, yes.

771
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:32,240
I know I'll never land in jail.

772
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,860
Don't you wish, Jimmy.

773
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,280
Oh, yeah.

774
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,700
I'm wearing the T-shirt that Bob Dove sent me.

775
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,020
It came to me in the mail.

776
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,000
And you can get one, too, dear friends.

777
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,940
When I'm wearing the T-shirt that Bob Dove sent me.

778
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,440
But you've got to know where to look.

779
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,880
Me, me, me sent me.

780
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,260
Nothing that I do can fail.

781
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,680
When I'm wearing the T-shirt that Bob Dove sent me.

782
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,520
Nothing that I do can fail.

783
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,320
When I'm wearing the T-shirt that Bob Dove sent me.

784
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,400
What is that red button over there, dear?

785
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,900
Go ahead, please.

786
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:07,300
Hmm.

787
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,400
.

788
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,820
Kill me or kill me.

789
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,280
Or kill me.

790
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,860
We don't care if you kill us or not kill us or...

791
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,540
We can kill you or not you.

792
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:19,940
Yeah, yeah.

793
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:20,660
That's the other side of it.

794
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,140
We don't want to look at it that way, too.

795
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:28,040
You can kill me, Sarge, and I just want you to know that that'll be dammit fine.

796
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,220
See, if you wish you like to kill, you told us that's all.

797
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,000
Kill, kill for the love of killing.

798
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,620
Kill for the love of Kylie.

799
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,120
We kill to be free.

800
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,320
We kill for fun.

801
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:38,380
We kill for fun.

802
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:38,380


803
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:38,380


804
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:38,380


805
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:38,380


806
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:38,380


807
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:38,380


808
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:38,380


809
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:38,380


810
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,220
We kill to be men. We make America free.

811
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,300
We kill for profit.

812
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,980
Well, that's a real nice, sentimental story, but personally, I think it's a lie.

813
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,680
We kill. Kill for the love of killing. Kill for the love of Kali.

814
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,680
Kill for fun. Kill to stay free. We make America great.

815
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,120
You're still making them Doctors for Wotan tapes, and they ain't killed you yet?

816
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:04,260
My God, haven't we strayed so far from the Bible

817
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,420
that Doctors for Wotan can make tapes day in and day out without anybody killing them?

818
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,040
My God, what depths have we sunk. What depths have we sunk to in this nation?

819
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:21,460
No, sir. As a matter of fact, in the Bible it says that I come as a sword, not as a...

820
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:22,680
I read it. I read it.

821
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,240
...tickle-weezy-lick flower, and I'm gonna kill the hell out of everybody I can get my hands on.

822
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:27,540
I read it. I read it.

823
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:32,000
I hear they cast some money changers out of the temple and took over the damn record album.

824
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,860
Mr. Graham, is it true that Doctors for Wotan...

825
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:34,200
Fine. Fine.

826
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,740
...are still making tapes?

827
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,480
Oh, we're with the...

828
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,980
Dear Billy Graham, is Doctors for Wotan still making tapes?

829
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,200
Because if they are, they have to follow our work.

830
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,800
Well, we can get our followers to do whatever we want anyway.

831
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,220
Well, I sent my money to Doctors for Wotan.

832
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,640
They're kind of...

833
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,120
Billy Graham.

834
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,600
...could I still go to heaven?

835
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,060
You're still...

836
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:53,840
...gotten a father...

837
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,580
You're still...

838
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,580
...the message has been brought to you by the...

839
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,780
You're still preaching that Dobbs dogma...

840
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,840
...now we shall pray.

841
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,800
...and they ain't killed you yet?

842
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,380
Oh, my God.

843
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,240
...we gave you...

844
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,900
Hold it, Wotan, you broke family.

845
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:07,740
Do it.

846
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,620
Hold it, Wotan, you broke family.

847
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,340
Do it.

848
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,080
Hold it, Wotan, you broke family.

849
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:14,840
Do it.

850
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,300
Hold it, Wotan, you broke family.

851
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:17,900
Do it.

852
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,100
Hold it, Wotan, you broke family.

853
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:20,600
Do it.

854
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,700
Hold it, Wotan, you broke family.

855
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,200
Do it.

856
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,060
Hold it, Wotan, you broke family.

857
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:25,460
Hold it...

858
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:25,720
Well, Daddy, that has been...

859
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,040
...Roger, well done, then.

860
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,040


861
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,160
...in this case.

862
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:27,180
Yeah

863
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,160
...とても遺失物 escape easy.

864
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:34,180
Good luck, Wotan Hood.

865
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:34,220
Good luck, Wotan Hood.

866
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,360
I just want to die

867
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,580
Oh, please kill me

868
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:25,340
I just want to feel the veil of broken glass in my veins

869
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,220
Oh, I just want to die for a new best

870
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,380
Oh, I just want to kill for a new best

871
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,420
I don't want to hear another word about Bob

872
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,640
I just want to die

873
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,720
Oh, I just want to die

874
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,540
Oh, I just want to die

875
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:47,360
Die, die, die, die

876
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,480
Oh, I just want to die

877
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah

878
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,540
I just want to die

879
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:59,400
I just want to be dead like John Baez and Bobby Dylan

880
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,360
Oh, I just want to die

881
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,660
Like David Crosby

882
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,480
Oh, I just want to die

883
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,060
Yeah, yeah

884
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:12,300
Just want to die and be cool

885
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,680
One last time

886
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,560
Just want to die

887
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,900
Die, die

888
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,960
And he says, no matter what you guys do

889
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:27,100
No matter how many of you people you get in the spaceship

890
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,360
There ain't no way you're gonna get rid of me

891
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:32,900
You just want to stop us

892
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,080
And laugh and try to stays you

893
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,280
And show our boy

894
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,280
Take a look at the可是

895
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:51,580
It's no way to cross a boundary

896
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:51,800
But we're Canals

897
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:51,800


898
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:51,800


899
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,740
Peranakan

900
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,880
Yeah, it's butt perder

901
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:54,020
But we're in the city

902
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:54,120
In his Tylenol

903
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:54,420
Up here at Hills-N gamers

904
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,260
And it's perfect

905
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:58,060


906
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,320
Yeah, yeah, ooo

907
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,720
Look and see

908
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,200
Andessa

909
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,460
My song is broken

910
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,740
My kid pawned a video

911
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,060
For drugs

912
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:41,440
My wife passed out on Darbon

913
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,080
And wrecked a new car

914
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,440
I got the white man

915
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,240
Blues again

916
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:56,480
I got the white man

917
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,200
Blues again

918
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,140
Working on a chain gang for Bob

919
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:19,700
Say we're working on that chain gang for Bob

920
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,840
Bob don't pay but he'll let you stay

921
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,180
You gotta kneel and pray

922
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,280
Working on that chain gang for Bob

923
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:39,880
Working on that chain gang for Bob

924
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,020
Working, working, working

925
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:46,240
Working on that chain gang for Bob

926
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,420
What's the matter?

927
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,560
Doesn't that sound exciting to you?

928
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,080
They're dead, they're all messed up

929
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,720
They're dead, they're all messed up

930
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,520
They're dead, they're all messed up

931
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,360
Genuinely glad to see you

932
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:02,900
Genuinely glad to see you

933
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,500
Genuinely glad to see you

934
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,680
As though they had really missed being away from him during the day

935
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,340
And are anxious to talk to him

936
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:11,020
This is the time for pleasant discussion

937
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,920
In a thoroughly relaxed mood

938
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,520
They don't pick this time of the day

939
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,820
To spring unpleasant surprises on Dad

940
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,020
They're here, they're here

941
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,600
They're going to destroy us

942
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,300
Families throughout the country

943
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,220
Observe the custom of saying grace at mealtime

944
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:30,320
It is always treated with reverence and respect

945
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,340
Converse pleasantly while talking to your dad and dad's wife

946
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:32,820
While dad serves

947
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:37,200
I said pleasantly for that is the keynote at dinnertime

948
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:41,040
It is not only good manners, but good sense

949
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,340
Pleasant unemotional conversation helps digestion

950
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,280
Pleasant unemotional conversation helps digestion

951
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:56,760
Let father and mother guide the conversational trend if they desire

952
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,360
After all, they made all this possible

953
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,340
And may want to talk over their days

954
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:02,900
And may want to talk over their days

955
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,180
And may want to talk over their days

956
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:06,760
Tell mother how good the food is

957
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,360
Maybe Cis rates a compliment too

958
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,200
It makes them want to continue pleasing you

959
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,760
Don't discuss unpleasant topics such as gruesome sights or sound

960
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,640
Don't discuss unpleasant topics such as gruesome sights or sound

961
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,700
Charm and relaxation remember

962
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:32,000
The dinner table is no place for discontent

963
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:32,340
The dinner table is no place for discontent

964
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:36,860
It makes dad and mother uncomfortable and unhappy

965
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,620
This does not mean you should be stiff or formal

966
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,900
With your own family you can relax

967
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,200
Be yourself

968
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,480
Just be sure it's your best self

969
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,080
This is fun, isn't it?

970
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:49,480
Yeah

971
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,120
You sure you like to do things like this?

972
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:52,640
Sure

973
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,160
I thought all girls wanted fellas to take them to fancy places

974
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,520
Spend lots of money

975
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,780
Not this girl

976
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,920
Not this girl

977
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:01,420
Not this girl

978
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,340
You know? Not this girl

979
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:02,800
Not this girl

980
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,740
I sort of like things like this too

981
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,500
You won't laugh

982
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,280
I like to go on bicycle trips too

983
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,440
Do you?

984
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,380
And miniature golf, do you like that?

985
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,880
Yeah and weenie rolls and square dancing

986
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,340
And baseball games and taffy poles

987
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,720
I think they're swell

988
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,740
Say, you like to do lots of things, don't you?

989
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,580
Mother, wouldn't it be slick if we had an electric ironer?

990
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,060
Like Sally's mother has

991
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,520
Of course it would

992
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,320
And I'm looking forward to having one too, Mom!

993
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,620
I'm having an electric dryer too

994
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,680
Axylaim

995
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:15,680


996
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,200
Oxyóm

997
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,960
And toilet paper

998
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:21,960


999
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:21,960


1000
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:21,960


1001
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:21,960


1002
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:21,960


1003
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:22,520
It's my favorite place

1004
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:22,520


1005
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:22,520


1006
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,160
We're gonna be welcoming

1007
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:30,600
but wait, this ain't cool

1008
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,800
Your jetpack's like smoking

1009
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,760
Piss your money away

1010
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,300
There won't be no rainy day

1011
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,860
If I will sell you all the sun

1012
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,740
He's unlike with your boy

1013
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:50,800
But he ain't no man, he ain't no God

1014
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,280
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried

1015
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,800
He ain't no man, he ain't no God

1016
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:04,340
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried

1017
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,600
At his desk in Dallas

1018
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,180
When jetpack sits smoking

1019
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:20,600
Behind his mirrored windows

1020
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,140
When jetpack sits smoking

1021
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,200
Let up your pipe, let go the smoke

1022
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:27,780
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried

1023
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:27,780


1024
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,720
This is psych, it ain't no joke

1025
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,260
Brace me to pop, lift up your chain

1026
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:37,720
And you will pay to know what you think

1027
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,340
But he ain't no man, he ain't no God

1028
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:44,860
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried

1029
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:48,320
He ain't no man, he ain't no God

1030
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:54,580
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried

1031
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:20,680
He ain't no man, he ain't no God

1032
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:20,960
I don't wanna dance, hair and hair

1033
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,980
I don't wanna dance, hair and hair

1034
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:21,980


1035
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:22,000
I don't wanna die an ま C

1036
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,760
I don't wanna die an totalement

1037
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:22,880
I don't wanna die an attached sentence

1038
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,820
That ain't the right word for him

1039
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:27,780
It ain't the right word for my heart

1040
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:31,820
Excuse, bye for me and bye for you

1041
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:35,440
No matter what, a little love's all new

1042
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,980
But he ain't no man, he ain't no God

1043
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:42,400
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

1044
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,060
He ain't no man, he ain't no God

1045
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:52,360
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

1046
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:27,120
I don't wanna walk the path of my child

1047
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:32,380
For in a world of darkness, danger and despair

1048
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,920
We can go on smiling

1049
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,100
Cause we know that Bob Dobbs is always there

1050
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,600
And I know that Bob's on my side

1051
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,580
I know it as sure as I'm born

1052
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,880
He will make the proper deal with the exes' whore

1053
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,260
Then we'll come to meet him

1054
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:53,360
Then we'll greet him and rule forevermore

1055
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,580
Bob is my one true savior

1056
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,760
You can't hurt him

1057
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,760
Can't keep all of the rest

1058
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,240
Looking at his smiling face

1059
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,920
Helps me when I'm depressed

1060
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,460
For the pinks, I sure feel sorry

1061
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:08,880
For tomorrow, they'll fry with all the rest

1062
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:13,400
Bob has got no real brain to speak of

1063
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,240
Though his luck has seen him through the lack

1064
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,520
For all the geniuses

1065
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,620
Led us down the wrong track

1066
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,980
Least we know a subgenius

1067
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,220
Won't turn around and stab us

1068
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:27,740
In the back

1069
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,360
The con thinks they have us suckered

1070
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,400
But I know that that is a lie

1071
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,920
They're due for a big surprise

1072
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,860
From demons from the sky

1073
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,300
Makes me so glad I wised up

1074
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,400
Got it sized up

1075
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,260
Hell, I'm a lucky guy

1076
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,000
Bob brought me slack

1077
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:46,800
And that's lots more

1078
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,720
Than I ever got from the con

1079
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,820
Though I know it's only

1080
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:53,140
Cause of all those pills he's on

1081
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,420
Heck, I know he ain't too clever

1082
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:57,520
But whatever he says

1083
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:57,740
I'm gonna do it for him

1084
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:57,840
So he'll say it once more

1085
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,440
How I'm palling, as I do, try

1086
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,760
I can even claim the color

1087
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,260
That he left in my old tales

1088
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:08,260


1089
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:08,480
He's all I've got

1090
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:13,840
Just to find out

1091
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,840
That his lands has cried

1092
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:15,720
I can hear it

1093
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,440
I got a big old bob.

1094
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:32,940
I got a big old bob.

1095
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,980
He's right inside my pocket.

1096
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,740
Got my big old bob.

1097
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,760
Just reach inside my pocket.

1098
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,520
I just washed him off.

1099
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,740
He ain't too stinky this time.

1100
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,060
You got to try my bob.

1101
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:46,500
He really wants to meet you.

1102
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,960
It will open up to bob.

1103
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,480
You'll know that he's a love god.

1104
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:09,200
And once he gets inside, he's never going to leave you.

1105
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:20,280
The bunny seat of bob is leaking out of my pocket.

1106
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,920
Just open under him.

1107
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,100
He'll crawl inside your socket.

1108
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:38,720
He'll crawl inside your socket.
