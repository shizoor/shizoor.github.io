1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:01,960
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:11,600
Welcome to the subgenius radio hour of slaps.

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,360
Send 638 for the album. Only $9.99.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:25,260
The UFO exhibiting anti-gravity capabilities follows the airliner right down to the surface of the Earth to its landing.

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,220
The UFO is a bell-shaped type which has been seen and photographed all over the world.

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,060
Angels flash through the heavenlies.

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,940
You know Ezekiel, saw a wheel.

8
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:50,340
But what a lot of us do not realize is that in chapter 1 of Ezekiel verse 4, the angels traveled in whirlwind fashion.

9
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,940
Not like our jets straight ahead. Whirlwind!

10
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,200
They move from one end of heaven to the other like a flash of lightning, verse 14.

11
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,860
And verse 15 says their color was burl.

12
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,880
Do you know what they put into spaceships now that are heaved out there?

13
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:17,480
The only thing that can withstand the heat. Other things would disintegrate. Burl-illium.

14
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,820
It's like some kind of vision I've never seen before.

15
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,040
It's like wagon wheels coming out of the sky.

16
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,180
And I'm sitting on the porch with Aunt May and she said,

17
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,680
What is it, boy? What is it?

18
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,140
And I said, I don't know, ma'am. I swear to God, I don't know.

19
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,880
But I just said, praise Bob.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,440
You know, when, if Bob, if Bob says something, that...

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,040
Wall climbing.

22
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,520
Walk, what was that?

23
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,880
Wall climbing.

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,120
Wall climbing. Well, I was wall climbing. I was wall climbing.

25
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,180
That's what Bob said to do.

26
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,100
That's what Bob told me to.

27
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,600
I was wall climbing.

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,520
And, uh...

29
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,980
And, uh...

30
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,440
I...

31
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,280
I get...

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,420
Real scared, Bob.

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,560
Because, uh...

34
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,260
I've seen them.

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,640
I've seen them before.

36
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,240
But there's more of them now.

37
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,740
And, uh...

38
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,260
Because there's lots more.

39
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,880
They're floating in the air.

40
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,640
And they're living in the wood and the rocks and everything.

41
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:41,180
And they're always kind of laughing and...

42
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,140
And, uh...

43
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,000
Fucking and killing and laughing all the time.

44
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,080
Duncan Lunan of the British Interplanetary Society

45
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,840
has interpreted the signals as a message from the space probe.

46
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,720
A message from a dying planet in Epsilon Booty's.

47
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,700
When did you see your last flying saucer?

48
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,460
The last thing I seen was here Sunday week.

49
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,720
It was out in the wheat field.

50
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,700
In the wheat field.

51
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,780
Isn't that a little unusual?

52
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,780
No, I think they must feed off wheat or something.

53
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,140
Yeah, the little green man's there was real head-cat.

54
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,060
Rockin' and a-rollin' through the crazy black hole.

55
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,880
Brought out the sax and it started to flow.

56
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,740
Brought out the drums and it started to roll.

57
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,500
Flying saucer, rock and roll.

58
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,340
Flying saucer, rock and roll.

59
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,940
I couldn't understand it.

60
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,740
A big head said it was a crazy beat.

61
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,980
It just stopped me dead.

62
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:40,460
Joe!

63
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,200
Ah, yes dear friends.

64
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,100
From Media Barrage number two.

65
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,220
The ancient one about UFOs.

66
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,040
And we heard from, well actually it was 1981 I think.

67
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:01,200
Janer Hypercletes and the late Reverend David Boone.

68
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,700
And Jonathan Winters.

69
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,920
And despite having those ancient crumbling recordings around,

70
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,380
my friends, I barely remember.

71
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,080
Oh yeah, no, I forgot. This is the part that you remember.

72
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,520
Okay, you know what show it is now?

73
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,280
Yeah.

74
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,060
Oh, this is the Puzzling Evidence Show.

75
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm just getting nervous. I'm watching this little car driving like a cup of coffee.

76
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,620
The little puzzling evidence show on the little KPFA here in the Burbank.

77
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,280
Oh yeah, you can't play all of it.

78
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
You can't die.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,620
We don't get any feedback.

80
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,520
You've got it rough on the new radio. We can't play anything.

81
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,040
That's why, you know, that's why on all kinds of radio stations

82
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,280
you only hear about eight bars of something.

83
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,820
Because then you don't have to pay the royalties and do the paperwork.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,660
So no more whole songs.

85
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,240
No more whole songs for us.

86
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,920
Unless, of course, they're original material.

87
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,260
Thank you. The copyright owners are us.

88
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,220
But it is good to be back here in California.

89
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,060
Yes.

90
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,060
After walking, after schlepping it over to XDay on my bare feet.

91
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,040
Oh, XDay. Yeah, I want to hear about XDay. And the audience goes wild.

92
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:14,940
Yeah, XDay.

93
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,760
They love it because they're thinking of XXXday.

94
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,020
So how was it to see Guy Duhl and Ivan Stang and Queen of UFOs and Nikki Death Chick?

95
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,640
And who else would have been there?

96
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,220
Oh, so all those people, they were great. It was excellent.

97
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,400
One day we had good weather, except for one day we had this wonderful thunderstorm

98
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,540
that rolled through during the night.

99
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,400
Man, I miss those.

100
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,980
And like, rain like crazy.

101
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,160
And Guy and I drove around in the...

102
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,400
And you slept in the van down by the river?

103
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,420
No, I didn't sleep in the van. I slept in the trailer.

104
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,860
The van was like next to the fire and next to lots of people.

105
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,380
And would have been a miserable place to stay.

106
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,880
And so I moved up on the hill to the hierarchy trailer.

107
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,420
Just like the old DocsDocs.

108
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,860
And when I was in the hierarchy trailer, no one bothered me.

109
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,600
I set up my coffee making stand and my little brewing post.

110
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,300
So I had coffee every morning and afternoon there.

111
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:15,420
And good, strong California coffee. Not that wimpy-ass Eastern coffee.

112
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,140
Yeah, I know.

113
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,940
And then of course, let's see.

114
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,520
But overall it was good. It was great.

115
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,640
We had a great time. We had the amino acids played one night.

116
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,660
Those amino acids.

117
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,960
Yeah, they are amazing.

118
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,520
The ESO played another night.

119
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,900
And I got a chance to jam with ESO for two different nights.

120
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,680
And that was great. I mean, we really, we wailed. We rocked.

121
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,520
We rocked! We didn't suck!

122
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,840
Sure, sure. Of course.

123
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,260
We tried to suck, but we just couldn't.

124
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,940
Yeah, you rocked.

125
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,600
We sucked at sucking!

126
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,940
No, no. You didn't suck. You rocked.

127
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,780
Well, that could be true.

128
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,280
Yes, I did, you.

129
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,300
I think we did.

130
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,460
Believe me, you got to.

131
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,260
Oh baby, it's gonna be new.

132
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,040
It's gonna be new.

133
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,540
It's gonna bebull bin-bugger, didn't pull them close.

134
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,600
Yeah, baby, you make me.

135
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,460
I think we did.

136
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:40,320
Isn't it good?

137
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,020
This is because of theأ

138
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,500
Wow!

139
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,920
Yeah

140
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:55,720
I'm gonna get on this

141
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,400
Yeah

142
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,980
I'm gonna get on this

143
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,660
Yeah

144
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm gonna get on this

145
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:11,560
Yeah

146
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,600
Yeah

147
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,720
Yeah

148
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,320
We grew our mullets out

149
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,720
While we were there

150
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,540
And one night Guy and I

151
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,820
We did the drumming routine

152
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,320
Where we drive around

153
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,540
The compound in our

154
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,100
Narc looking vehicle

155
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,060
Scaring the various pinks

156
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,020
That happen to be there

157
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,460
And the bodies that all shy away

158
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,760
And of course it was porn

159
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,100
Guy

160
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,360
Right

161
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,460
And I'm not kidding

162
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,080
It was like

163
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,620
It never rains that hard here

164
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,280
No

165
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,940
It was raining in

166
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,640
Giant cascades

167
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,600
Where one foot

168
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,060
I've been up to the cascades

169
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,640
It was raining like a bucket per second

170
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,920
Much like where you used to live

171
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,320
Yeah

172
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,740
A lot like where I used to live

173
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,160
Big thunderheads rolling over

175
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,820
With lots of thunder

176
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:58,820


177
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,800
That's what they used to call me

178
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,640
A thunderhead

179
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,700
Big cracking

180
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,480
Yeah

181
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,040
And so

182
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,580
Yeah

183
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,140
Guy and I drove out

184
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,640
In the middle of the compound

185
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,440
Wow

186
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,060
Road

187
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,620
While it was raining like that

188
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,020
And

189
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,020
And

190
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,340
And

191
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:42,340


192
00:09:42,340 --> 00:10:12,340


193
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:23,420
Was that reduce

194
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:32,540
As passed

195
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,720
Which is the same

196
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:41,720


197
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:41,720


198
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:41,820
Part of the ultir contradiction

199
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:41,820


200
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:41,820


201
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:41,820


202
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:41,820


203
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:41,820


204
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:41,820


205
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:41,920
Having

206
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,320
It's

207
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,320


208
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,320


209
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:51,240
I only said that in reference to the aforementioned extrusion of logic in reality.

210
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,740
And so what was your question now?

211
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,400
Well, Dr. Drummond, is it true that Dr. Howell, your comrade there at the show,

212
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:08,740
is going to join me, Reverend Ivan Stang, at the Indy Bible on September 20th in Indianapolis

213
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,300
for a huge subgenius freakout?

214
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,860
Can I get that info at subgenius.com?

215
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,740
What other news is there?

216
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,500
This is PR News. I'm creating unintended problems.

217
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,360
For PR News, I'm completely contained.

218
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,240
From Los Angeles, PR's 600 Kmart stores report.

219
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:38,260
From Eugene, Morgan Smith continues to battle two major campgrounds and several homes over the weekend.

220
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,280
PR radios at PR.

221
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,460
PR.org.

222
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,020
PR's Ricard resigned after a plagiarism scandal.

223
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:48,960
Yeah.

224
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,320
For PR News, I'm expected to return late in the week.

225
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,220
PR's Madeline Brand blamed for the continuing attacks on the dance floor.

226
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,340
This is PR News.

227
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,120
I'm selected by the U.S.-led Occupation Authority to help baby abandonments.

228
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,380
No questions asked.

229
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,540
This is coming up on 9.30 at 10 o'clock this morning.

230
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:11,720
This is PR.

231
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,800
PR brought to you by Fernanda Namby, Lemur.

232
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,120
Hey, Atlanta.

233
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,200
Hey, Atlanta.

234
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,680
Hey, Bob.

235
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,400
They spelled, they misspelled Namby in this publication.

236
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,940
I want them written up right now.

237
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,340
They misspelled Namby.

238
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,280
They spelled it Mamby.

239
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,880
Namby Pamby.

240
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,440
Namby sat on a fence.

241
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,940
This is what we're stuck at here at 4.12 in the morning at Subgenius International Airport.

242
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,720
X-Day's turned into such a big thing.

243
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,180
They had to build an airport just to handle all the people that come to X-Day now.

244
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,060
Here they get their Subgenius Church hair.

245
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,540
And then they march off to the area where the end of the world will happen.

246
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,000
And Philo Drummond is down there.

247
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,020
We can see him on the floor.

248
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,780
Philo, what?

249
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,420
What?

250
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,200
Goodbye, belly.

251
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:11,520
What do you think?

252
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,820
How about it?

253
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:12,840


254
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,160
How about it?

255
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,100
Can we add icons?

256
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,000
Oh, yes.

257
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,680
Here.

258
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:25,420
In another edition of the ancient Subgenius traditions, we can now add treasured and

259
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,920
hated symbols of our lives to this fire.

260
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,680
Janina Grinder here has apparently a Virgin Mary, which she is.

261
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,080
My mom.

262
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:35,620
Thanks.

263
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,500
That's nice.

264
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,360
That's nice.

265
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,220
Some people have thrown in.

266
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,560
Their driver's licenses.

267
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,240
Their work records.

268
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,860
Their time punch-outs.

269
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,260
Their parents' divorce papers.

270
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,760
And one especially poignant example.

271
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,240
If I could throw my self-esteem in the fire, I sure would.

272
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,640
I have Bob's rally monkey.

273
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,820
Bob did not rally.

274
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,800
Bob did not save us.

275
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,780
Bob's rally monkey.

276
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,500
Fat fucking lot of good and dead.

277
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,740
Feed the fire, asshole.

278
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,260
Burn the monkey.

279
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,600
Burn the monkey.

280
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,460
Burn the monkey.

281
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,180
Burn the monkey.

282
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:25,660
And now where the pagans would normally have hundreds of beautiful topless women,

283
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,840
we have banjo Bob.

284
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,320
Sample of the ultimate spouse dance.

285
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,500
The sacred dance of the subgenius.

286
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,280
Hell yeah.

287
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:47,180
Hurry up and burn, Bob! We're tired of waiting! We're tired of waiting for the goddamn saucer, and we want to see your face burn!

288
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,420
Bob once asked the classic question, would you tell me if my face was on fire?

289
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:59,900
This is our chance. Bob, your goddamn face is on fire.

290
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,000
My face is on fire! My face is on fire!

291
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,700
Snap out of it! Wake the fuck up!

292
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,100
Oh, where is the fuck?

293
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:37,060
Wake the fuck up!

294
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:44,280
Barbecue a poker while the effigies burn. You may not want to stay and see how we take care of our turncoat.

295
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:52,020
Christiana's kind of far away. So come along with me.

296
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,700
We can dance and trip and be anarchists.

297
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,580
We gotta get the manual and put it in the oven till it cooks.

298
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,440
We're gonna take the ashes to the wasp zone.

299
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,340
We'll take...

300
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,980
Muslim anarchy camp, reckless abandonment.

301
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,420
Random acts of dumbness.

302
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,200
We'll be rewarded if you see somebody taking charge.

303
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,020
But you won't!

304
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,400
You'll be expected to beat them.

305
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,540
And everyone who's no one will be participating.

306
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,480
No one who is someone will ever get to know the joys of anarchism.

307
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,040
What?

308
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,100
Destruction of the system, yeah.

309
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,620
So come along with us.

310
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,920
What?

311
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,840
Selling days and nights on the Anarchaic bus.

312
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,920
We're gonna pick up indigents and crusties and a half a dozen nuts.

313
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,340
And we're never coming home.

314
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,920
We're never coming home.

315
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,840
We're never coming home.

316
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,860
We're never coming home.

317
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,580
We're never coming home.

318
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,740
Underwater basket weaving.

319
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,000
Methamphetamine symposium.

320
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,160
African killer spelling bees.

321
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,520
Bowling in ice hockey rinks.

322
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,800
Anarchy camp's never a nerd.

323
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,120
Not much fun till someone gets hurt.

324
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,360
So we're greasing up the rusty bird ramp.

325
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,140
Time to make some reservations for next year's Anarchy Camp.

326
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,840
Just like X-Day, Anarchy Camp by the band NoFX.

327
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:20,920
And now back to KPFA Berkeley, the puzzling evidence show where Philo is reporting on 6X Day, although Dr. Howell had decided not to attend.

328
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,340
I know I've made some very bad decisions.

329
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,400
And I had people feeding me each day with gourmet food.

330
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,040
Yeah.

331
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,820
Just because I found out later is because I was a hierarchite.

332
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,420
Yep.

333
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,520
And they could have me like a figurehead in their camp.

334
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,740
And when I was sitting there, they attracted the bobbies up.

335
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,560
Now, did the camps have names to the camps?

336
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,580
Yeah, the camps.

337
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,620
People do stuff like the Tranquility Bay.

338
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,580
Yeah, they had different names.

339
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:58,760
You know, they didn't, their names, like there was one of the new subgenius bases that had a lot of the new subgenius guys from alt.slack and alt.binaries.slack.

340
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,020
Some of them.

341
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,020


342
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,000
Some of those new subgeniuses are a little off base.

343
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,340
Internet subgeni I had met in a compound called Pound Subgenius.

344
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,780
And that's just what I'd like to do.

345
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,220
And you could see it off in the distance.

346
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:09,740
Every one of them.

347
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,740
It had these big flags and giant bob heads.

348
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,480
I went in there and they were all computer geeks.

349
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,300
So you have like, you have to log into their camp.

350
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:24,780
When you walk up, you had to sign a big board, this rotating board that had this arcane mechanical device.

351
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,720
And you couldn't walk in unless you logged in, you know.

352
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,200
Board?

353
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:28,800
Never.

354
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,000
I was entertained every second.

355
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,160


356
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,820
And then Doc Frop had his compound.

357
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,360
I don't know what, other than, we just always called it Frop's place.

358
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,700
If only I could leave the compound.

359
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,300
And then, let's see, there was Tranquility Base is really cool.

360
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,960
They have the Bonobo Bar and the Tiki Banzai Grill was there.

361
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,580
Bonobos?

362
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,900
I say, aren't those pick-me chimps?

363
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,920
Just kidding, that's the name.

364
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,700
But, I bet anyone that likes the Bonobos would have arice in that bar.

365
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:09,720


366
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:09,720


367
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:09,720


368
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:09,720


369
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:09,720


370
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:09,720


371
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:09,720


372
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:09,720


373
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:09,980
.

374
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:09,980


375
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:09,980


376
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,020
.

377
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,200
.

378
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,240
.

379
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,480
.

380
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:11,480


381
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:11,480


382
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:11,500
.

383
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:11,500


384
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:11,600
.

385
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:11,640
...

386
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:13,760
.

387
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,200
.

388
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:23,900
.

389
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:23,900


390
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,720
So you guys were jamming?

391
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,920
Who was the jammies?

392
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,240
I jammed with ESO and Princess Wee.

393
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,720
Thank you.

394
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,780
Jammed with us.

395
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,320
We had, you know, Chaz was there and Dave, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

396
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,100
He's a great American.

397
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,560
I know.

398
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,860
I'd like to be on their show someday.

399
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,140
We should all go be on their show.

400
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,000
Lonesome Cowboy Dave is what makes this country great.

401
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,740
I was thinking, did you go?

402
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,540
I wasn't on the show, though.

403
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,780
No, you should have gone to be on show.

404
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,860
That would have been fun, but they were all getting ready for X Day.

405
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,440
I don't know that they even had time for the show.

406
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,560
That's pathetic.

407
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,140
How can that be?

408
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,120
Yeah, no lie.

409
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,500
Because the show is like just a tiny snatch of X Day.

410
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,420
I don't understand.

411
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,560
When you saw, I mean, you saw how elaborate Chaz's camp was.

412
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,000
He has this cool crate that he's built down there in the middle of T-Base Camp,

413
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,000
and it's under the trees back in the woods.

414
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,360
And he's got his, like, it's a,

415
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,740
he could live back in there.

416
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,100
It's got a little mini kitchen, his computer's in there, all his history.

417
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,520
Oh, that's really a neat setup.

418
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,280
His whole history of CDs is his, you know, he's got a place to sleep.

419
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,020
CDs?

420
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,800
It's really nice and cozy back in there.

421
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,120
I guess I saw those.

422
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,720
Plus, he has all these young chicks that hang around.

423
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,880
Calking and balking and going, balk, balk, balk.

424
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,580
He sails in on his own yacht.

425
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,280
He sails in on his van.

426
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,080
Yeah.

427
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,480
He's got a van, you know.

428
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,840
What's the name of his book?

429
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,080
I couldn't really look for it.

430
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,300
He's a history of rock and roll.

431
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:04,640
Yeah.

432
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,300
I'd like to get that.

433
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:06,780
I have a good,

434
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,780
He's a real, he's a real music, musicologist kind of guy.

435
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:11,960
Yeah, that's fine.

436
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,660
But Tranquility Base plays his mostly.

437
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,880
I wonder if he listens to this show.

438
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,600
See, I think it's important that he listens to this show.

439
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,840
Okay, I need a little more church air here.

440
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,780
I don't know if he listens to this show or not.

441
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,560
Look, there's a caller.

442
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:26,860
Oh.

443
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,160
Thanks for waiting and go right ahead.

444
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,220
Yeah, I'm calling from Glen Rose.

445
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,880
I talked to these two a couple of months ago about some cattle mutilation.

446
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,580
Yeah, you were the farmer, right?

447
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,040
Right.

448
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,500
Raised cattle.

449
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,320
Yeah.

450
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,980
I told you all about the mutilation.

451
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,480
You all said it'd be a good idea if I sent some money in.

452
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,320
Might give me an edge.

453
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,260
Right, right.

454
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,800
Friends, I must interrupt here.

455
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,040
My own wife didn't recognize these voices,

456
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,480
so I should explain that what follows,

457
00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:01,700
is like the third radio appearance ever in 1980 of yours truly,

458
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,260
Reverend Ivan Stang and my partner, Dr. Philo Drummond,

459
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:10,300
on George Nolan's show on KFJZ in Fort Worth.

460
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,440
The guy calling in is my brother.

461
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,140
Well, we've had another one down here.

462
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,960
Another cattle mutilation.

463
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,360
How much money did you send in?

464
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,400
Well, that's the problem.

465
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,660
I never got around to sending this money in.

466
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,700
Well, that's why.

467
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,880
Well, we don't have that much to do with cattle mutilation,

468
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,780
but we can help put you on the alert to who might be doing it.

469
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,720
And how to watch out for them.

470
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,540
Yeah, that whole situation with the cattle mutilations is pretty spooky.

471
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,820
Not very many people know about it.

472
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,840
And we've found that lately an even scarier aspect,

473
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,500
a UFO-related goldfish mutilation.

474
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:51,840
Goldfish mutilation.

475
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,980
Right in your own home.

476
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,700
You're going to see a lot.

477
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,280
You'll see a lot more of that.

478
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,640
People, it's like you'll wake up in the morning

479
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,340
and people will find that their goldfishes have been mutilated

480
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,700
and no explainable reason for whatsoever, no breaking.

481
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,740
Surgically, yeah, certain organs surgically removed.

482
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,000
It's just scary as can be.

483
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,680
We've seen that in some of these animals down here.

484
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,340
Uh-huh.

485
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,100
Is there any way to find out who's doing it?

486
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,140
Well, there's a lot of theories on that.

487
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,660
One theory says that it's the conspiracy doing it

488
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,680
and making it look like it.

489
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,280
Like UFOs to discredit law enforcement agencies.

490
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,420
Another theory says that it is UFOs

491
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,820
and they're using cattle eyeballs for rocket fuel.

492
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:42,800
And another theory is that it's some crazed teenage zombies out there

493
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,880
that are going wild.

494
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,260
Yeah, some weird religious cult doing it for who knows what reason.

495
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,240
Boy, there are weird cults around, aren't there?

496
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:49,680
There are indeed.

497
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,320
Most of the cults, I might add, some of them are us.

498
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,420
But most of them are them.

499
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,940
And most of the ones that are us don't know they're us.

500
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,300
Yeah.

501
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,880
Well, the way that they get it straight now,

502
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,860
the us are the good guys, the them are the bad guys.

503
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,120
That's right.

504
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,260
There are a lot of latent subgeniuses.

505
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,920
But by the same token, there are a lot of conspiracy members there

506
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,880
who don't know they're working for the conspiracy.

507
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,660
A lot of latent homo sapiens, too, you know.

508
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,020
That's right.

509
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:20,300
Or homo correctus is what the subgeniuses descended from.

510
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,340
Well, I wanted to know if there's...

511
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,200
Should I try to...

512
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,060
Find out who's doing it or catch anybody doing it?

513
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,180
Well, send us some money to begin with,

514
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,740
and we can fill you in on a whole lot more.

515
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,960
That box number you can send it to is...

516
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:44,180
Post Office Box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

517
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,220
And I might add, that is a real post office box.

518
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,440
I have seen it, touched it, opened it, and it actually exists.

519
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,060
We're not kidding about that.

520
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,700
And we will send you material that will help explain

521
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,700
not only cattle mutilations,

522
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,400
but hundreds of other true mysteries

523
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,460
in this modern space age agogo world.

524
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,520
And I can also verify that these guys,

525
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,140
not only is that a real post office box number,

526
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,200
these guys are real actual solicitators, solicitation...

527
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,340
They are asking for money, really.

528
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,580
I'll send some money in this time.

529
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,180
Maybe it'll help.

530
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,800
In the meantime, you can sit out on your ranch in the dark

531
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,040
and just watch for bright lights in the sky.

532
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,160
And different kinds of things.

533
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,560
Well, the different kind of things, what I'm worried about finding.

534
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,120
Don't worry about taking a gun with you.

535
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,860
It won't do any good.

536
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,080
Well, that's a hell.

537
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,960
Yeah, bullets cannot stop them.

538
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,760
Come here, creatures.

539
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,660
I summon all of you to attend.

540
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,600
On March 22nd, hundreds of people witnessed a pair of flying objects.

541
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,460
For the next nine days, UFOs rose out of the sea.

542
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,000
The tongue in the air remained both of us.

543
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,760
And in various manners,

544
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,820
the port of Gover's Central Holiday City

545
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,340
I've opened the surface of the earth.

546
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,260
It's time to attack.

547
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,120
All the other women don't know why you're there

548
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,060
and whether you really had your tongue in your cheek or not.

549
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,520
Especially the farmer who had...

550
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,160
See, he had a special calculation on his land.

551
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,900
And his neighbor thought it was strange, too.

552
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,700
Are not the angels ministering spirits?

553
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,000
And so if the minister...

554
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,780
Who shall be the heir?

555
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,480
The celebration of the year of 2014?

556
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,780
Good night.

557
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,960
Only Earth with a single moon

558
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,040
will have exactly total solar eclipses.

559
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,820
He is too remarkable an occurrence

560
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,540
to be due entirely to chance.

561
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:50,200
We have just discovered an important note from space.

562
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,720
The Martians plan to throw a dance floor.

563
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,040
We have just discovered an important note from space.

564
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:54,360
We have just discovered an important note from space.

565
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,860
All the human race.

566
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,160
All the human race.

567
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,360
Good.

568
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,160
Nothing can stop us now.

569
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,880
It will only take a few hours to attach this detonator.

570
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,740
Then we can all take off from Mars.

571
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,880
Are you sure the rocket can carry all of us

572
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,140
and your men from the island, too?

573
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,220
Now get Dr. Harding.

574
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,840
He's going to help me make the final adjustments on the bomb.

575
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,280
OK.

576
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,600
You've got the robot in the car.

577
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,340
We've got the control panel here.

578
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,820
We'll take it along and let the robot do the fighting for us.

579
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,080
Then we'll have to wait before we find out what this is all about.

580
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,180
Not entirely.

581
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,060
The papers we found in Harding's laboratory explain why they're building the hydrogen bomb.

582
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:39,100
Its explosion was intended to deflect the rotation of the Earth enough to send it out of its orbit and spinning off into space.

583
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,760
Those zombies must have been as crazy as they looked.

584
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,800
It may sound ridiculous, but it's theoretically possible.

585
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,500
It's certainly lucky you managed to stop them in time.

586
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,080
Yeah, we're safe now, for the time being.

587
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,020
But there are undoubtedly more of those power-mad creatures loose on other planets.

588
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,780
So it'll take constant vigilance on our part to ensure the safety of this world.

589
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:08,120
If the people do not seek to offend him, another and worse war will break out.

590
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:17,900
When you see a knight with a strange light in the sky, you will know it is a sign that the world is about to be punished for its crime.

591
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:27,120
So make it clear that the보을 вопросы will exist tirar 빠리가 되지 않는iot look.

592
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,020
Submissory trouver

593
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,300
Get rid of me

594
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,780
Donate to more wrestle

595
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,580
Give me back my fun time

596
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,920
Conquer thisänder

597
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,440

00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,800

599
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,480
I want to kill you

600
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,880
I want to kill you

601
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,020
La la la la la

602
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,440
Give me back my fun bag

603
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,320
Give me back my fun bag

604
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,300
I'm gonna make it all up to you

605
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:25,340
I'd like to give it all to you

606
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,060
Objects in motion, Earth, Venus, Mars

607
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,180
A place without gravity, I no longer see stars

608
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,240
Not far in the future, where did that galaxy go?

609
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,040
The fading of photographs, a dying light bulb

610
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:43,420
I'm gonna make it all up to you

611
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,460
I'd like to give it all to you

612
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,180
Across the horizon for an infinite time

613
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,020
Dying of loneliness without the sunshine

614
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,300
All together but away from each other

615
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,480
With darkness between us, with darkness between us

616
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,360
I'm gonna make it all up to you

617
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:13,480
I'd like to give it all to you

618
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,400
I'm gonna make it all up to you

619
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,360
I'd like to give it all to you

620
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:55,820
I'm gonna make it all up to you

621
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:02,000
I'd like to give it all to you

622
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:08,080
I'm gonna make it all up to you

623
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:14,220
I'd like to give it all to you

624
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,780
Objects in motion, Earth, Venus, Mars

625
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,060
A place without gravity, I no longer see stars

626
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:20,060


627
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,900
Not far in the future, where did that galaxy go?

628
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,640
The fading of photographs, a dying light bulb

629
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,700
Across the horizon for an infinite time

630
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,400
Dying of loneliness without the sunshine

631
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,820
All together but away from each other

632
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,120
With darkness between us, with darkness between us

633
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,940
C.D. Truth

634
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,060
An advertiser for the E.A.A.B.

635
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,060


636
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,360
band there from their new album, Chemically Dependent.

637
00:32:54,460 --> 00:33:01,200
And you can learn more about that band at www.cdtruth.com.

638
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,040
That's like letter C, letter D, truth.com.

639
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,600
Wonderful band that we see every year at the devotional.

640
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:17,720
And before that, we heard Give Me Back My Fun Thing by the baby Philo Drummond singing

641
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,540
with his old band, The Swingin' Love Corpses.

642
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:27,440
This music in the background, by the way, is Einstein's Secret Orchestra jamming at

643
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,880
6X Day with Dr. Philo Drummond and Princess We Are Dove, as well as, I think, Dr. Lake

644
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,180
King.

645
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,740
Ah, yes.

646
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,040
And now...

647
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:45,080
We stand here at this anti-progressive-ist warehouse filled with so many of our comrades,

648
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,940
com-comrades of ours.

649
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:53,460
Kings of corn, we used to call them before the Bolshevik days, back when the Tsarist

650
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,000
police hunted us like pigs.

651
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,720
It's the Wellman-Howell syndrome.

652
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,600
Roman-Howell?

653
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:02,940
Romanoff.

654
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,920
It's an outside joke.

655
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:10,520
But physicists on three international teams have discovered the pentaquark.

656
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,960
But did they take their fresh fruit, organic vegetables?

657
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,120
Well, I would probably...

658
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,700
So you can imagine what it's like to be...

659
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,980
...stuck on this narrow-gauge railway with these subgenius gods all day yakking about

660
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,880
their me shows.

661
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,520
Yeah, they're one-wheeled narrow-gauge railways.

662
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,020
It's like a unicycle.

663
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,040
Railroad.

664
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,040
They didn't catch on very well.

665
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,600
This bulletin is just in.

666
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,100
It can't be read on...

667
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:47,700
You can't read the bulletin that's just in because it is a violation of FCC.

668
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,100
FCC law.

669
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,300
And they do...

670
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,900
It is law, folks.

671
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,920
I'm not kidding you.

672
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,740
We have to sign on to these new laws, these special laws.

673
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,540
Now here's Philo driving around X-Day in his NARC car.

674
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,920
Expedient super laws.

675
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,020
And he's enforcing the laws of the subgenius church.

676
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,360
If you were not...

677
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:07,900
Pull over.

678
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:08,540
I'm gonna...

679
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,640
If you were not observing the laws of the subgenius church during the X-Day observance,

680
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,660
it was quite often seen that apparently the old church would pull...

681
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,380
Pull you over and...

682
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,740
And say, I notice you have not offered me your phone number.

683
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,020
And they'd search your mind.

684
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,940
Now I must kill you.

685
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,180
An invitation to visit you at your fine home.

686
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,820
I'm frightened by your shapely legs.

687
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,340
Your flashing eyes, your floating hair.

688
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,680
I am provoked by your weight, all-consuming lust.

689
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,760
No for my lithe, nubile flesh.

690
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,700
And so here comes Stang with his security.

691
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,100
He's landing X-Day.

692
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,560
Up came Stang with his big boot on.

693
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,540
And he says to Doug...

694
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,540
Oh, there he is.

695
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:54,900
I see.

696
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,220
So this is a fake Stang with the helicopter landing.

697
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,440
And the real Stang is over there behind the fence on that grassy knoll

698
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,820
with a set of binoculars watching.

699
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,480
And oh my, I see.

700
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,040
He's doing...

701
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,380
He's watching with his one hand.

702
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,440
Okay, so we're going to go back to X-Day now.

703
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,040
The amino acids.

704
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,200
Live at 6XX.

705
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,700
Live at X-Day.

706
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:34,660
Live at 6XX.

707
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,800
Oh my god.

708
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:35,800


709
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:35,800


710
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:35,800


711
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:35,800


712
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:35,800


713
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:35,800


714
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:35,800


715
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,540
Oh my god.

716
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:37,860
Oh my god.

717
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,520
Oh my god.

718
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:38,820
Oh my god.

719
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,860
Oh my god.

720
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,360
Oh my god.

721
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:40,540
Oh my god.

722
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:40,760
Oh my god.

723
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,340
Oh my god.

724
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,160
Oh my god.

725
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,360
Oh my god.

726
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,400
Oh my god.

727
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,180
The Amino Acids live at 6X Day, friends.

728
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,600
And they never stop.

729
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:32,560
And this is a good time for me to mention that at 6X Day,

730
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:37,020
one of the most joyous events is the Bull Dada auction.

731
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:42,220
Yes, where the subgenius ministers auction off the weirdest crap they can locate.

732
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,720
Sometimes it's not just stuff.

733
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:50,120
Sometimes it is their own bodies or sex acts or glands or fluids.

734
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,420
Once G. Gordon Gordon auctioned off his septum.

735
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,940
Yes, his septum for a lap dance.

736
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,460
Anyway, friends, the Bull Dada auction.

737
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,700
You know, Bull Dada is the latest exploration of advanced surrealistic Dadaism

738
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,540
in which the mind is filled with dirt and lugs,

739
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:14,700
which trickle like mutilated centipedes down the sides of the now empty craniums.

740
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,600
And which is the only way to find shelter and rest inside the now sightless eye sockets.

741
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:23,860
This definition of Bull Dada was broached first by the great Shredney Chisholm

742
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,760
in I believe the year 1972.

743
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,940
It's since elaborated on to include everything a kitschy, marvelous, insane,

744
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,480
and somehow packed with meaning for the subgenius.

745
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:43,520
Although it might appear, like this show, to be absolute trash to those without discernment.

746
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,580
Those pathetic...

747
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:52,860
normworms and pig boys who crawl their way through their jobs and misperceptions that they call life.

748
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,500
Praise Bob.

749
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,140
I'm Zach. I'm Martin.

750
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,960
What do you want to talk about?

751
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,140
Oh, I have something else I need to auction off.

752
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:04,040
You know, every X day, some things instantly become relics.

753
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,940
And we have a couple of relics back at the camp.

754
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,680
That was three?

755
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,360
I'm probably going to get rid of them later on.

756
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,320
But anyway, a relic has been created.

757
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,960
Let me see the hands of all of those who know what teabagging is.

758
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:18,780
Eww.

759
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,120
Alright, you subgeniuses. You all know what teabagging is.

760
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,860
How many of you know who Doc Fropp is?

761
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,360
Alright.

762
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,900
One human soul.

763
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,520
How many of you know what Chewy Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies are?

764
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:42,160
Well, I'm here auctioning off chewy chocolate chip cookies that have been teabagged by Doc Fropp.

765
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Come on!

766
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,140
Right before the Bulldada auction began.

767
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,640
All my business now.

768
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:05,040
The going price for a brand new, unopened, sealed bag is $3.69.

769
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,100
They're mostly gone. I was handing them out right before I came up.

770
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,120
Damn you!

771
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,060
Damn you all to hell!

772
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,600
I saved Princess Wade.

773
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,420
I would not allow her to eat a cookie.

774
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,200
But you Stan! Yes, you!

775
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,260
And the Lord.

776
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:32,120
The bidding starts at 50 cents for the last remaining teabagged cookies.

777
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:35,300
Think of the fun you could have at your next campground gathering.

778
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,660
Two dollars!

779
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,840
Two dollars! Damn.

780
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,880
Going once, going twice?

781
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,740
Three!

782
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:42,820
Three?

783
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,500
The text will never go away.

784
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,160
Sold for two dollars!

785
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:49,880
All right.

786
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,720
Praise the Bob!

787
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,440
And you're listening to PR News.

788
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,740
But there comes a time we need to get things done.

789
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,280
The time has passed.

790
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,260
Yesterday was also Bob Day.

791
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,420
PR News.

792
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:20,580
Support for PR comes from the Northwestern Pit Children Foundation, driven to suicide.

793
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:25,820
From PR News in Washington, I will not say where the bodies are being taken.

794
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,620
Ha ha.

795
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,860
And from Zulu.

796
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,880
This is PR Radio.

797
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,720
Seven provocative mental girls at noon.

798
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,040
From PR News in Washington, I'm in an ambush.

799
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,220
NPR's Brad Eglint reports.

800
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,180
Brad will not report in the coming days.

801
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:51,620
Philip Pan, Beijing correspondent for the Washington Post, has barricaded himself inside Beijing.

802
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,540
Oh yes, it's in the 46th day today.

803
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:55,860
Thanks.

804
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:56,960
Thank you.

805
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:58,840
PR News.

806
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,580
Washington.

807
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,640
The German ambassador to the United Nations.

808
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,500
Germany would welcome such an approach.

809
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,300
PR News.

810
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,260
We're still rolling!

811
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,820
Ah, well, uh...

812
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,820
There's much more news.

813
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,440
Uh, there is some more news.

814
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,260
But it's so depressing.

815
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,980
I can't go the next day.

816
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,180
I don't have the money.

817
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,580
And I don't have a job now.

818
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,280
And it's a long way to go.

819
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,400
And I don't know anybody.

820
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,400
And I'm being a scumbag.

821
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,100
What do you say to that, Philo?

822
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,600
What do you say to somebody that says they can't go?

823
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,780
I don't think I can't go the next day.

824
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:35,740
I say, son, it's good you know your deficiencies now so we don't have to fool with you later.

825
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,020
I don't want to have to fight and trudge over your lifeless corpse on my way to the next

826
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:40,020


827
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:40,020


828
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,880
day saucers.

829
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:42,340
Whatever.

830
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:48,640
But I'm making my way towards the bounciest beauty and graceful arms of those beautiful

831
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,680
sex goddesses.

832
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:56,840
And I will, uh, know that I don't have to worry about you taking up space and breathing

833
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,980
my precious air.

834
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,160
Pinhole.

835
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,360
Pinhole.

836
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,660
That's what I say to those bobbies that tell me that.

837
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,280
I say there's five reasons to choose me.

838
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,200
I'm drop dead gorgeous.

839
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,940
I will never rush you.

840
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,400
It's a mutual massage.

841
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,580
I'm sweet.

842
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,120
Okay.

843
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,780
Well, also,

844
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,000
you should read all these wonderful books

845
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,420
about military skills.

846
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,820
I'm taking a nap.

847
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:27,880
That's what I'm talking about.

848
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,460
That's what I'm talking about.

849
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,300
You got the X-Tank.

850
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,780
You got the X-Tank.

851
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,080
You're a little early, sir.

852
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:35,980
Y'all, yeah.

853
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,840
The X-Tank is like a year away now.

854
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,680
X-Day is over.

855
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,040
It's crazy to think you could go back in time

856
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,620
and go to this year's X-Day.

857
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,300
What kind of thinking is that?

858
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,460
I'm kind of thinking.

859
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,800
That's some stinking thinking.

860
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,240
You're going to have to get rid of that stinking thinking.

861
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,940
I want you to leave your mind behind.

862
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,200
And I want you to practice ancient Indian medicine

863
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,160
that offers time-tested solutions

864
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,340
for gastrointestinal problems.

865
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,420
Okay?

866
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,480
Okay?

867
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,060
Okay?

868
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,260


869
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,120
Mass hysteria.

870
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,000
How about a show of this country?

871
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,140
Mass hysteria.

872
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,720
Mass hysteria.

873
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,540
Well, I won't say that.

874
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,260
Okay, don't because it's...

875
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,180
Well, don't think of this one.

876
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,820
There's a company called...

877
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,540
Mass hysteria.

878
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,300
That's us on the show.

879
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,880
You can thank your lucky stars...

880
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,060
You thank your lucky stars...

881
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,060
Mass hysteria.

882
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,760
That's what you get for doing the show.

883
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,800
...with our divinity.

884
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,700
All right, 60-cycle hum on the show.

885
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,620
Did you bring any salty bag snacks?

886
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,700
That army will never reach the gates of Zion.

887
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,040
You have to do that at the same time.

888
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,420
I don't have any bagful of crunchy items.

889
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,620
I don't want a stupid old matrix.

890
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,800
How about some snacks like potato chips?

891
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:58,100
Up until now, most of the focus on UFOs has been...

892
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,080
Not UFOs.

893
00:44:59,080 --> 00:44:59,780
Is any of this real?

894
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:03,080
And if it is real, where is the evidence?

895
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:07,180
Only by exposing the full truth around the UFO question...

896
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:12,800
...can we get to the core reasons for the intense secrecy surrounding this issue...

897
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,300
...and the potential use of a highly sophisticated technology...

898
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,400
...for the betterment of our planet.

899
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,220
So you know, this techno...

900
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,460
Lubricated tongue.

901
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,260
...drives you crazy at this hour of the morning.

902
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:28,560
But of course, people's funds for salty snacks...

903
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,680
...reflects a fundamental biological imperative.

904
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,700
All cells, in order to survive, have to have salt.

905
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,020
They've just got to have salt.

906
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,040
They've just got to have it.

907
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,200
Every cell in your body...

908
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,000
They're just licking it up.

909
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,940
They need a big old salt lick to go down there.

910
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,140
...jumbo-sized bag of KFC barbecue potatoes.

911
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,820
So how many times did you tell them the next day?

912
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:50,520
What?

913
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,540
Did you say somebody was rocking out in there?

914
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:05,580
Oh my God, it's Carter LeBlanc.

915
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,640
It's Reverend Carter LeBlanc.

916
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,660
Ramping.

917
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,060
What?

918
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:09,480
What?

919
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:09,600
What?

920
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,100
What?

921
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:10,540
What?

922
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:10,540


923
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:10,540


924
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:10,540


925
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:10,540


926
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:10,540


927
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:10,640
What?

928
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:10,740
What?

929
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:10,740


930
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:11,620
What?

931
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:11,620


932
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:11,620


933
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,600
How dare he say...

934
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,080
I...

935
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,240
Oh, this...

936
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:19,060
When he sees me on the road, he tries to kill me.

937
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:26,320
I abduct aliens, and I shove them up my ass!

938
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,360
I can kick more ass than a five-legged girl!

939
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,760
I floss my teeth with ten-dimensional hyperspirant.

940
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,820
I blow my...

941
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,200
My nose is the fabric of reality!

942
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:46,340
And I lick my ass with the wool that other people pull over their own eyes!

943
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:54,260
I may not teach you anything, but don't think that you're insane!

944
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,920
Unbelievable, dear friends.

945
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,300
Reverend Carter LeBlanc suddenly fired up, leaping on the stage with the Minoan brain-eaters

946
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,040
jamming in the background like mad.

947
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,100
It's insane!

948
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:06,800
It's mad!

949
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,780
It's 6X Day!

950
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,440
It's mad!

951
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,760
It doesn't matter if you sell the good shit!

952
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,300
It doesn't matter if it's hot steroids!

953
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,840
It doesn't matter if...

954
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,080
Friends, you can't understand a word he's saying, but go, baby, go!

955
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,440
It doesn't matter if it's a bike merger!

956
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,460
It doesn't matter if it's industrial secrets!

957
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:32,080
If you're selling good shit, it's not hard to sell!

958
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,440
It's not hard to sell!

959
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,200
It's not hard to sell!

960
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:36,780
It's not hard to sell!

961
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:36,780


962
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:49,580
Anybody, anybody who has studied any form of transcendental mysticism knows, they know that this reality is an illusion.

963
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:53,100
The things that surround us are nothing at all.

964
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,860
And that's a great deal for you.

965
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,120
That's a great deal for you tonight.

966
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:08,380
Guys, if the world we live in, if the world we live in is truly nothing, then Bob Dobbs has a great deal for you.

967
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,340
He's got something for nothing, and it's only going to cost you $30.

968
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,020
Amazing, dear friends.

969
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:24,240
The Minoan Brain Eaters opening for amino acids.

970
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,900
And Reverend Carter LeBlanc ranting his fool.

971
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:28,540
Head off.

972
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,780
So how many times did you jam an X-Tank?

973
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,980
I jammed twice.

974
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,100
And then where was the success in that?

975
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:02,940
The video playment area in relation to, say, I mean, was there a mass?

976
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,640
Like Burning Man has a mass.

977
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:11,480
No, it was like Tranquility Base.

978
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:21,060
It would be like having a club at one of the clubs, one of the camp clubs, theme camps, as opposed to the main stage.

979
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,920
There is a main stage at X-Day.

980
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:26,000
And the main stage is where the events take place.

981
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,400
Like, you know, the...

982
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,380
The Bobby contest, the Alien contest.

983
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,860
They have to put up steel spheres pointing out where the Bobby is at.

984
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:34,940
Oh, yeah.

985
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,760
The Bobby is at X-Day.

986
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,720
I think I've seen that in the...

987
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,720
I took pictures of that.

988
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,920
If any Bobby comes too near the perimeter fence,

989
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,440
he is instantly electrocuted.

990
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,700
His frizzling body hangs on the wires until it decays and falls away.

991
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:57,980
A Faye-like lead singer that was spouting some kind of obtuse,

992
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:05,380
and then, of course, the swimming pool and the various hot tubs in the area.

993
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,740
There's like two hot tubs.

994
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:08,140
Hop in.

995
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,500
And then...

996
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,040
That's just a copy. Don't jump in.

997
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:17,840
You know, the various dump stations that we like to visit periodically,

998
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,120
and all the various places where you can purchase your subgenius...

999
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,720
Yeah, it's developed, but it's private.

1000
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:25,920
It's like Grandview?

1001
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:26,980
I mean...

1002
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:27,260
Yeah.

1003
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,260
Oh, it's much more developed than Grandview.

1004
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,360
It's a private campground.

1005
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:33,920
Yeah.

1006
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,700
For privates only. No corporals are allowed.

1007
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,980
So, you know, people wander around without any clothes on,

1008
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,860
without feeling restricted or inhibited in any way.

1009
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:46,060
But they can play the violin like a virtuoso without a single mistake.

1010
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:51,100
The nasty stares of those traveling in subgeni that just gawk and gawk and gander.

1011
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:55,580
Well, when I get up in the morning and my feet are cold, I don't like to get down on the stairs.

1012
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:56,680
Flying over there.

1013
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,320
I just touch the bone to the strings.

1014
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:11,000
But then we were naturally endowed with astonishing powers of renewal, self-repair, regeneration.

1015
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:14,900
And here we are, you listening, me talking.

1016
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:16,900
Nothing seems different.

1017
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:18,980
I don't get it.

1018
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:21,400
What happened?

1019
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,740
The aliens came.

1020
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,460
Let's rewind that one millisecond.

1021
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,100


1022
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,100


1023
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,100


1024
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,100


1025
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,100


1026
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,100


1027
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,100


1028
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,100


1029
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,100


1030
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,320
When the world ended.

1031
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,280
Alright, let's play that video.

1032
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:32,880
Wow.

1033
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,760
Oh, there the aliens are.

1034
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:36,800
Oh, for goodness sake.

1035
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,180
Cut it. Cut it.

1036
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:44,260
I really like the way that sample collar made it sound so real this time.

1037
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:45,840
So that's what the aliens did.

1038
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:49,120
They came, they exterminated, and here we are.

1039
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,020
Are you getting enough magnesium?

1040
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,040
Well, I'm getting my zinc.

1041
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,860
And I'm also getting the...

1042
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:58,100
Look, he's packing his zinc into his soup bag and he's ready to go.

1043
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:58,100


1044
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,760
What about the talking Apollo 11 lunar module?

1045
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:05,620
What about the maximizing your ear and brain function technique pills?

1046
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,120
What about exorcising a demon?

1047
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,440
Yeah, we'll bring it up to about 190 PSI.

1048
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:16,880
These are the pills you take to learn the techniques it takes to make tapes that teach you those techniques.

1049
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,660
We're preparing for the end of the show here.

1050
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:19,480
I think...

1051
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,860
Yeah, we're starting to put our records away.

1052
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,700
We're putting our tapes back in our tape boxes.

1053
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,560
We're putting our...

1054
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:26,960
We're putting our...

1055
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,400
Each tape in tape.

1056
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:29,620
Each tape.

1057
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:30,360
And our magazines.

1058
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:38,880
And our various subgenius regalia back in its little packages and its holders and its holsters.

1059
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,480
Subgenius, you mean like Nancy?

1060
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,440
I'm putting my guns back in their holsters.

1061
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:47,220
And I am wrapping up all my fish, my dead fish.

1062
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,360
I'm just showing you my...

1063
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:56,260
Reverend Hal is placing his accoutrements in his well-worn leather...

1064
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:56,940
Oh, is this on?

1065
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,000
...attaché.

1066
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,460
I call it my pouch.

1067
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,120
It's attached to him.

1068
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,120
It's sewn onto his back.

1069
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,040
Hmm, well, okay.

1070
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,020
It may have migrated there.

1071
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:07,540
It's a back pouch.

1072
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,400
I haven't felt anything below the waist for years, but...

1073
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:10,840
He go!

1074
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:11,700
What?

1075
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,140
We're doing the show over here.

1076
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:13,800
Slow over here.

1077
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:14,220
The matter of animal tissue...

1078
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,360
Thirsting after lusting after salt...

1079
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:16,540
Man, man, man.

1080
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,180
...is of crucial importance.

1081
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:26,860
And to keep themselves supplied with this critical liquid, animal oils have developed ways for sensing sodium chloride and other substances.

1082
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:27,700
They have a few moments.

1083
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:32,140
Then with their long tongues, they lick it and they slap it up.

1084
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:32,820
They lick it.

1085
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:33,960
They lick it.

1086
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,980
So I guess all this licking occurred at X-Tag?

1087
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,320
Yeah.

1088
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:47,660
They had a big old subgenius salt licks where we all went down to the river together and we licked on the big old salt licks.

1089
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,940
So what happened right at the end of the world?

1090
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,340
What did you guys do?

1091
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:55,860
The X-ists didn't come again, and of course I never get up.

1092
00:53:55,860 --> 00:54:07,400
It's traditional that Philo always sleeps over sleeps, knowing that when that actually comes, the sex goddesses will come to the cabin, the hierarchy trailer for me.

1093
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:07,420
He is asleep.

1094
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,120
We will not come this year.

1095
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:11,780
And I won't have to worry about actually waking up.

1096
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,080
If he is not going to wake up, we will not come down.

1097
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,760
Sex goddesses.

1098
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,560
Try again next year.

1099
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:20,600
They're plural.

1100
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:21,920
Sorry.

1101
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:23,100
Goodbye.

1102
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:25,840
Oh, you thought I was talking about sex goddesses?

1103
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:25,840


1104
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,280
I was talking about you.

1105
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,020
I get it.

1106
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:27,340
Okay.

1107
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,100
Well, I was.

1108
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,400
Actually, we were talking about you.

1109
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,080
You probably think this show is about you, don't you?

1110
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,300
Especially if your name just happens to be Robert.

1111
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:46,460
But this show is about the one true slack master, J.R. Bob Dobbs, the pipe-smoking super salesman

1112
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:49,440
of belief and disbelief.

1113
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:55,820
And the infinite detail can be had about Bob at www.7eleven.com.

1114
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:55,820


1115
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:55,820


1116
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:55,820


1117
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:55,820


1118
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:55,820


1119
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:55,820


1120
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:55,820


1121
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:55,820


1122
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:55,820


1123
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:55,820


1124
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:55,820


1125
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:55,820


1126
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:55,820


1127
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:02,000
Or you can send me crap at stang...

1128
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:12,420
Post office box 807 Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1129
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:20,080
And now, Soso Donna with his latest mix, Voodoo Crispy X Day 6.

1130
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,820
Bob is back.

1131
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:25,820


1132
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:25,820


1133
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:25,820


1134
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:25,820


1135
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:25,820


1136
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,960
And he's better than ever.

1137
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:09,360
Hold on, Phil.

1138
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:10,820
Hold on.

1139
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:11,500
Ha!

1140
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:15,920
Oh, hey there!

1141
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:19,180
We're back!

1142
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:19,220
Wait!

1143
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:19,300
Oh, anxiety!

1144
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:19,340
It got me.

1145
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:19,340


1146
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:19,380
Okay.

1147
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,400
Thank you.

1148
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:49,820
Thanks.

1149
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,340
So, so, Donna.

1150
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,980
And now, friends of the

1151
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,560
Subgenius Emergency Medical Technician.

1152
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,100
Yes, at every X-Day,

1153
00:56:59,160 --> 00:56:59,880
we have a nurse.

1154
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:01,720
And this is her.

1155
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,860
Our official doctor, you might say.

1156
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,300
Real doctor, available for people

1157
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,340
who get hurt at X-Day.

1158
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,580
And my fellow Subgenius Foundation

1159
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,440
employee, Reverend

1160
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,140
Nikki Deathchair.

1161
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,520
I know what's going on now.

1162
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,080
I'm totally aware of everything.

1163
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,740
Don't worry, it'll heal.

1164
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,100
It wouldn't be so bad

1165
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,660
if it wasn't so funny.

1166
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,680
If it just wasn't so funny that you were hurt.

1167
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,060
It wasn't so true.

1168
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,320
If only it wasn't so funny

1169
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,220
that you were hurt.

1170
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,340
You gotta laugh at your pain.

1171
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,940
The basis of humor

1172
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,640
is the discomfort of others.

1173
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:42,440
It's punishing.

1174
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:45,940
Oh my God.

1175
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,000
He's gonna have a

1176
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,120
cardiac arrest.

1177
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,140
The M.T.

1178
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,480
will have to take it away.

1179
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,880
Sherman Volunteer Fire Department.

1180
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,740
He's laughing.

1181
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,400
It's not the honest thing, the laughing

1182
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,360
is killing me.

1183
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:02,460
Let's go run around and say goodbye to everybody.

1184
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,040
She's dying from laughter.

1185
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:06,440
Okay, okay.

1186
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:10,680
We're gonna say goodbye to everybody else.

1187
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,840
It was fucked up.

1188
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,180
It's so tragic.

1189
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,660
I miss you guys so much.

1190
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,340
You're the fucking popcorn.

1191
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,000
Let's party.

1192
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:25,000
We got five minutes left.

1193
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,020
The Sudden Genius Foundation company

1194
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,220
is a family.

1195
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,840
It's the entire corporation.

1196
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:31,680
Right here.

1197
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,620
He's so violent.

1198
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,060
Bob, you're alive.

1199
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:39,640
Oh my God.

1200
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:40,760
It's all Stank's fault

1201
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,600
and I've had enough.

1202
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,860
Oh, when the doms heads.

1203
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,020
Oh when the doms heads

1204
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:52,340
Oh when the doms heads

1205
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,180
Go killing things

1206
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,440
When the doms heads go killing things

1207
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,140
Oh oh I want to be in that doms town

1208
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,960
When the doms heads go killing things

1209
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,980
Oh, when the doms heads

1210
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:08,300
Oh, when the doms heads

1211
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,580
Oh when the doms heads

1212
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:13,260
When the doms heads go killing things

1213
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,840
Oh, oh I want to be in that information town.

1214
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:17,840


1215
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,260
Bob's town.

1216
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,300
When the Bob's heads go killing things.

1217
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,100
Do you know, Bob needs you right now.

1218
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,500
He needs your $30.

1219
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,700
Banjo Bob, you insufferable inebriate.

1220
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,020
How the fuck are you?

1221
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:46,140
Oh, I took your advice, you fucking turd.

1222
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,180
I put shoes on you, motherfucker.

1223
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,180
You know, if I were you,

1224
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,300
some old man told me to put shoes on.

1225
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:55,520
If it wasn't for your mattress back,

1226
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:57,960
Mammy, with that curb service sign

1227
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,160
and the fucking double bed mattress on her back,

1228
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,820
I wouldn't be a motherfucker.

1229
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,240
Oh yes, I almost forgot.

1230
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,620
Friends,

1231
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,640
are you a subgenius minister yet?

1232
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,000
Have you joined?

1233
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,440
Have you joined the church of the subgenius?

1234
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,420
And by that I mean,

1235
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,080
actually send in your $35

1236
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:24,380
payable by PayPal or credit card

1237
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,820
on subgenius.com

1238
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:30,760
where it says become an ordained minister

1239
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,260
or where it says stores.

1240
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,440
And even if you have,

1241
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:37,820
do you have your well-made Bob t-shirt

1242
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:39,620
from anticonformity.com?

1243
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,560
Do you have your Arise DVD?

1244
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,780
Sure, you can watch it

1245
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,060
on the internet, but

1246
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,340
it's not the same.

1247
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,760
And it isn't the same.

1248
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,700
It hasn't been kissed

1249
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,120
by the lips of Princess Wee

1250
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,840
who kisses every copy of Arise that goes out.

1251
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:01,500
And I sign every copy of Book of the Subgenius.

1252
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,500
How about that?

1253
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,260
You can still get those from us.

1254
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:07,460
But yes, the $35 for the minister's pack,

1255
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,380
you really ought to think about it, folks.

1256
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,760
You don't have to meet

1257
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,780
any subgeniuses

1258
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:15,760
any subgeniuses

1259
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:15,760


1260
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:15,760


1261
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:15,980
ever,

1262
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:19,000
but you will have that option.

1263
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,480
You can't come to X Day

1264
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,440
unless you're a member.

1265
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,560
You can't go to the

1266
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,600
members only

1267
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:28,080
kind of smarty pants

1268
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,160
internet forum called Scrub Genius.

1269
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,400
I do a lot more there

1270
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,580
than on Facebook.

1271
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:38,080
Because Facebook's just a bunch of gimme bobs.

1272
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,680
People who can't even spell Bob's name right.

1273
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,880
Do you know that, Princess Wee?

1274
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,300
They can't even spell Bob's name right,

1275
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:43,760
half of them.

1276
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,620
They leave off the quotes.

1277
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:48,240
Oh yeah, gimme bobs.

1278
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:48,740
You can tell.

1279
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,720
It's so easy to tell.

1280
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:52,760
Anyway, friends,

1281
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,280
we'll be back next week

1282
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,580
with more X Day recordings

1283
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,580
and hopefully with the lonesome cowboy.

1284
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,620
Hopefully he won't be lonesome next week.

1285
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:03,240
Well, thank you.

1286
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:04,260
Good night.

1287
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,680
And praise Bob.

1288
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:08,760
Yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai, yai.
