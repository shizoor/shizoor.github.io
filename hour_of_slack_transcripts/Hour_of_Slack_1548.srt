1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,280
And, yes, this is Synesthesia, a special post-X-Day wrap-up edition here.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,900
With me in the studio, we have Dr. Holland Owl and Reverend Ivan Stang.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,280
And on the phone line, we have Dr. Philo Drummond, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,100
and it sounds like Princess Wee Ardo is there in the background as well.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,460
Yes, indeed.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,920
Yes, there you are.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,960
Bye, George.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,840
So we're going to take a minute here to pause for a little bit while we're going to change the disc here.

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,880
Here and easy with that.

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,580
That's a personal one.

11
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,060
Stay tuned because we've got some.

12
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,060
That goes back to the days of the ancient Olympus, you know, that disc is here.

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,100
It's my sacroiliac duty.

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,580
Okay.

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,760
Listen to yourself, Bob.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,280
You follow her to work.

17
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,380
You open her mail.

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,940
You eavesdrop on her.

19
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,940
So genius.

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,620
Power of work.

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,160
Dr. Drummond, your voice is sounding robotic.

22
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,320
Are you in the middle of a transformation to overman?

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,820
Robotic.

24
00:00:59,380 --> 00:00:59,580
Beep.

25
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,420
It could be.

26
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,520
I'm actually just flapping mightily.

27
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,520
You can say that on the radio.

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,260
That's not fair.

29
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,940
Flapping is perfectly acceptable in family.

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,160
I'm probably 15 feet from you.

31
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,780
Yeah, what are you doing out there?

32
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,180
Well, it's a good place to make a phone call.

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,500
On her service, you have to stand in the middle of the highway outside the bed and breakfast.

34
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,600
Yeah, there's only two bars, Charlene.

35
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,360
It's in Louie's place.

36
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,220
Okay, well, I will walk over there to where you are.

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,120
That's a good idea.

38
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,280
Then we'll hear in the studio.

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,480
No, I'm not wearing any mosquito repellent.

40
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,620
And Dr. Howell's not there to draw the mosquitoes to his...

41
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,060
I'm not wearing any mosquito repellent either.

42
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,300
How about that?

43
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,400
No, you're wearing mosquito attractant.

44
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,440
It's called Dr. Howell's sweat.

45
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,280
All right, all right, all right.

46
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,500
It's a sweaty time.

47
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,820
Okay, I'm hiking my way across the...

48
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,840
This is a mobile operation now.

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,240
Sustain we now.

50
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:02,920
No longer stationary.

51
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,040
Description of a time...

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,060
Yeah, I'm tuning out.

53
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,420
I'm tuning out.

54
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,120
My battery...

55
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,260
Petty luster...

56
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,640
Oh, no, there went Princess Wee.

57
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,520
She let us know.

58
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,900
...have lost us Princess Wee.

59
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,460
As I got over to Princess Wee, she tonked out.

60
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,120
Her battery gave out great heart.

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,460
Her body is still here.

62
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,560
I'm looking at her body.

63
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,020
Hey, hey, hey.

64
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,460
Well, give it a pinch for me.

65
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,680
Hey, we do have a...

66
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,740
In fact, does she still have her tattoo on the chest that I applied?

67
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,060
Hey!

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,500
Yeah, she still has her tattoo.

69
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,440
On her chest.

70
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,220
Well...

71
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:30,640
I still do.

72
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,540
Well, see, there you go.

73
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,580
She still has it to me.

74
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,820
I walked into the living room, and there was Dr. Howell drawing on my wife's chest.

75
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,420
It's a nice eye and a pyramid design.

76
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,100
Yes, that's what we do at X-Day.

77
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,480
If anybody wants a drawing by me on them for free, they can, but few do.

78
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,400
Let's take another caller here.

79
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,020
Hello, around the air.

80
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,200
Can we take it?

81
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,580
I would like to answer...

82
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,860
I would like to answer the previous caller's question.

83
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,440
I didn't even hear it.

84
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,180
About what is it doing around me, 6-D to me.

85
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,000
6-12 and the oblong hangings that they were planning to...

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,160
WD-40.

87
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,420
In the corner, yeah.

88
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,640
Hey, Dave, you're on the phone with Philo.

89
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,740
Philo did call in.

90
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,440
He's got heroin and cocaine on his ass.

91
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,080
And Princess Wee...

92
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,040
I'm sorry.

93
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,920
I thought I was on mute.

94
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,920
Princess Wee is hovering nearby, about six inches above the ground.

95
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,060


96
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,240
Oh, okay.

97
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,440
Yeah, did we must call also?

98
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,460
Yeah, she's still at Wisteria.

99
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,720
It sounds like a room full of barnyard animals.

100
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,880
Or some sort of barnyard...

101
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,340
Barnyard imitations, eh?

102
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,320
Make a noise like a goose.

103
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,880
Yeehaw.

104
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,400
Please.

105
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,600
That's the wrong animal.

106
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,340
Yeehaw.

107
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,220
I'm very disappointed in that particular imitation.

108
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,720
He had it through the donkey when he said the goose.

109
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,660
Am I still coming in?

110
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,720
Okay, let's drop that aspect then, but...

111
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,040
Yeehaw.

112
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,280
Did you know that that small part of Ohio in which Wisteria is located

113
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,740
is known as a biological treasure reserve with more concentrated species in that area

114
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,340
than in, well, hardly any other place on the planet?

115
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,060
No other place on the planet is diverse as that one.

116
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,180
Yes, with its thousands of buzzing, stinging insects.

117
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:25,140
There are more types of venomous insects, plants, and reptiles, and even salamanders out there

118
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,040
than you can find anywhere else.

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,420
Except the Amazon jungle.

120
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,080
What about that...

121
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,700
And it's the only home of the Kandiri toad.

122
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,060
And that freshwater sea serpent, which many people saw.

123
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,520
And, of course, the giant tortoise, or turtle, known as...

124
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:39,620
Old...

125
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,740
Who do they call it?

126
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,040
Old Sequa.

127
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:49,320
That's why the Native Americans created the original turtle mound that's seen somewhat near Old Sequa's lair.

128
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:54,320
The goofy beach ball eyeballs were added by hippies in later times.

129
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,400
That's no burial mound.

130
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,020
That's...

131
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,540
It's a warning.

132
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,220
It's a warning to the skies, to the heavens above.

133
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:08,860
In this bioregion, giant turtle forms like Old Sequa flourish.

134
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:17,160
The nearest giant turtle is in Indiana, in southern Indiana, on the map of America's cryptic monsters.

135
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,380
Did you know that there's a north-south passageway going all the way from Kentucky,

136
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,180
all the way to the Great Lakes?

137
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,200
And over to...

138
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,000
It was on the road.

139
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,800
Underground.

140
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,240
The endless caverns.

141
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,140
The world of...

142
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,520
The endless caverns are in Tennessee and southern Kentucky.

143
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,960
Mammoth caves.

144
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,760
So what was the word of response?

145
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,300
Where imprisoned mammoths may still be heard trumpeting.

146
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,100
Now, this is bad.

147
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,940
Everybody's talking at the same time, and then they stop.

148
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,920
Was this voted the worst X-Day ever?

149
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,740
To some, it was the worst X-Day ever.

151
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,460
Because no one died.

152
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,900
And to others, it was the best X-Day ever.

153
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,120
It was a fine X-Day.

154
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,620
Because no one died.

155
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,560
Last day was the worst X...

156
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,480
Last X-Day was the worst X-Day ever.

157
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,020
This X-Day was an adequate X-Day.

158
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,020
Adequate, I must say.

159
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,940
I am gourmet food and delightful-looking young ladies...

160
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,820
Cream of corn soup and corn chowder.

161
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:25,260
You know, by the last day of X-Day, they were bowing and cringing before Stang and myself,

162
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,000
bringing us...

163
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,860
Iced tea on a silver salver, bending over humbly.

164
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,720
They did.

165
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,120
Yeah.

166
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,740
Well, beforehand, they act like they don't even know you.

167
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm sure they were bringing me more than that.

168
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,100
Well, I'm sure they brought you something.

169
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,040
They were bringing me the good stuff.

170
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,320
Well, you were trained by Bob.

171
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,600
Don't share this with Hal.

172
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,480
The rest of us are groping in the dark, but of course...

173
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,580
Oh, there was a lot of that going on.

174
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,980
I remember there was a tumor squelching.

175
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,200
There was a squelching party where some of the Arapa guys who band together and whispered

176
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,160
two rumors to each other.

177
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,640
And there was...

178
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,820
Well, Reverend Pickles was there.

179
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,780
Reverend Schicklgruber?

180
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,340
Pickles.

181
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,460
Reverend Schicklgruber.

182
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,680
There never was such a...

183
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,080
It was Anton or Alloy or something like that.

184
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,760
That was several years back.

185
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,440
There was no such Nazified person there this time.

186
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,260
I meant Reverend Pickles.

187
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,860
Once again, I said Pickles.

188
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,140
Pickles.

189
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:26,760
Pickles.

190
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,060
And many people took pictures for the absent Reverend Pease.

191
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,840
Pease.

192
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,240
What was that year that you weren't there, Dr. Hal?

193
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,340
Well, that was way back in the year zero, I think.

194
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,120
That was a good year.

195
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,960
There was one year I went that you weren't there.

196
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,160
Because I stayed in the bedroom that you normally sleep in.

197
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,140
There were a bunch of years when Dr. Hal wasn't there.

198
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,520
Well, at one time, I didn't stay in that bedroom at all.

199
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,140
But in an insect-infested pop-up.

200
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,480
That's right.

201
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,020
The first time.

202
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,020
It would pop up and large huntsman spiders would drop from the ceiling.

203
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,500
I remember sometimes in the old days, though, when we used to reverberate.

204
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,160
Laying on the side of a road with a bottle of absinthe in your hand

205
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,720
and see that you had parked your carcass right wherever you damn well pleased

206
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,420
over in New York State there.

207
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,320
That was a famous comedian, Park Your Carcass.

208
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,300
That guy.

209
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,340
I...

210
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:24,860
Never.

211
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,120
Ever.

212
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,900
Remember that night we put the four snoring guys in that same place?

213
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,620
Oh, possum.

214
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,740
And created the vortex of snores?

215
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,600
Yeah, yeah.

216
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,400
That was nightmarish.

217
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,960
That was a terrible X-Day.

218
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,260
The X-Day of snore vortex.

219
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,460
In snore world.

220
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,180
And we drove the other campers away from the loudness of the reverberation.

221
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:46,660
The cross.

222
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,020
Was that because there wasn't enough power to power their hookup?

223
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,180
That was at the other place.

224
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:53,620
What was that?

225
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,200
Is that...

226
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,000
The grounds are in the...

227
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,420
There wasn't enough earplugs to shield their eardrums from the mighty snores that were...

228
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,240
It wasn't the snores so much as...

229
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,940
There was a little girl blowing a vuvuzela all the time when we were trying to sleep.

230
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,840
We were talking about X-Days of yore.

231
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,620
Oh, yore.

232
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,480
Yeah, in the olden days when we stayed in a house trailer.

233
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,260
Yore.

234
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,880
An unfurnished, echoing house trailer.

235
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,960
It was like a church camp dormitory.

236
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,340
There were like these cots there.

237
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,060
Each person would carve out a cot like it was their place to go and stuff.

238
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,560
Yeah.

239
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,840
Yeah, I remember that now.

240
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,520
It was...

241
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,660
The snorers were Philo, Dr. Hal, Dr. G. Gordon, Gordon, and myself.

242
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,880
I protest this calumny.

243
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,300
And together, the four of us, we rattled...

244
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,000
That trailer rattled apart.

245
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,080
All the four sides of it fell off.

246
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,360
The ceiling fell in.

247
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,620
Well, I'm going to have to like butcher a hog in a minute.

248
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,660
Well, we saw a man jump...

249
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,980
Jump his bike over three burning cars.

250
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,400
That's right.

251
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,520
Circus Apocalypse was an X-Day.

252
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,180
David Apocalypse.

253
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,400
David Apocalypse was there.

254
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,560
You never said that.

255
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:02,920
He...

256
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,520
I'm not kidding.

257
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,920
He really did drive his bike over three flaming cars.

258
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,680
And landed on the other side.

259
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,180
Yeah.

260
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,160
Yeah, he did.

261
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,800
And we've got...

262
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
So what, he's doing like stunts and stuff now?

263
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,080
Yes.

264
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,900
Or was it regular, some neat stunts?

265
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,460
Now, ladies and gentlemen, this next act is...

266
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,320
Might possibly be...

267
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,360
Might possibly be the most ridiculous thing you see all weekend.

268
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,140
What I'm about to do...

269
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,680
What I'm about to do is...

270
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,420
On my little clown bike...

271
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,380
Jump three cars on fire.

272
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,420
Pay attention.

273
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,940
Do what the clown tells you to do.

274
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,740
If you guys want to be safe, stand still.

275
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,080
Just do what the clown does to you.

276
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,600
Be aware.

277
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,320
Be aware.

278
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,320


279
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,320


280
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,320


281
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,320


282
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,120
Be very aware.

283
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,800
Touch yourself.

284
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,280
Touch your neighbor.

285
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:01,860
No, don't.

286
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,720
No, do.

287
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,920
I'm kidding.

288
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,280
Safety third.

289
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,020
Get it right.

290
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,700
This is a sideshow, son.

291
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,400
What you are about to see is real.

292
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,660
What you are about to see is real.

293
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,460
This is reality.

294
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,340
Indisputable.

295
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,280
Obvious.

296
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:21,700
Obvious.

297
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,120
And right before...

298
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:23,620
And right before your eyes.

299
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,600
What you are about to see is real.

300
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,520
Dave, I'm sorry to tell you, but whatever is going on, it looks really wrong.

301
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,300
This is not how I envisioned this at all.

302
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,140
Direct from Isle of Death Co.

303
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,140
In Telebrands Plaza, New Jersey.

304
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,180
He's from Iowa, Dad?

305
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,560
Okay, you're going to set up the ramp?

306
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,120
All right.

307
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:47,920
All right.

308
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

309
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

310
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,380
Yeah, yeah.

311
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,900
Yeah.

312
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

313
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,620
Oh, no.

314
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:06,260
David Apocalypse will attempt to jump three cars on his bicycle on fire.

315
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,080
Okay.

316
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,180
We need three volunteers from the audience who have cars.

317
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,480
Can I get three cars down to the stage area now?

318
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,880
Three volunteers who arrived here by car.

319
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,160
Wait.

320
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,520
You...

321
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,240
We need it so we can set three cars on fire.

322
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,320
David.

323
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,540
Okay, we got three. We got three. We got three. We're good.

324
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,260
Okay, we're bringing them down. All right.

325
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,120
Oh, there they come. Everyone look up there. Here come the cars.

326
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,520
They're on their way. No, don't look at me. Look up there.

327
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,200
I hear them. I hear the engines. Do we have enough safety tape?

328
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,900
I have the cars. You have the cars? Okay, bring the cars. Bring the gasoline.

329
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,860
We're ready.

330
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,860
I hope the safety tape is as best as I can get.

331
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,260
All right. I'm going to need to get a running start here

332
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:02,820
because this ground is absolutely perfect for this kind of act, I have to say.

333
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,880
This is going to be great.

334
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:09,980
All right.

335
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,460
I'm ready.

336
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,600
All the people that I've tied up, set them on fire.

337
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:20,840
No, no, no.

338
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,220
No, no, no.

339
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,120
Out of the way. Out of the way.

340
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,000
Here we go.

341
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,000
And I make it.

342
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,100
And I make it.

343
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,320
Medicals. We're good.

344
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,900
Medicals have your gun. We've got David Apostolos, everyone.

345
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,180
David Apostolos.

346
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,940
David Apostolos.

347
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,600
David Apostolos truly is one of us.

348
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,200
Take it with you.

349
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,920
Thank you.

350
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,860
One of us.

351
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,720
One of us.

352
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,880
Those flaming cars are just little plastic toy cars.

353
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,060
They've been lit on fire.

354
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,220
They're miniature cars.

355
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:18,980
Shut up!

356
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,640
This circus has been brought to you by the letters LSMD.

357
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,460
Hint, assholes.

358
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,280
And brought to you by the numbers.

359
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,560
What were they again?

360
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,700
Six.

361
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,440
Six.

362
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:37,320
Six.

363
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,860
And six.

364
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,220
And six.

365
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,000
What fire? No.

366
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,820
That's just noxious, that's just noxious, poisonous fumes that people are inhaling.

367
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,580
It's not a big deal.

368
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,260
That's just plastic matchbox cars on fire.

369
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,640
Breathe, breathe deeply.

370
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,720
Yeah, they know why.

371
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,200
Come on, fracking equals jobs, people.

372
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,120
Yeah, right?

373
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:56,820
Right?

374
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,580
We're creating a future.

375
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,920
Do we have anything else?

376
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,080
Burning is just the beginning.

377
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,020
No, we're done.

378
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:02,900
We're done?

379
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,780
Gooble gobble.

380
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,760
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.

381
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,520
My name is David Apocalypt.

382
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,760
This is Andrew the Impaled.

383
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,800
Gooble gobble, gooble gobble, we accept you, we accept you.

384
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:17,800


385
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:17,800


386
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:17,800


387
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:17,800


388
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:17,800


389
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:17,800


390
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:17,800


391
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:17,800


392
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,620
Gooble gobble, gooble gobble, one of us, one of us.

393
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,840
You should have been there, man.

394
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,020
It was boss bitching and groovy.

395
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,780
Yeah, Evel Knievel would have been impressed.

396
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,160
Anyone would have been impressed.

397
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,500
Amoeba Knievel would have been even more impressed, but he wasn't there.

398
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,720
It's a full-scale tabletop rally.

399
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,860
Told you, told you, told you.

400
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,800
But that was just part of a larger show involving mutilations.

401
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,920
Pain, nails driven into the face.

402
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,480
Yeah, who can get out of the straitjacket first?

403
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,440
Right.

404
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,940
Necessary training for your average subgenius.

405
00:15:59,600 --> 00:15:59,800
Attention.

406
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,560
Your thoughts and monitors for quality purposes.

407
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,020
Raise awareness.

408
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,220
Attention.

409
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,800
Raise awareness.

410
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,100
Raise awareness.

411
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,480
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I tell you.

412
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,780
Originally, I was a doctor.

413
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,640
I was famous for the gravity from the slack crusades and the fine-shell circus apocalypse.

414
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
Alcatraz could not hold him.

415
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,140
Psychotropic drugs could not control him.

416
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,700
The bed and breakfast won't let him back in.

417
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:42,680
Ladies and gentlemen, I tell you, I give you, the one, the only, reverend, David Apocalypse.

418
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,860
Release.

419
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:44,820
Release.

420
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,340
Yeah.

421
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,220
I'll fuck you again for the very first time.

422
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,660
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to perform one of my favorite stunts here.

423
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,880
This is called the human blockhead.

424
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,320
What I'm going to do is I'm going to take this ice pick and drive it directly into the center of my fucking face.

425
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,860
Now before I do this, it's very important to let each and every one of you know, do not try this at home.

426
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,460
Because my face is here.

427
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:18,160
And if you try to do it with my face in your home, you will surely be breaking some kind of physical laws.

428
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,260
And we are all law-abiding citizens here.

429
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,040
Citizens of something anyways.

430
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,760
Now this could be the last time I do this act.

431
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:36,980
Not because I'm going to kill myself, but I assume there's going to be metal detectors at the spaceships and they're not going to let me take this thing on.

432
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,060
I'm a little bit worried about that.

433
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,440
I don't know.

434
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,440


435
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,440


436
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,440


437
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,440


438
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,440


439
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,440


440
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,440


441
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:40,440


442
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:46,880
I have some, you know, unmentionable things that I really don't want to be seeing on the x-ray machine in front of everyone, if you know what I mean.

443
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:55,700
You know, so it's going to be a little bit of just, you know, keister what you can before you get on the spaceships is all I'm saying.

444
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,000
Before I begin, I'm going to tell you a quick little story.

445
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,780
This is an honest to God truth story.

446
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,700
This is the story of how David Apocalypse decided he needed to join the circus.

447
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,660
As many of you can imagine, a guy that...

448
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,300
dresses and behaves like me had a hard time growing up.

449
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,860
And one time my dad took me to the circus.

450
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,440
And while I was at the circus, I saw the elephant act.

451
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,220
And the guy had the elephant stand on his hind legs and everyone applauded.

452
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,880
And the guy had the elephant come up on this little wheel...

453
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,180
little stool thing and stand up on one foot and everyone applauded.

454
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,300
And then the guy had who he said was his wife lay down on the ground.

455
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,440
And he said,

456
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,120
and he said he was going to have the elephant walk right crosser and the elephant came along.

457
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:54,340
And the elephant took its left foot put its front left foot over top over and onto the other side of earth.

458
00:18:54,620 --> 00:19:01,700
Then the elephant took its right foot over over the woman and onto the other side.

459
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:08,800
And then the elephant took its rear left foot over the woman and onto the other side of her.

460
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:22,720
point the elephant stopped straddling this woman and the elephant urinated and

461
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,260
I don't know if you've ever paid attention to an elephant urinate but it

462
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:34,100
takes a long time and there's a lot of it it was incredible and the audience

463
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:43,160
had this collective gasp of horror and titillation and after the elephant was

464
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,540
done curiously enough elephants don't have any way to shake when they're done

465
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,500
it just sort of dribbles after the elephant was done it finished walking

466
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:59,400
over the lady and that woman who had just had the most disgraceful thing I've

467
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,140
seen happen to a person just about anywhere except my own bedroom

468
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:11,220
that woman stood there laid down and stood up and with a huge smile on her

469
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:22,060
face went tada and it was at that moment that I knew I wanted to be in the circus

470
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,680
because if you can have something that horrendous happen to you in front of

471
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,900
that many people and get up and give the world a tada you're about the strongest

472
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,960
person in the world

473
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,080
you're about the strongest person in the world

474
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,880
now ladies and gentlemen what I'm gonna do isn't near as bad as getting

475
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,040
urinated on in the face by an elephant but we'll see if we can make it close

476
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,320
this ice pick has been verified by my expert here you are an expert aren't you

477
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,660
have you ever built anything before well then I guess we're fucked all right

478
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,560
ladies and gentlemen watch as I attempt to take this ice pick and drive it

479
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,460
directly into the center of my face

480
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,100
very important for all of you remember if you're gonna treat if you're gonna be

481
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:16,860
penetrating anyone or anything lube liberally

482
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,440

483
00:21:34,860 --> 00:22:02,420
ladies and gentlemen at this point I've driven this thing all the way up to the handle into my face hammering on it anymore that'd just be fucking stupid at this point oh yeah that opens up the all third nostril ladies and gentlemen at this point you're about to see a giant

484
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,420


485
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,420


486
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,420


487
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,420


488
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,420


489
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,420


490
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,420


491
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,420


492
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,420


493
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,420


494
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,420


495
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,420


496
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,420


497
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,420


498
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:02,420


499
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,140
you either clap or I give you the clap

500
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:29,160
now removing it that takes a little more finesse not really but you know if you do it without the finesse it takes all the class out of an act like this and you got to admit this is a hell of a classy act huh there we go

501
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,680
you

502
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,000

00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,860
in my enlightened form where do you put your skeleton while you're doing this

797
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,780
hey uh i have to admit to a crime

798
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,480
uh oh

799
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:29,420
i just realized that it was a crime but uh didn't weren't we performing on the fourth of july and we ended our show with that flaming sword that shoots like

800
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,040
exactly

801
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,320
like a roman candle

802
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,900
i saw it

803
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,780
which i aimed

804
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,540
you had it

805
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,380
at the sky in order to fight god

806
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,700
yes the subgenius war on god continues

807
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,240
yeah i got back to

808
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:40,440
you're against the law

809
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,140
i've got back to yelling and screaming at god and threatening him with this big sword

810
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:48,180
i have to say god always has a bigger sword but it wasn't magnificent

811
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,960
that's what makes the war on god so much fun for god

812
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,700
he knows he's gonna win

813
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,320
the losing side always has the coolest uniforms

814
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:07,520
yeah like the poltergeist see we read the book and we know we won and stuff that's how they don't have to you know go take dance classes or any of this stuff the other kids had to do

815
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,020
poltergeists make up the principal part of spontaneous material manifestation

816
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,960
not actually against the law

817
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:16,780
poltergeists

818
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,640
no just shot it shoot a sword at god

819
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,800
well there you go you're in the clear stang

820
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,980
our legal department has just released you from any indemnification for your damnation

821
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,760

822
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,360

823
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,120

824
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,460
how can i do that?

825
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,280
he wants to look at the nasty gossip

826
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,780
yes he does

827
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,080
you were there for it dr drummond don't worry

828
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:51,080
they didn't say anything too much too bad about you and what they did say well let's face it it was all true

829
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,460
were you there when they crucified my lord?

830
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,040
the true lies that they're trying to spread about me

831
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,420
mhm well

832
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,600
you should be used to it by now

833
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:07,500
ad hominem or ad hoc whatever they call it on the way to kentucky are you fighting the vital fights still in this area down there

834
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:15,380
we're still um we're over here next to next to the house on the pad that was vacated lunch a while back

835
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,940
he's on the pad as they call it

836
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,640
we have our pads empty after lunch and that means their lunch is going somewhere

837
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:31,660
you know when i performed that wedding did you notice dr howell at the end of it they consummated their marriage by launching a bleeding head

838
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:37,480
i saw that that old tradition refuses to die they had this hideous head with the hanging head

839
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,080
they were hanging tatters of flesh and they took the golf club

840
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,980
it smelled horrible

841
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,480
yeah well you see the pride of

842
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,920
that was like they didn't bring wedding rings they brought a golf club and a decapitated head

843
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,080
and this was a subgenius wedding

844
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:56,120
golfing or tennis or something like that and a few decapitations

845
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,380
they brought the important stuff

846
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,420
yeah

847
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:03,800

848
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,460
oh yes dear friend

849
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:07,460


850
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:24,860
a solemn solemn ceremony about to begin well it may not be that solemn considering the atmosphere which is a taco pot party taco filling or pot luck sorry pot luck party

851
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,700
wait a minute i thought you said it was a pot party

852
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,700

one

855
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:57,620
one more time now if the bride hasn't gotten cold feet and fled to another state this is when she would come trite sing down the aisle led by her father jr bob dobbs who is giving away and she well pretty close a bloody human head

856
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,840

this is what marriage is all about dear friends

860
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:31,220
my son has a euphemism for uh for for the wedding bed they call sex cutting the onions because it involves tears and sharp knives

861
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,820
and if you guys need any explanations later on

862
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:34,820

871
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:23,380
swear on a book of the subgenius friends normally subgenius weddings are the

872
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:27,860
utilitarian type that only lasts 24 hours or less just because somebody

873
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:32,180
wants to get laid I don't know if that's an issue here I'm not gonna ask but this

874
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:37,140
isn't one of those this is the real thing there are papers being signed that

875
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:44,720
will lock these two together in legal state authorized as well as subgenius

876
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:59,980
matrimony lay your hand on this sacred Bible and swear that you are who you are

877
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,840
that's all you have to say

878
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:02,500
I do

879
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:09,360
yeah most okay all right that's all we just had to get that hand print all right

880
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:15,960
dearly beloveds we are gathered here in the presence of JR Bob Dobbs whichever

881
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:22,380
form he may choose to take let's hope it's not like last year and insert any

882
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:28,040
other deity names here that you might need or require but probably Bob is

883
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,400
enough Mothra Gamera

884
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:38,560
we are gathered here in the presence of JR Bob Dobbs Mothra and Gamera and why

885
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:45,680
not the gargantuas too we'll throw them in to join this man if he is indeed a man

886
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:52,280
and this woman if she is indeed a woman he's Reverend Fox she is Reverend Astor

887
00:41:52,280 --> 00:42:02,160
in a permanent and yet still virtuous bondage of holy matrimony in the name of

888
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:12,260
Jesus Jesus we don't have what it takes pray those flies though I'm

889
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:12,500

890
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:31,960
swallow the

891
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,860
the subgenius.

892
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,780
Because it'll be legal for everybody

893
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,140
when we're completely done.

894
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,980
Okay. This is a bond

895
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,300
of subholy

896
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,560
wedlock, so that no matter what

897
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,760
physical position these beloved may take

898
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,360
in the next centuries,

899
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,540
their moral standing

900
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,120
shall remain

901
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,180
upright.

902
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,700
Now, if there are any jealous losers

903
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,840
here who feel that this man and woman should not be

904
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,820
joined together forever, just hold

905
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,560
your peace, because I don't want to hear about it, okay?

906
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:02,460
Yeah!

907
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,620
But we want to hear from

908
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,780
them, so I

909
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,600
will first hold the mic up to

910
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,680
the boy, or

911
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,760
I think they always did

912
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,300
Yeah, I had to go first, too.

913
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,760
Oh, because

914
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,660
she has the punchline.

915
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,880
My priestess

916
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,480
pokey.

917
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,620
Shut up!

918
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,500
When I met Bob about

919
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,780
ten years ago, I felt I was

920
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,800
kissing my chance for romance good fucking

921
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,760
bye. But the first

922
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,660
time I met you, you were in a

923
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,380
conspiracy uniform and

924
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,660
fitting yourself with a fake name tag.

925
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,720
So from the

926
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,600
beginning, you had little patience

927
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,100
for the moronic, droning,

928
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,600
nonsensical behavior of sweaty

929
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,540
tourists in 100

930
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,760
degree heat. And I thought

931
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,560
that was pretty hot.

932
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,440
After a few failed first attempts to introduce

933
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,520
myself, we started seeing

934
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,680
each other more and we were having a lot

935
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,300
of fun and we really connected.

936
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,100
Then I introduced you to Bob

937
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,520
and I didn't know what would happen.

938
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,120
And a few years later, we went to

939
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,460
X Day 14

940
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,280
and I felt we got to really be ourselves

941
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,720
there, really for the first

942
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,720
time. And I really

943
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,860
like seeing how naturally wonderful you are.

944
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,120
And since we've done everything together,

945
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,100
I love you and I want to keep doing

946
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:33,900
everything together.

947
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:54,060
I can hold that if you need to.

948
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,360
If you would.

949
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,320
I'm not as verbal

950
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,100
as Bob.

951
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,020
Ben is. I just

952
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,480
usually sit back and glare at everybody.

953
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,060
But here's what

954
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:07,480
I have.

955
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,940
Since I first met Fox

956
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,920
and told him to

957
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,440
fuck off and never speak to me again,

958
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,820
I knew that I would never be bored

959
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,080
whenever he was around.

960
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,500
And in the last seven years

961
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,840
and our many

962
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,500
adventures into

963
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,720
the terrifying darkness

964
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:28,940
that exists

965
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,480
just over the hill of all the

966
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,100
right-wing people.

967
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:31,120


968
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:31,740
in the great city lights.

969
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,260
This has been proved true.

970
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,520
And we still go on those adventures.

971
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,740
And we still almost end up dying and coming back out the other side.

972
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,820
Nobody knows how.

973
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:47,960
You are the person who introduced me to Bob

974
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,640
in the most random and sideways of ways.

975
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,840
And I'm so glad to have met Bob

976
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,900
and all the wonderful people that you've brought me to know.

977
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,100
And you were my contact.

978
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,900
And you are my constant companion in getting slack,

979
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,140
in making slack,

980
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,660
and fighting to get the slack we deserve.

981
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,960
And I know when the saucers come,

982
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,260
or the years that may follow,

983
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,180
whichever happens,

984
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,360
we will fight the conspiracy together

985
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,020
and forever be Yetis.

986
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,760
And I love that.

987
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:20,420
Wow!

988
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,080
All right!

989
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

990
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,300
That was,

991
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:30,300
those were some of the best vows I ever heard.

992
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,180
Although I got confused earlier.

993
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,060
I thought you guys were going to exchange vows.

994
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,240
Just to make this personal.

995
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,440
Princess Wee and I met you guys earlier.

996
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,260
And when we went to Orlando

997
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:44,640
and were guided around by Reverend Fox,

998
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,420
you had to work and you weren't there.

999
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,460
But we were aware of you

1000
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,920
because he wouldn't shut up about it.

1001
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,720
And we, as often happens,

1002
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,260
Princess Wee and I, who are true Yeti mates,

1003
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,840
we looked at each other afterwards

1004
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,460
and we thought,

1005
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,080
what a nice couple.

1006
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,600
How did that nerd ever score her?

1007
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,520
But that's almost always the question

1008
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,660
in these weddings.

1009
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,720
And actually we did gradually figure it out.

1010
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,140
He does kind of grow on you, doesn't he?

1011
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,000
He does.

1012
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,760
Now you guys can get together

1013
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,000
and put your hands on each other and hold tight.

1014
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,940
Let me just go just a little ways.

1015
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,400
A little further that way, that way.

1016
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,460
Oh, a little wide!

1017
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:27,260
Um.

1018
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,020
Hey, have I been paid?

1019
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,520
No, no, that's okay.

1020
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,580
We'll cover that later.

1021
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,260
Don't worry.

1022
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:36,520
It's a question.

1023
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,180
It's part of the form I have to ask.

1024
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,460
Do you, Reverend Fox,

1025
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,620
take this woman, Reverend Astor,

1026
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,740
to be your lawfully wedded wife

1027
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,760
in permanent subgenius matrimony,

1028
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,160
to have and to hold,

1029
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,520
in fact to do just about anything she agrees to do,

1030
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,240
for richer or poorer,

1031
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,520
in sickness and kinkiness,

1032
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,640
through any hardship or disaster

1033
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,740
that may befall her ever,

1034
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,740
for whatever sick and twisted,

1035
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,120
but no less blessed reasons?

1036
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,900
Say, I do.

1037
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,220
I do.

1038
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,000
Do you, Reverend Astor,

1039
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,320
take this man thing,

1040
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,560
Reverend Fox,

1041
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,340
to be your lawfully wedded...

1042
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,220
Uh, special...

1043
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:27,460
...husband...

1044
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,220
It said wife here.

1045
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,540
...in short duration...

1046
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,220
No, in ultimate,

1047
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,000
permanent subgenius matrimony,

1048
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,780
to have and to hold,

1049
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,180
in fact to do anything he agrees to do,

1050
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,040
for richer or poorer,

1051
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,060
in sickness and kinkiness,

1052
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,180
through any hardship or disaster

1053
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:41,420
that may befall him

1054
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:45,800
in the next centuries aboard the vessels,

1055
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,580
for whatever sick and twisted,

1056
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,440
but no less blessed reasons,

1057
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,380
for ever...

1058
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,480
Say, I do.

1059
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,580
I do.

1060
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,200
I don't think they're taking this in.

1061
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,280
I don't think they're taking this entirely seriously.

1062
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,840
Listen to the joy in that idea.

1063
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,020
Now, shake on it,

1064
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,000
and say, it's a deal.

1065
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:09,420
It's a deal.

1066
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:09,920
It's a deal.

1067
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,100
And now...

1068
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,280
Normally we do the wedding ring,

1069
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:20,120
but you said there is not...

1070
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,600
We're doing something else than wedding rings.

1071
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,100
Does that golf club have anything to do with it?

1072
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:25,920
It could.

1073
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,900
Anyway, in lieu of a ring,

1074
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,160
we should at least display the simple, cheap,

1075
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,000
expedient trick of the Temple of Devoe.

1076
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,640
I think we know how to do that.

1077
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,320
She's the female, the receptacle end,

1078
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,120
and you hold up a hand like this.

1079
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,060
That symbolizes the ring,

1080
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,860
or let's face it, your vagina.

1081
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,160
You hold up...

1082
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,180
Now, you'll look like this.

1083
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,420
Just hold up one finger,

1084
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,940
to represent one of the dicks.

1085
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:57,460
Okay?

1086
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:59,640
This is symbolic.

1087
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,960
It's a symbol of the...

1088
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,340
No, one.

1089
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,080
Just use one.

1090
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:02,700
Any one.

1091
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:03,560
That's a...

1092
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,640
Well, that's vulgar, but...

1093
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,880
This is a symbol of the holy estate of marriage,

1094
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,020
of the shackles,

1095
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,180
the veritable handcuffs of wedlock,

1096
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,840
as well as the pole going deep into the hole repeatedly.

1097
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,420
Now, install the ring.

1098
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,400
Just once is fine.

1099
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,180
Fertilization takes place,

1100
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,520
and in ten months,

1101
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,260
the subgenius baby comes out.

1102
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:27,640
Okay.

1103
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:28,540
That's good.

1104
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,120
That was...

1105
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:29,460
Ew.

1106
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,440
Has anybody got Kleenex?

1107
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,680
By the authority invested in me,

1108
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,320
by J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1109
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,500
Gamera, Mothra, and the Gargantuas,

1110
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,120
and in defiance of the laws of the state and of nature,

1111
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:48,800
I pronounce you man and wife forever and ever and ever and ever.

1112
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,860
You must now kiss each other.

1113
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,400
Really, really go at it.

1114
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,700
Everybody else should kiss each other, too.

1115
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:06,800
Wow.

1116
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,400
This...

1117
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,760
This is...

1118
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,180
This is the point at which my son once asked me at a wedding,

1119
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,780
Daddy, is this where they lay down on the floor

1120
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:22,620
and make the baby?

1121
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:24,960
And I said,

1122
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,920
I don't think in these Lutheran marriages they do it that way.

1123
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:31,300
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, it is done.

1124
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,920
A man and a woman, praise Bob!

1125
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,840
Nothing will ever be the same.

1126
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,720
Now, y'all are supposed to throw confetti or rice,

1127
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:46,760
and that represents sperm shooting through the air.

1128
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,440
Did you know that?

1129
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:48,620
Or...

1130
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,160
Oh, now I get it.

1131
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,340
What?

1132
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,640
Did I put two and two together?

1133
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,500
You got a head?

1134
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,020
You got a golf club?

1135
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:56,360
Four!

1136
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:59,120
The head is launched!

1137
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,860
The deed is done!

1138
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,300
Heal...

1139
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:12,000
Bleeding head good, healed head bad!

1140
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:15,460
Bleeding head good, healed head bad!

1141
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,880
Bleeding head good, healed head bad!

1142
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,200
Bleeding head good, heel head in bed, yeah!

1143
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:22,520
Woo hoo!

1144
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,200
Ow!

1145
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:32,920
And now we usually play the Jurassic Park theme as the two lovely wedded people walk away.

1146
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:38,900
But the Abolition Control Committee is good enough, and them some.

1147
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,580
Price Bob, let's eat!

1148
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:42,620
Woo!

1149
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,060
Oh, if you do any garter throwing, I want to be there for you.

1150
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,600
I can't wait to see all the babies.

1151
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:12,600


1152
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,180
I can kiss on the head next next day.

1153
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,200
Ten months after...

1154
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,120
We did a lot of arranged marriages at this one.

1155
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:26,560
I hooked up tall men with short women and tall women with short men and so forth.

1156
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:34,600
It was like inspired by the Mooney weddings where Reverend Sun Yung Moon just arbitrarily matches up couples

1157
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:38,860
until he's got about a thousand people who don't even know each other all getting married at once.

1158
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,480
Imagine those awkward wedding nights.

1159
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,240
Like Japanese pornography.

1160
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:52,100
Yeah, well, the way I've set up the subgenius arranged marriages, they are going to be as awkward as I can make them.

1161
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,800
Awk, sput, splut.

1162
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,680
It's a challenge, and it makes for a strong marriage if they can get through that.

1163
00:53:58,780 --> 00:53:59,160
Yeah, that's true.

1164
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,580
And mutant children.

1165
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,700
The boy names too approach to marriages.

1166
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,180
The hairy boy named Hershey.

1167
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:11,380
But why is that relevant to the sacrament of marriage, Dr. Drummond?

1168
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,620
Big shoes.

1169
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,500
No, a boy named...

1170
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:19,260
Well, you gotta start off on a bad note, and then it gets better, see?

1171
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,540
Okay, there's something to what you say.

1172
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:29,220
Yes, when you start off singing in happiness, you know you're going to come home crestfallen with your tail between your legs.

1173
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:29,480
That's right.

1174
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:36,300
When you go out punched over and bitter, then you come back whistling with a smile on your lips and a song in your heart.

1175
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:37,100
I got news for you.

1176
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:37,520
You got it.

1177
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,340
That ain't a tail.

1178
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:39,860
Well, I...

1179
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:40,720
You got it.

1180
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:44,660
I'm trying to soften it up for our listening audience, Stang.

1181
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:44,940
Yeah, I know.

1182
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,540
Thanks for unsubtilizing my...

1183
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,820
That's my specialty.

1184
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,600
I have a horrible way to treat a fellow passenger on any vessel, whether it exists or not.

1185
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:57,280
My fellow passenger is no pigeon.

1186
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:06,140
He's fully aware of all the risks that exist and still willing to go forward, reverse, and in low gear.

1187
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:11,040
My fellow passenger has big feet, strong arms, and hairy eyebrows.

1188
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:15,840
My fellow passenger is 59 years old and still going strong.

1189
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:21,820
I heard the cough of the banshee, the southern Ohio banshee, coughing banshee.

1190
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,760
It's the myriad of callers right next to me.

1191
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:26,980
She's right next to me.

1192
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:27,880
She's got a redneck to me.

1193
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,200
Wish I had a call tool.

1194
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,760
How could you get a redneck to me in southern Ohio?

1195
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:31,740
The redneck to me.

1196
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:32,640
Uh-huh.

1197
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,460
I'm going to have to get a redneck to me when I come here.

1198
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,560
I've got one.

1199
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,720
No, it's funny that...

1200
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,620
I'm about to get a redneck to me.

1201
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:40,760
Roseacea.

1202
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,020
Roseacea.

1203
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,500
You know, it's funny that saying, you know...

1204
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,460
I'll have to get them to add a redneck to me.

1205
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:53,040
Ah, V. Yeah, you can have a redneck next to you, but your own neck will still remain...

1206
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:58,000
You know, they say that mullets are for rednecks, but having a mullet will prevent getting a redneck.

1207
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,460
The entire neck will not redneck.

1208
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,480
It's better than having a chop of redneck off of me.

1209
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,100
I'm sorry.

1210
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,240
I just wondered, is that the growth that's under your chin?

1211
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,040
It's like under Barbara Barber?

1212
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,140
That's just called a...

1213
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,800
That's just a neck beard.

1214
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,820
We're just trying to keep the sun off.

1215
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,040
Can you understand that?

1216
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:18,960
Can you appreciate that?

1217
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,300
That's what it is.

1218
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:20,700
It's...

1219
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,600
Add a redneck to me.

1220
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,720
It hides the goiter.

1221
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,980
Getting dirty's goiter.

1222
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:30,020
And it's so much cleaner than a chop of redneck off of me.

1223
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,980
Or a glass of redneck ale.

1224
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,220
Uh-huh.

1225
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,480
Some people pronounce it a little different.

1226
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,020
How frustrating it is in Caffeinas when there's no redneck to me.

1227
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:40,020


1228
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:40,020


1229
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:40,020


1230
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:40,020


1231
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:40,020


1232
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:45,100
There's nobody there who can open that cabinet and get you out a can of Diet Mountain Dew.

1233
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,200
I experienced the frustration of the day in Caffeinas.

1234
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:53,960
It seemed like days, but there were ameliorating factors.

1235
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,500
As sometimes there are and sometimes there aren't.

1236
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,300
Right.

1237
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,900
But you never know unless you go there.

1238
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,460
My mother's day goodbye kind of confused everybody for a bit.

1239
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,380
The twittering of the birds.

1240
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:05,840
Sure.

1241
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:12,120
That was another X-Day when there was the obscene conga line that you were referring

1242
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:12,380
to.

1243
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,760
This time all was sweetness and light.

1244
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,620
Of all the Latin dances.

1245
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:24,720
So any further questions before we wrap it up on X-Day, that is to say?

1246
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:30,920
We can tell you about your favorite X-Day characters and favorite X-Day plot lines,

1247
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:33,460
but you'll just have to be specific with your questions.

1248
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,340
Especially since who's dying?

1249
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:43,340
Well, you can hear by the coughing that the subgenius virus has been getting around.

1250
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,060
It's not the cough that carries you off.

1251
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:49,880
Yes, it's true.

1252
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:54,980
You can catch all sorts of strange maladies at mysterious wisteria.

1253
00:57:55,060 --> 00:58:01,080
But you can also be cured of them and come away in a state of glowing, perfect physical health.

1254
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,300
Thinking that everything is alright.

1255
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,720
I thought they were mostly sickenings.

1256
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:06,680
I didn't know that.

1257
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,340
I was going to say that the healing was more like a joke.

1258
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,560
No, no, it depends on the individual subgenius.

1259
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,940
We don't just treat them all like cattle.

1260
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,900
Well, except during the Bobby Awards.

1261
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,800
A lot of people were sickened by eggplant attire.

1262
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,260
That was the sickening that we had this time.

1263
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:24,380
Yeah, I noticed that.

1264
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,900
It looked very uncomfortable from behind.

1265
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:27,300
Sickening.

1266
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,220
Yeah, exactly.

1267
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:31,840
That's kind of hard to ignore the way he showcased it.

1268
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:32,660
Exactly.

1269
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:37,500
Well, we also practice healings, but the question was about the sickening.

1270
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:44,960
But, uh, I remember the sheer pink thing that he wore many years ago.

1271
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:52,280
Yeah, the last time eggplant went naked, he ended up as a cover boy for Fugly.com.

1272
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:54,960
I'm not kidding.

1273
00:58:55,060 --> 00:59:02,640
That old picture of eggplant in the see-through raincoat and nothing else pops up on the internet.

1274
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:02,640


1275
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:03,680
It's on the internet all the time.

1276
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,540
It's like a crazy, inexplicable guy photo meme.

1277
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,100
Yeah, talk about a meme.

1278
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,140
Mm-hmm.

1279
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:19,540
Well, uh, yes, so many things proceed from the, uh, Wisteria campground to infect the

1280
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:20,700
rest of the noosphere.

1281
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:24,020
It was a haunted Indian area at one time, wasn't it, Dr. Howell?

1282
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,600
I think you did some epistemology on the, uh...

1283
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,240
A haunted what now, my boy?

1284
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,260
Epistemology?

1285
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,500
Uh, the stark epistemology.

1286
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,640
Well, the people after the mound building...

1287
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:32,640


1288
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,940
The mound builders, supposedly, were quite superstitious.

1289
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,580
Yes, uh, Peter, Paul, and Patty.

1290
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:44,040
They were superstitious, and they built many mounds all over early, uh, North America.

1291
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,540
Peter, Paul, and Patty.

1292
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,900
Oh, then I guess that's the story of Wisteria right there.

1293
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:56,320
Well, they were obviously at Wisteria excavating, uh, uh, the chasm of the giant, uh, snapper.

1294
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,040
The old sea claw.

1295
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,440
The old sea claw, yes.

1296
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:00,160
I'm gonna go...

1297
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,500
I'm thinking about going and...

1298
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,980
nurturing myself in the bosom of Morpheus.

1299
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,060
Sounds pretty good.

1300
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,520
Tell him, uh, hi from me.

1301
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:15,660
Suckling the milk of Morpheus from the teat of sleep.

1302
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:15,920
Suckling those big, old brown nipples.

1303
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:16,820
Yeah.

1304
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:25,260
Morpheus does have awfully large nipples, dripping with the sap of sleep.

1305
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:27,660
Boy, this is getting hard to follow.

1306
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:32,480
In the bosom of Morpheus, I'll soon be suckling the milk of Morpheus.

1307
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,520
I'm jealous.

1308
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,520
The phrase is the arms of Morpheus.

1309
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,040
I wanna get me some of that.

1310
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:38,440
Oh.

1311
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,320
The wisdom tea.

1312
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:39,960
The arms of Morpheus.

1313
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,160
I've already been there this X-Day.

1314
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:42,920
Plastic metal.

1315
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,000
You know what else it's time for?

1316
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,180
Uh-oh.

1317
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:45,740
A PSA.

1318
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:46,680
Station identification.

1319
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,900
And the famous CD flipping.

1320
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,260
Yeah, it was that new, uh, Andrew and David Apocalypse car.

1321
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:53,860
Station identification.

1322
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:54,640
Plastic metal.

1323
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:55,820
Yes.

1324
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:56,180
Plastic metal?

1325
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:56,860
Indemnification.

1326
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,000
That, uh...

1327
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,960
This new music forum, plastic metal.

1328
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:02,460
Now stop a-yackin' so we can do the...

1329
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:02,460


1330
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:02,460


1331
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:02,460


1332
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:02,460


1333
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:03,320
Station demodification.

1334
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,140
It's okay, I can just cut all your mics off.

1335
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:12,700
For free information, see www.subgenius.com.

1336
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:14,840
Praise Bob.
