What you're going to hear about today is nothing short of a miracle.
It's dramatically new, made possible only through years of research, inventions, and innovation.

Ted wore his gator shoes and corduroy jacket And the air wafting from his groin smelled like Buddy Hackett
Pretty little Wanda all covered in lard
Did a whiff of a beer and a drink of vodka
And a shingle and a shingle till my dick got hard

Got out the flask and a long rubber tube
Greased up Sonny's butt with some mineral lube
Slid that pointy needle in his acroiliac
Right at the top of his sweaty booty crack
Started seeing drips, that was a real good sign
And then we drained the fluid out of Sonny for no spine

Good evening.
He was obsessed with sex, with mad desires, by a force he could not control.
Why did he rape?
Why did he ravage?
Why did he kill?
He was a demon, a beast.
He was evil and depraved.
His was the most unique of them all.
To some women he was an instrument of pleasure.

He's just plain no good if you ask me.
He's the sort of a guy that would change a girl's evening stroll from a recreation to an occupation.
But he wants me to be his girl.
His girl is a lot of girls.
And you happen to be only one of them.
But take my advice.
I never saw any good come out of him and I never will.
What's the matter honey?
Come on home with me.
I'll make you forget your troubles.
They rampage throughout the South.
The sharp edge of suspense slams hard into fear and fear becomes terror.
That's more like it baby.
You, you, you.
Do you know that bad girls go to hell?
These are the men.
Possessed with sex.
Corrupt.
And immoral.
Who prey upon women.
You know that I love you.
Why are you leaving?
I love you too.
But you're different.
Oh no dear friends.
This is Hour of Slack number 1682.
And I don't have any idea what it's going to be like.
I'm recording this intro on my phone because my mixing setup called Tarzan's Radio Station
went with Princess Wee to the 21X Day Drill Festival.
And I didn't.
Instead of going to the Wisteria Campground and recording two shows a day with Dr. Hal
and Philodrumon and Reverend Susie the Fleezy and everybody like usual.
Instead I had to drive right back to Texas.
Just me and Buddy in a rented car because there was a death in my family.
Anyway I'm back at Stang Ranch with a skeleton office and a little bit of work.
And none of my regular recording gear.
Dr. Hal, Princess Wee, Dr. Drummond, Reverend Angry Larry and many others did record shows
at X Day.
But I haven't gotten those recordings yet.
I'm told there was ranting and music and a nice Bobtism and Bob Burning and all that
great stuff we do at X Day.
What I do have are two two hour shows recorded by Reverend Fanboy on July 4th and 5th.
And uh...
This time you, the audience and me, we'll be hearing those for the first time together.
Because I'm really running late on this show.
The first one had just Reverend Fanboy and Reverend Fight C. Taj.
Who I don't think we've ever heard do show before.
And the second one had Reverend Fanboy and the redoubtable Reverend Anna Moll.
One of my favorite subgenius radio personalities.
And a new person.
And a new band.

It's a band called YB Dobbs.
There's also some new music around here by many friends.
And even a whole new Rudy Schwartz Project album.
In fact, I can probably confidently say that we started with something from that album.
Which is called Postal Code for Ham.
And that the titles and PR news were by Lee Murr.
And that if there are long stretches of collage they're probably by Cool Hand Chris using
old stuff from our and his Bulldotter audio collections.
So, yeah, this is kind of a nuts episode.
I don't have the slightest idea when Buddy and I will be able to return to Ohio.
And see my wife and weemawmaw and finish selling off that old house that's bleeding me dry.
But I do know this.
Sometimes I hate being a grown up.
But I have a huge loving family.
Who all live very nearby.
And we'll get through this.
And thanks to all the friends who did my job for me this year at X Day.
It's a good dry run.
I'm not going to be around forever either.
Friends, treasure your loved ones.
And tell them you love them every chance you get.
Because you never know when you might suddenly lose that privilege.
And now this.
Now me and my brother.
My brother and me.
We've seen things we never wanted to see.
Had to wipe it all away.
With the back of my hand.
And let my little brother be a kid again.
And now.
We've got to stick together.
Oh man, oh man.
We've got to stick together.
Now me and my love.
We crash and burn.
We squeal and skid.
On a hairpin turn.
We pass in space.
We miss by miles.
We turn and we crash it on.
And go out in style.
And now.
We've got to stick together.
Oh man, oh man.
We've got to stick together.
Yeah.
I saw the light.
I saw the light.
I saw the light.
I saw the light.
I saw the light.
I saw them ride.
In a veteran's parade.
Looked like they'd been friends since their boyhood days.
I was raising my fist.
In an angry salute.
When they looked at me.
And my defiance went mute.
But I'm fine.
We've got to stick together.
Oh man, oh man.
We've got to stick together.
Oh man, oh man.

Don't take me for granted.
That's all I ask.
Our time here together will be over so fast.
We are sparks.
We burn like a flame.




We burn and breathe.
Alone we arrive.
And alone we leave.
Now me and my brother.
My brother and me.
We've seen things we never wanted to see.
If you're ever alone.
And your prayers within.
You feel like nobody's here thinking about you.
Well man, I probably am.
And man.
We've got to stick together.
Oh man, oh man.
We've got to stick together.
Oh man, oh man.

We've got to stick together.

We've got to stick together.
We've got to stick together.
Don't take me for granted.




Well, I swear friends,
that song by the Rain Makers,
Stick Together,
reached out and seized my attention.
as if by magic.
It's from a lesser-known album, Live in Oslo.
And I'd hardly ever even noticed that particular song before,
but last night, right when I'd given up work on this show for the evening
and grabbed a random, really random Rainmaker CD
from my big box of those,
that one strangely unfamiliar song caught my attention on the song list,
so I paid extra attention to it for once.
It's perfect for my immediate situation.
This family tragedy that I'm still reeling from,
well, it's had my goat rancher brother and me,
working together to deal with, indeed, things we never wanted to see.
The song couldn't be more appropriate,
but then I tend to see the songs of Bob Walkenhorst
as being secretly about my life,
because I'm a fanboy.
Anyway, and now this.
An instrumental by Reverend Jimmy Ryan
titled The Fallen.
He composed it for Memorial Day,
but, again, it's appropriate for me, personally,
for the same reasons.

Next question.
For those who have missed the earlier part of the story, nothing has happened so far.
That's right.
You've missed darn near nothing.
We have an intense amount of slack right now, which means that we have, well, very little.
That's right.
But it's all in full swing.
Ain't nothing going on but the rent, as they say.
Nothing is in full swing.
And there's a variety of reasons for that.
Yeah.
The fact is, it's just too damn hot.
It's hot as balls out here.
You know that it's hot when you can't even charge your phone.
No, electronics are dying left and right.
It's a thing.
I'm worried about this little computer of mine I got plugged in.
Of course, you've got probably Uber coolers on there.
On this laptop you have.
It's amazing.
Well, anyway, we're hiding here in Cofinas because of the blazing, blazing sun.
We are getting, we are getting, the Cofinas is a convenient point of shade.
We are right now getting something that resembles a breeze blowing through.
Not an actual breeze, but we take what we can get here.
And let's go, let's go into it.
Tarzan's radio station is in the I-Van with a lot of other stuff.
Like the pulpit.
Which is on its way down here.
So this is Jane's podcast.
Someone greased Tarzan's vine again.
Watch out for that tree, George.
Don't let some monkey grease your grapevine.
I am wearing my own fan, which is not doing very much for me.
For those of you who are jealous of us being here, don't be too jealous.
It's currently 91 degrees with a heat index of 99.
Oh my God.
Okay, I officially died 20 minutes ago.
Check my pulse.
It's warm.
It's hot.
It's extremely humid.
I feel like I'm back in Houston.
But that's the joy of it.
That's the fun.
It beats the mud, right?
Or is the mud better?
Well, the mud you can probably cool off in.
That's true.
Many co-congregants have been soaking in the walnut, black walnut oil of the swimming hole.
Avoiding the genital nipping old sequoia.
Old sequoia, he's got his eyes on your genitals.
So swim accordingly.
Not on my genitals.
They're too boring.
But we are told that, well, let's face it right now.
The heat here, the cleansing fires of the exes tomorrow when they burn the planet will probably be a relief from this heat.
Because I am told the cleansing fires of the exes is a dry heat.
And when you roast, you get a dry rub.
So.
Oh, I'd give anything.
For a dry rub right now.
So.
So.
It is.
Although.
Although.
Although a moist rub might feel a little bit better on my skin, depending on what kind of substances they're doing.
They're rubbing.
I think.
I think you've turned into Ed McMahon.
Now, there's a there's a reference for the aged.
Right.
You are, Johnny.
Ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha.
So I'm slugging down Diet Coke.
I'm slugging down Diet Coke.
Blazing a trail through my stomach.
No Coke, Betsy.
No Coke, Betsy.
It's all there.
All there is to do here is sit and talk and drink.
While I pound caffeinated water.
Mm hmm.
I am.
Well, it's it's not.
It's a little bitty energy squeezes.
Huh.
So I am not actually drinking the Kool-Aid.
No.
He brought his own.
Oh, yeah.
No, that Kool-Aid is perfectly fine.
Uh huh.
It's it's it's caffeinated.
That's right.
Actually, it is caffeinated and 18 servings per bottle.
Yeah, right.
I might get one more water bottle full of squirt from this.
It's caffeinated.
It's vitamin vitamin enhanced.
The usual stuff that you'll find in energy drinks.
Taurine, Rana, ginseng, vitamin B.
All sorts of no actual sugar.
So it's good for us.
All sorts of different substances prop up the subgenius.
And oh, look at that.
It's kosher.
Very good.
The subgenius must have slack and caffeine.
Death before dishonor.
That's right.
Nothing before caffeine.
I am one of those who needs a cup of coffee in order to be able to go up and get a cup of coffee.
So if we had to characterize X Day so far, it would be.
The slackers X Day.
It is truly the slackers X Day.
There is no capability of doing anything right now other than slacking.
Yeah, we're just just hanging here.
Slacking those who've read the secret Facebook page know that there's a spot of trouble and some true tragedy in staying family.
So suffice to say he won't be here.
He's got better things to do for the entire.
For the entire subgenius family.
This has been one rotten year.
Many many bad things have happened.
Profanities permitted on this.
Sure.
I'm going to give it to staying and he can cut it up however he wants for air.
I will let you let's be real.
Let's be real.
Since Reverend staying is not here.
I will say it for him.
Shit.
Piss.
Fuck.
Yep.
Yep, which I'm sure is his mood right now.
We have had too.
Too many losses during the year of 20 AX.
And we really need some slack on this.
Either that or this year has to be the year.
The people who have been it could be that the people who have been preventing the exits from showing up.
Because they just can't pick them up because they're too damn awesome.
Hey.
Have boarded their saucers early.
So I'm hoping that there's room for the rest of us now.
Right.
Yeah.
It's we shall see in 14 hours 53 minutes.
It's it's the clock is the clock is ticking and we need our slack.
So we're grieving also for Reverend and atrocity.
Dr.
Cross.
Yeah.




Doc atrocity.
Dr.
Dark.
Mm-hmm.
We lost him in August.
I have over the years.
I have been trying to carry on the tradition in his good name of execrable movies.
My inaugurating the grindhouse.
I can only hope to remain in the shadow.
What's it's a damn fine thing.
Let me just tip my hat to you.
But yeah, I understand.
Dr.
Dark was the one who gave me the idea of the grindhouse in the first place.
And he always he told me early on that he was amazed by my endurance in running the bloody things all night long.
No.
Last year.
That that was the first time I'd seen an Ealing comedy and you hear you read about these things.
Yeah.
But where the hell do you go to see one unless you like take the time to go and find them?
Exactly.
Exactly.
Well, well, last year was the introduction to the grindhouse of the goons.
Mm-hmm.
That that's what I saw.
I loved it dearly.
Thank you.
Yes.
The goons.
Yeah.
Let's let's face it without the goons.
We would not have comedy.
As we know it today.
Just about everyone in British comedy owes a debt to the goons.
Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers, Harry Zekum.
I was very fortunate in Chicago when I was a teen back before NPR ate all of local noncommercial radio.
WBZ would run the goon show once a day.
Oh, yes.
All summer.
That's very important.
Oh, man.
Very important education for everyone.
Yes, absolutely.
Like you understand.
Like why were the Beatles like that?
Why did they make all those Christmas?
How are the Beatles like that?
Why were the Rolling Stones like that?
How did Monty Python get their start?
Mm-hmm.
Get their inspiration?
There's there's always see that that for me is that subgenius.
The complete oddity of what Spike Milligan was writing week after week after week.
The hardest thing in the world is to get somebody to give a crap.
And when you find like minded mutants who are thinking the worst.
about the same kind of stuff, then you raise that ability to have more people
give a crap about it. It's just the networking, it's just the connecting.
Oh, there must be a cure for it.
Yes, yes, the screens, the screens.
Never before so much paralyzing terror as in this hair-raising orgy of sadism.
At the mercy of the twisted perversions of a madman who satisfies his lust by torturing his victims
with the bone-breaking rack, the razor-sharp sword,
the scalding boiling oil, the deadly spider web.
Grotesque rituals and pagan orgies, they worship evil as their god
and their high priest is evil.
The devil's lust, the living dead feasting on the life's blood of their victims.
Help! Keep quiet and sit down! I command you!
Let us beware of those who seek to possess our bodies and our minds.
For the academic world dehumanizes us.
The hypnotic spells they cast on the living are a prelude
to the unspeakable terrors yet to come.
These microphones are excellent at picking up the fans of every machine in here.
Yes.
That's what I've noticed.
And the fans of every fan in here because everyone has fans
because it's the only way to stay cool in this ungodly heat.
No, that explains it, why it's quite hummy in here.
Let's all get a Hummer now.
Quality American built.
I apologize.
I am not capable of pulling off the intense stream of unconsciousness
that someone like Lonesome Cowboy Dave can pull off.
No, that's cool.
No, this is absolutely...
Hello!
Absolutely amateur hour.
This is just me with my stuff set up.
Well, if you want an amateur hour, here I am.
It's kind of nice because it's fun just sitting here and chatting.
Sometimes when it's actually a show with a capital S,
you tend to get a little too excited.
You have to be able to think in some cases.
And thinking can hurt, especially in this weather.
Think hurt.
Think hurt.
Think hurt.
I'd rather have the other kind of hurt if you ask me.
So it's kind of good to just chill and hang out and see what happens.
Kick back, relax, have a cool beverage, wear cooling towels on your head.
And just slack off.
Please be slackful wherever you are.
And stay out of the heat.
The sun is hot.
Don't touch it.
Are you trying to tell me that a girl sucking blood from a man's neck
induces orgasm?
The creeping horror spread like some twisted bubble.
A vile plant engulfing the living and the dead.
Walking the earth until the pits of hell open wide to receive the living,
the dead, and the undead.
The face of an angel.
The heart of a killer.
The power of the devil.
I want to know who you're meeting in the cemetery.
I don't have to tell you anything.
I have friends.
They do favors for me.
What kind of favors?
You'll find out.
Okay, tell me the Grindhouse schedule.
Okay, so tonight's Grindhouse schedule, as I mentioned, the theme of the show tonight
is Dicey.














Oh, fuck it.
I watch now.
Stuff that will wrap your mind into a little bitty ball and pee on it.
The evening starts with the weird world of LSD.
Okay.
Where you get to watch the poor guy fly a giant bird.
Spread your wings and fly.
What year was this made?
Oh, I'd have to look it up.
Mm-hmm.
But in the era of the what?
The...
The early 70s?
It's basically, yeah, late 60s, early 70s.
It's basically Reefer Madness for LSD.
Okay.
Followed by Evil Bong.
The first of the Evil Bong film series.
This is the original featuring Tommy Chong.
Tommy Chong?
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Tommy Chong and Evil Bong.
After or before his main work with Cheech and Chong?
Well after.
Oh, okay.
After he got out of jail, actually.
Okay.
Followed by a fine piece of film called Doggy Woggy's Poochie Woochies.
Come on.
That is the title of the film.
Are you familiar with Alexander Hodorowski's Holy Mountain?
So, okay.
Hodorowski I'm familiar with because I was listening to Nosehair Lintgland out of Radio Valencia,
which has dearly departed but now replaced with Pete Goldie's own streaming service.
So are you familiar with Holy Mountain?
So Holy Mountain I saw pieces of during the Hodorowski documentary about Dune,
which I drove my...
daughter five towns over to see.
The only place it was showing in Metro Detroit was up in Farmington Hills, way the heck north.
And Hodorowski is just an amazing person.
Well, Doggy Woggy's Poochie Woochies is a remake of Holy Mountain.
Done entirely with stock dog footage.
Okay, I'm sold.
How long does that go on?
Yeah, how long does it go on is definitely the question to ask.
Because I'm sure it will just go on and on and on until your brain just farts right into your ear.
Uh-huh.
This is followed by Dr. Caligari.
Not the original Cabot of Dr. Caligari, but the fine version that I showed last year.
Okay.
Is it like Hammer Horror?
No, it's kind of porny.
Okay, porny.
You got my attention.
Do you want to have heads with a doorknob?
No.
No, that I don't want.
This is followed by the seminal Spider Baby.
Who is the cast of Spider Baby?
Starring Lon Chaney Jr. and Sid Haig.
I'll tell you what.
Lon Chaney Jr. features large in my life now because I've become a big Gilbert Gottfried's amazing colossal podcast listener.
And the man has a life mask of Lon Chaney Jr. in his house.
I mean, he's that devoted to Lon Chaney Jr.
That's Gilbert Gottfried's favorite actor.
And I can see why, having taken in some of his work since.
So I cannot wait for that.
And at approximately 2 a.m. I have no idea because everything just thundered.
It's going to close as it does.
And I have no idea when anything is going to actually be other than it all starts at approximately 545 tonight.
Closing out the night, as always, the last film before the end of the world.
Forbidden Zone.
Mm-hmm.
In color.
Mm-hmm.
Saw it last year.
This is how we end the world, ladies and gentlemen.
Gotta see it again.
Because one day we will get it right.
You know?
You know?

Here's to the family reunion.
Damn you!
Both of you!
Now let me out, Pau!
You're for mom!
You just hold her tight.
I'm at least going to get a little feel.
I don't think Pau would be too mad at that.
Mad?
It ain't nothing but a show of affection.
Betwixt some country cousins.
Feeding.
Seeding.
And breeding from dawn till dusk.
Trouble is, with all that feeding, seeding, and breeding,
he hardly has time or energy for any farm laboring.
She was also a tad uppity,
having been raised by our highfalutin relatives in the city.
Well, where's your dad?
In London, visiting the Prince of Wales.
Do tell.
For drinking for five.
By five, she'd had five.
And corn liquor was all it took.
Oh, it's better than my tea!
Five good snorts guaranteed.
To put hair on your chest.
Oh!
Er, figuratively speaking.
I don't know what there is about this gives me such a wild feeling.
Ha ha ha ha!
Maybe it's the wind in my hair!
Talk to Lisa!
Ha ha ha ha!
You hear tell about kissing cousins.
But to most country folk, it don't generally stop there.
Kissing's just a jumping off place for bigger and better things.
I just, I can't really believe it's happening.
Well, take your clothes off or it won't.
Y'all hear me now.
You gotta, you gotta say this for this death cult, we just keep swinging.
Once a year.
We don't like, you know, lose faith.
We don't cry and say, you know, we don't off ourselves in our brand new sneakers and purple
jer-, jer-, track suits.
We just come back again this time for sure.
Well, and give it another shot.
And you know, if, and the good thing about this year is if the world does not end tomorrow,
at 7 a.m. We still have a few days to hang out. That's right. So I'm looking at the schedule and
like, okay, Saturday looks like the fun day. Schedule. Saturday looks like the fun day when
I'm not here. So now. Schedule is a very funny word. It's always a funny word the next day.
So.
Don't want no more bun. More, more, more, more bun. Don't want no more bun.
Maybe the fox can say it better.
What does the fox say?
Oh no.
Fox made it to X Day.
Fox is here?
It's okay. Is it on?
Yeah.
We're close quarters here in the Pleasure Palace recording studio at X Day 21.
Which, you know, seems.
Slightly damp and moist outside. So we are lucky to be inside in a studio facility provided to us because we are paid up in our dues.
Given such delightful access to this magical trailer.
This is Anna Mull here with YB Dobbs from Austin.





I'm in Texas. Also.
And I'd like to add that I have never met this person in my life.
But I know that they exist.
See, there are others of us out there. So close.
In location. As far as on the planet that is about to be turned to cinders is considered.
And yet we've never met. And that is why we have divivals.
That's why we have these lovely X Day drills.
Drills and outreaches to find other subgenius.
Not just on the Internet.
But in actual real life.
So tell us more about this background music you have here.
What is the sounds that we are hearing that are not our voice?
Attempting to play a couple of tracks that I've made over the years.
Right at the moment.
Under my project.
Power to the High Frequencies.
There. That's my shout out for the whole show.
I promise I won't keep doing that.
Power to the High Frequencies.
That is an excellent. You go right ahead.
We are not in a non-commercial existence here for a reason.
That's right.
By all means. Do you have a Patreon is what the kids are doing these days?
Or a PayPal?
I think.
I think somebody set us up a Patreon at one point.
We for sure have a.
I think a lot of people had that happen for them.
Yeah.
I don't think anything.
No one flocked to ours at all.
Yeah. That's what happened to the Thorazine year in Podcrust.
Everybody was like.
Come get our gold memory.
I like the Podcrust.
It was great. It was great.
But sometimes you just have to.
You can't depend on a Patreon page.
How does Time for the Show do it?
Are they all just mongers?
I think they just blatantly said.
Here's our PayPal.
Give us money.
Much like mine is ANNAMAULHOUSE at gmail.com.
You can send me PayPal's through that.
Venmo is.
What is the thing?
Capital ANNAMAUL on Venmo.
There's also the cash tag animal.
It's capital A capital M.
So.
All kinds of earth monies can be sent directly through the PayPal.
I would happily make more entertaining things.
I'm not going to do membership levels for these shows.
It's a free for all.
No. I'm sorry.
It's not a free for all.
You've got to pay for it.
But you'll get access to every level.
What are the different levels?
There were different levels.
There were different levels.
The Podcrust had a platinum level where you got sent in.
You could actually smell the broadcast as it was being made.
Oh.
Yeah.
So total immersion into the sensory overload.
Fully immersed experience.
Very good.
Yeah. Okay.
Okay.
Actually, I don't think they were.
They got incentives then.
That's the.
They just.
Putting the scent in incentive.
Yes.
I don't think it was probably the best idea and might have been why we didn't have many
people at the platinum level.
By many, I mean any.
Any.
Put it into the any and many.
Nobody signed up at all for the full immersion?
Well, no.




Nope.
Nope.
Not even our bestest fan got in on the gold level though and got to actually be on a few
shows.
Nice.
So, like I said, if people send us money, they can be on the show.
That's by us.
It's the royal us.
Right.
Royal.
The royal animal.
All y'all.
Somebody asked me the other day.
I think it was staying.
He was like, so what is it?
Is it reverend?
Is it a doctor?
What is it?
And I was like, yes.
Well, I've paid enough times.
I can make up my own damn.
It's overlord at this point.
Overwoman.
Overlord.
Absolutely.
It's been overlord for many.
Yeah, overlady doesn't sound, it sounds worse.
Like a scripted almost.
It's limited, not over.
Overlady.
No overlady.
No.
The overlady comes in and she's wearing her monocle and bionicles both at the same time
as you, close and far.
I used to call her monocle.

I used to collect bionicles.
Oh yeah.
The Lego things.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
That's so terrible.
Oh yeah.
I used to have a bunch of those comic books actually.
They were, and there was a show I believe.
It got very popular for some time.
I was-
A whole day is some time.
What amount of time?
Because I was just like, you know, it's like some time.
Sometimes.
Bionicles are-
It was very popular.
Right.
For some time.
Much like we can say about ourselves.
We're very popular for some time.
That means then that there will be like a-
It was that moment before somebody listened to us.
Very popular.
While you were still underground.
Right.
It just means that, yeah, it will come back and you'll be popular again due to people
wanting that good old 2014, 15, 16, 17 sound.
The nostalgia of the days of the post 2000s.
Oh yeah.
I'm trying to make nostalgia out of nostalgia too.
In that way.
I saw some Enron notepads the other day at a thrift store.
Really?
I was just like, you know, there were supposed to be like spreadsheets or something.
Maybe if they'd have used those, then they would have not had, you know, they'd have
used the spreadsheets at Enron.
They would have maybe stayed around a little longer.
Just throwing that out there.
I mean, they threw all of their spreadsheets out.
They did.
They did.
I think they got rid of all of it pretty quickly.
I think I too need a Shell Corporation.
Oh, they got the best gas.
They have preservatives in their gasoline.
Oh no, you mean like a...
Oh yeah, different kind of Shell.
Radiation there.
Different kind of Shell Corporation.
Have you seen my frog?
I, um...
He's about this tall and I think he can probably swallow a manhole.
Wow, that is a really large...
Well, how wide is he?
How wide is that frog?
He's about this wide.
This wide.
Which is, that's a large bus that you're standing next to.
Are you comparing it to the size of the bus?
Not a short bus.
Well, maybe, no, it was the...
Well, yeah, the person he had swallowed at the time, maybe their scale was throwing off
my particular perception.
Like, spatially, you know, of like being able to like say, oh, well, those are like
size 17 shoes, so it's the frog's got to be like, you know, at least the size of one of
those like yellow buses, I would say.
It's hard to miss and it looks like a big poisonous frog.
I prefer my buses azure, but...
Azure?
Azure, azure.
So, I mean, what were you doing letting a frog like that loose in the first place?
How could, how can you even, can you even say it's your frog at that point?
I would be denying the crap out of that.
That is not my frog.
I don't know where this frog came from.
That's nobody's frog.
That's absolutely...
Wow.
The frog of the deep forest.
Whatever that murderous frog that, oh no, we were just, I was just sitting near the
frog.
I don't, I've never seen this frog before in my life, officer.
You couldn't, you wouldn't even think of it as a frog is the thing that I thought was
most appealing about it.
Oh no!
Yeah.
But I didn't want to AFK.
They were...

It was almost dessus and it was safe or safe.
So one, when I was чистed, I saw, I mean, they were very close to me, like completely

So I just set it on
to a mat and I just started feeling...

So I remember reaching out at it a little.

You really want to make a defined conversation with the frog.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was that or one of those Greyhound Steely Dan things.
So did you order it on SkyMall?
I mean, Hammer Schlemmer or whatever it was.
How do you get one of those delivered to where you can take a ride on a frog?
It kind of just hopped over.
I think it wasn't a drone thing.
And I had seen advertisements for it.
And I did notice a dip in my bank account suddenly after this feeling of purchase that occurred.
So it was a feeling of purchase.
And that is why you can't own it because you can't own land.
You can't own the frog.
You really actually can.
That's why they have trespassing laws.
By the way, if somebody comes knocking on the door here and telling us we need to leave, those might apply.
Oh, I see.
Right.
The bug.
It's trespass laws.
We'll have to hop the next...
Frog.
You have to order another frog.
Yeah, it hopped away.
I don't know what happened to it.
Well, it ate that guy.
It must have been...
Oh, yeah.
It's going to be on the ground.
Are you the lucky one for not having been chosen to be on the inside of a giant poisonous frog?
That's what I'm wondering.
I can say that for myself.
Yeah, I am the lucky one in that.
I can't say that for the person who was devoured.
To me, you can't really say it for your bank account because you did take the payment for that.
It is just money, though, I suppose.
I make more all the time or not enough all the time.
It's more like I make not enough money all the time.
You know, I too feel like I don't make enough all of the time or even some of the time.
So, you know, if people were to say, you know, that background noise, it's not noise, it's actual music.
There's two means.
Maybe I need to send money in and they'll turn that up.
Where would they send the money into?
You're going to look for it.
Look for pirates of the high frequencies on your band camp.
That's where we take a lot of our put a lot of our material on there.
And you can find it there for a pay what you want rate, which is tax free.
I don't know if it's tax deductible, but band camp does take a little bit of that money so that they can keep running.
You see, and thieves.
Absolutely.
Selfish, selfish droobs.
You know, they're doing this thing, too.
Now that we're talking about band camp, that they're like reselling like collections of music that like, you know, I don't know if you've listened to any of the like, like a numero group or eccentric soul like recordings and stuff.
But they have a similar thing where they're like taking music from like all around and kind of recompilizing, reconstituting it in a new product for them to make money off of, which is, you know, in its own right.
Kind of cool.
I suppose they think they can do that in their own right.
As in, we signed that paperwork.
When we decided to put things on band camp.
And by we, I mean somebody else.
I am not involved.
By sign, you mean not even a double click, just one click for that little box.
And that's that's all you get.
I will take all of your spam email.
And oh, by the way, you can sell my stuff.
Copyright infringement is your best entertainment value.
Copyright infringement is your best entertainment value.
Oh, I see.
I think there might be a presence in the room.
Door open.
Left.
Oh, the door is open.
I got to run through.
OK, don't.
It's the frog.
Be careful.
Not the frog.
Here, let me play some ambience ambulance music.
OK.
I'll be right back.
Never been one to look back.
Trying to cover my tracks.
To regret or undo what I've done.
Now's not the time to begin.
Soles of my boots wear a cap.



Wearing a ball of string at the moon and the sun.
How do you measure a life?
Is it by friends?

Family ties?
Or the work that you do every day?
Or by the stranger whose path crossing with yours found you left?
Something shining behind in your wake?
Stay ahead of the wolves.
Step in the light.
Keep on moving.
Put up a fight.
If you must, say no to gravity's pull.
Stay ahead of the wolves in your heart.
When someone you love rips apart.
Everything that you hold to believe.
Is unconditional love.
It's a life of freedom.

Is unconditional love.




Something you only talk of.
So much harder to live than to leave.
So much harder to give than receive.
Stay ahead of the wolves.
Step in the light.
Keep on moving.
Put up a fight.
If you must, say no to gravity's pull.


Keep on moving.
Keep on building in the end.
Stay ahead of the wolves.
No obtain然後再多, wipe away your pain.



Stay ahead of the wolves
Step in the light
Keep on moving
Put up a fight
If you must
Say no to
Gravity's pull
Stay ahead of the wolves
Thanks for watching!
