1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,460
Well, you can't blame a girl for trying.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,340
What's on the radio?

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,820
Oh, this radio's no joke.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,180
Turn it on, see.

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:08,760
Thanks.

6
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,540
No, not that one, Ann.

7
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,600
That's my police radio.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,720
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,320
That's what you're in.

10
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,040
Right.

11
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,540
The Self Genius Hour of Swag.

12
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,180
You're becoming a regular boy scout, aren't you?

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,140
Aren't you?

14
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,480
I can take care of myself.

15
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,780
Oh, I see.

16
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,220
What do you think, then?

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,680
Let me be perfectly clear here.

18
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,680
This is Over the Edge,

19
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,360
and also, simultaneously,

20
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,660
it is the Puzzling Evidence Show.

21
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,560
How can that be?

22
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,200
And we're going for five hours tonight,

23
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,200
right here on kpfa.org online,

24
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,380
where we can look on our monitors

25
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,580
and see where you're tuned in from.

26
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,300
There's no other stations.

27
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,300
If you're listening in Sweden,

28
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,260
we see that.

29
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,460
We see that someone is tuned in in Sweden.

30
00:00:59,580 --> 00:00:59,800
We can see you.

31
00:00:59,800 --> 00:00:59,920
Yeah.

32
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,240
We can see you under your clothes.

33
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,280
Britt Eklund.

34
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,260
If you're in Sweden, give us a call.

35
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,180
You know,

36
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,640
what was her name?

37
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,940
Bridget Thorntonsen?

38
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,660
That's correct.

39
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,200
That starred with...

40
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,860
Yes.

41
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,440
Yeah.

42
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,340
The famous model.

43
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:17,880
Yeah.

44
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,340
Yeah.

45
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,800
Are you saying that she could be me right now?

46
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,140
You've got the one that made the...

47
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,640
We can beam you right now.

48
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,300
...Singmar's wife.

49
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,160
And Christine Jorgensen.

50
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,280
Beautiful girl ever.

51
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,300
Welcome to Babylon.

52
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:29,300


53
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:29,960
Well, that was...

54
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:30,820
I guess...

55
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,640
You know, can you fill in our listeners

56
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,220
about this whole trial?

57
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,820
I mean, because this whole...

58
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,600
Jesus, these are two subgeni who are being...

59
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,520
whose reproductive rights are being trashed

60
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,220
and whose right to reproduce

61
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,760
their own mutated versions of the human race

62
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,740
are actually being prevented by the law

63
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,800
in the form of a judge, I believe, in Texas?

64
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,640
No.

65
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,160
New York.

66
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,240
New York judge.

67
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,540
Yes.

68
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,020
In New York.

69
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,680
In Texas, they said,

70
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,940
whatever you do,

71
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,420
don't take that child back to New York.

72
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,300
But Jesus and Magdalene

73
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,620
took the Christ child.

74
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,300
Yeah.

75
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,860
Bob, who's called Conbo, by the way.

76
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,000
Conbo is a cute little boy of about...

77
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,240
Conbo.

78
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,380
...eleven now.

79
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,920
You know, like Marjo.

80
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,660
Yeah.

81
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,180
Oh.

82
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,660
Judge Punch John.

83
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,000
Marion.

84
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,700
Marjo is named after Marion Joseph, right?

85
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:23,900
Yeah.

86
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,380
Conbo is Connie and Bob.

87
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,460
Anyway, Jesus and Magdalene...

88
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,640
The subgenius business managers at that time

89
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,020
had a custody problem going on with the child's father,

90
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,720
who was a pink human.

91
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:43,400
And at one point, the judge was shown photographs

92
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,440
of a typical X-Day drill celebration

93
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,860
in which Jesus and his wife were doing normal X-Day things.

94
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,400
And this shocked the judge so much

95
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
that he said that the mother was...

96
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:57,700
Unbelievable.

97
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,540
...not a fit mother

98
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,520
because she was a member of Church of the Subgenius

99
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,700
and gave custody of the child to the father,

100
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,460
who was basically a ne'er-do-well welfare cheat thief

101
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,560
in a trailer court.

102
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,520
And it wasn't even a double Y!

103
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,120
Unbelievable.

104
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,360
Yeah.

105
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:16,820
No.

106
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,740
It was an X-Y.

107
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,220
And the case made the news on the internet

108
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,380
and created quite a bit of buzz.

109
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,380


110
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:27,900
It made quite a bit of stir

111
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,760
and caused many people to buy memberships from the church.

112
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,080
Oh, good!

113
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:32,960
It made me quite rich.

114
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,660
So it was a helpful...

115
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,340
Oh, that's good.

116
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,260
However, they...

117
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,280
You're getting rich off me?

118
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:37,880
Yeah, that's good.

119
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,400
The good, kindly, well-educated, hardworking subgenius parents

120
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,800
still are not allowed to see their child

121
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,800
until the judge makes up his mind.

122
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,280
The first judge...

123
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,940
That's obscene.

124
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,960
The first judge was screwed up so bad...

125
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,400
Seriously, it's disgusting.

126
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,220
...he was refused...

127
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,540
He had to be...

128
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,800
He had to step down from the case.

129
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,160
Why?

130
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,300
Because he was such a jerk?

131
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,400
He was so stupid that he...

132
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,200
He recused himself.

133
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,620
So next time you're fired from a job, just say...

134
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,360
Just say, I've recused myself.

135
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,960
...I've recused myself because I was too emotionally tied to the job.

136
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,380
Well, the second guy should have done that.

137
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,260
Why?

138
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:13,680
Why?

139
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,140
Because...

140
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,320
Why?

141
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,560
Because he was a what?

142
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:23,080
He was such a Christian that he couldn't handle the idea of a cult sense of humor or a church

143
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,700
sense of humor?

144
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:32,940
Well, the images that threw him were the beautiful Magdalene with Jesus drawing a

145
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:39,400
heart on her privates in front of a crowd on the internet.

146
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,840
The other thing that bothered him was Jesus dressed in clown... in a Jesus suit with clown

147
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,160
face being beaten in a parody of that Mel Gibson movie, being beaten by naked women

148
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,260
with dildos.

149
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,200
Did you see a clown face?

150
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,400
It was a takeoff on the Passion of the Christ, which they thought was not bloody enough and

151
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,240
they decided to restage it.

152
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,380
Could there be a connection with the insane clown posse people?

153
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,040
No, just some of the photographs that were on subgenius.com.

154
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,540
Yeah.

155
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,840
This is...

156
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,960
Maybe it's just a juggalo.

157
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,200
Unbelievable.

158
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,920
Well...

159
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,780
What's unbelievable?

160
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,780
Well...

161
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,440
I think I can believe it.

162
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,080
No, it would hurt them.

163
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,240
Well, because, you know, I think that's what I'm saying.

164
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,240


165
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,240


166
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,240


167
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,100
In other words, because the judge...

168
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,500
I don't believe anything.

169
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,200
Does anybody talk about those...

170
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,280
Everything you know is true.

171
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,780
You'll see in a moment.

172
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,680
You should believe everything that I say.

173
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,920
Yeah, because what...

174
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,820
I don't know about stank, I mean, but...

175
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,380
No wrinkles for me.

176
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,540
They're happy.

177
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,100
That's pretty scary, though.

178
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,380
Subgeni, they can take your baby away.

179
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,920
I won't even say...

180
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,780
Don't let me jinx it.

181
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:48,360
Look, they don't take babies away from strippers.

182
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,060
You know, they...

183
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,480
They don't take babies away from performance artists.

184
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,180
Yeah, I know.

185
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,580
They don't take babies away from big channels.

186
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,220
Because they don't have...

187
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,220


188
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,220


189
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,220


190
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,220


191
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,380
They don't have any.

192
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,900
I don't believe that they won't let them have any.

193
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,140
They don't let them have any.

194
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,460
They turn the baby away from...

195
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:58,600
Yeah.

196
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,160
A guy has a job.

197
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,340
Jesus and Magdalene.

198
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,240
And he has a job, right?

199
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,120
Oh, yeah.

200
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,780
They both have three jobs.

201
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,240
They both...

202
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,140
They have three jobs.

203
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:14,520
They're college-educated subgeniuses who are responsible citizens and yet...

204
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,060
That's why they...

205
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,320
You know, normally, the courts just blindly give the kid to the mob.

206
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,200
But in this case, they blindly gave the kid to the Christian or the...

207
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:24,540
Yeah.

208
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,280
Absolutely abolished him.

209
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:26,440
Right.

210
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,560
The Christian deadbeat...

211
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,480
The deadbeat Christian dad...

212
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,400
Who was beating...

213
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:31,960
Garage band...

214
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,400
A dead horse instead of a live Jesus who was being beaten at X Day.

215
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,120
And the judge didn't think that was funny or...

216
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,640
Yeah.

217
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,760
Rather, we're not...

218
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,380
It's not that we're...

219
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:41,700
Yeah.

220
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,020
It's not that it's sick humor.

221
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,940
We're a reflection of the illness in society around us.

222
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:45,960
Exactly.

223
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,300
Of course.

224
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,620
I wonder if the judge was more...

225
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:47,800
I...

226
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,680
I'm just a reflection of everybody else's...

227
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,280
Failure.

228
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,100
Failure and neurosis at the moment.

229
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,200
Yeah.

230
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,400
Yeah.

231
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,720
What are...

232
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Yeah, we're not really totally screwed up.

233
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,920
We're a reflection of a screwed up society.

234
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,960
So, all people at work...

235
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,980
They're useless by the 70s.

236
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,800
That's right.

237
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,660
Or as we put it, officer, have you ever heard of Mad Magazine?

238
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,140
I'll do you a right, Johnny.

239
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,820
Sure can.

240
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,120
That's how you really...

241
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,220
Is that what your lawyer said?

242
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,560
That's how the court case...

243
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:16,920
No.

244
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,820
That's how it should have started.

245
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,620
But they forgot that crucial line.

246
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,180
I have to...

247
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:23,740
I believe...

248
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,200
The state is a place of...

249
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,200


250
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,200


251
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,200


252
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,200


253
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,200


254
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,200


255
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,200


256
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,200


257
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,200


258
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,200


259
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,400
Scotty, you round up the crew.

260
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:32,520
Well, you know, they will never take away Philo's baby, wonderful baby, because Philo has a job.

261
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,920
Good night, Bill.

262
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,920
A few salesmen for a large downtown department store, but they provide aid.

263
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,440
Reports each weekend is only two days off.

264
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,200
Why is it Iran?

265
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,100
Everyone in Iran is a sub-genie.

266
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,760
Everything will work out.

267
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,080
The president is the head of the plan.

268
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,720
Well, good morning, Miss Helvinger.

269
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,620
Good morning, Southern Fighter.

270
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,680
Well, once more, I'm here to strike terrific terror into the hearts of criminals everywhere.

271
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,800
Bob, you're the best at that of anybody.

272
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,420
Hmm?

273
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,400
Stand up again, please.

274
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,300
Yes, sir.

275
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,600
And sing in unison.

276
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,780
I'm stinking.

277
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,780
Beautiful.

278
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,620
Everyone say, beauty.

279
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,420
It might not fanaticism at times provide a kind of mainspring for good actions.

280
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,340
No, it wasn't the airplanes.

281
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,040
It provides a mainspring for actions, all right.

282
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,640
It was very kill-believing.

283
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,560
But I can't think of any instance in history where it provided a mainspring for good actions.

284
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,040
Fanaticism is just following the rules, really.

285
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,080
Always, I think, for bad ones.

286
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,260
If you really believe in that stuff.

287
00:08:52,980 --> 00:09:00,720
Because it is partial, because it almost inevitably involves some kind of hatred.

288
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,120
You can have a baby shower.

289
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,040
You hate the people who don't share your fanaticism.

290
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:11,160
If you think you've got to march off the roof with a line of people because it says so somewhere,

291
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,320
I mean, that's not really fanaticism.

292
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,760
It's just orthodox behavior.

293
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,140
That's what I told the judge that one time.

294
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,900
It's still going over time.

295
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,100
Ha, ha, ha.

296
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,040
Ha, ha, ha.

297
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,780
Northern state.

298
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,220
Ha, ha, ha.

299
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,980
Don't look up there.

300
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,320
Whoa, where the hell are you opening the door?

301
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,900
People have done that.

302
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,680
They have jumped.

303
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,400
They have just marched dutifully.

304
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:37,540
Why?

305
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,100
I mean, it's just a computer gun.

306
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,820
Without giving it a second thought.

307
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,640
Just behaving like they're on parade.

308
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:46,920
March.

309
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,660
With their eyes open.

310
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,360
Oblivious to what their next step will bring.

311
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,460
Oh, none for any of us.

312
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:01,320
We'll be able to live in water, heat, cold, you name the worst, and never again a wrinkle.

313
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,520
Cryogenic suspension.

314
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,060
Why don't you shut up for a second?

315
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,420
I'm not worried.

316
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,680
No, you don't have to.

317
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,260
If you'd say a few words, it'd be better.

318
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,180
Harry, I can't believe it.

319
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,800
I just can't believe it.

320
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,560
Then if it gets taken over by...

321
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,280
economic considerations, say, like the Crusades,

322
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,080
then fanaticism disappears and perhaps does no harm.

323
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,900
I must go to extermination.

324
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,520
Before I am exterminated by this gangster,

325
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,760
computer god, concocted and controlled,

326
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,420
worst mongrel, organized crime,

327
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,760
murder-incorporated gangster communist government,

328
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,520
I hand you the secret

329
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,460
to save the entire human race

330
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,500
and the entire universe.

331
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,300
One dollar.

332
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:52,640
Don't.

333
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,960
Or even a value of typewriter to me.

334
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,740
For your own...

335
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,840
Maybe we could promote fanaticism.

336
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,300
Well, I don't know.

337
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,000
I can't think of any good that the Crusades did.

338
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,300
The Crusades had, of course, two different streams in them.

339
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,060
A fanatical stream and an economic stream.

340
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,000
The economic thing was very strong indeed,

341
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,820
but it wouldn't have worked without the fanaticism.

342
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,800
There's the flying saucer, Doc.

343
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,360
Where?

344
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,640
See them two peaks?

345
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,120
That flat hole between them, you see it?

346
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,840
Now the sun's hit it.

347
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,240
It is undamaged.

348
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,660
I'm putting her down.

349
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,560
Did you see any signs of life?

350
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,240
Anything moving?

351
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,120
No, sir.

352
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,120
Of course, I didn't get too close.

353
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,540
I might lay the thing.

354
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,860
In a matter of months,

355
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,680
thousands of Americans were no longer disbelieving.

356
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,320
Ooh.

357
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:50,940
Ooh.

358
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,620
Ooh.

359
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:51,760


360
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:51,960


361
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,120


362
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,260
Ooh.

363
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:52,300


364
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:52,460
Ooh.

365
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:52,740
Ooh.

366
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,640
Or as we like to say, one of a kind.

367
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,160
The end of this part of the album.

368
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,280
I understand.

369
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,640
It's just as well you didn't.

370
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,820
Hey, wait till she stops rolling, Doc.

371
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,800
You're our excited, ain't you?

372
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,640
I'm afraid so.

373
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,300
Even scientists get excited sometimes.

374
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,060
So, good day.

375
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,960
Good day.

376
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,140
Okay, where are you?

377
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,660

378
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,160
No.

379
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,420
Okay.

405
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,900
We feed our little ones.

406
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,440
Oh, yeah, we should put up nice tomatoes for dinner.

407

00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:57,760


409
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:57,760


410
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,420
Oh, I don't even think of myself.

411
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,340

00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:00,340

00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,160
Everybody in this video is looking at the baby.

414
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,940

00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,760

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,960
Where shadows fill the night

450
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,840
Where goblins stalk and monsters walk

451
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,840
Oh, what a lovely sight

452
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,460

00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,700
Will come and guard you while you dream away

455
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,900
Dream about a tiny hearse

456
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,520
Drawn by a fuzzy bird

457
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,320
And by your side

458
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,240
Some mummies ride

459
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,540
Think how you like that

460
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,940
Rose bowl high, casket low

461
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:43,940


462
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,780
Shake your head get your anus

463
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:44,780


464
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:44,780


465
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:44,780


466
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:44,780


467
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:44,780


468
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,200
That's it son

469
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,880
Now just close the other one

470
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,780
You're such a beauty, I can only say

471
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,580
Scrag!

472
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,700
God's secret overall plan,

473
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,200
worldwide living death Frankenstein slavery.

474
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,540
It's your right wing this time.

475
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,200
Yes, it is.

476
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,600
Perhaps if you...

477
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,500
Yes, perhaps if I did.

478
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,120
Good grief, not again.

479
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,080
It is right wing this time, sir.

480
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:42,320
You're looking more like mommy heavily again.

481
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,860
...control the entire universe

482
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,280
with the endless stairway to the stars,

483
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,080
namely,

484
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,100
the man...

485
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,000
...made inside-out planets

486
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,440
with nucleonic-powered speeds

487
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,740
much faster than the speed of light.

488
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,520
Look up and see

489
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,620
the gangster computer god-concocted

490
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,260
new fake starry sky.

491
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,200
We're having a...

492
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,260
Okay, okay, here we go.

493
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,740
We got it.

494
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,000
Here we go.

495
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,000


496
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,260
Have you such troubles you think

497
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,860
they are driving you to drink?

498
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,640
No matter what bothers you,

499
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,200
let me tell you what to do.

500
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,180
This little box is all I use.

501
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,620
You call it snuff.

502
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,920
I call it snooze.

503
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,200
You used...

504
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,380
Take a little pinch of snooze

505
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,080
and you sneeze,

506
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,180
you're a troubles away.

507
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,200
It's a cinch.

508
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,380
You take a little pinch

509
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,720
anywhere, anytime,

510
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,720
night or day.

511
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,980
When your head is all tight,

512
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:09,120
It tickles your nose and you must let go you use take a little pinch of snooze and you

Yapping at me all the time and you sneeze your troubles away

515
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,820
Ava so sick ever it they would soon die and be buried

I had pains from constant bunions in the yeshtin from eating onions arthritis bronchitis

517
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,360
The doctor said you lay down you're dead

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,920
Hey, you took a little pinch of snooze in there

519

00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,740
But only with two bottles. Okay, go. This is the beginning of our

522
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:06,520
You know a lot of those pills by dare of fake, you know something they give me a pain in my aches

523
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,620
invention of Doug McKenzie

00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:15,060
He used gave her a little pinch of snooze and she sneezed her fat away

525
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:21,700
She died. No, she only tried it and she lost ten pounds every day

526
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,840
For when she sneezed she shook like a

527
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,280
Yelly that made the fat come off of her she used

528

529
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,600
And she sneezed her fat away

530
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,040
For me

531
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,900
One night they were sitting on the sofa with my Yenny

532
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:58,820
That's the girl a go for or she lay in my arms already to kiss and there was all pocket up for two

533
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:03,460
This but they didn't know when I was doing it. She had snooze and she was chewing it

534
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,640
I think that it take you. Yeah. No, they'll be taking you out

535
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,520
You could knock him off or you could whack

536
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:39,980
She must wanna start spitting

537
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,700
Well, this isn't a topic

538
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,860
Seems ch green

539
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,360
sounds is that that's not an empty 있는

540
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,480
I

541
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,800
only think and that's not just this

542
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,760
Fox, I mean that is a

543
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:54,960
The

544
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,700
Best song of all time

545
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:55,700


546
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,360
today's busing people get us은

547
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,020
I've ever had the pleasure to...

548
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,660
It's the baby.

549
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,820
It's the baby.

550
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,900
It doesn't tarnish our gravity, though, does it?

551
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,700
It's the baby.

552
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,180
Yeah, it does.

553
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:16,240
When you bring a baby into a radio studio, you just, you know, it can't help but cutify things.

554
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,120
It lightens things.

555
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:24,200
We were going to codify the doctrine, but instead we cutified the doctrine.

556
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,520
Well, we cutified the church by a great margin.

557
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,460
I would say we've just about tripled the cutification of the church.

558
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,200
Well, that's saying something because we have never been able to cutify it very well.

559
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:37,560
Yeah.

560
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,520
When somebody wants to insult us, they say that we've cutified it.

561
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,980
Oh, that's cute.

562
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:56,940
I have with me the entire of this book of the history of the Church of the Subgenius.

563
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,500
It's rather...

564
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:57,980
It's rather dry.

565
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:58,640
Yeah.

566
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,600
A lot of it's just counting which million was put into which bank and so forth.

567
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,600
But there's some...

568
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,380
But there's some...

569
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,000
Vatican finances.

570
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:07,780
What about...

571
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,340
There's some interesting stuff about the Kennedy assassination and...

572
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,900
Yeah, we've all heard that.

573
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,840
Early involvement.

574
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,780
Where did the money go out for...

575
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,020
What about the catalog?

576
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,380
The tiger's on it.

577
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,460
I'm waiting for the catalog.

578
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,800
All the money for the investigation into the assassination of dogs.

579
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,980
What happened to the money?

580
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,000
It was his...

581
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,180
It was a tremendous amount.

582
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,660
It was...

583
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,020
It was...

584
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,040
It was...

585
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,040


586
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,040


587
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,040


588
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,040


589
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,060
It was...

590
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,060


591
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,060


592
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,060


593
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,400
It was...

594
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:27,900
Thank you.

595
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,360
Thank you.

596
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,160
Thank you very much.

597
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,480
It was an amount of time was spent on prosecuting Doug Wellman.

598
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,200
Dr. Drummond, was that you making that horrible noise?

599
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,060
That was me and Walter making that horrible noise.

600
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:45,140
Well, and they never were able to get Wellman for anything.

601
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,360
Maybe I should say Walter and me.

602
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,980
Wellman was slippery.

603
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:48,940
I and Walter.

604
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,980
Even David Byrne was not able to get Wellman, and he tried.

605
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,400
Why do you ask for more?

606
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,180
This is a...

607
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,180
Let a lady...

608
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:56,860
What?

609
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,280
What?

610
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,160
I wanna be famous.

611
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,560
David Byrne had another song called Buck Naked.

612
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,740
It has become...

613
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,520
You know, he...

614
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,280
Another song called Buck Naked.

615
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,820
One of them died.

616
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,180
A reality.

617
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,220
I'm serious.

618
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:06,940
I'm wondering...

619
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,260
Well, there was...

620
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,580
There have been so many musicians, singers named Buck Naked.

621
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,460
Including former subgenius Buck Naked.

622
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:22,160
He told me that if I ever mentioned him, I had to say that he was former subgenius Buck

623
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,420
Naked.

624
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,140
He did not want to be associated...

625
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,340
Please.

626
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,840
So I don't want to associate Reverend Buck Naked with...

627
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,220
Is he an apostate?

628
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:26,240
...with the...

629
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,680
Is he an apostate?

630
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:26,800
...with the...

631
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:26,800


632
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:26,800


633
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:26,800


634
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:26,800


635
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,520
Oh, yeah, major.

636
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:28,860
Really?

637
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,600
Oh, yeah.

638
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:29,980
Why?

639
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,100
Well...

640
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,680
I used to...

641
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,360
He was a good...

642
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:32,920
I met him.

643
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,560
He was okay.

644
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,820
He was regular Michael Pepe.

645
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,400
But...

646
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:36,980
He...

647
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,040
But what...

648
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,580
He joined...

649
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,220
He joined the last...

650
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:48,960
As I understand it, former subgenius Reverend Buck Naked joined a rival cult.

651
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,520
I think possibly even a Jesus-oriented one.

652
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,740
Have you ever heard of the I Am people?

653
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,540
Oh.

654
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,340
No.

655
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:57,620
No.

656
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,180
Well, apparently he is.

657
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,200
Oh, my God.

658
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:00,880
I Am.

659
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,880
The I Am?

660
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,720
Holy...

661
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,840
I Am had some great graphics.

662
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,460
Would that be...

663
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,180
That's...

664
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,220
I've ripped off...

665
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:07,520
I've got...

666
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:07,920
Five syllables to the line.

667
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,600
I've ripped off...

668
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:08,980
No.

669
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,700
I've had our art department borrow ideas from the I Am cult graphics.

670
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,100
Wow.

671
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,260
And they weren't the ones that killed the...

672
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,220
They killed themselves.

673
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,280
Oh, no.

674
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:18,900
That was Do Re.

675
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,920
No, they still are.

676
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,720
To Do Ti.

677
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,080
No.

678
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,220
You're thinking of the They Were cult.

679
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,240
Yeah.

680
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,100
The Do...

681
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,040
That was the...

682
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,900
Yeah.

683
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,800
And there was the Be Here cult, which I was in.

684
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,800
Be Here Now, Rob Doss.

685
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,320
Were you in one of those Be Here Now cults?

686
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:36,480
Yeah.

687
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,660
I just liked his show.

688
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,160
Okay.

689
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,000
Penis?

690
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,260
Yeah.

691
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,020
Buck played a devil.

692
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,440
Oh, my God.

693
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,300
He was one of the foreground devils.

694
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,680
He made a great devil.

695
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,440
Speaking of background devils...

696
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:49,820
Former.

697
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,140
That's former subgenius.

698
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,660
Former devil subgenius in Buck Naked.

699
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:52,660


700
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,960
Now devil Kelty.

701
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,080
Oh, my God.

702
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,080


703
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,080


704
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,080


705
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,080


706
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,080


707
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,080


708
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,080


709
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,080


710
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,080


711
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,920
I said I am, right?

712
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,780
I said I am a subgeniusist with the I Am.

713
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,600
What do they do?

714
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,620
There's a lot of former subgeniuses actually.

715
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:00,780
Do they do anything?

716
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,600
That's quite a long list of people who decided they'd had it.

717
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:04,800
Yeah.

718
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,460
Well, the top one, Appa State Schism would be Bob Black, right?

719
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,680
I mean, he was...

720
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,180
Well, no.

721
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,140
Not really.

722
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:11,740
No.

723
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,820
He was a scary guy.

724
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,200
I mean, I don't want to say Bob Black on the radio.

725
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,900
He wasn't that...

726
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,760
I mean...

727
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,520
His reputation precedes him, I'd say.

728
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,700
He never scared me, let me put it that way.

729
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:21,940
Okay, good.

730
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,420
Well, I know people that just...

731
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,080
Because I...

732
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,080


733
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,080


734
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:34,460
He really did try as much as he could to arouse people's antagonism and opposition and, you know, wrote those nasty letters.

735
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:41,140
Well, I'm not trying to air a smeared underwear of the church on the air.

736
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,260
No, see, I've been trying.

737
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,660
You might in my revised.

738
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,780
Gossip from 85, essentially.

739
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:50,760
In the Stang-centric revised history of the church, which I'm teaching to these innocents.

740
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,440
Hello, by the way, Rosna and James Berger.

741
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:55,900
Hello.

742
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,100
Gary Gabo fan who's driving away.

743
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:04,640
Anyway, I've decided to just skip over the unpleasant aspect.

744
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,760
I've unpersoned quite a few.

745
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,880
Well, I did too.

746
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,960
We use the tried and true unpersoning where you just don't mention them at all.

747
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,440
And they hate that.

748
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,260
I know.

749
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,880
They hate that worse than anything.

750
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,420
It's the worst thing.

751
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,440
I know, in fact.

752
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:20,560
Yeah.

753
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:28,100
Bob Black hates, is more offended and enraged by being ignored than anything else.

754
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,500
Yeah.

755
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,700
That's really the best way to treat people like, you know, the kooks.

756
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,280
I know.

757
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,280
He's a kook even compared to us.

758
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,800
Well, that's the funny thing.

759
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,500
I mean, even, I mean, you know what I mean?

760
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,860
I mean, how can you be a kook compared to Stang?

761
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,100
To Church and Subgenius.

762
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:43,800
Yeah, but no.

763
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,720
They.

764
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,660
No, we feel for the differently saying.

765
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,760
We're, you know.

766
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,160
Yeah.

767
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,620
But not really.

768
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,480
No, we're all kooks on some level.

769
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:52,760
No, you have to be a.

770
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,340
It's just that we're also subjectivists.

771
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:01,400
So anybody that we really dislike, we can say, well, he's a kook and write it off like that.

772
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,440
That's how words work.

773
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,360
Yeah.

774
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,080
They're just not.

775
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,760
That's what language is all about is to label things.

776
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,260
Right.

777
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,900
Put them away.

778
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,140
And say prejudgments that are unfair.

779
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,660
They're prejudgments to keep order.

780
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,280
Which means you have to.

781
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,180
That's why there's this difference between subgeniuses and kinks.

782
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:18,860
Yeah.

783
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,600
It's just a.

784
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,500
Yeah.

785
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:20,740
Yeah.

786
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:20,740


787
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:20,740


788
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:20,740


789
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:26,460
It's a way using linguistics to simplify things that are actually very complicated.

790
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,120
Yeah.

791
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,920
And it appeals to the stupid, the superstitious.

792
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,400
Yeah.

793
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:38,580
And to people who enjoy studying the effects of stupidity and superstition.

794
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:38,680
Yeah.

795
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,700
Stupidity, I'm upset.

796
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,140
You know, it doesn't really exist.

797
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,520
I think stupidity actually is just fear where, I mean, that is to say, stupidity is everywhere

798
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,640
at all times.

799
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,240
But it's based on fear.

800
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,620
I can see why you would say.

801
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:50,920
I can see why you would say that.

802
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:51,880
Yeah.

803
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,580
But is Bushman stupid?

804
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,860
Almost everything is stupid.

805
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,980
I mean, but, you know, compared to what?

806
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,560
I mean, it's just like saying, you know, almost everything is insane.

807
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,560
Things are insane.

808
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,180
But they're so insane the word insane doesn't apply.

809
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,280
Or it does, but.

810
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,380
Right.

811
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,940
So when we say subgenius kink, what we're basically talking about is a normal.

812
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,680
Is.

813
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,140
A normal person.

814
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,880
Okay.

815
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,500
Who.

816
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,240
A pink.

817
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,120
A pink.

818
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,560
A pink who pretended to be a subgenius.

819
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,180
Yeah.

820
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,580
A pink who was aping its betters.

821
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:26,920
Yeah.

822
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,700
There you go.

823
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,320
That's the worst.

824
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,540
That's what, that's what we call a subgenius kink.

825
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:31,960
Yeah.

826
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,340
A gimme bob.

827
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,840
A gimme bob, yeah.

828
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,800
Or an imabob.

829
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,060
Or an imabob.

830
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,880
Actually, the worst are the imabobs.

831
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:38,800
Imabob.

832
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,260
Oh, yeah.

833
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,200
Those are people who think they're bob.

834
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,300
You know, I knew bob dogs.

835
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,680
And, sir, you are no bob dog.

836
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,480
You know, I haven't paid.

837
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,800
I'm a bob.

838
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,100
I actually haven't paid.

839
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:50,100


840
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,960
I've had the occasion to say that in all sincerity.

841
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:52,860
I'm a same.

842
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:52,940
I'm a same.

843
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,220
I'm a same.

844
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:53,640
I'm a same.

845
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,820
To one of the imabobs.

846
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,460
Yeah.

847
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,860
If you can see what I'm.

848
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,180
Can you, can you hear where I'm coming from?

849
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,380
Then there's, you know, then there's the hezabobs.

850
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,780
Do you see what I'm saying?

851
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,700
Can you see the words that I'm saying?

852
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,240
Well, the hezabobs.

853
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,260
The words.

854
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,100
I'm a bobby.

855
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,560
See them?

856
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,920
Hezabob, it means the same thing as imabobbies.

857
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,660
Or the maybobs.

858
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,060
Yeah.

859
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,120
Maybobs.

860
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,620
Now, that was, that's a little different.

861
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,000
Nylon shell.

862
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,020
Fully waterproof.

863
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,440
I kind of like the maybobs.

864
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:17,740
Maybobs.

865
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,060
Yeah.

866
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,400
They're a refreshing change from all the yaybobs.

867
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:22,840
Yeah.

868
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,780
The maybobs?

869
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,500
Okay.

870
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:29,040
They're the opposite of yaybobs and yayhoo, which are sort of like yayhoos.

871
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,280
On, on, on things.

872
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,020
You don't know who the yayhoos are, but you do know who the yaybobs are.

873
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,760
Straddle the line, you know, rather than.

874
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,120
Well, you have to compromise.

875
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,480
Life is a series of compromises and terrible pains.

876
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,860
Just try to compromise.

877
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,520
Life is a series of balancing between the interstitial vortices.

878
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,240
Exactly.

879
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,420
Exactly.

880
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:47,420


881
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:47,420


882
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:47,420


883
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:47,420


884
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,240
Dr. Drummond, you love that interstitial vortices thing.

885
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,600
It explains so much.

886
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,640
It's right.

887
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,460
It explains everything.

888
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,040
It's like the unified field theory.

889
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,880
Vortices are like that.

890
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,780
Plus string theory all rolled into one.

891
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,260
Plus the golden mean.

892
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,540
Plus the golden mean.

893
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:11,920
And not only that, it combines earth, fire, and water and air into a unified chemical.

894
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,500
Three times 666 equals 1998.

895
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,920
What's the vortices?

896
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
It's right in front of us all the time.

897
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,420
The inverse.

898
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,120
The interior is nylon lined for easy on and off.

899
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:20,960
Ooh.

900
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,820
The strings are aligned with nylon for.

901
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,860
So what, it takes your soul off?

902
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,940
Your skin.

903
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,320
Finally.

904
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:30,900
The vortices.

905
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,780
What do you mean the vortices?

906
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,920
First, you take the skin off of the feet.

907
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,480
String theory.

908
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,040
Okay.

909
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,540
What is string theory?

910
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:36,820
Now, the power here.

911
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:43,020
String theory is what superstitious scientists came up with because they couldn't understand

912
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,920
the interstitial vortices.

913
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:46,520
Exactly.

914
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:46,920
Exactly.

915
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,260
Exactly.

916
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:47,400
Exactly.

917
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:47,400


918
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:47,400


919
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:47,840
The phylogenetic phylogenetic.

920
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,140
Exactly.

921
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:48,940
They knew that.

922
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:53,080
Stephen Hawking could not quite grasp the interstitial vortices.

923
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:53,940
No, he couldn't do it because he wasn't a subgenius.

924
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,140
So they had to come up with all these other silly.

925
00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:02,860
I might add that if any of your subgeniuses out there are interested in an in-depth analysis

926
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:12,380
of this concept, it's simply look at the new edition, the new printing of Revelation X.

927
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,040
Oh, yes.

928
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,840
The new printing.

929
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,700
We forgot.

930
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,720
We forgot the swag.

931
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,840
The new printing.

932
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,680
The new reprinted.

933
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,040
The new reprinted.

934
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,040


935
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,440
Long out of print.

936
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,060
Revelation X is back in stores.

937
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:24,540
The Bob Apocryphon.

938
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,020
Oh.

939
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,560
The Bob Apocryphon is back in stores these days.

940
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,260
Wow.

941
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,240
Not that you should buy it.

942
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,240
No, you should buy it.

943
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,800
We can't.

944
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,160
You should buy it and give it to a friend.

945
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,600
Give it to me.

946
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,760
I don't even have one.

947
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,780
I don't even get one.

948
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,040
You should buy it and donate it to science.

949
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,680
This is a buy as a whole.

950
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,020
This is a revised edition, by the way.

951
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,260
As the M. Hope F. Innocent, the first person.

952
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,640
We have to go through it.

953
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,680
I don't even know.

954
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,540
We've gotten a...

955
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,180
Which edition is it?

956
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:54,260
The new Revelation X has unpersoned a couple of people.

957
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,180
Unpersoned?

958
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,320
War in heaven became war is heaven.

959
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,000
Yeah.

960
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,200
You know, the good thing about it, don't we go into detail on the interstitial vortices

961
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,100
in that book?

962
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:05,620
Really?

963
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,740
The Dallas P.O.

964
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,960
Box is now the Cleveland.

965
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,800
What is it?

966
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,100
Okay.

967
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,940
Tell me about...

968
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:13,080
Because the vortices now, as far as...

969
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,140
So the ten strings that are rotating...

970
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,280
There's a balance between pain and pleasure.

971
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,620
The ten strings that are rotating...

972
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,060
That's right.

973
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,680
The dynamo of pain and pleasure.

974
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,200
The whirlpool.

975
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,240
The whirlpool of pain and pleasure.

976
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,660
You have to listen to Philo, Michael.

977
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,460
Okay, go ahead.

978
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,180
They will...

979
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,480
It's the dynamo.

980
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:33,120
It's the eddies that are created between the dynamos of pain and pleasure, balancing

981
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,040
each other out.

982
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,020
They create this vortex.

983
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,780
And the vortices are contiguous with each other simultaneously.

984
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,620
And yet, each one is its own separate unit.

985
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,500
And separated.

986
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:52,120
And separated by their own interstitial area, which we call the interstitial vortices.

987
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,660
Dr. Drummond just explained the makeup of the universe and the meaning of life.

988
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,300
And you weren't even paying attention.

989
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,340
No, he wasn't.

990
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:02,920
Where are you, folks?

991
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,600
I was.

992
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,520
He's so broke.

993
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,020
He can't even pay attention.

994
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:11,480
I can't believe this, that I found out about six meanings of life just tonight only.

995
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,480
And you love people.

996
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,180
Okay, so this is the interstitial...

997
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,140
And your assignment...

998
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:16,660
Your assignment...

999
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,560
You have to learn...

1000
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,880
You have to pick which one is valid.

1001
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,160
Michael told me he was so broke...

1002
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:26,320
I would say so far, the interstitial vortices has it over everything I've heard so far.

1003
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:33,280
If you read the back end of Revelation X, there is a very detailed description of the

1004
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,240
theory of the interstitial vortices, including illustrations.

1005
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,500
Where can I get a copy of that?

1006
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:46,420
You can get Revelation X from any better bookstore, as well as things like Walmart.com.

1007
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,580
The evil...

1008
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,880
Well, I should say, the evil Walmart.com.

1009
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,960
The terrible Amazon.com.

1010
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,640
We only...

1011
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,440
We only...

1012
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,820
And, you know, we only shop at Walmart because their prices are so high.

1013
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,680
Hal Robbins' dinosaur book.

1014
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,480
All right, Hal Robbins, who is...

1015
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,420
Who has just walked in.

1016
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,980
Rumored to have just walked in.

1017
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:05,600
Yes, it's true.

1018
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,360
It's true.

1019
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,060
Dr. Howe has...

1020
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:11,280
Dr. Howe is here in the flesh for the first time.

1021
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:11,900
In the flesh.

1022
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,620
Someone who knows how to use the shift key on their computer.

1023
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,120
Yeah.

1024
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:24,800
A man with a vocabulary five times larger than the entire English language.

1025
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,100
Yeah.

1026
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,080
Those are my organs.

1027
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,300
Keep away from that.

1028
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,180
Those are my extras.

1029
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,360
In case I...

1030
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,860
Now, you know, in China, you can sell those.

1031
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,040
Dr. Howe is now being interviewed by Princess Marie.

1032
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,180
You can lose a tongue talking too much on the radio.

1033
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,500
That's the best part of the show.

1034
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,580
$10,000 a kidney.

1035
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,000
I know.

1036
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,300
The way she's taking off his clothes, though, it...

1037
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,260
I can go eat dinner.

1038
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,620
It's a little bit perky.

1039
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,660
Look, here's somebody left this food thing here.

1040
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:51,680


1041
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,020
It's still got something in it.

1042
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,040
It's called bourbon tree.

1043
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,400
Hey, stay away from that.

1044
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,020
Chocolate cream biscuits.

1045
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,420
Look.

1046
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,740
Wait, that's...

1047
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,220
That's laced with 325 milligrams of LSD-25.

1048
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,060
Okay.

1049
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,240
Bourbon tree.

1050
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,400
He's just going to eat it.

1051
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,200
Bourbon tree street.

1052
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,480
Now, back in the old days...

1053
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:15,900
I don't know.

1054
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,240
I don't know.

1055
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,240


1056
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,240


1057
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,240


1058
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,240


1059
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,240


1060
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,240


1061
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,240


1062
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,240


1063
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,240


1064
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,240


1065
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,240


1066
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,960
The subgeniuses didn't have brains, per se.

1067
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,840
They just had this sort of a nerve center at the end of their...

1068
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,800
At their hind end.

1069
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:31,460
This nerve center served as a thinking mechanism,

1070
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:36,280
which caused them to be able to discern between pleasure and pain.

1071
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,200
Gravitating towards the one and moving away from the other,

1072
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,420
they found their little cubby holes.

1073
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,300
They found their little cubby holes.

1074
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:47,520
They found their little cubby holes.

1075
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:47,960
Uh-oh.

1076
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,660
A special bulletin has just been handed to me.

1077
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,140
Oh, my God.

1078
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,640
Stand by as we switch you over to our main studio.

1079
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:59,600
A report from the DuPont Company of Wilmington, Delaware has just been received.

1080
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,060
Hurry.

1081
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,320
The news is that fabrics containing Dacron polyester made by DuPont

1082
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,980
are now being prepared for the special scientific heat treatment.

1083
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:12,660
This means all garments made from this specifically treated fabric

1084
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,140
can later be durably pressed for the perfect outer shape.

1085
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:22,360
And that fabric has been used to create this new Hal Robbins book,

1086
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,440
which, since I'm not a member of this station, I can promote, I guess.

1087
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:33,040
Dinosaur Alphabet by Harry S.

1088
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,300
Can you believe that?

1089
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,140
Harry S. Robbins.

1090
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,080
I knew that was his name.

1091
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,740
Dr. Hal, his new book,

1092
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,880
which is absolutely one of the most...

1093
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,220
...good books.

1094
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:46,220


1095
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,020
...gorgeous dinosaur art books.

1096
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:52,180
Well, it is the most gorgeous dinosaur art book ever seen.

1097
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:52,760
Yeah, but is it...

1098
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,940
Dinosaur Alphabet.

1099
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,920
Is it real or is it fantasy?

1100
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,100
No, it's...

1101
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,860
Well, it is sort of fantasy.

1102
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,560
These dinosaurs are better than anatomically correct.

1103
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,900
They're colored in a way that has to be fancy.

1104
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,200
You know, no one's ever proven...

1105
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,620
Are their sexual organs enhanced?

1106
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,680
No one really knows what color...

1107
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,060
No one's ever proven that dinosaurs existed in any form other than bones.

1108
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,300
That's all we have.

1109
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:15,620
That's right.

1110
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,840
What makes anyone think...

1111
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,440
Not only that, but there are poetic paragraphs

1112
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,560
that go with each of these full-page color...

1113
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,280
They're almost like paintings, really.

1114
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,480
Man's best friend.

1115
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,740
Yang Chuanosaurus hid away from the prey on which he dined,

1116
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,000
panting in the heat of midday,

1117
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,820
crouching in his hunter's blind.

1118
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,280
An ambush predator.

1119
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,240
Yang Chuanosaurus, though...

1120
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,520
Just doesn't sound right.

1121
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,060
Yang Chuanosaurus, though.

1122
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,520
It's very interesting to me.

1123
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,500
And there's a...

1124
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,220
At the end of it, there's a kind of a bibliography

1125
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:57,260
that describes the details about each of these fabulous creatures.

1126
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,600
Who wants to know details?

1127
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,200
But they're not fabulous.

1128
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,500
They're real animals that really existed.

1129
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,840
I want the gross scanned overview.

1130
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,300
I don't want details.

1131
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:11,300
Like Gigantosnotosaurus, which lived in Argentina.

1132
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,100
They're doing a terrible call.

1133
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,980
Had to flee to Argentina, because it was...

1134
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,500
Bigger than the...

1135
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:15,500


1136
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:21,600
Bigger than three Tyrannosaurus rexes standing on each other's piggyback.

1137
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,760
By the way, we have to do an ID here.

1138
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:29,720
This is Over the Edge and the Puzzling Evidence Show combined and homogenized for your convenience.

1139
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,660
Now, now.

1140
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,080
Girl, what idea, baby, is that?

1141
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,220
Oh, I know.

1142
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,420
You should draw a face.

1143
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,500
It was a nice face.

1144
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,080
You'll turn me, baby, into a baby.

1145
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:37,740
No, he's yours.

1146
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,360
Not much more.

1147
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:43,300
This has been such a wonderful excesslessness mess.

1148
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,480
It's not over yet.

1149
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,560
We're going till 5 a.m. this morning.

1150
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,380
That means we'll get more presents.

1151
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:53,720
There are probably 20 to 30 people in the studio, each one of them with an instrument.

1152
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,280
It's the proof of karma, friends.

1153
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:02,200
I brought Phineas Narco a copy of the Bobliographon, because he's got some pieces in it.

1154
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:09,780
And the karma, I had instant karma happen when Dr. Howell brought me a copy of his new

1155
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:14,300
book, The Dinosaur Alphabet, by Harry...

1156
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,300
S. Robbins.

1157
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:21,940
And by the way, Robbins is spelled with one B. I bet you radio listening illiterates didn't

1158
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:22,440
know that.

1159
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,600
Some of them may have known it.

1160
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,340
And some may have known about it and repressed the memory.

1161
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,060
Well, I'm not a radio illiterate, and I didn't know that.

1162
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,300
But you do now.

1163
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,760
What does it matter when one knew something, so long as one knows it?

1164
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:42,020
What's important is that when you type into that search engine in the bookstore...

1165
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:42,460
See?

1166
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:42,900
I got you.

1167
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:43,180
I got you.

1168
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,880
You used the name Robbins with the one B.

1169
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,060
Like the bird.

1170
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:48,860
Like the bird.

1171
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:55,700
Look, you can either feed a man and he's full for one day, or I can teach you, I can

1172
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,440
give you this fishing pole and teach you to fish and you can go feed yourself forever.

1173
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,920
No, putting down that fishing pole.

1174
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,480
You're not supposed to hit Hal with a fishing pole.

1175
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,000
Stop it!

1176
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,420
Trout almondine?

1177
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,180
Is it true, Reverend Stang, that the new...

1178
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:17,600
Is the new edition of Revelation X is digest-sized?

1179
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,240
No, no, it is not.

1180
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,920
It's exactly like the original.

1181
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:21,260
No, no, it's full-sized.

1182
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,560
Oh, it's not shrunken.

1183
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,020
It's one to one scale.

1184
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:27,000
In fact, aficionados of the Church of the Subgenius will want to lay out their old

1185
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,560
copy right next to their new copy, because they'll want to have a new copy to keep their

1186
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:37,280
old copy in shape for its future value, as well as being able to have a new coffee table

1187
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,160
edition to show to their friends on their evenings of entertainment and frivolity.

1188
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:42,160


1189
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:42,160


1190
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:42,160


1191
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:49,080
The third Subgenius holy book, which I always forget the title of...

1192
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,160
If you buy a Revelation X, you get the coffee table?

1193
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:55,300
The Cyclopedia of Slack with Bob Leografon is small.

1194
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,080
It's not digest-sized.

1195
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,440
It's family Bible-sized.

1196
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,100
It is a beautiful book.

1197
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,640
It is nice and small.

1198
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:02,720
It's like a family Bible.

1199
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,160
The earlier books are more like coffee table books.

1200
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,240
Well, it hasn't got smaller, a la the Penguin.

1201
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,100
It's small and compact.

1202
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:10,920
It's tough.

1203
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,460
In any case, you'll want to lay your old one next to your new one and look at them

1204
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:19,740
page by page and try to study them to figure out what's different, what's changed, and

1205
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:20,560
where is Waldo?

1206
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:29,020
That's the big selling point of the new edition of Revelation X is that 23 of the pages are

1207
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,660
very subtly different.

1208
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,200
And if you can find all those differences, then you win, of course, the trip to Dobson.

1209
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,900
As seen in the book.

1210
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:40,900


1211
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:40,900


1212
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:40,900


1213
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:41,540
We've seen it on television.

1214
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,180
Tremendous honor, of course.

1215
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,360
Well, YouTube, anyway.

1216
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:52,500
An unspoken assumption of the expanding Earth theory is that dinosaurs were actually like

1217
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,340
the size of chickens back then.

1218
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,480
Well, yeah, but the Earth was only the size of mercury back then.

1219
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,400
So, it's an expanding universe.

1220
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,560
Exactly.

1221
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,020
So, dinosaurs were really dinky little things.

1222
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:05,960
But since then, the elastic has weakened.

1223
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,520
But if people had been around, they would have been the size of G.I.

1224
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:08,660
Joe.

1225
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:09,520
But since then, the elastic has weakened.

1226
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:14,560
Well, it would have been like the blue whales of their day.

1227
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:21,240
There were many whales, whines, and complaints, but nothing was done.

1228
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:27,500
It makes sense because those dragonfly fossils and stuff, they're impossibly big.

1229
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:31,300
They had a meter-wide wingspan in the fossils,

1230
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:37,020
but since they've just grown from their original standard size as we see them now.

1231
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:42,480
They found fossilized frock sticks that were 15 feet long.

1232
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:48,800
They did. Well, I guess they were prospecting in the proper garden then.

1233
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,680
There were giants in the earth in those days.

1234
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:57,920
Everything was turned into giants over the millions of years as fossils.

1235
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:58,980
I have a theory.

1236
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:05,700
Dinosaurs were able to get so large because gravity was actually less in those days.

1237
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,000
But what about...

1238
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:08,580
What about gravity?

1239
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:08,580


1240
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,780
Now, people ask me, well, how could that be possible?

1241
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,660
And I ask you, why not?

1242
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,480
We don't know anything about gravity.

1243
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,860
We don't know what planet this is.

1244
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:18,400
We don't even know what it is.

1245
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,160
What makes it, how it gets here.

1246
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:27,660
I say that in the early days, it was probably because the earth was spinning slower or faster,

1247
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,680
but the gravity was less.

1248
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:34,060
Well, if the earth was smaller, of course the gravity would be less.

1249
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,620
No, it wasn't that much smaller.

1250
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,240
That wouldn't make that much difference, but gravity would.

1251
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,940
A fraction of its size would make a heck of a difference.

1252
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:45,700
Nothing can grow that big today because they'd have an immediate heart attack

1253
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,440
as they were crushed by their own organs.

1254
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,900
It's too big. It's too heavy.

1255
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:49,900
Well, it didn't happen at once.

1256
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,820
I'm trying to realize.

1257
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:52,580
How?

1258
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,180
Gravity is like a moon that's down.

1259
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,880
There were no dinosaurs when the earth was the size of the moon.

1260
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:00,340
Well, that's the whole point.

1261
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,040
Of course there were because they popped into the earth.

1262
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,380
Funfella, Tilton.

1263
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,640
Oh, suicide man, you're crazy.

1264
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:09,140


1265
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,760
This is the first time everybody's used this ever.

1266
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,560
And put your hands on the glass.

1267
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,400
Well, let me accuse you once again.

1268
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,920
Dr. Dean Scott, I think...

1269
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,580
That's a crazy idea.

1270
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,000
I'm not a Christian.

1271
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,140
Well, it is crazy.

1272
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:22,760
I don't want to describe to his Christianity.

1273
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:28,020
But it is true that things were different on this planet at different times in its history.

1274
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,480
And I also love Dr. Dean Scott.

1275
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,720
What is crazy anyway?

1276
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,260
You wouldn't recognize it.

1277
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,000
I think it's a mac and mack.

1278
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,940
It's a mac and mack.

1279
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:35,880
It's like a giant insect.

1280
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,240
But the atmosphere used to be quite different.

1281
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,360
It's just being not reality oriented.

1282
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,200
You didn't have insanity.

1283
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:41,920
Or did you?

1284
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,080
Was it all insanity?

1285
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,420
Gravity was less.

1286
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,380
Mark my words.

1287
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:51,780
And really insanity didn't exist since the human race didn't exist.

1288
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:53,180
Can an animal be insane?

1289
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,680
There was also more energy to exploit.

1290
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,780
More food to eat.

1291
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,900
More fecundity of the earth.

1292
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,600
That wouldn't account for the vital ability to grow.

1293
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,980
None of that would account for the vitality of the earth.

1294
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:03,980


1295
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:03,980


1296
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:03,980


1297
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:03,980


1298
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:03,980


1299
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:03,980


1300
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:10,980
the gigantic size of these things and the gigantic ability to attain gigantic size they attained it

1301
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:15,080
only because the gravity allowed them to it would not connect

1302
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:28,480
giant reptiles have persisted through into many ages including the age of man

1303
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:38,200
yes the megalania of uh the australian continent is one example an enormous

1304
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,980
broadcasting from the factory of tiny dogs company what that's alive today in the 21st century

1305
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:51,340
you can look at fossils of raindrops and they're a lot relative of the

1306
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:58,140
well-known dragon what accounts for that much larger less gravity what was the big

1307
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:58,460
shark

1308
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:07,580
if i was running for office today i would advocate gravity reduction everything would be bigger

1309
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:12,380
everything would be lighter you could lift more you could jump higher it would be great it was

1310
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:17,800
like that on our original planet what's now called mars it would take care of the obesity

1311
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:25,400
gravity and there had to be a compromise which would end up just about where it is now

1312
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,560
this whole argument is so moot

1313
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:33,840
because the planets were switched in 1945. the planets were switched in 1945

1314
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:42,160
it's in the book what is this it's in the book it's in the new genius book check it out

1315
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:50,080
this is official subgenius doctrine dr howell what do you know the truth of the experience

1316
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:52,520
the earth

1317
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,860
expands in a certain sense

1318
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:03,140
the earth is constantly being pelted by extra planetary material

1319
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:15,900
in a dramatically increased

1320
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:23,320
god pelts the earth with extremely like a chimpanzee thrown at his enemies

1321
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,160
in his frustration

1322
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,360
cosmic uh

1323
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,260
sprinter

1324
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,520
The cosmic constant of fecal peltings.

1325
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:36,760
In other words, if you were to take a one-meter-sized piece of platinum and put it in a vault,

1326
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,960
in 100 million years, it should be like four or five meters huge.

1327
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:51,280
Here's another thing. Forbidden sciences teach us that gravity is not something that sucks you towards the nearest, the biggest mass,

1328
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:57,400
but pressure from outer space pushing down on you against the Earth.

1329
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:04,240
That's why things fall, is because outer space is pressing down on us.

1330
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:09,780
Our science, Earth science, is so primitive. It's really in its infancy.

1331
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:15,160
It's crude. It's based on language, which you feel good science would be based on things in themselves,

1332
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,740
if they could be proved to exist.

1333
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:20,680
Right. We're...

1334
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,200
We're babies compared to the people from the future.

1335
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,180
My former employers, I might add.

1336
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,400
Science is really...

1337
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:29,700
And the excess.

1338
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,320
What can we do about the people from the future?

1339
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,420
Primal energies of the animal man.

1340
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:42,460
We can't do anything about the people from the future except not give birth to them.

1341
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,020
Yeah.

1342
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,460
It's too late for me.

1343
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,600
I already gave birth to two of the people from the future.

1344
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,400
Well, I managed to wither a lot of hell.

1345
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,080
Were they older than they were at the time you saw them a moment ago?

1346
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,100
No, I'm talking about the UFOs are the...

1347
00:52:59,100 --> 00:52:59,840
Oh, yeah.

1348
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,820
Well, they made it with the subgeniuses, right?

1349
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:06,800
Is that how the Yeti became more than man?

1350
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:15,160
No, it's really the Exus just flat out instant created the Yetis as a perfect creature.

1351
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,440
They were able to give life to...

1352
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,940
They were able to create new life forms.

1353
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:20,800
They're certainly a...

1354
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,260
The Yeti was...

1355
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,960
The Yeti was the smartest animal on the earth.

1356
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:30,940
The Yetis then created the humans much the same way by quick mutating a certain type of rat.

1357
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:31,880
Monkey seed.

1358
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:32,620
Monkey tube.

1359
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,600
So really, humans were the lab rats of the Yetis.

1360
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:36,820
Yeah.

1361
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:45,380
But a stunted, retarded Yeti made the mistake of freeing the humans and teaching them fire and language.

1362
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:45,820
Fire.

1363
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:48,120
And that's when the conspiracy was born.

1364
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:49,700
It's just that...

1365
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:50,600
Wow.

1366
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:50,760
Wow.

1367
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:51,400
That's...

1368
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,260
There was a traitor Yeti.

1369
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,020
If you try to look for the...

1370
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:55,680
That's horrible.

1371
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,880
You know, they should have just let them fall back into the slime.

1372
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:00,740
...know when you're going to be looking for them.

1373
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,480
Why teach them?

1374
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,580
Why educate them?

1375
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:08,420
I mean, if they're only going to raise themselves up and out of the slime.

1376
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,360
It's not like a good idea at the time.

1377
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:18,160
Well, actually, the Yetis did go out and exterminate most of the humans, but some of them...

1378
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:18,560
They survived.

1379
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,960
...were projected by time control.

1380
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:32,700
They were projected by time control into about 100,000 years ago where Cro-Magnon Man suddenly appeared and wiped out all the other wonderful, pleasant humanoids.

1381
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,660
Yeah, good-looking Neanderthals.

1382
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,540
Yeah, Neanderthals, the Homo erectus and the Homo connectus.

1383
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:45,880
You have the return of that in Jay Leno, you know, that's got the prognathus.

1384
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,960
I know, he's got the big jaw of the Neanderthals.

1385
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,640
And Anthony Robbins.

1386
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:50,940
Yeah.

1387
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,360
He appeals, of course, to the mind.

1388
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,200
Yes, they're both that uber-human...

1389
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:56,900
What do they call that?

1390
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:01,180
Well, Jay Leno has that superhuman jaw like Bob does.

1391
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:01,600
The jaw of the football.

1392
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,160
J.R. Bob Dobbs has a jawbone like that.

1393
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,340
It is the jawbone of the Yeti.

1394
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:14,680
Yes, a strong jaw, almost prognathous of a larger primate such as Gigantopithecus...

1395
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,100
Or J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1396
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,860
...or Gorilla or J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1397
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:19,620
But...

1398
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:28,780
The Yeti now is such a much larger animal, the most subgeni I know, and it seems rather dwarf compared to the Yeti.

1399
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,720
Well, that's neither here nor there, you know.

1400
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,460
Hitler wasn't very Aryan either.

1401
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,320
Yes, true.

1402
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:41,140
As far as ideological purity is concerned, do as we say, not as we do.

1403
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:41,600
Yeah.

1404
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:42,740
Yeah, I'll practice.

1405
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,720
We can do what we want and you can do what you want.

1406
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:50,680
As Bob said, I don't practice what I preach because I'm not the kind of person I preach in favor.

1407
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,360
Here, here.

1408
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:51,740
Exactly.

1409
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,580
Neuronicus 1.14.

1410
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:57,440
You have to be crazy.

1411
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,860
You better say, don't let your followers practice and we'll tear you into thousands of pieces.

1412
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,300
Many of us are tired, ready to lay our bodies down.

1413
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,000
I have the pain of a hundred million hells.

1414
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,640
Above all, a subgenius needs slack.

1415
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,600
That is it. The subgenius must have slack.

1416
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,640
It's not that the subgenius needs slack.

1417
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,820
The subgenius must have slack.

1418
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,480
The subgenius is born with slack.

1419
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:29,240
It doesn't mean that slack is not something you go out and acquire.

1420
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,620
Slack is what you have.

1421
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:36,100
The subgenius, to be a subgenius, must have slack.

1422
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:42,600
You were born with original slack, but the conspiracy took it away from you.

1423
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:43,400
That's right.

1424
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:44,460
Tell us.

1425
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:45,660
As heard on TV.

1426
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,020
Why?

1427
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:47,700
Uh.

1428
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:52,140
That conspiracy forced you to purchase false slack.

1429
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:55,960
And now you don't even know what real slack is.

1430
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,300
You don't get to pay a dime for your slack.

1431
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:58,560
That's a fact.

1432
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:06,520
So if you're having a slack attack, you can find out how American people...

1433
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,980
You must have it, is what you're saying.

1434
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:14,480
So if you're having a slack attack, check out Revelation X at better bookstores everywhere.

1435
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,820
At subgenius.com.

1436
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,700
Does the cover look just like the other cover?

1437
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,080
Yes, it is identical.

1438
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,080
Same colors?

1439
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:25,260
Yes.

1440
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,400
It all looks...

1441
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,860
In fact, I'd have a copy for you, Dr. Howell, but I gave them...

1442
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:37,180
All the ones that I had, I gave them away to my nieces and nephews in Stang County, Texas.

1443
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:37,440
For me?

1444
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,740
Well, that's all right, I guess.

1445
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,480
Oh, I can mail you one.

1446
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,460
But those youths had never been in the...

1447
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:47,020
Never been exposed to the word of Bob in this form at all.

1448
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,260
Well, you better make sure...

1449
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,900
You've read Revelation X because you co-authored it.

1450
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:55,160
Urban youths ought to be exposed to this kind of literature.

1451
00:57:55,720 --> 00:58:03,300
The youths of America deserve nothing less than full exposure to the subgenius doctrine.

1452
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:11,420
But are you saying that the authors of subgenius doctrine, Revelation X,

1453
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,440
are also working on...

1454
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:14,480
Are you saying that the authors of subgenius doctrine, Revelation X,

1455
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,900
are also working on the minds of tiny little helpless innocent children?

1456
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,280
Tiny little midgets?

1457
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:26,060
Well, as Bob ordered us to, yes, of course we are.

1458
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:27,880
You're only following orders?

1459
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:32,000
A little innocent, precious, fresh mind.

1460
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:40,560
I know what you mean, Michael Pepe, because every little innocent life is of inestimable value to us here in the Church of the Subgenius.

1461
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,700
Every tiny little runny pipsqueak...

1462
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:44,440
Every tiny little helpless...

1463
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,480
Every little long toddlin' down the pike is to us a brother...

1464
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,680
And he toddles into a bookstore...

1465
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,480
...who deserves to be coddled and burped and tickled...

1466
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,980
Yeah, where did they get that black stuff?

1467
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:54,700
And, uh...

1468
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,960
But there comes a time when you have to draw the line somewhere...

1469
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,380
Mommy!

1470
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:05,220
And that line is www.subgenius.com.

1471
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:13,320
You have been listening to The Hour of Slack, although this time it was a rerun of the KPFA over-the-edge and puzzling evidence show.

1472
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:17,500
So nonetheless, it is an hour of slack.

1473
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,480
Or just was.

1474
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,780

1475
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,480
Praise Bob, and thank you.
