1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,620
Your mind.

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,380
It is the center of your life.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,700
It is everything you hear.

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,700
Everything you see.

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,840
Everything you feel.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,860
It is everything you are.

7
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,340
How do you know if such stole your mind?

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:51,040
And now, the subgenius hour of SWAT.

9
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,380
The subgenius hour of SWAT that you are about to listen to

10
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,900
is specially designed only to be played on radio station

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,880
and only in the city of...

12
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,320
So any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show,

13
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,420
the listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials

14
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,980
in the event of any material from this radio or other radio station.

15
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


16
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


17
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


18
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


19
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


20
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,940
This is Walter Teasdale reminding you that it's often a photon that light releases,

21
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,080
but truth is, not everyone gets the picture.

22
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,480
Hoping your time is all time and all your unpermissible truths are happy truths.

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,420
Here is your host, Reverend Ivan Stan.

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,200
It may not be Mr. Right,

25
00:01:59,260 --> 00:01:59,980
but he is...

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,300
He is certainly Mr. Smooth.

27
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,020
He is a booty, he's a booty, she's a booty too.

28
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,240
But Mr. Momma,

29
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,140
Poodamatada,

30
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,260
Poodamatada,

31
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,460
Poodamatada,

32
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,120
Poodamatada,

33
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,320
Poodamatada,

34
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,100
if you want to come back and never look through,

35
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,760
we can show you some Taza and some booty too.

36
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,720
This is something we think you should know,

37
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,360
where it's got three,

38
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,880
four,

39
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,660
one,

40
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,280
two,

41
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,900
three

42
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,980
by one,

43
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,700
oh

44
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:34,720
ah

45
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,800
t'oh

46
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,940
with a response of that.

47
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,800
I don't see what,

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,660
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,540
Even though a lot of people used to listen to us, Dave.

50
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,700
I'm glad no one does anymore

51
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,640
because it kind of gives you the sensibility returns

52
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,620
that why do you do anything while you do it

53
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,920
because you are our spontaneous одноimager.

54
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,460
Yes but I have about four hours.

55
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,260
anymore. Oh, that's great. Why did you throw it away? It was such an invention.

56
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,120
Well, I have it here. Which was the mother of invasion. You could put the thing on and have a little

57
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,380
tabla thing. You know, a little Indian instrument. Oh, yeah, and then you could play it

58
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,100
like right, like...

59
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,960
Oh, man.

60
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,540
Some brain rot theater here in the background, friends.

61
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,460
Mm-hmm.

62
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,860
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz.

63
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,760
Tonight's hour of slack is

64
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,320
kind of a trip into death

65
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,800
and through death into rebirth.

66
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,520
Yes, really, it's a mysterious show.

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,120
Mayhaps at points a frightening show.

68
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,140
But, uh,

69
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,440
you know,

70
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,560
but if you stay tuned after a while, it'll become a sexy show.

71
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,520
That really makes me mad.

72
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,460
That was kind of help on the rockish.

73
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,700
Was it?

74
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
Yeah, that was.

75
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,260
But we did jam help.

76
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,280
We did jam a rock without the aid or assistance.

77
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,500
Any unnatural products except for our own soulful bladder-removing cakes,

78
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,860
which we just brought into the studio over the last half hour

79
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,180
for the special WKRON giveaway.

80
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:37,680
Wall ball.

81
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,820
The wall ball.

82
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:39,940
Wall ball.

83
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,080
What the hell is...

84
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,700
Well, anyway, hey...

85
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,180
So what do you guys think?

86
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,180
There's four people on the air, but only two people listening.

87
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,560
Do you think that's the right ratio?

88
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,220
I think that's fine. Fine with me.

89
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,540
I think that only two people should listen to the show.

90
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,840
You said fresh and new, and boy, there's a smell in here.

91
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,620
That's for sure.

92
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:56,740
Smells like God.

93
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,680
Smells like all the great outdoors.

94
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,660
You know what?

95
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,360
Some people train their dogs with a rolled-up newspaper,

96
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,860
but John Holmes didn't have to.

97
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,880
Excuse me.

98
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,840
This is disgusting.

99
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,760
We've had, oh, whole slime balls, blowfish, puff ball, salvo maneuvers,

100
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,740
phlegm, ice buckets, moments of ecstasy,

101
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,280
P.O., diaper pails, flogging.

102
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,440
This show is in the...

103
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,280
I know, I know.

104
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,240
If I'm going to send my money,

105
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,800
I must insist on a more elevated intellectual plane.

106
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,420
And furthermore, it is quite illegal to say...

107
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,520
I know.

108
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,660
...penis on the radio.

109
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,060
I know, but I...

110
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,700
Oh.

111
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,700
Thank you.

112
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,360
Thank you.

113
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,100
Right on time.

114
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,220
Now they're going to complain,

115
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,120
and then we're going to have our badges.

116
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,480
No, instead we'll have a wonderful tape to edit

117
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,460
and send throughout the Subgenius Tape Network.

118
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,360
Hundreds of shows.

119
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,320
Playing your voice.

120
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:53,940
Well, there is...

121
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,200
Not sounding like a dweeb.

122
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,940
He has defaced himself.

123
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,980
No matter how bad they are?

124
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,420
I think, uh...

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,140
I think the Reverend stated it so well.

126
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,800
Reverend Sowell.

127
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,220
Yeah.

128
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,580
Reverend Sowell stated it so good.

129
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,460
Yes.

130
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,300
When he said that it was, uh, that football was, uh...

131
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,040
Did he say it was like life or like death?

132
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,300
He said it was like shrapnel.

133
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,380
He said it was like shrapnel.

134
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,420
I thought that was so good.

135
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,120
It's a way of working its way out of your system.

136
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,260
It does.

137
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,760
Well, tell me this, uh...

138
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,760
You can tell me.

139
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,500
You can answer me this, uh, Catherine.

140
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,640
And your voice certainly has changed.

141
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,780
Yeah, well, I've been speaking a lot.

142
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,220
Uh-huh.

143
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:34,740
1972.

144
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,440
Quite a load, you know.

145
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,560
Even God can't help me with that.

146
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,160
I can still smile, though.

147
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,660
Yes, yes.

148
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,080
Answer me this one question.

149
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,780
Would you, uh, drive such a lovely, expensive automobile

150
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,300
down the street without tires?

151
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,100
No.

152
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,360
Would that be ridiculous?

153
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,480
That would be silly.

154
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,020
Moronic?

155
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,500
That's why I, uh...

156
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:56,680
Crazy?

157
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,900
I don't watch television so very much.

158
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,720
If you could say that.

159
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,860
I have lots of wheels, and I got a lot of spare tires, too.

160
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,260
But...

161
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,920
Do you think, uh, tell me...

162
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,060
Can you smile?

163
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:05,540
Yeah.

164
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,340
That's very good.

165
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,180
Uh, tell me this, Catherine.

166
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,640
It, it, the young people.

167
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,580
There are...

168
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,660
Oh, the young people.

169
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,940
There are so many of them.

170
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,680
Thank God.

171
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,160
Yes.

172
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,400
And, uh...

173
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,100
They're so young.

174
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:16,840
Yes.

175
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,120
Now, don't you think that they...

176
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,400
that they have a love for...

177
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:22,960
Lord Jesus.

178
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,580
Yes, I do.

179
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,820
Can you smile?

180
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,300
Yeah.

181
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,640
That's very nice.

182
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Just like Jesus.

183
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,300
Oh, yes.

184
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,220
Under the beard.

185
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:31,900
Uh-huh.

186
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,280
Yes.

187
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,560
For a woman, that is a fairly well-developed beard.

188
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,380
Well, that's just in your eyes.

189
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,560
In my eyes, it's just...

190
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:39,600
No.

191
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,120
No, my...

192
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,980
The best I can do.

193
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,300
Can you smile?

194
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:42,920
No, no, no.

195
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,260
My beard is not in my eyes.

196
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,980
Don't catch it.

197
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,880
You catch the beard from your own eyes.

198
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,020
Isn't it true?

199
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,400
Yes, it is.

200
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,400
Why don't you just brush your hair?

201
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,300
I'll brush my hair back so I can see.

202
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,560
Oh, you're young, too.

203
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,020
Yes.

204
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,660
Smile at me.

205
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,360
There we go.

206
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,620
I have no lines in my hair.

207
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,720
I have no lines on this paper.

208
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,340
You mean we have nothing more to say?

209
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:03,760
No.

210
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,380
Why did God give lines to his people?

211
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,760
Well, that's just the first question this evening, dear friends,

212
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,380
on the Everybody's God Show.

213
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,780
Brought to you by fruit.

214
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,200
Fruit that grows on every tree.

215
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:21,940
Fruit.

216
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,200
Fruit.

217
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,240


218
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:22,380


219
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:22,380


220
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:22,380


221
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:22,380


222
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:22,380


223
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:22,380


224
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:22,380


225
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:22,380


226
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,560
I'll put it there, Dr. Amos.

227
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,900
Look out for that snake!

228
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,740
These Chico sticks are terrible.

229
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,480
That snake left them here.

230
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:31,880
Oh.

231
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,320
I do not want to die because as far as I am concerned, I am dead already.

232
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,340
I merely want the doctors to recognize that fact.

233
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,700
I cannot believe that this...

234
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,640
This condition constitutes life in any real sense of the word.

235
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,120
Legally, you're alive.

236
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,280
I think I could challenge even that.

237
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:10,280
Any reasonable definition of the word life must include the idea that it be self-supporting.

238
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,140
Now, isn't it true that in heart transplant cases,

239
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,960
it's legal to take someone's heart if they can only be kept alive by these respirators and other medical hardware?

240
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,160
There also has to be no brain activity.

241
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:22,640
I don't see it at all.

242
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,480
Yours is certainly working, Mr. Harrison.

243
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,160
Certainly working and certainly sane.

244
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,680
That's what we're here to decide.

245
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,140
Your Honor, I am not asking anyone to kill me.

246
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,660
You're only asking to be discharged from this hospital.

247
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,080
Which will kill you.

248
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,120
And that's exactly my point.

249
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:47,180
I'll spend the rest of my life in this hospital with everything in it geared just to keeping my brain alive.

250
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,640
Now...

251
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,120
As far as I'm concerned,

252
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,380
that's an act of violence.

253
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:52,380


254
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,440
An act of deliberate cruelty.

255
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,900
Wouldn't it be more cruel for society to let people die when with some effort it could save them?

256
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,380
No.

257
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,180
Because the cruelty is not a question of saving someone's life or letting them die.

258
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,180
The cruelty...

259
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,340
is that the choice is removed from the person concerned.

260
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,760
I would like to be able to decide what happens to my own body.

261
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,920
This is a reading of Timothy Leary's Psychedelic Guide to the Tibetan Book of the Dead.

262
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,420
Instructions for use during a psychedelic session.

263
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,260
First Bardo Instruction.

264
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,220
Oh Ed!

265
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:46,920
Ho Tom!

266
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,320
Oh Voyages!

267
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,220
The time has come to seek new levers.

268
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:52,360
The time has come to seek new levers.

269
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,360


270
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,100
of reality.

271
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,440
Reality check.

272
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,340
Your ego and the end game

273
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,600
are about to cease.

274
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
That's what you think.

275
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,060
You're about to be set

276
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,060
face to face

277
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,040
with the clear light.

278
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,060
I like that light.

279
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,340
You're about to experience it

280
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,040
in its reality.

281
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,280
Reality check.

282
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,840
In the ego-free state

283
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,900
where in all things are light.

284
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,960
Avoid the cloudless skies.

285
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,640
Yes, I like the cloudless skies.

286
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,960
And the naked, spotless intellect

287
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,900
is like a transparent vacuum.

288
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,220
I'm going to get sucked into this one.

289
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,200
At this moment, know yourself

290
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,300
and abide in that state.

291
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,220
Are you going to bring politics into this?

292
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,800
Oh, Ed.

293
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,820
Oh, Tom.

294
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,940
Oh, Voyagers.

295
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,160
That which is called ego death

296
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,440
is coming to you.

297
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,420
I'm dead already.

298
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:52,760
Remember.

299
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,000
Got my pen.

300
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,780
This is now the hour

301
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,520
of death and rebirth.

302
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,860
All right, I'm out of here.

303
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,580
Take advantage of this temporary death

304
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,540
to obtain the perfect state.

305
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,420
Politics again?

306
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,860
Enlightenment.

307
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,080
Yes, I would like a mint.

308
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,200
Concentrate on the unity

309
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,080
of all living beings.

310
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,920
I'm concentrating.

311
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,960
Hold on to the clear light.

312
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,260
There's that light again.

313
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,300
Yes.

314
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,460
Use it to attain understanding and love.

315
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,260
Yes, I'd like to understand love, wouldn't you?

316
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,320
If you cannot maintain

317
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,560
the bliss of illumination.

318
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:33,920
I can't.

319
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,300
And if you are slipping back

320
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,440
to contact with the external world.

321
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,180
That's nothing.

322
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,460
Remember.

323
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,500
I got my pen.

324
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,900
There'll be a quiz after class.

325
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,760
The hallucinations.

326
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,840
I like hallucinations.

327
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,340
Which you may now experience.

328
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:48,920
Whoa.

329
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,460
The vision and insight.

330
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,280
I can see inside.

331
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,800
We'll teach you much about yourself and the world.

332
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,960
Yeah, but what about this veil?

333
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,580
The veil of routine perception

334
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,820
will be torn from your eyes.

335
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,160
I hate it when that happens.

336
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,080
Because my mind,

337
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,580
which had been my most precious possession,

338
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,600
has become my enemy

339
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,000
and it tortures me.

340
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,680
It tortures me with thoughts of

341
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,040
what might have been

342
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,600
and what might be to come.

343
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
And I can,

344
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,260
I can feel my mind

345
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,260
very slowly breaking up.

346
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,020
And he wore a copy of implied warranties

347
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,880
for something only of clause.

348
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,060
Furtive.

349
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,980
Myself.

350
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,420
In reverse action.

351
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:39,680
Six.

352
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,860
Severability.

353
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,620
If any force in or problem

354
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,380
on the practical ability to fulfill himself

355
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,300
as that force in the fire of the chaplain.

356
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,020
Then soft in the inertia,

357
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,580
of chairs.

358
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,680
Blind walls with all he who argue,

359
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,480
not refer to make magic.

360
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,860
Is unsatisfactory to exist.

361
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,980
Guess he couldn't get back in the phone booth

362
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,640
and delight.

363
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,700
Before you think there's that price.

364
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,180
51.

365
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,620
Every man of complex nomenclature.

366
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,600
Frankly I dare frame thy heart

367
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,340
in minute detail of a lot like death.

368
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,860
If you want to,

369
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,480
you misguided mother.

370
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,820
I wash my hands

371
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,420
of your damn foolish thoughts.

372
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,740
Die.

373
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,920
If you want to,

374
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,240
you must.

375
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,600
I'll kill you.

376
00:14:52,020 --> 00:15:22,020


377
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,460
Let it guide you through your new life to come.

378
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,380
I thought I was dead.

379
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,500
If you feel confused.

380
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,280
I'm confused.

381
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,520
Call upon the memory of your friend.

382
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,060
Tom.

383
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,640
Ed.

384
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,700
Voyagers.

385
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,220
And the power of the person whom you most admire.

386
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,380
Thank you, Dennis Murphy.

387
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,880
Oh, Ed.

388
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,920
Oh, Tom.

389
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
Oh, Voyagers.

390
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,780
Try to reach and keep the experience of the clear light.

391
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,240
Can I keep this?

392
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,700
Remember.

393
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,720
I got my pen.

394
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,840
The light is the life energy.

395
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:58,700
Hmm.

396
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,680
The endless flame of light.

397
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,080
Oh.

398
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:07,320
An ever changing surging turmoil of color may engulf your vision.

399
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,480
Wow, look at this.

400
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,820
This is the ceaseless transformation of energy.

401
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,700
Hmm.

402
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,640
The life process.

403
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,280
Oh.

404
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,240
Do not fear it.

405
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,140
I don't fear it.

406
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,760
Surrender to it.

407
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:20,760


408
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,340
I surrender.

409
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,860
Join it.

410
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,080
Are there going to be dues to pay?

411
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,500
It is part of you.

412
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,060
Part of me?

413
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,520
You are part of it.

414
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,260
Part of it?

415
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,520
Remember also.

416
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,180
What?

417
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,860
More notes.

418
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,480
Beyond the restless flowing electricity of life is the ultimate reality.

419
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,880
Reality check.

420
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,420
Oh.

421
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
So what's going on?

422
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,460
Well, the chicken bladder strips were.

423
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,360
I was talking about the catering tonight when you saw Rudley under hooking.

424
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,140
Shut up.

425
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,000
Okay.

426
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,760
I changed the script.

427
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:50,760


428
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:50,760


429
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:50,760


430
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:50,760


431
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:50,760


432
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:50,760


433
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:50,760


434
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:50,760


435
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:50,760


436
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:03,420
This is the greatest moment of my life.

437
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,020
After getting in the kitchen of a restaurant where children take after her family was

438
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,720
accompanied by low-class networks of construction workers, I went into Driving Lane Business

439
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:10,720


440
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:10,720


441
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:10,720


442
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,380
Follow us til' I could, put my shoes on, shoot a brink, and come home.

443
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:15,420
Spill.

444
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,740
I'll bring you to the Google show, and if you hadn't been able to hear, I was expecting

445
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,340
to have to stay with me.

446
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,820
I thought, I can't live if everybody goes away from me.

447
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,100
I don't want to.

448
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,280
I thought, Lord, you just have to understand,

449
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,180
because I can't do it anymore.

450
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,500
I can't come back and come back down here again.

451
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,240
I don't want to ever again.

452
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:46,540
No!

453
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,340
She wants to destroy me!

454
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,620
She wants to destroy me!

455
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,560
Come on, baby!

456
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,600
Come on, baby!

457
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,480
Nothing.

458
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,700
Hey, you're crazy.

459
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,280
I can pull those red vests.

460
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:56,620
You ready?

461
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,280
Four.

462
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,340
One with dust.

463
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,360
Two with dust.

464
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,280
Three with dust.

465
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,300
Four with dust.

466
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,360
Five with dust.

467
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:02,840
Three.

468
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,800
The voice.

469
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,760
That's nothing.

470
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,640
Your own awareness, not born into anything

471
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,520
possessing form or color, is naturally void.

472
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,800
That's nothing.

473
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,900
But what happened to your voice?

474
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,220
The final.

475
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,980
You know, reality.

476
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:21,980
Good.

477
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,460
I can get rid of this damn thing.

478
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,020
I still think you should sell it to me.

479
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,960
And I'll pass it around as a cultic-phobic reaction.

480
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,660
Hey, Chaz?

481
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,180
What?

482
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,220
Is spittle bio-radioactive sometimes?

483
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,540
Huh?

484
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,680
Is spittle radio-bio-genetic-gen-

485
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,560
What happens with bio-deo-gradogenetic radioactive?

486
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,960
Meaning that it breaks down in your tissues?

487
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,280
It breaks down at post office box 14876, Dave.

488
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,000
44114.

489
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,380
Caller, are you there?

490
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,500
Are you there yet?

491
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,500
Caller?

492
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,520
Are you losing your mind yet, friends?

493
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,720
Don't it feel good to do just that?

494
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:17,940
Why don't you just go to bed?

495
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:17,940


496
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:17,940


497
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:17,940


498
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:17,940


499
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:17,940


500
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:17,940


501
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:17,940


502
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:17,940


503
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,980
I was glad to get Dennis Murphy's name on the hour of slack.

504
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,260
And Linda's.

505
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,360
I won't explain that at all.

506
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:33,520
But I will explain what you've been listening to tonight on this subgenius radio half hour

507
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,160
so far.

508
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,620
Kind of a mix up of about six main things.

509
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:47,920
Of course, the funky bardos running through there doing their version of the Tibetan bar.

510
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,740
The Book of the Dead.

511
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,680
An amazing rendition of that normally real serious sort of tone there.

512
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,460
The funky bardos in Buffalo, New York.

513
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,640
Wonderful cassette we have from here.

514
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,480
A lot of brain rot theater from WCSB in Cleveland.

515
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:16,000
This particular tape was from, I recorded it off the air live.

516
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,920
It wasn't there in the studio.

517
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:17,920


518
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,180
They didn't send that one to me.

519
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,900
They don't even know I have that tape.

520
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,120
Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz there going on.

521
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,720
And hurting you, I hope, sometimes.

522
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,240
Like the Firesign Theater stretch there talking about God and fruit.

523
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:44,240
And that was recorded in some LA radio station in 1972.

524
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,920
The death media barrage.

525
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,080
Which pops in and out.

526
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,660
Different ominous sounding quotes about death.

527
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:59,820
That's from Reverend Phineas Narco's cassette album, Cauldron of Agony.

528
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,140
Great name for a really disturbing tape.

529
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:13,600
There's some really, really insane talk and music in there.

530
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,620
Sort of cut up words.

531
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:25,580
From a tape called The Thing from Columbus by John Bennett, ZZ AJ, and Reverend Ficus

532
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,560
Strangulensis.

533
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,980
Let's see what else.

534
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:34,020
Of course, Bleepo Abernathy, as always, doing our titles.

535
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:41,280
And some KPFA, less than a show, more, more, much more than an hour.

536
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,940
Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence there.

537
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:45,940
And...

538
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,160
Gary Gabrog, Fran.

539
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,000
Fine, fine, Gary Gabrog, Fran.

540
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,160
Are you losing your mind yet?

541
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,120
I tried to warn some of you.

542
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,200
Hello?

543
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,700
Hello?

544
00:21:59,460 --> 00:21:59,940
Hey.

545
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,540
Hey.

546
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,740
How you doing, Peggy Shores?

547
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,460
Yeah, all right.

548
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:02,860
How are you all?

549
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,060
Oh, we're medium fine.

550
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:09,080
Hey, would you like to participate in next week's episode, provided I don't drive to

551
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,620
Mars or some other planet?

552
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,480
Yeah.

553
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,200
Which would...

554
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,960
I don't know if I should give away the plot.

555
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,600
We've been thinking about getting in on this big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

556
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,460
You know everybody listens.

557
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,600
Oh, yeah.

558
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,120
Don't worry about it.

559
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,460
OK.

560
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,320
Well, if you'd like to, we'll tell you what it's about and stuff.

561
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,260
Anyway...

562
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,200
That'd be fine.

563
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,320
Oh, just...

564
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,400
What do you want?

565
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,820
I mean, we...

566
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,700
Just talk.

567
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,440
I just want to wish Dave a happy birthday there.

568
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,860
Oh, thanks so much, Gary.

569
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:41,100
I mean, Bill, I'm so glad that you remember today was the first day of the rest of my

570
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,600
life.

571
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,780
Yeah, I do.

572
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,880
and I'd like to offer you a complimentary scrotum tuck.

573
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,580
Well, you mean you're doing that now?

574
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,060
Well, I do the pigs all the time, so I figure out...

575
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,240
I thought you needed some kind of...

576
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,860
That's just a vet license, ain't it?

577
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,240
Yes, yes.

578
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,040
Well, you mean you're actually taking human clienteles now?

579
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,220
Yeah, I sure am.

580
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,580
Well, jeez, what kind of deals do you offer down there at the tuck and go?

581
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,920
Well, yours be free on the house.

582
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,640
Well, I'm glad as a birthday gesture that I'll get a tuck and go.

583
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:18,180
I definitely will, but what kind of specials do you offer some of the other frequents out there?

584
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:25,520
Well, we can talk about that off the air, but I'd give you more specifics then.

585
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,680
You're talking about castrations, are you?

586
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,780
No, just a simple tuck.

587
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,800
They're probably sagging real bad right now.

588
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,420
I see where you're coming from.

589
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,140
There we go.

590
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,080
What do you work for?

591
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,080
You work for some...

592
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,660
A little western.

593
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,720
A weird lab or something?

594
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,720
Some kind of weird sick people or something?

595
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,420
Come on, pig, man.

596
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,700
You've come a long way to get involved in something weird like this, man.

597
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,680
I could sing you a song, a birthday song.

598
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,620
Go ahead, sing me a birthday song.

599
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,620
Every birthday to you.

600
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,480
Every birthday to you.

601
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,340
You look like a dolphin.

602
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,260
Can you sing a little too?

603
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,220
That's it?

604
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,160
Aren't you touched?

605
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,460
I'm touched, but not in the right parts of my body.

606
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,800
I just had a minor... a minor... um...

607
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,480
Drizzle.

608
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,420
Ooh, Dave, it's Bertha down at the diner.

609
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,180
Hey, Bertha at the diner.

610
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,680
I remember your robust...

611
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,280
Where have you been keeping yourself, young man?

612
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,240
I haven't seen you in ages.

613
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,720
I've been keeping myself in an icebox with your heart pinned to my chest, baby cakes.

614
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,420
I heard about all that terrible food that they had for you down there.

615
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,940
I made your specialty tonight.

616
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,880
I made some Honey West Virginia graham cracker mealtime and whether or not cake.

617
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:33,600
Ooh!

618
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,180
I love that stuff.

619
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,760
That's mouthwatering pie.

620
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,380
That's awesome.

621
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,740
And it...

622
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,340
I even put drool on it.

623
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,020
A big splattering of drool.

624
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,060
I suppose you think that's funny because I mention that word occasionally.

625
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,360
No, that's your favorite.

626
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,800
That's monkey nipple stew.

627
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,340
Well, monkey nipples.

628
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,400
Now that's... that's the kind of phonetics we're talking about.

629
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,000
Monkey nipple stew is genuinely humorous and probably would taste good.

630
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,540
A periwinkle period pie.

631
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,080
That's even better because that tickles the old cerebrum.

632
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,800
A deep fried... a deep fried fish fish.

633
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,520
Woo!

634
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,140
That's too deep for me.

635
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,040
No.

636
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,900
No, I think when you get into deep fried deep fish fish...

637
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,220
Hey.

638
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,720
You're talking more spiritually.

639
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,340
Hello?

640
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,260
Which is too hard for us to understand right now.

641
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:13,580
Hello?

642
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:13,580


643
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:13,760
Hi.

644
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,600
You're on the air?

645
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,120
How are you?

646
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,440
With Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

647
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,780
Do you pose the use of a calf at Metro House?

648
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:24,240
Now, did I used to pose in the calf barb at USA Metro House?

649
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,480
Yeah, I used to do the stud photos.

650
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,040
Remember me?

651
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,500
Uh, no.

652
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,980
Oh, yes you do.

653
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,400
I was the guy with the glazed and bronze body.

654
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,900
You kind of looked like Bobby Sherman.

655
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,060
The 23 inch biceps.

656
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,740
You remember me?

657
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah.

658
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:36,940
I remember you.

659
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,180
Oh, I remember you.

660
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,180


661
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,180


662
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:40,600
Do you remember Bobby Sherman?

663
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,000
They stick a...

664
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,520
They stick a... tubes down catheter...

665
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,000
Do I stick capillary tubes down...

666
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,680
Do you stick tubes where?

667
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,120
Catheter tubes, right?

668
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:48,900
Is that what you say?

669
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,080
Your butt.

670
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,180
In my butt?

671
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:50,940
Yeah.

672
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,640
Of course I do.

673
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,880
Where else would I put them?

674
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,400
Your butt?

675
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,280
In my botty, as they would say in Brazil.

676
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:55,600
Your butt.

677
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,880
In my bossy eye.

678
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,000
That's what they...

679
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,020
Your body.

680
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,280
In my body.

681
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,740
No, I don't.

682
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,500
As a matter of fact, why?

683
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,620
Could I maybe help you do that sometime?

684
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,020
Not to me, but you know, to you.

685
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,020


686
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,020


687
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,400
You, perhaps?

688
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:06,720
Yeah.

689
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,120
Now, you're not really a 12 year old guy, are you?

690
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,660
You are, actually are a 17 year old woman.

691
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,200
I mean, girl.

692
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,360
Uh huh.

693
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,020
13.

694
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:22,940
The history of evil and Illuminism is similar.

695
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:31,800
You are no doubt aware of the mystical significance of the eye in the pyramid found on the back

696
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,400
of U.S. dollar bills since 1933.

697
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,640
Yeah.

698
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,520
Some have explained it as a Masonic symbol, and this is correct.

699
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:48,400
It is public record that Franklin Roosevelt's political henchman, James Farley, was a member

700
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,280
of secret fraternal orders.

701
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:57,800
But did you know that this pyramid symbol dates back to ancient Egypt, where it was

702
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,640
known as the Eye of Horus?

703
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:06,020
And is it not curious that many have reported citing what appears to be a symbol of the

704
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,020


705
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,900
Eye of Horus as an observatory on the top of Mount Shasta?

706
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:18,100
This literally may be the true Eye of Horus, the all-seeing eye of world Illuminism.

707
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,260
How did this malignance enter America?

708
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,920
The connecting link dates back to the Middle Ages.

709
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,740
The musty history books of this era are full of sorcerers, pursuers of forbidden light,

710
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,000
significantly different from the original.

711
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,740
And, unfortunately, key public figures would pledge to this blasphemous creed.

712
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,780
Roger Bacon's 13th century English statement was devoted to what he called universal knowledge

713
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,640
and the practice of alchemy.

714
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,480
The problem of supernatural production of gold and silver, the true origin of demonic

715
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:02,000
monetary policy, and satanic inflation soon became such a threat that the British Parliament

716
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,960
outlawed it in 1404.

717
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:11,100
Yet Illuminists such as George Ripley of Britain and Basil Valentine of Germany continued

718
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,560
this malicious pursuit.

719
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,800
In modern times, we shall see that the alchemists have been succeeded by the Luciferian scientists

720
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:25,360
who invent new and terrible elements to destroy our civilization.

721
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,560
Isn't that a little extreme?

722
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,100
Extremity is the point.

723
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,940
Who is in charge of the world?

724
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,360
The conspiracy.

725
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,140
You are.

726
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:42,360
I haven't talked about my favorite conspiracy, the conspiracy of normals to make normalcy

727
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:42,700
the norm.

728
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,140
The most infuriating conspiracy of all.

729
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,780
The one that doesn't even know it's a conspiracy.

730
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,620
Confederacy of dunces.

731
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:00,260
Well, it gives them the unique opportunity to conspire against themselves without being

732
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,700
any more confused than they started off in the first place.

733
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:11,400
I've been reading Professor Timothy F. X. Finnegan of Trinity College, who was the founder of

734
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:18,940
patapsychology, which is influenced by very much by Alfred Jerry's pataphysics, the College of

735
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:24,400
Pataphysics in Paris. And patapsychology is based on memories we can't get rid of,

736
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:32,460
but can't quite believe in. It's the study of the preposterous memories. But briefly told

737
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:38,040
Finnegan that I've never seen a normal human being. I've never experienced an average day.

738
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:46,440
And Finnegan refers to that as Murphy's first fundamental finding. And that's the whole bedrock

739
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,900
of patapsychology. This is connected with Finnegan's thesis that the idea of the normal

740
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:59,280
was invented by the English to make us all act like they do. This was before they invented the

741
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,440
wire. Then they invented clocks to make a man work more than his good fortune.

742
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:10,740
And the whole British empire rests on the very is, which makes us believe our subjective

743
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:17,380
impressions are objective facts. And this is why the empire never ended. And nobody knows why Queen

744
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,780
Elizabeth was one of the fifth richest woman in the world. She didn't marry a rich man. She never

745
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,320
did any work in her life. Where does all this come from? Well, Lyndon LaRouche says it comes from the

746
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:32,360
international drug trade. I'd like to hear a better explanation. Finnegan says it's all due to the fact

747
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,900
that people are idiots. And so the British empire goes on collecting money by putting these people

748
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,560
on exhibit, even though not one of them is an authentic freak. And the only one who even begins

749
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:47,020
to resemble a freak is Prince Charlie. Well, so much for the British empire. And Professor

750
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,740
Jesus Magdalena Laputa of the University of Madrid, who's written so many books attacking

751
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,500
Finnegan, he has not proven his case that Finnegan is a paid propagandist for the IRA.

752
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,020
And anybody who pays any attention to that is just a paranoid kook.

753
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:20,940
And we'll be shocked. Alfred Kinsey's two books on sexual behavior were intended to prove that there is no such thing as normal sexual behavior. If you read him carefully and you read the thesis behind it, he makes it very clear. He points out at one place that he...

754
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:31,080
He pointed out as an entomologist and as a student of particularly specializing in the study of wasps. And he discovered that his specimens, he always measured his specimens.

755
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,800
He crashed down to other races.

756
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,320
He found out, yes.

757
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,840
He got stung by the wasps.

758
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:40,180
He found out that there was no such thing as a normal wasp, and that they were all...they

759
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:45,160
just came in all different...members of the same species came in all different shapes

760
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,000
and sizes, and there was such an incredible diversity among them. And he found the same

761
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,800
thing about sexual behavior, that there was an incredible diversity. But the sad thing

762
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:00,740
is...so this speaks to your conspiracy idea. The sad thing is that people read Kinsey to

763
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,440
find out how many times it did.

764
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:02,440


765
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:02,440


766
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:02,440


767
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,920
How many times a day they should do it, or how many times a week, or a month, or whatever.

768
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:12,080
They are looking for...they are looking in Kinsey and in other sex surveys for a norm,

769
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,600
instead of taking themselves as the measure of all things.

770
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:24,720
Sure. The great witch queen of central California, Lola of Capitola, she once said to me, the

771
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,680
normal is that which nobody is.

772
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:32,440
Well, the problem...if everybody finds out that the normal is...well, it is the normal.

773
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:32,440


774
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:32,440


775
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:38,200
There is not really such a thing as normals. Then there is no us versus them, and all these

776
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,840
religions that we have been making our living off of will just disappear. They dry up and

777
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,360
blow away.

778
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:50,860
No, you see, the normals are like mortal thought in Christian science. Mortal thought is unreal,

779
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,680
and yet it makes people sick. They get better when they realize it is unreal. The concept

780
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,680
of the normal makes you sick because you feel guilty about not being normal. Any definition

781
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,420
of the normal excludes you right away.

782
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,420


783
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,420


784
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,420


785
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,420


786
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,420


787
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,420


788
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,420


789
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,420


790
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,420


791
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,420


792
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,420


793
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,420


794
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,420


795
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,420


796
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:02,740
Yeah.

797
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:08,080
Because nobody is normal. It is a mathematical abstraction. So the concept of the normal

798
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:14,000
is unreal, and yet it can make you sick. You have got to read Mary Baker Eddy on Mortal

799
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,840
Mind to fully understand this.

800
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,040
They are members of the Diffie culture.

801
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,960
It is not only normal, it is uniform, and it is like the one uniform god that everybody

802
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,200
wants to be like, so they all have to be the same.

803
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:30,620
It works both ways, though, because some people just live to hate normals.

804
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,000
Uh-huh.

805
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:43,040
I've seen the things you people wouldn't believe, and I enjoyed every minute of it.

806
00:33:44,200 --> 00:34:00,740
Oh, it was lovely. So lovely. A little philosophy there from a panel discussion recorded, oh,

807
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,020
two or three weeks ago.

808
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,420
Yes. I will. But, oh, you didn't want to. No, I was just trying to make sure that you

809
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,040
at the Winter Star Festival, so to speak,

810
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:12,380
in Ohio, sponsored by ACE,

811
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,820
A-C-E of Cleveland,

812
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,320
the Association for Consciousness Exploration.

813
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:25,200
And the people talking there were myself

814
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,700
and Jeff Rosenbaum of ACE,

815
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,860
Anadeya Judith of the Church of All Worlds out in California,

816
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,020
and mostly talking there, Robert Anton Wilson,

817
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,560
old Pope Bob, and his pal Robert Shea,

818
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,880
the co-authors of the Illuminatus encyclopedias

819
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,260
that we use in our church,

820
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,460
panel discussion about what is the conspiracy.

821
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,660
We'll probably run little bits and pieces of that.

822
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,680
Just before that, there was some more of the secrecy

823
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:04,740
and secret recordings called Plan for Chaos.

824
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:14,080
Well, the reading there was by our friend Reverend Lou Minotti.

825
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,540
But I thought I would do a little...

826
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:22,720
Oh, I should also mention we've got a very different

827
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,100
and big revival coming up in Buffalo, New York,

828
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,680
on April 4th.

829
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:34,560
And Sister Mary Squared will be there,

830
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,420
and I will be there,

831
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,400
and John Bartles,

832
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,300
we've got a song by him coming up a little bit later,

833
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,040
will also be there.

834
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:49,660
But also, Magnus the Magician,

835
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,020
also known as Jeff McBride.

836
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,440
If you've ever seen this guy,

837
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,860
I'd never heard of him before,

838
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,260
but apparently worldwide,

839
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,280
he's a really famous magician.

840
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,260
His stuff's kind of weird for the U.S., though.

841
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,000
I saw a videotape of his act,

842
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,560
and it's unbelievable.

843
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,140
And two days prior to April 4th,

844
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,700
when we do this revival in Buffalo,

845
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,160
Mary Squared and I are opening for this guy,

846
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:24,020
which is kind of a daunting thing to consider,

847
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,400
because he's really, really good.

848
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,680
And as far as I know,

849
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:28,680


850
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,100
as far as I can tell,

851
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,780
completely, it is magic.

852
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,720
It's not illusion.

853
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,480
It is supernatural forces.

854
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,760
Assuming the videotape isn't cheated on,

855
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,000
and I don't think it is.

856
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,620
So, he's good.

857
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,400
He's real good,

858
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,340
and we're really bad.

859
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,680
He does this very disciplined thing,

860
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:57,660
and we're just the epitome of undisciplined.

861
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,180
So, I guess that's what it'll be about.

862
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,100
You know, it takes all kinds.

863
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,200
And that's what I wanted to talk about tonight.

864
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,240
I had a little sermon here.

865
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,280
Actually, it's a reading from Revelation X,

866
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,040
the Bob Apocryphon Gospels in Progress, dear friends,

867
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,640
regarding the slack of Bob.

868
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,740
And, you know, one problem met by scientifically-minded investigators

869
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:27,480
is that Dob's existence requires him to acknowledge,

870
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,820
and somehow explain,

871
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,180
the many anomalous and irritating phenomena

872
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,920
that invariably accompany his physical presence.

873
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,060
Dob's exists in the eye of an acausal hurricane,

874
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,160
a quantum storm generating enough slack force

875
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,740
to coerce the odds and variances,

876
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,240
the physical laws of our universe,

877
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,520
into giving him exactly what he wants and needs

878
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,180
from moment to moment.

879
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,760
Dob's never has to compromise his desires in any way.

880
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,560
Instead, the universe must rearrange itself

881
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,820
and sometimes perform remarkable feats of acausality

882
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,140
in order to accommodate a Dob's.

883
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:23,520
The fact that his soul is banned from both hell and heaven

884
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,460
is not the only reason that Bob remains

885
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,240
on Earth.

886
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,320
He cannot die.

887
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:34,100
He is protected by the very randomness of the universe,

888
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:38,720
for he himself is the most uncertain random principle.

889
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:46,300
A Bob is that nexus to which all the most unlikely probabilities

890
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:50,540
must converge, but always in a manner that benefits him.

891
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,980
There are very selective laws of probability for Dob.

892
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:02,440
If it takes a 40 million to one shot for him not to be hurt seriously

893
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,000
by, for instance, a truck barreling suddenly around the corner,

894
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,980
if it would require a drunken, rotten telephone pole

895
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,100
to suddenly fall down and block that truck

896
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,580
and maybe kill the driver, then that's exactly what will happen.

897
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,820
The least likely possibility is most often

898
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,240
what saves Bob from the many equally unlikely dangers

899
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,500
that constantly threaten him.

900
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,080
To see Dob's luck in action can be frightening.

901
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,240
The field constantly compensates for everything happening around him

902
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:45,700
on all levels from the molecular to the macrocosmic.

903
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,840
These chains of events can result in literally anything,

904
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,800
anything that is mathematically required to keep Bob's slack pure.

905
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,020
To maintain that even vibration of slack.

906
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,180
Lightning strikes, anvils fall out of airplanes,

907
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,380
dictatorships are overthrown, elevators crash,

908
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,380
miracle cures are discovered, old wounds flare up,

909
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,960
floods are averted, stock markets collapse,

910
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,080
pianos fall from windows, the blind suddenly see,

911
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,580
and the deaf hear, and false teeth get swallowed,

912
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,700
poor families win the lottery,

913
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,620
and enemies of Bob laugh to death,

914
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,940
or unexpectedly drop dead from heart attacks or aneurysms.

915
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,060
And yet Bob never actually intends any of it.

916
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,340
It's the luck plane protecting itself.

917
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,780
But sometimes the effect is subtle.

918
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,480
Other times it's more elaborate,

919
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,540
as when a fantastic Rube Goldberg type machine

920
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:55,680
spontaneously forms from the ordinary household or office,

921
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,480
and the office objects around Bob.

922
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,760
Sometimes it causes Bob to be injured,

923
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:07,020
but only if his being in the hospital would prevent an assassination attempt at that time, say,

924
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:14,280
or lend him the perfect sleeve job from the ultimate archetypal student nurse.

925
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:20,440
The way Bob interacts with our universe is indeed uncannily

926
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,580
like the way cartoon characters interact with bears.

927
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,980
When he is surprised,

928
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:29,300
his eyes have been reported to bug almost superhumanly,

929
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,720
and his hat to be caused by some telekinetic power

930
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,600
to pop into the air for a second,

931
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,740
or spin wildly on his head.

932
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,800
His pipe may spontaneously leap away from his mouth

933
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,860
and then magically reinsert itself.

934
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,380
It may sometimes even make a little kaboom sound

935
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,280
when he's angered and a tiny mushroom cloud appears in the bowl,

936
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:53,160
and fiery dottle pops out,

937
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,960
exploding like a bomb.

938
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,220
It's like miniature meteor showers.

939
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,700
How does Dobbs do it?

940
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,080
Bob isn't doing any of it.

941
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,900
The universe does it for him.

942
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,580
The universe must contend with Bob,

943
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,300
for Bob does not contend with the universe.

944
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,600
If Bob seems to be having trouble,

945
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:29,680
it is only that the universe is momentarily out of phase around him.

946
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,680
He is another universe,

947
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,340
his own self-contained universe

948
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:42,740
with its own laws and internal regulations and space-time.

949
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:49,560
The interface between his and ours may one minute be a chaotic and terrifying one,

950
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,580
and then suddenly become an orgiastic celebration of life,

951
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,360
and awareness.

952
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,660
It may even lapse into total non-causality,

953
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:03,880
a state in which nothing occurs around Bob at all,

954
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,600
a total and utter stasis,

955
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,800
such as when he is blind drunk and passed out,

956
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:21,000
and the only indication of time passing in all the cosmos is his snoring.

957
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:28,840
Ahhh!

958
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,280
It's happening everywhere you look!

959
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:42,640
Amidst some real-life tymophones is your need that you willfall into darkness.

960
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:42,720
You can't really move through the future if you are in some state of darkness,

961
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,400
and those are true realities,

962
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:50,540
but sooner or later will you fall into a state ofiki andvation .

963
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,560
I don't see any method that can 눌러fe into you,

964
00:43:53,560 --> 00:44:00,000
you know that the head of every man is christ the head of the woman is the man the head of christ

965
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,180
is god and they so you got your woman you got your man you got your jesus you got your god

966
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:14,600
then you got your normal order here the correct order is for christ to be head of every man

967
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:23,620
this doesn't mean just to be a christian man no until a man is mastered by christ

968
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:31,740
he's not a man and until he's not normal now there are those today that are mastered by drink

969
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:39,100
there are those today mastered by passion those mastered by the flesh but we need to be mastered

970
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:43,700
by christ we need to be mastered by fate and which

971
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:44,440
bleeding

972
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:55,400
but yet which can yet be launched onto the stratosphere using a nine iron yes

973
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:03,080
in truth as uh pre-scripture states the nine iron can be used to launch that self same hand

974
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:13,780
but it must be in obiasis to they who have come and shall come again uh you understand the arisal

975
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:22,840
the time is not yet for their arisal to respond to the man that's the general principle exactly and

976
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:29,100
it's normal i think for a woman to be subject to the man and matter oh that is a woman who cannot

977
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:36,020
look up to a man and respect him she ought not to follow him and surely she ought not to marry him

978
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:42,780
that's the important thing but a real woman responds with every fiber of her being

979
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,400
very rowdy alsoắn

980
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,440
didn't say that in the santa claus

981
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:57,300
been so instrumental here at the church and organizing those spread leg suppers

982
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,100
my

983
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:07,580
section

984
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,880
you

985
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,160
look at this

986
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:11,620
significant

987
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,340
amazing

988
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:12,360
isn't this

989
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:12,840
a very

990
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:14,420
beautiful

991
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:14,420


992
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:26,060
For Bob, my friend, Bob is a sex god.

993
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,820
Bob, in fact, is sex.

994
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:38,820
An all-encompassing sex that is the very in-ness and surrounding-ness of the union of both the lingam and the uni.

995
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,380
And not just heterosex, all sex.

996
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:46,120
Bob does not choose to fornicate.

997
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:51,060
Bob has the tool of Wotan, has to fornicate.

998
00:46:51,100 --> 00:47:03,000
And not just with women, not just with men, with animals, with plants, from the faithful oak tree in his backyard to the mighty whales of the brining deep of the very earth itself.

999
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:04,900
That was fun.

1000
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,020
Doctor!

1001
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,000
No, doctor, I beg you.

1002
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:10,600
Does this hurt? Does this hurt?

1003
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,020
No!

1004
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,660
Doctor, doctor, please.

1005
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,860
No, wait, can you wait?

1006
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,420
It is a time of flagrant immorality.

1007
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,100
Uncle Puzzling, will you tell me a bedtime story?

1008
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,120
Oh, this is disgusting.

1009
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,700
Can you tell me what the 60s were like?

1010
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,300
The 60s?

1011
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,500
Was it really like an Oliver Stone movie?

1012
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:37,540
Probably, but Uncle Puzzling just doesn't even want to speak to you.

1013
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,860
Eh, eh.

1014
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,360
You, you, I think you shocked him into a...

1015
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:42,360


1016
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:42,580
memory.

1017
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,140
The wrong kind of question.

1018
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:45,040
He's in a reverie.

1019
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:45,900
Here they are.

1020
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,260
Here's what the 60s were like.

1021
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,080
Oh, they were wonderful.

1022
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,420
They were being, like, stuck inside a, a ball gum machine.

1023
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,220
Cool.

1024
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,300
Yes, the 60s were very gaudy, held sway along with...

1025
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,120
Oh, it's the 60s, man.

1026
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,760
The 60s are back!

1027
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:02,780
Yeah!

1028
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,200
Ron, Ron, I wish you didn't ask for the 60s.

1029
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,000
Look what's happening.

1030
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:07,420


1031
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:11,900
Coming up...

1032
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,420
Rerun, uh, uh, Latin.

1033
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,640
Hey, remember body painting?

1034
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,400
You keep awful records in your basement real loud.

1035
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,940
Cheap high-five.

1036
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:31,780
Yeah, yeah, and painting it black and, and putting those black light posters up like,

1037
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,000
like, look at this one.

1038
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,360
When the light hits it, you can practically see it.

1039
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,320
They're twitching there.

1040
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,100
Wow, man, watch this.

1041
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:39,960
Vaughn Meter, dead ahead.

1042
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:51,480
I'm gonna play the latest hit by the electric, uh, melt of the frog brain, uh, strawberry, uh, alarm, uh, vesicle.

1043
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,900
Boy, that brought those colors out, man.

1044
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,580
Everybody on the floor, let's dance.

1045
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:57,900
It's the 60s.

1046
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,860
It's the electric baboons, man.

1047
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:06,280
Boy, when the pigs callin' the 60s through my door,

1048
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,240
they really swung.

1049
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,520
I'll show you how to handle a market pig, man.

1050
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,700
When the pigs...

1051
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,560
...bust through my door, then the people are gonna have to bring the...

1052
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,420
Shut up, pigs.

1053
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,260
...pig hole and peep on those pigs out through the poop hole.

1054
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,440
...pig hole and peep on those pigs out through the poop hole.

1055
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,120
Oh, wait, this is the sensitive part of the 60s, you know, when you were coming down off the acid, you thought,

1056
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,400
I love everybody.

1057
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:29,580
You see, you have to have a sensitivity treatment when you wanna...

1058
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,220
Wow, it was cool then.

1059
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,720
Yes, all of the rock stars are now, as you say, sensitive.

1060
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:38,860
Like me.

1061
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:39,320
Yeah, sensitive.

1062
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,420
Yeah, like us.

1063
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:41,500
Honk, honk.

1064
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,320
Yeah, you're about as sensitive as a power shovel.

1065
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:45,760
Wow.

1066
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,160
When you see an archive, it's...

1067
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,760
Here comes the hurdy-gurdy.

1068
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:52,520
Ow!

1069
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,060
Oh!

1070
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:53,880
Oh!

1071
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:54,760
Oh!

1072
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,320
Oh!

1073
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:55,580
Oh!

1074
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:55,880
Oh!

1075
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,060
Oh!

1076
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,500
Here comes the hurdy-gurdy.

1077
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,880
Hurdy-gurdy.

1078
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,160
Rikki-tikki-tobby.

1079
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,240
Rikki-tikki-dos.

1080
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,200
Rikki-tikki-gurdy.

1081
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:03,940
Soul Superman.

1082
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,280
Rikki-tikki-gurdy-gurdy-gurdy-gurdy.

1083
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,020
Singing songs of the world.

1084
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,180
I don't think you should have brought up the 60s, it was kind of a confusing period for us all.

1085
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:11,600
No, 60s, no.

1086
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:12,780
Bringing him up now.

1087
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,360
Murder.

1088
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:14,960
Murder.

1089
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,200
Murder.

1090
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:15,600
Murder.

1091
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,020
Murder.

1092
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:16,700
Murder.

1093
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:16,900
Murder.

1094
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:16,900


1095
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:16,900


1096
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:16,900


1097
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:16,900


1098
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:16,900


1099
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,700
The 60s.

1100
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,980
Here, just right in this green tambourine.

1101
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,120
How was that?

1102
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,600
Was that a nice story of the 60s?

1103
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,800
Well, there you have it.

1104
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:25,760
The 60s.

1105
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,720
I shall be dead.

1106
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:27,920
The 60s are genius.

1107
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,040
For I am not now, nor have I ever been.

1108
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,040
I'm Amber of the human race.

1109
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,920
Mr. Kennedy, your head.

1110
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,080
Shh.

1111
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,160
Go ahead now.

1112
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,800
The Buddha smiles.

1113
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,240
A Buddha.

1114
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,160
A Buddha.

1115
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,160
A Buddha.

1116
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:49,660
The void is not nothingness.

1117
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,260
It's not?

1118
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:55,000
The void is beginning and end itself.

1119
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,180
That's nothing.

1120
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,380
Unobstructed, shining, thrilling, blissful.

1121
00:50:59,540 --> 00:50:59,920
Whoa!

1122
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,140
Diamond consciousness.

1123
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,420
Now that's short.

1124
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:05,560
The all-good Buddha.

1125
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:06,680
A Buddha.

1126
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:07,700
A Buddha.

1127
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:08,140
A Buddha.

1128
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,080
That's a lie.

1129
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1130
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:14,300
There's no such thing as no.

1131
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,360
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1132
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,260
Dusky train yards.

1133
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,660
Do you ever have a problem with barnacles growing on the roof of your mouth?

1134
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:23,180
We lost Dr. Winky.

1135
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,240
Oh, hell yeah, man.

1136
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,800
I had this problem for like six and a half weeks.

1137
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,280
I went to seven different specialists.

1138
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:34,600
I finally went to a Spanish fly, and he told me the air got, was actually emanating from my midbrain.

1139
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:37,500
That it was kind of like coming down like the Y tumors that grow.

1140
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,340
Growing in the middle ages when it used to, they'd have the outbreaks.

1141
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:46,800
And sooner or later, I mean, I would start hallucinating, and I never, I just had this painful barnacle in my mouth.

1142
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,620
Is that what you're hallucinating about tonight?

1143
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,480
What am I hallucinating about tonight?

1144
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:51,780
Let's see.

1145
00:51:51,820 --> 00:52:02,940
Lupini beans and white wine and a magnificent cow named, oh, what should we name the magnificent cow?

1146
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,080
Er or ball?

1147
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,000
Or somebody give it some biblical.

1148
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:07,300
Biblical.

1149
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,540
I'm a pagan at heart.

1150
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,200
Did you know Taz was in a retardo bastard version of the pagans?

1151
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,960
I'm not allowed to mention that on the air.

1152
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:29,620
Or else the gas people come by and create an excreted, an inflated, I'm sorry, exacerbation.

1153
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,660
I'm sorry.

1154
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,920
Oh, some sort of, oh geez.

1155
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,520
Taz just pulled his boner.

1156
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,020
He called.

1157
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:36,960
He actually called up.

1158
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,300
Jehovah's Witnesses.

1159
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:41,760
And I guess they were witnessing some kind of porno climacto.

1160
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,560
And I guess we're in a big heap of slimy right now.

1161
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,260
You, me, and everybody we know.

1162
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,420
And we don't know very many people, do we?

1163
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:54,800
I'm sure none of you, I'm sorry, seem to be drowning, but I'm actually rebounding.

1164
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:01,020
I'm coming back strong as, as strong as I, you know, you could imagine under the circumstances.

1165
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:04,060
But I forgot what I was talking about.

1166
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,260
About three and a half weeks ago.

1167
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:06,660
I think.

1168
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:07,520
Mm-hmm.

1169
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,560
Is when the Toyota broke down again.

1170
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,780
Is that where I started up?

1171
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,220
I don't know.

1172
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,400
You like to come full cycle.

1173
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,500
And I thought something with a cycle.

1174
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,160
There he is.

1175
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,520
I can make a six, six, twelve cycle motor horse.

1176
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,980
We got Dr. Winkie back in the office.

1177
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:19,900
Now sing.

1178
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:24,480
For me at the shoulders, the sinews of complex nomenclature.

1179
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:30,840
The dow of the echo in a thought is conscious will fear.

1180
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,380
Send orders.

1181
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:33,720
Is true false?

1182
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,460
I'm not going to sing.

1183
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,560
I'm not going to sing.

1184
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:36,640
I'm not going to sing.

1185
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:36,640


1186
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:36,640


1187
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:36,640


1188
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:36,640


1189
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:36,640


1190
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:36,640


1191
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,640
His Jesus.

1192
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:42,640


1193
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:42,720
He heard.

1194
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,820
troubles with this.

1195
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,680
Oh my God.

1196
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,680
That's true.

1197
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:51,560
Hmm.

1198
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:52,600
All right.

1199
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,140
But if we can't use a punctuation, you've said something wrong that you guys don't want

1200
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,140


1201
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,140


1202
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,140


1203
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,140


1204
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,140


1205
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,140


1206
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,480
No.

1207
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:56,740
It's right.

1208
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:56,740


1209
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:56,740


1210
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:56,740


1211
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,720
The guy who goes, well, look what you got this.

1212
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,720
So this thing went, you know, Ariel.

1213
00:53:59,720 --> 00:53:59,720


1214
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,400
It's a little bit, I just learned that there was no sides for what you did.

1215
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:10,240
But he had the yips just like a Jew.

1216
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:17,300
Problem was that he was Irish and Catholic too.

1217
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,880
He was the last of the great blasphemers.

1218
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:29,580
And his head shook so bad he couldn't drink no more.

1219
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:35,900
He threatened to go outside and sleep in someone else's car.

1220
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,740
Who could want more?

1221
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:02,260
Then he'd stumble around and do a little dance

1222
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:07,340
That would end abruptly when he'd pee in his pants.

1223
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:08,720
And then he'd go home and think about it.

1224
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:08,720


1225
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:08,720


1226
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:08,720


1227
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:12,040
He was excommunicated upon his own request.

1228
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:16,360
As a blasphemer, he was the neighborhood best.

1229
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,000
He was shaking at the priest.

1230
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:33,780
And he'd scream, bloody murder.

1231
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,680
He'd get way out there.

1232
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:44,440
And he'd continue to go out there further and further.

1233
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,040
He'd slander the church.

1234
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:07,400
He'd slander the parishioners.

1235
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:13,060
He'd make obscene gestures up in front of the police commissioner.

1236
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,920
He'd explain all his actions and make perfect sense.

1237
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,980
Then they'd hit and let him go on his own or in cognizance.

1238
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,660
Then he'd go back to the bar and fell down three or four.

1239
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:30,240
And he'd get back up on his soapbox and blaspheme some more.

1240
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,560
And this would go on and on every night of the week.

1241
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:38,460
Until his liver finally began to get...

1242
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:39,900
Kind of weak.

1243
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:45,180
And he began to buy LSD from the kids on the street.

1244
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:55,220
He was our last of the great blasphemers.

1245
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,080
With a big tall milk glass full of whiskey.

1246
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:05,500
And a splash of water.

1247
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,580
And one cube clinking.

1248
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,720
While the...

1249
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:08,720


1250
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:08,720


1251
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,020
Spearside buzzed and crackled.

1252
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:15,640
And the light went on blinking and blinking and blinking.

1253
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,500
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1254
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,100
John Bartles.

1255
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,760
The amazing John Bartles of Springwater, New York.

1256
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:31,760
Wherever that is.

1257
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,620
Actually, he helped me performing with that...

1258
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,440
Blasphemer.

1259
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,500
Not too...

1260
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:39,520
Far off.

1261
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:45,180
Well, you've been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1262
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,340
One of the many Church of the Subgenius products.

1263
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,680
But the only one that I can tell you about.

1264
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,820
Unless you want to write for free information from...

1265
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:55,980
Bob himself.

1266
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:08,720
Just write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

1267
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,560
