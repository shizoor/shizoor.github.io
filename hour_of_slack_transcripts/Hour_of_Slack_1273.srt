1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,020
And now, the subgenius hour of slack!

2
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:35,900
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station.

3
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,940
And only in the city of...

4
00:00:51,580 --> 00:01:04,360
Friends, we're doing computer repairs this week, and I'm forced to use a rerun from the year 2001 for this hour of slack.

5
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,040
But it's a good rerun. Price bought.

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,360
There's the range pin.

7
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:21,380
The first arrangement is to sit down slowly, making sure the head muscles don't move too much, causing the brain to move around in the brain case.

8
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,020
Making sure all the dendrites are connected so that no one knows.

9
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,480
No one knows.

10
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,920
Oh, yes, dear friends.

11
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,240
Welcome to another subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

12
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,580
This one is actually, what, number 787.

13
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,200
That's all.

14
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:01,960
And, uh, well, we finally finished moving the subgenius archives into the new tomb castle.

15
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,860
But I'm getting married in four days.

16
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,760
We did everything back-asswards, friends.

17
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,040
Princess, we, and I.

18
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,260
Uh, first we bought a house.

19
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,880
Then we went on our honeymoon to Amsterdam.

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,700
Uh, then we got married.

21
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,940
Next we're gonna start dating.

22
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,680
And I guess, uh, eventually someone will introduce us.

23
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:34,180
And, uh, so, since I've gotta go, uh, get ready, get fit for my tuxedo and, uh, all that kind of crap.

24
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,780
Uh, romantic, uh, crap, friends.

25
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,800
Uh, see, I've been there, done that.

26
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,760
It's my...

27
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,000
It's my...

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,660
It's my second time, too.

29
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,500
Although Princess We is very excited.

30
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,160
She's never been married before.

31
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,000
And she's never gonna be married again.

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,000
Because, my friends, I'm gonna announce to you right now, in a subgenius on-the-air wedding ceremony,

33
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,800
that I'm gonna bird-dog that stuff.

34
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,480
You hear me?

35
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,160
I'm gonna bird-dog that stuff.

36
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,500
So don't even think about it, boys and subgenius girls.

37
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't even...

38
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,840
This is...

39
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,280
Reverend Stang is bird-dogging that stuff.

40
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,660
And, uh, and in so doing, I've gotta rush through this show.

41
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:20,220
Of course, there's tons of Einstein's Secret Orchestra, uh, recorded from, uh, the DeVival at Euclid Tavern.

42
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,200
And maybe some ranting.

43
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,180
And tons of brand new, uh, Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket.

44
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,900
And, uh, Little Theodore.

45
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,340
I've got some Little Theodore here that, uh, you probably haven't heard.

46
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,700
That's wonderful.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,880
And, uh, oh, uh, Lord only knows what all.

48
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,620
Oh, Morning Forty Federation.

49
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,240
That's this, uh, sloppy band in New Orleans that I kindly like.

50
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,420
But, friends, this is, after all, the hour of slack.

51
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:58,860
And who better to explain certain heretofore unexplored areas of slack and slacks

52
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:06,860
than the great discovery of, uh, of our friend, uh, Pope Phil Monty, the pope of all northern England.

53
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:19,420
Uh, uh, Phil Monty discovered, uh, this local artist by the name of Fat Harry White.

54
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:27,220
And so, dear friends, once again, on the hour of slack, we are so pleased to present to you slack

55
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:37,520
as, uh, ex, explored, uh, the conceit of slack as entertained by the great Fat Harry White.

56
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:37,860
Thank you.

57
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,440
Praise Bob.

58
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,760
Mmm, baby.

59
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,840
Slippin' into my new skin-tight jumpers for you, honey.

60
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,980
And dressin' up for the ladies for the love.

61
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,340
Come over here, Maureen.

62
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,240
Hey, I'm talkin' about dressin' up like it reminds me of when I worked at Slack's R.O.S.

63
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,420
You know, right? Next to Jessop's, the grocer's.

64
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,440
It was the first time I met Foxy Fiona, my very sexy lady friend.

65
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,840
Never forget it, she walked up to me at the counter and in a very sexy voice

66
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,020
asked me what I had to offer in the trouser department.

67
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,780
Apparently, she wanted to buy some flared crimpling slacks for her long-legged father's birthday.

68
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,680
Very partial to bright colours, it was.

69
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,160
Anyway, I told her I was almost certain I'd have something with a good length that would satisfy her

70
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,100
and asked her to follow me upstairs.

71
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:42,020
Well, after going through me trousers, she surprised me by saying that she really fancied the large pink pair that I had.

72
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,040
Not only did they hang well, but she thought they looked really attractive.

73
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,100
Particularly the way they swung about loosely when I walked.

74
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,400
Mind you, she wasn't too sure of the size at first and had me lay them out on the counter so she could measure them up.

75
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,080
She also ran her fingers admiringly down the crease.

76
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,320
Well, she decided to go for it, asked me how much.

77
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,080
I says three and a half.

78
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,080


79
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,620
Three and a half quid.

80
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,440
She asked me rather cheekily if I would go down.

81
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,380
Well, you know, thought about it, long and hard.

82
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,640
Decided to drop them for her, which I did there and then.

83
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,760
What fun, backwards and forwards, over the counter.

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,320
A good bit of haggling and no mistake.

85
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,960
And I was thinking about this, right, because I've been back to that shop

86
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,200
because the weather's beginning to change a bit, getting a bit parker, isn't it?

87
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,820
Well, I tell you what, I went out the other morning and my buns were so cold it started to change colour.

88
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,900
I'm not kidding.

89
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,060
When they're very sexy.

90
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,100
Sexy lady friend, sexy Sam, saw me coming towards her, me purple head sticking out me coat.

91
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,280
She told me to get it covered immediately.

92
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,840
So I said, I'm going to the shop to buy a hat, a fur one.

93
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,560
Well, when I got there, you know, I asked sexy Salea, the very sexy lady friend hat assistant,

94
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,960
to show me what she had, you know, in her fur department.

95
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,220
She said she'd be only too pleased to show me what she had downstairs

96
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,260
and led me to the basement where I could see everything she had.

97
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,540
On full display.

98
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,940
I tell you what, you wouldn't believe how much she had.

99
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,020
She had every kind of fur out you could imagine.

100
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:16,100
I was going to go for a fox fur, but as soon as sexy Salea said she had a particularly nice beaver

101
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,980
that I might be interested in, immediately changed my mind.

102
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,800
Well, you know, after getting it out for me, I've got to say,

103
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,840
I've never seen such a big bushy one like it in all my life.

104
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,880
Well, when I asked her if she could, you know, try it on for size, she said,

105
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,180
I might find it a bit tight at first, but if I bury my head,

106
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,380
deep enough, then it should stretch a little to accommodate me fully.

107
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,140
Tell you what, she weren't wrong.

108
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,140
And when I looked at it in the mirror, you know, sideways on,

109
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,880
I could see it had slid in perfectly.

110
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,880
Well, you know, after that, she then said she'd summat round the back

111
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,880
that I might be interested in, led me into the storeroom

112
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,920
to show me a selection of gloves that had just arrived.

113
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,560
Well, I was obviously interested, but as I didn't know what size I was,

114
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,980
I had to get sexy Salea to measure my hand.

115
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,920
After asking me to, you know, give her a finger, which I promptly did,

116
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,920
she then asked me to stick my thumb up.

117
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,220
No problem at all.

118
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,600
Within minutes, she declared, as she was holding her measuring tape,

119
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,240
that I was extra, extra large.

120
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,400
Well, then she had to take a phone call.

121
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,900
But while she was on the mobile, I took the opportunity of rummaging in her box

122
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,940
until I found the perfect fit.

123
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,280
And when I withdrew, sexy Salea nodded appreciatively at my great big leathery pair.

124
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,980
Ah, dressing up.

125
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,840
For the ladies, yeah.

126
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,180
I'm a-looking in the mood for love.

127
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,840
Oh, yes.

128
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,620
Fat Harry White, dear friends.

129
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:53,060
And from his album, well, actually, it's Fat Harry White and the Love Limited Orchestra.

130
00:08:53,180 --> 00:09:02,160
From his album, Mmm, Baby, on Anxious Records, thanks to Pope Phil Amante.

131
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,240
Oh, yes.

132
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,540
Friends, you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack,

133
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,840
the voice of the Church of the Subgenius, the only real religion,

134
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,360
because it's the only one that admits it's so totally full of crap,

135
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,860
that makes it pretty much the only valid one.

136
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,480
Don't you agree?

137
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,380
Anyway, you can always get more information about this church

138
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,420
by checking us out on the internet, www.subgenius.com.

139
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,560
And what's it about?

140
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,500
Well, it's about...

141
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,100
It's about the great super salesman J.R. Bob Dobbs, who discovered in 1953

142
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,580
that there was a conspiracy of normal people robbing away the slack

143
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,840
of all the weirdos, abnormals, disbelievers, or those who'll believe anything,

144
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,700
which is what we're looking for, friends,

145
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:52,400
those who can join us in this nameless fight against that conspiracy of normal people.

146
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,180
And how are you gonna get slack, and how are you gonna fight the conspiracy?

147
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,480
Here's our secret.

148
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,720
We won't tell you.

149
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,640
It's up to you, because only you know what's best for you.

150
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,840
So, uh, eh, eh, eh, eh, praise...

151
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,320
I don't even know what's coming up next.

152
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,880
I gotta get this show done in a hurry, eh, because...

153
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,480
So I go on to, uh, some serious, serious slack.

154
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,220
I understand that when you get married, you can have sex, and I've heard a lot about that.

155
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,520
I was just so anxious to check it out.

156
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,040
Well, um, so I'm going to let, uh, the older tapes, uh, take care of the rest of this show.

157
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,460
Praise Bob.

158
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,620
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

159
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,620
I heard Mojo almost had mutiny in New Zealand, because of that.

160
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:31,620


161
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:31,620


162
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:31,620


163
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,760
He kept spewing Bob.

164
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,980
And, and, uh, uh, we have people that work for the company who actually go to church

165
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,600
and stuff.

166
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,520
Well, I guess that's their problem.

167
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,780
And they got absurd by the effect of Bob upon their, uh, cataclysms?

168
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,420
Yeah.

169
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,700
Oh, my dearth.

170
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:47,940
What?

171
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,280
So they felt threatened by Bob.

172
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,080
Their God.

173
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,460
Their God.

174
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,600
They felt like their God wasn't standing a chance against Bob Dobbs.

175
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,140
They might be listening right now.

176
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,460
They were feeling a little sinful.

177
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,960
They might be listening, even.

178
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,380
Well...

179
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,740
Right now.

180
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,220
You know, there's some people have the kind of God that has to, that needs help from his

181
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,700
followers.

182
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:14,640
A weak, pathetic, sad God who can't take a joke, who can't take an insult, and whose

183
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,300
followers have to thrash those...

184
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,700
A God whose, a God whose hands and feet wounds have never healed, nor that long-kneed

185
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,800
spear in the side, Nix.

186
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,080
Then you got old Bob.

187
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,140
They'd been festering for thousands of years, and even before the hams came out.

188
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,840
No, old Bob, he's a better sport, and his followers are pretty good sports.

189
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,360
Listen to this.

190
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,360


191
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,360


192
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,360


193
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,360


194
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,360


195
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,360


196
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,360


197
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,660
Listen to this.

198
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,340
Check it out.

199
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,120
There he is, right here.

200
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:33,920
Bob's being tortured.

201
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,460
Some sport with hams right now.

202
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,760
Um, they average about, uh, 27, 28.

203
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,500
Inches.

204
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,320
What?

205
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,380
Oh my God.

206
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:41,880
Isn't that a little old?

207
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,360
That's a new record.

208
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,680
Well, it's old for brownies.

209
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,940
Oh, I see how you could get it that way.

210
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,160
The Muscovites are all girls whose first few marriages didn't work out, and they decided

211
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,480
to get back into uniform.

212
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,980
Fortunately, we sell enough cookies to keep a roof over our heads.

213
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,740
March, march, march, from Michigan.

214
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,600
Door to door.

215
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,360
No, most of the girls sleep right here in the back.

216
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,360


217
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,360


218
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,360


219
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,360


220
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,360


221
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,360


222
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,160
No, no.

223
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:02,840
No, no.

224
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,280
Dog's town.

225
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:04,900
Cookies.

226
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,620
You sell the cookies door to door.

227
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,220
Oh.

228
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,660
Bob cookies.

229
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,120
Yes.

230
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,400
We go out every night at the stroke of midnight.

231
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,020
Oh, stroking at midnight.

232
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,500
Yes.

233
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,080
Well, there's no time during the day.

234
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,240
I give my lectures during the day.

235
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,160
Oh, could she?

236
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,880
I teach my girls the basics of a happy, successful life.

237
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,540
Oh, I see.

238
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,780
Things like cooking and...

239
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,900
No, dum-dum.

240
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,280
Things like alimony.

241
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:29,920
Oh!

242
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,340
And then one week in the morning, we go to the bar.

243
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:31,340


244
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:31,340


245
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:31,340


246
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:31,340


247
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:31,340


248
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:31,340


249
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,300
And each month, we go on a...

250
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,980
And shaving their vaginas for Pazuzu.

251
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:34,640
Uh-huh.

252
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:40,840
Each girl has a tent all to herself, and each one has her own mess kit, bed roll, and a

253
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,420
flashlight.

254
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,620
The girls just love it.

255
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,400
Oh, that sounds very interesting.

256
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,340
Where do you have these encampments?

257
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,380
Fort Dix, New Jersey.

258
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,500
Fort Dix.

259
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,140
There you go, Dave.

260
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,740
Fort Dix.

261
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,400
Man, Dave.

262
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,060
Fort Dix.

263
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,160
Dave exploded there.

264
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,800
I'm sorry.

265
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,380
I had a bad vision.

266
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,200
I had a pretty weird...

267
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,220
It was intense, Chaz.

268
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:00,720
That was...

269
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,320
It scared us.

270
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,320


271
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,320


272
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,000
It was like right in my prefrontal lobe.

273
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,660
Your mother sucks Bob in hell.

274
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,860
I could see it right in the front of my head.

275
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,840
Stang and I were both actually scared when you did that.

276
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,800
I thought it was going to come out of my head and leap onto the turntable for the love of

277
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,100
dodge.

278
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,020
Like a Harryhausen animation.

279
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,420
Yeah, like one of those...

280
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,440
It's pulling Dave's forehead open from inside and leaping out a little bit.

281
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,340
You're homunculus.

282
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,220
With kind of a Dave look to it.

283
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,080
Tiny little man, come out.

284
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,340
And a big prehensile...

285
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,320
Tiny little man.

286
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,120
...like, tentacle-like appendage, baby.

287
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,160
The world is a ghetto.

288
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,700
Remember, folks, in Sector 49 Light School...

289
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,040
But you can put a nice little horn soundtrack to it and it's not so bad.

290
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,980
Come on, baby.

291
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,700
Get on down.

292
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
When the windows are open a little bit.

293
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,920
Sit down next to me.

294
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,840
Let me tell you about old Bob.

295
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,880
She just like...

296
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,660
You can't imagine me as shaken.

297
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,160
You need a light, huh?

298
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,160
Like, all I see is hot buttered corn.

299
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,320
I'm not a corn.

300
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,320


301
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,320


302
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,320


303
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,320


304
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,320


305
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,320


306
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,320


307
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,320


308
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,320


309
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,320


310
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,320


311
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,900
So your eyes really are looking hot, Bob.

312
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,700
You know what I'm saying, Bob?

313
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,020
I mean, I can't see you as like the dulcet-toned, you know, any one of them kind of singers,

314
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,560
you know...

315
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,460
What, you mean I'm not doing the Isaac Hayes thing right?

316
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,700
Well, I just can't see you.

317
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,700
Hey, baby.

318
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,720
Hey, baby.

319
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,720
Well...

320
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,860
The Isaac Warberry Jones...

321
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,100
...sit down in my bed.

322
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,300
And just have the just a beautiful little...

323
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,440
Hey, I just made a musical joke, Bob.

324
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,700
Hey, Chaz, are you...

325
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,240
Baby, make my bed, baby...

326
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,240


327
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,240


328
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,300
Baby, make my bed, baby.

329
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,020
I just made a musical joke.

330
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,360
I said the Isaac of the Berry Tone.

331
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,740
Hey, baby.

332
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,180
Hey, baby, baby.

333
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,400
He's my baby.

334
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,260
Sector 49.

335
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,980
Necks will be shaved at 3 p.m.

336
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,660
The world is for Gator.

337
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,120
Ring my bell, baby.

338
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,980
There will be no forehead paintings.

339
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,640
There will be no absurd behavior

340
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,740
among the Lungerlesians and the Bungerhesians.

341
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,740
The world is a ghetto.

342
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,200
Lusions.

343
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,760
There'll be no smoking in the gas chambers.

344
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,420
There'll be no puffing in the town of Hogs.

345
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,880
Please go to the restroom before you're strapped to the table.

346
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,300
Run slowly.

347
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,900
Do not walk with your head lifted or your eyes skyward,

348
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,220
but run slowly to the nearest convenience area.

349
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
Step on.

350
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,760
Stopping blue line.

351
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,500
If your family wishes to witness your execution,

352
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,000
make sure they have the pink backstage pass

353
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,640
before they enter the death chamber.

354
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,700
Security to aisle B.

355
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,020
The Kmart special tonight is a floundering of ham,

356
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,280
some pieces of old-estute periodical

357
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,960
from the period before this propaganda.

358
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,520
The world is a ghetto.

359
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,700
Something you know.

360
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,140
That is true.

361
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,840
Dr. Muffy, the walls are clean now.

362
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,460
All the blood's been washed into the sewer.

363
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,180
The old box is a ghetto.

364
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,340
All the barbed wire is down now

365
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,660
and everything looks like it used to look here in Cleanville

366
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,300
before the bungalows exploded.

367
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,820
That for me.

368
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,480
That for me.

369
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:28,660
That for me.

370
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,260
That for me.

371
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:29,260


372
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:29,260


373
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:29,920
Don't do it.

374
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,500
That's really true.

375
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,620
I think we still have problems here in Dobstown.

376
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,580
Some very, very deep psychological problems.

377
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,100
Dobstown is a ghetto, baby.

378
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,260
Dobstown is this world.

379
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,940
You ain't in the world until you've been to Dobstown.

380
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,540
And you can't escape the world until you have escaped

381
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,960
from Dobstown.

382
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,040
We ain'ta good eatin' no everything.

383
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,940
We're the codeytic people,

384
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,360
we're thestellar men,

385
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:18,360


386
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:18,360


387
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:18,460
On the air in Cobblestone,

388
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:18,460


389
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,140
Dobstown

390
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,900
And this is just my hoe,

391
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,320
so get out of here please

392
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:23,320


393
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:23,320


394
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,840
Bye.

395
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,460
Artamaya Salinas mix of I Dream of Bob.

396
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,400
So appropriate.

397
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:08,500
And before that, ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland starring Dances with Rockets, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang as guests.

398
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,680
Now how about some subgenius techno?

399
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:19,820
This new material here from St. Ann and Helena Handbaskets, C.D. Hale-Conney.

This new material here from St. Ann and Helena Handbaskets, C.D. Hale-Conney.

404
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,300
Anti-virgin Cosmo Green, the prettiest thing you've ever seen.

405
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,000
She's super sexy, nasty, mean, the original bad girl, so unclean.

406
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,520
An uber femme of outer space, she's so outrageous in your face.

407
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,980
An icon of desire and sex, just like the girls from Planet X.

408
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,480
A diva of debauchery, mistress of hot swaggery.

409
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,300
She's ultra cool, she's so hot, a juice of genius.

410
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,500
Patriot, our sister of salvation.

411
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,980
A pinup queen for masturbation, a true Jezebel.

412
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,260
She'll send you straight to pink hell.

413
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,120
Divine domestic deviation.

414
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,840
Connie is our inspiration.

415
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,300
A lonely leader in fighting love.

This is the Connie we trust.

417
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,080

Look out, boys.

432
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,740
She's on her way.

433
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,380
Our darling Connie is here to stay.

434
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,240
A girl like her is something rare.

435
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,160
She's superwoman.

436
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,780
She's everywhere.

437
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,720
A mighty enemy of the state.

438
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,600
She's the devil incarnate

439
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,240
She's one hell of a revelation

440
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,100
The siren of divine creation

441
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,840
Hail Connie, fuck Bob

442
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,660
This girl's got class, a true hard drop

443
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,460
She'll get you on this righteous kick

444
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,180
Get with Connie, do it quick

445
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,940
This girl's the winner in a plane of speech

446
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,580
She's the center of our galaxy

447
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,880
She's the heaven's mutation

448
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,100
Straight from Bob's up radiation

449
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,980

name of the averSON cirno

502
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,140
This

503
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,880
spore penetrates the flesh

504
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,100
and devours the body from

505
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,060
within, turning it into

506
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,980
a human fungus.

507
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,140
I've got images in my brain

508
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,660
I'll never get out!

509
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:47,680
I've got images in my brain

I'll never get out!

The 9000 series

512
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,440
is the most reliable computer

513
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,660
ever made. No 9000

514
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,300
computer has ever made a mistake

515
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,620
or distorted information.

516
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,540
We are all, by any practical definition

517
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,440
of the words, foolproof

518
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,420
and incapable of error.

519
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,200
I will not be

numbered.

523
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,080
Have you ever jacked in?

524
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,820
Have you ever wire tripped?

525
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,280
Brain is gone.

526
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,220

548
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,580
Oh, praise Bob.

549
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,200
And now

550
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,320
for the great

551
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,740
Morning 40 Federation.

552
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,260


553
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,300
All right, boys.

554
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,600
All right, boys.

555
00:27:48,260 --> 00:28:17,780
All right, boys.

556
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:47,980
All right, boys.

557
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,320
All right, boys.

558
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,580
I love you.

559
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,800
Come on, kid.

560
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:02,360
I love you.

561
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,020
I love you, Mom, but I'm a drunk, a drunk.

562
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:14,200
I miss you, Mom, but I'm a drunk, a drunk.

563
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,380
Send money, Mom.

564
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,520
Because I'm a drunk, drunk, drunkie donkey.

565
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,220
I'm sorry, Mama.

566
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,900
I never meant to do you any wrong.

567
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,180
You know it's just sometimes I work so hard.

568
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:58,900
I need a little beer, a little wine, a little hard liquor.

569
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,720
But none of that's important, Mama.

570
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,280
What's important is that I love you.

571
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,840
You love me, too?

572
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,380
I love you, too.

573
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,780
Maybe your papa was the same way.

574
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,860
Oh, Mama, that means so much to me.

575
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,000
I love you so much that I'll never forget you.

576
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,460
Well, I used to do art, but I gave it up.

577
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,280
Because it was too much work.

578
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,240
And it didn't pay.

579
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,520
And it was just a pain in the ass.

580
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,300
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway.

581
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,180
What the fuck?

582
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,520
What the fuck?

583
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,880
What the fuck?

584
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,540
What the fuck?

585
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,260
What the fuck?

586
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:47,880
So now,

587
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,660
I ski and watch TV

588
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:55,180
Cause that's a lot more fun and relaxing

589
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,460
And what I really want to do with my time

590
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,140
Art gets old when no one pays you

591
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,760
Or even understands what's the point

592
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,300
Unless I was gonna do it just for me

593
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,320
But I'd really rather just ski and watch TV

594
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,700
Cause that's a lot more fun for me

595
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,580
And I might as well have fun

596
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,900
Cause that's the life's for, you know

597
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,520
Rap, Rob Agosto, and all that

598
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,900
And I'm alive now

599
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,460
But someday I'll have to die

600
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,700
And then I'll be dead

601
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,280
For a long time

602
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,000
For a long, long time

603
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,860
For a long, long, long, long time

604
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,900
Or fucking forever, in fact

605
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,360
So I might as well ski and watch TV

606
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,300
Now, while I have a chance

607
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,800
Don't have time to waste

608
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,980
An art, and I don't believe in God

609
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,320
I'm not that dumb

610
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,880
So what's art even for

611
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,420
If you don't get paid?

612
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,060
And I'm sick of torturing myself

613
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,500
And of wondering if it's done yet

614
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,760
And I'm sick of hanging out

615
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,120
With all those dumb flakes

616
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,520
That think they're so smart

617
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,440
And I might as well just listen

618
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,600
To the music that I grew up with

619
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,580
That's the only music

620
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,180
That ever really moved me

621
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,600
And who stops just to

622
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:16,940
Say, oh, my friend

623
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,080
It's not real

624
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,760
And now I can get all those old great songs again

625
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,160
On CD

626
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,120
Cause they sound better

627
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,100
And last longer, I think

628
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,940
Oh, I'm so glad to be alive

629
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,560
In this modern age

630
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,860
And that's why I don't want to die

631
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,340
But there's not a whole lot I can do about that now

632
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,400
Except maybe eat more vegetables

633
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,880
And I think I better marry my girlfriend

634
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,580
And I think I better marry my girlfriend

635
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,400
Cause it's such a risk nowadays

636
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,560
Even though I'm not one of those people

637
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,660
And I'm probably safe

638
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,400
But you can never be too sure

639
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,000
And so we can marry

640
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,460
And ski and watch TV

641
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,740
Together and feel free and happy

642
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,480
Without having to worry about art

643
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,880
What a pain

644
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,860
Glad I'm through with all that

645
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,780
And now I've got

646
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,580
All I could really reach for

647
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,200
And I can mastered all the rules

648
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:18,560
And make my friends and everything

649
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:18,560


650
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:18,880
Then I would Approach

651
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:18,880


652
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:18,880


653
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,480
Anyway

654
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,940
Anyway

655
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,760
Anyway

656
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,500
Anyway

657
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,020
Anyway

658
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:25,840
Anyway

659
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,220
What the fuck

660
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,760
What the fuck

661
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,080
What the fuck

662
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,240
What the fuck

663
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,580
What the fuck

664
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,060
What the fuck

665
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,680
What the fuck

666
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,040
Fuck fuck

667
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,900
What the fuck

668
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:49,540
Anyway, anyway, anyway, what the fuck, what the fuck, anyway.

669
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:58,280
Little Theodore from his album Idiots Are Closer to God, truly a subgenius anthem.

670
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:15,900
You can contact Little Theodore at 3277 Raleigh Street, that's R-A-L-E-I-G-H Street, Denver, Colorado, 80212.

Or, littletheodore at yahoo.com.

672
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,580
The Theodore part is spelled with an F.

And for that matter, you can write to Subgenius Foundation for that free information.

676
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:44,460
Post office box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

677
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:53,980
And now, back to the Euclid Tavern in Cleveland, where that devival with Einstein's Secret Orchestra is already in progress.

678
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,260
Now we can get back to what we were talking about.

679
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,760
We started out doing, which is saving souls from themselves.

680
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,820
Yes, friends, we're here to save souls from themselves.

681
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:16,860
To save people from the false slack that they chose by default, just by ignorance.

682
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:24,760
Following the man, just because they didn't recognize the power of their own slack.

683
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,880
And slack.

684
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:37,960
Friends, when you truly take the attitude of slack, you have a power that the Pope of the Vatican would kill for, and has killed for.

685
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,760
The power to fail.

686
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,220
The power to fail, my friends.

687
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,420
If we were geniuses, we'd call it the Church of the Genius.

688
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,840
But this is the kind of church that's a little easier to qualify for.

689
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:58,260
As the great subgenius Pareto, whoever the hell he is.

690
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,000
That's what's said.

691
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:07,620
Give me a fruitful error any time, full of seeds bursting with its own corrections.

692
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,420
You can keep your sterile truth for yourself.

693
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,540
And friends, it's true.

694
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,640
False prophecies abound everywhere.

695
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:24,540
For instance, everybody thought that whoever got the most votes would win.

696
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,960
Prophecy failed.

697
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,640
The ultimate problem we can solve is its riches and turbet

698
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:35,640


699
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:35,640


700
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:35,640


701
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:35,640


702
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:35,640


703
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:35,640


704
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,020
my

705
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,680
It's time for

706
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,160
Mr. Dick Dick Cheney says it's time for lots more nuclear

707
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,940
See who we got on board.

708
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,320
We got Tom Lisa Rice.

709
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,480
She works with Exxon.

710
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,840
We got Chaney, he works with Huffer Pufferbelly and Swank Incorporated.

711
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:59,300
We got Dinshaw and Dimwit, working for the oil companies.

712
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,240
We got oil, nuclear power.

713
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,680
We got the Caesars.

714
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,400
One, two, three, four!

715
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:27,880
The iodine, the one, three, one, has got my thyroid on the run.

716
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,940
And the dracon, it isn't fly.

717
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,820
He's making it hard just to stay alive.

718
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:40,540
But the iodine, the one, three, one, the iodine, the one, three, one,

719
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,320
there's no more running through the middle land.

720
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,740
No more fail-for-loss.

721
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,700
Shake the bloody hand of the poison man.

722
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,460
Shake the bloody hand of the poison man.

723
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
Shake the bloody hand of the poison man.

724
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:04,080
The barium, a two, four, eight, it's made me sterile.

725
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,540
I can't procreate.

726
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:10,460
And the plutonium, one, four, seven, a so-called pro-style.

727
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:18,300
The CLM, the iodine, the one, three, one, the iodine, the one, three, one,

728
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,460
there's no more running through the middle land.

729
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,620
No more fail-for-loss.

730
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,520
Shake the bloody hand of the poison man.

731
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,380
Shake the bloody hand of the poison man.

732
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,140
Shake the bloody hand of the poison man.

733
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:48,880
Take over two million patents that can cause cancer.

734
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,440
Steve Newton.

735
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


736
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


737
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


738
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


739
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


740
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


741
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


742
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


743
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


744
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


745
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


746
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


747
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


748
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


749
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


750
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


751
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


752
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


753
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


754
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


755
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:50,440


756
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:57,460
human lesions, brain tumors, thoracic confusion, loss of republican identity, congregations

757
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:08,520
in the middle east, disconnected rumors, belongs to anything on DNA with a sperm virus, chicken

758
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:14,140
exposure, and what the fuck is the use?

759
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:27,920
The iodine, the 131, has got my thyroid on the run, and the krypton, with it vile, is

760
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,060
making it hard just to stay alive.

761
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:38,400
The iodine, the 131, the iodine, the 131, is still my life.

762
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:57,260
It's no more running through the middle land, no more carefully, shake it for me, I am

763
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:02,660
a little frozen man, shake it for me, I am a little frozen man, shake it baby.

764
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,400
Thank you.

765
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:17,320
Boys and girls gathered here in the name of freedom, I know some of you have hardly reached

766
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,080
your 14th birthday.

767
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:26,060
Some of you are wearing those pearl cockled necklaces given to you by your ancient grandfathers,

768
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:32,880
and we know the nuclear devices you will be carrying into town today will cause you instant

769
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,320
sainthood and martyrdom.

770
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,000
You will be lifted on high.

771
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,580
So there's no reason to cry, children.

772
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,980
Each one of you are a little bum, armed and ready to pop.

773
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,340
It's my baby calling, so I need you here.

774
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:50,980
Ah.

775
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,420
You think we can?

776
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,340
It's a half past four and it's shifting here.

777
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,220
Ah.

778
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,900
So how am I going to fit in here?

779
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,500
I feel like I could pop all night, baby.

780
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,320
I don't know if I can walk to town with this thing.

781
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,600
You're my radar love, hun.

782
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,120
Ugh.

783
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:07,920
Don't know how far away.

784
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,380
The implantation devices make sure that each child walks the straight and narrow path to

785
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,100
his destination.

786
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:20,720
The objective or target as it is known at Control is to make sure that each child removes

787
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,000
itself as it removes the target, so there are no witnesses and no disclaimers allowed

788
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,820
past the curfew now.

789
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:29,860
Bop.

790
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,780
Bop.

791
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,720
Bop.

792
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,040
Bop.

793
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,380
Bop.

794
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:32,540
Bop.

795
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,460
Bop.

796
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:34,460


797
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:35,720
Bop.

798
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,040
Bop.

799
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:36,520
Bop.

800
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:36,600
Bop.

801
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,120
Bop.

802
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:37,860
Damn it.

803
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,560
What do you think Dave about the fact that…

804
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,020
Dammit they're not even going to hide anymore are they?

805
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:45,400
No.

806
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,180
No.

807
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:46,620
No.

808
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,660
They're just right out there.

809
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,740
We're having an oil problem right now.

810
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,780
We're not making enough money to who knows what.

811
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,480
They're just not even going to hide it anymore.

812
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,040
Nope.

813
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:00,860
They're just going to rape everything they can in the four years they have, or

814
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,740
only two really, because they know they're going to lose the senate.

815
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,440
Okay.

816
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:04,440


817
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,160
Oh, Jeb's son will be the next Bush emperor.

818
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,280
And then...

819
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,800
Jeb's son?

820
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,320
You mean the little Puerto Rican kid?

821
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:12,880
Yeah, yeah.

822
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,240
The one granddad called the little brown one?

823
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,640
His father called him the little brown one?

824
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,080
Yeah, George Bush Sr.

825
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,120
Oh, is that the little brown one?

826
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,600
The little brown one, right?

827
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:29,720
Well, I'm glad he's spreading his genes around and kind of like one of the folks now, but...

828
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:30,480
That's good.

829
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,780
You have a brown child.

830
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:32,460
I'm learning.

831
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,500
How did that happen?

832
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:41,780
You know, I realized that I was serious when it sunk in that I really was trying to learn Dutch from that little Berlitz book.

833
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,820
You mean you're saying you're actually thinking of repatriating the feces?

834
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,100
Well, you know, I don't want to be part of the empire.

835
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:49,840
I know what you mean.

836
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,440
I don't want to be on the Death Star.

837
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,060
I know.

838
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:58,260
I grew up believing that America was the rebel forces.

839
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:03,360
And now it's like, well, the rebel forces.

840
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,920
This is the Death Star, man.

841
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,120
Howdy, folks.

842
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,780
Come on down to America, Inc., where you'll be forced to pay for everything.

843
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,100
But it's not.

844
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,480
It's convenient, friends.

845
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,580
Ah, memories.

846
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,920
This is the most convenient.

847
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,500
Ah, memories.

848
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,200
They used to shoot at us.

849
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,500
Now they shoot near us.

850
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,040
Well, I heard about the more friendlier bullets that they're using on the kids these days.

851
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,920
Well, they don't think they were using friendly bullets in Cincinnati.

852
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,400
Coming.

853
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:38,320
I heard they use the little bouncing bullets now.

854
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,420
Not in the West Bank of Gaza, they don't.

855
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,020
No, no.

856
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,280
They're using really lead bullets still.

857
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,520
Yes, they're still using them.

858
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:44,800
And even the Army.

859
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:45,480
What do you think about this?

860
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:53,540
The Army has switched to a bullet that is environmental friendly.

861
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,620
It's some sort of other.

862
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,340
It's not lead.

863
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,880
They did biodegradable bullets.

864
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:58,300
Yeah.

865
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,160
Oh, my God.

866
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,260
The family still has to pay for it.

867
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,420
So that we only kill humans.

868
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,320
Not the earth.

869
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,480
They probably got a big contract.

870
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,100
They probably got a big conservation tax break for that.

871
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:05,840
Yeah.

872
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,360
The idea, of course, being, you know, this is the way.

873
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:10,120
Think of the research that went into that.

874
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:10,440
Gentlemen.

875
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,060
How much money cleaned up for years and years and years.

876
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,700
The world will be a clean war.

877
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:18,500
A war that you and your children can stand to fight.

878
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,120
An effectively deadly bullet.

879
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:20,760
But yet.

880
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,480
You know, somebody had to not repent.

881
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,680
Easy to mop up after.

882
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:31,700
In order for that bullet to be developed, somebody had to not repent or quit their job or slack off.

883
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,340
That's the age correct way of thinking of it.

884
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,760
There was a point where somebody could have repented, quit their job and slack off.

885
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,980
And then somebody else would have had to develop that bullet.

886
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,540
Sign the check and put it in my rectum right here.

887
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,860
But instead, this is, if I don't develop this bullet, somebody else is going to do it.

888
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,780
So I might as well not repent, quit my job or slack off.

889
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,140
I got to tell you guys something.

890
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:52,760
I'll be known as the guy who developed the environmental bullet.

891
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,080
The environmental bullet.

892
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:55,680
Yeah.

893
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,220
You know, the guy in the Doobie Brothers who's supposedly a missile defense expert.

894
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,100
Bend over and spread them, baby.

895
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:02,920
Here comes my.

896
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:03,480
Here comes my.

897
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:03,480


898
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:03,480


899
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:03,480


900
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,200
Environmentally.

901
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:05,860
Cool.

902
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:07,460
Bullet.

903
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,560
Thank God I've been shot.

904
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:18,660
I can almost see the future of America as my life oozes out here on the sidewalk.

905
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,180
Thank God for the safe, clean bullet that just ended me.

906
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,560
Ended you?

907
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,580
Did I?

908
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:26,800
Did you end?

909
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,440
Did I end at that moment?

910
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,200
No.

911
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,140
You know, we have a friend who was in a band who's kind of like.

912
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:32,640
Here's a song.

913
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,240
It's just important.

914
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,800
Hey, why aren't kids like marching and stuff?

915
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,740
Well, for what?

916
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,100
Yeah, they're not shooting them yet.

917
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:40,400
Stop.

918
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,860
Once they start shooting them, they're going to go.

919
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,500
You're thinking of the old America.

920
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:45,320
This is America Incorporated.

921
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:45,720
Right.

922
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,260
You know, we don't actually.

923
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,320
I mean, come on, man.

924
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,080
Do I have to spell it out?

925
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,300
As many of my employers.

926
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,040
Yeah, this song does.

927
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,320
There are no disagreements in corporate America.

928
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,860
Come on now.

929
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,960
Get with the program.

930
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,560
Read from the same page and remember the talking points.

931
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,340
Point number one.

932
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,560
Things are better than they've ever been.

933
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,760
And all the kids know today is they want their job.

934
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,080
Well, that's all there is.

935
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,560
There's the job and endless drudgery.

936
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,780
The life will sort of and the job.

937
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,860
And well, I'm not going to rock the boat.

938
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:22,920
I want the job.

939
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,820
Chaz, you told me you're not only going to rock the boat, that you were going to rock it.

940
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,480
But that boat right into another world.

941
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,660
I mean, I'm just you're getting one to go.

942
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,320
You want to really?

943
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,260
Climb on there and go to a world where people actually think normal or something.

944
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:37,960
I don't know.

945
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,020
Yeah, definitely.

946
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,060
It's becoming very important to get off.

947
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,160
To get off.

948
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,120
To get off.

949
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,540
I mean, very, very, very important now.

950
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,300
Yeah.

951
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,000
I want to get off.

952
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,620
I don't want to.

953
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:52,280
I only hope.

954
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,340
Stick around here.

955
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:54,680
Exactly.

956
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,540
I just did build by a house in Cleveland.

957
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,160
I'm building my own Amsterdam.

958
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,300
Yeah, but you also built yourself a nice canal.

959
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,400
Both in your mind.

960
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:04,940
Do you know?

961
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,260
With the little hair and green thing in the front.

962
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:07,740
You know.

963
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:15,600
I'm also learning foreign languages so that they'll let me go there.

964
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,700
Are you learning Enochian Babylon?

965
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,620
Well, I've been living in my house for five years.

966
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,640
And for five years, I've been installing each day.

967
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,940
I dig out a little area in the foundation area.

968
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,860
Trying to put in another composite rocket motor.

969
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,940
So the house is about two thirds now.

970
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,480
Completely surrounded and strapped with rocket motors.

971
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,860
So in another year or two.

972
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,420
But the timing is so fiendishly important, dude.

973
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,580
So devilishly tricky to get every rocket to go off at once.

974
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,140
What happens if half of them go off and the other half don't?

975
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,660
Oh, you have a kind of...

976
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:52,660
You've got a tilted house, dude.

977
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,240
Really?

978
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,000
The Mish Fire is just going to send that thing...

979
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,040
Might end up in Arkansas.

980
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,240
Well, you would hope it would end up in Arkansas.

981
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,420
Well, I'm not in the middle of Lake Erie.

982
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,140
It doesn't matter.

983
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,340
As long as I reach seven miles per second in any direction,

984
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:07,960
that'll be...

985
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,960
Even down.

986
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,300
I'll be able to get Earth orbit.

987
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,500
Chaz, I'm afraid you don't want to go seven minutes per second in any...

988
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,480
I mean, seven seconds...

989
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,000
You know, that speed in all general directions.

990
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:18,860
Because that would be...

991
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,120
You would be exploding up.

992
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,400
If you were, you know, not ahead of direction.

993
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,300
It can't happen here.

994
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,720
It can't happen here.

995
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,540
I've been checking it out for a while, babe.

996
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,760
I'm telling you, my dear, that it can't happen.

997
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:33,620
Can it happen here?

998
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,740
Can it change, I say?

999
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,280
I've been checking it out.

1000
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,640
Checked it out a couple times.

1001
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,000
Yeah, it's happening here right now.

1002
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,660
And as we watch the sun go down on our democratic freedoms,

1003
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,520
the freedoms that we've taken for granted...

1004
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,840
Oh, no, but we still have all those freedoms.

1005
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,880
They're even more convenient than ever, as long as you...

1006
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,660
As long as you tow...

1007
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,060
The line.

1008
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:00,960
The line.

1009
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,120
...in the back for three or four days...

1010
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:03,120


1011
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:03,120


1012
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,900
until everything's nice and...

1013
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,320
As long as you want what they want,

1014
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,800
you can have anything you want.

1015
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,000
We want what they want.

1016
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,640
But I want what Bob wants.

1017
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,160
I want what we all want.

1018
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:16,520
I want a worldwide cataclysm.

1019
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,880
I want chocolate pudding delivered to me by aliens.

1020
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,320
And I want some female chocolate pudding

1021
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,220
delivered as frequently as possible.

1022
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,060
As the old salivary glands can move.

1023
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:29,400
Sometimes they...

1024
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,260
They don't move.

1025
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:35,220
Of course, that's not the first part of it.

1026
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,640
That's the end of it.

1027
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,620
The first part is much more laconic and obscure.

1028
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:40,500
I mean...

1029
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,420
Well, that's more artistic.

1030
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,920
You know, when you're obscure and hard to understand,

1031
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,460
that's more artful.

1032
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,820
And you know, Dave,

1033
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,980
if we were a little more artful,

1034
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:53,180
we'd probably be getting paid a little better.

1035
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,660
But instead, we're...

1036
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:57,380
You just...

1037
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,220
Low-grade showbiz clowns

1038
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,960
we might as well be the guys that sweep up

1039
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,980
behind the elephants at the circus, you know?

1040
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:05,900
Well, we do that, too.

1041
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,380
The dwarfs with the little pooper scoopers.

1042
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,420
Well, we also do do that.

1043
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:12,000
Yeah.

1044
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,240
I mean, at least I've been going back.

1045
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:14,760
I don't know.

1046
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,560
Some people think they're too good to work.

1047
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,240
But, you know, as long as I'm getting a paycheck,

1048
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,060
I don't mind what tumbles out of there.

1049
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,200
I've seen worse things.

1050
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,880
And I've picked up worse things.

1051
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,420
You've stuck your arm all the way up worse places

1052
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,840
than where that came from.

1053
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,080
Yes, that is true.

1054
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,100
I don't want to go in.

1055
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,040
To the grim details.

1056
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,200
You tried to get your head all the way up into worse places.

1057
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:36,800
But I...

1058
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,860
I was almost a microcephalic baby from that incident.

1059
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:44,780
And I was almost returned to my native home in Canada

1060
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,800
and buried alive there for the whole incident.

1061
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,460
It was just...

1062
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,440
I don't know.

1063
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,580
In London, it struck a compromise.

1064
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,380
That's in England, you know.

1065
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,080
Dodger Stadium, it struck out.

1066
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,240
In Munich...

1067
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,340
It struck first.

1068
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,860
Take it down.

1069
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:13,380
Chaz is trying to bring back the fake rebellion of the 60s,

1070
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,880
which, of course, was actually co-opted from the very beginning.

1071
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:18,640
Okay, you start.

1072
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:22,260
The John Lennon glasses were trademarked

1073
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,740
before John Lennon was even born.

1074
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,760
Well, Jack Kerouac and Cassidy and all those guys...

1075
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,520
It's all planned out ahead of time.

1076
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,160
...were actually mind-controlled.

1077
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,460
For quite some time.

1078
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,520
Yeah, but what good did it do?

1079
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,380
Not a damn thing.

1080
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:36,340
It was early in the morning.

1081
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,620
The energy was so, so weak.

1082
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,800
The poor people below could hardly stand to look up.

1083
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,420
Their necks were craning, but still, it looked like it was...

1084
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,260
Wait.

1085
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:46,280
This is...

1086
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,720
Dave, you're stuck in the 60s, man.

1087
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,580
No, man, I'm not stuck in the...

1088
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,080
Get with it, dude.

1089
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:52,120
It's the 90s.

1090
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:52,620
No, wait.

1091
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:53,560
It's the...

1092
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,540
The aughties or the zeros or the...

1093
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,120
Yeah, it's the new...

1094
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,040
It's the modern age.

1095
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,060
What is that feeling?

1096
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,040
It's contemporary.

1097
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,620
It's new.

1098
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,240
It's now.

1099
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:02,980
It's what I'm talking about.

1100
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:08,520
Your muscles rise up in your neck and the back of your brain tingles like there's a little teeny...

1101
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,920
A chameleon in the back of your neck.

1102
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:16,140
What is that feeling when your shoes drop off as you're walking down the street and they wave goodbye to you?

1103
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,560
What is that feeling?

1104
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,860
What is that feeling?

1105
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,920
And we hope you've enjoyed it half as much...

1106
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,560
What's that blue stain in your undies?

1107
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,440
Are you sure you're all...

1108
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,680
Have you been keeping bad company again?

1109
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,880
Have you been hanging with...

1110
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,980
Those who hang too far.

1111
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,940
Yesterday I bought a new car.

1112
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,300
Today I bought a new horn for it.

1113
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,240
Herb Alpert.

1114
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,900
You know, the sick thing is,

1115
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,580
Rowan and Martin's laugh-in was actually kind of

1116
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,560
the hippest thing going at the time.

1117
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,480
I can hardly afford to buy my groceries.

1118
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,900
Horrible nauseas possessed us in the morning.

1119
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,040
First a chilling feeling that Dean was not going to go on.

1120
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,300
His arms were too scrawny.

1121
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:01,540
His ears were full of grey.

1122
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,980
It's yellow matter.

1123
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,240
Yellow matter's coming out of his ears.

1124
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:10,480
All of a sudden, then...

1125
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,320
I put out all the lights and played Robert Goodman...

1126
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:13,680
No, said Bill.

1127
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,160
I've been standing here for three hours

1128
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,820
with my panties upside down and no one's noticed.

1129
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,380
Dean hopped up about convulsively,

1130
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,880
anxiously pulling on his arms.

1131
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:28,280
And he said,

1132
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,100
It made me wonder if the college boy had thanked him

1133
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,720
or what he was trying to do

1134
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,300
with all the strange, strange radio equipment.

1135
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,200
Oh, actually, it's in Idaho.

1136
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,800
Would you mind saying that again?

1137
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,020
Idaho?

1138
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,780
That's frightfully interesting.

1139
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,640
We pronounce it Ohio.

1140
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,280
Oh, I've always wanted to make a cowboy.

1141
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,800
I mean, meet a cowboy.

1142
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,140
Really?

1143
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,700
Really? I yelled across the river.

1144
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,120
Well, you won't see me too for too...

1145
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,160
Yeah, there was a mist and men are tonight

1146
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,520
and the streetlights didn't come on the freeway

1147
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,260
till Vine Street.

1148
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,460
And me and an old friend were talking about

1149
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,160
Allegheny and pulling boats.

1150
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:05,300
There was people hanging themselves down steps, I guess.

1151
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,200
But mostly good things.

1152
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:08,400
Good things.

1153
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,420
And hello, JD.

1154
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,160
Hello, Robbie.

1155
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,380
Hello, everyone.

1156
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,060
My parents say I don't know what good things fun is.

1157
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,060
And they're right.

1158
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,500
I don't know what good it is.

1159
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,880
The spasms lasted for three and a half hours.

1160
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,160
By the time...

1161
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,880
We got grandmother all quieted down.

1162
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:33,840
She still had somehow gotten it into her brain

1163
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,120
that grandma was going to...

1164
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:35,520
Grandpa.

1165
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:36,180
I'm sorry.

1166
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:36,760
Grandpa was...

1167
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,600
You have the right idea.

1168
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,300
It's just a shame that polygamy never caught on

1169
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,980
among the married people of this country.

1170
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,440
Hey, I...

1171
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,560
I'm not one of polygamies.

1172
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,640
They can't help it if they're not told.

1173
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:57,720
Hey, did you have a joke on Larfin last week

1174
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:58,140
about how...

1175
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:58,200
I'm not a polygamist.

1176
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:58,260
I'm not a polygamist.

1177
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:58,740
You're a soothing pig

1178
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,120
and your nostrils...

1179
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,900
The long arm has gone through

1180
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,880
and brought back

1181
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,760
one that we could slip under the door.

1182
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,580
Oh, I couldn't have said it better myself.

1183
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,720
Hey, how about that?

1184
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,980
Your name's in big lights

1185
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,280
up there on that marquee.

1186
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:14,860
So is mine.

1187
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,120
Yeah.

1188
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,400
Now we had a number of circumcision marks.

1189
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,800
Some of them were covering our heart.

1190
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,440
Other ones were...

1191
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,240
Nearly psychic circumcision marks.

1192
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,480
The kind we young men like to make.

1193
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:27,800
Come on along with us.

1194
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:28,220
Come on along with us.

1195
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:28,220


1196
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:28,220


1197
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:28,220


1198
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:28,240
Come on along with us.

1199
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:28,240


1200
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:28,240


1201
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:28,760
Come on along with us.

1202
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,720
Come on along with us.

1203
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:30,180
Come on along with us.

1204
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:30,180


1205
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:30,180


1206
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:30,180


1207
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:30,180


1208
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:30,180


1209
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:30,180


1210
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:30,180


1211
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,640
Now there are no cues from that bit.

1212
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,520
The marks are purely coincidental

1213
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,320
and I think the problem was

1214
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,460
he might have fallen down

1215
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,120
before he entered the elevator.

1216
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,840
No, no, it's not the same guy.

1217
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,020
This man was confused.

1218
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,800
He was pointing and asking questions

1219
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,760
and I just couldn't answer what...

1220
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,200
I had no idea what he was talking about.

1221
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,740
We really learned the three R's.

1222
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,400
Reading, writing, and rhythm.

1223
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,800
Specifics, barking, and playing

1224
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,540
with ourselves.

1225
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,400
These are the new rules.

1226
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:06,020
This is the new regimen

1227
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,620
for a new human race.

1228
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:09,940
One that will not only conquer the stars

1229
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:11,240
but conquer the bars.

1230
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,620
With the waiting thud of their own furry feet

1231
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,280
they'll smash down every door

1232
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,620
and you'll be behind it.

1233
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,440
Standing there, guarding.

1234
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,740
Standing tall for America.

1235
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,060
That really...

1236
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:27,640
That really moves me, Jay.

1237
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,300
I'm so glad that...

1238
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,500
It's just a tear gas.

1239
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,140
Such a sincere...

1240
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,540
Oh man, it's a tear gas

1241
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:36,700
in the mind control, man.

1242
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,020
I don't know what I'm saying.

1243
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:38,860
I'm crying.

1244
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,440
Oh man, I...

1245
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:42,900
Get it together, man.

1246
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:43,700
It sounds like Mambo music.

1247
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,860
Come on, come on.

1248
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,440
None of this emotional baloney.

1249
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,240
Get it...

1250
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,080
Hey guys, you know I was wondering

1251
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,760
the funny thing about doing

1252
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,600
a late night show like this

1253
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,920
and getting a lot of, you know,

1254
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,200
really out there callers.

1255
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,620
Last night, little Jimmy Spliff

1256
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:01,880
called three times

1257
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,960
and he was, you know,

1258
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,580
doing his own variety of rocket science.

1259
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,820
But here at the, you know,

1260
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:08,740
the Kingdom Dome

1261
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,200
there's a lot of complaints.

1262
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,160
You know, we've had problems before

1263
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,940
but we're gonna hang in there

1264
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:15,860
as long as we can.

1265
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,540
I mean, as far as I'm concerned

1266
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:18,780
the gallows been built

1267
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,800
so let's keep hanging.

1268
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,380
And nobody's gonna talk about your shoes

1269
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,700
or say that, you know,

1270
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,780
you left the show.

1271
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:27,780


1272
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:27,780


1273
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:27,780


1274
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:27,780


1275
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:27,780


1276
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:27,780


1277
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:27,780


1278
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,220
You left the eggs in there too long

1279
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,060
or there's just, you know,

1280
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:31,160
some problem with you.

1281
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,220
You know, everyone's gonna just be cool with that.

1282
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:37,200
Hey, who were you hot for on the Laugh-In,

1283
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,700
Rowan and Martin Laugh-In show?

1284
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,280
I liked Goldie Hawn.

1285
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,580
Chaz.

1286
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,980
Yeah, I figured you'd be the Goldie Hawn.

1287
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:44,280
There was Judy Karn,

1288
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,420
she's a little cute English chick.

1289
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,120
Nah.

1290
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,000
I liked Joanne.

1291
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:50,660
Joanne Worley.

1292
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,440
Me too, man.

1293
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,880
I was really into...

1294
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,900
I understand.

1295
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,020
She was kind of large

1296
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,580
and kind of heavy.

1297
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,500
She was pretty boned

1298
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,020
and loud and obnoxious

1299
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:03,500
but that wide, wide, wide mouth

1300
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,440
just invoked...

1301
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,440
The Queen of Hearts look.

1302
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,820
You like that Queen of Hearts look

1303
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:09,840
off with their heads

1304
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,660
and referring to your structures down there?

1305
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,360
Yeah, I don't know what it is.

1306
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,940
I can't put the two and two together.

1307
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,740
Her laugh was just very infectious.

1308
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,300
There's no doubt about it.

1309
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,600
I wonder where she's at now

1310
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,440
and how large and old...

1311
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,780
I think she's in the old house.

1312
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,340
I think she's at this home

1313
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,980
in Pasadena, California.

1314
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,960
Sitting out in the backyard

1315
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,280
watching the Cupid pee in the pond.

1316
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,180
Yeah, she's had her last turkey sandwich

1317
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:38,320
for today, though.

1318
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,980
She's going back in sight for her meds.

1319
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:45,280
Does that little boy ever finish peeing?

1320
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,060
Does he just pee that forever?

1321
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:47,860
Until next week.

1322
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,160
Hasta la semana próxima.

1323
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,180
Keep your back to the wind.

1324
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,700
Keep your hat tight.

1325
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,900
Keep sat in saddle.

1326
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:01,480
The Rebel Forces,

1327
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:03,400
this is the fucking Death Star, man.
