1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
Because this is a God-sent plan for you.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,820
A plan to help you get out the hole.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,520
A plan to help you overcome the obstacles in your way.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,500
You know you got to have a devil fighter to stay ahead of the devil.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,700
And I'm always working for you to get you ahead.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,760
Praise God.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,800
Now many of you know me.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,800
I'm no stranger to you.

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,380
You know me as a money bag lady.

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,140
And I'll bring you ways that you may be able to receive.

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,900
The subgenius hour of sweat.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,700
I wish she was a money bag lady.

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,780
Oh, I do.

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,760
I only know her as a bag lady.

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,480
Yes, Mother Truth, the bag lady.

16
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,600
Yeah, here we go.

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,040
Dear friends, welcome to the subgenius radio.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,600
Radio ministry hour of slack.

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,360
A psychedelic, a wild, and a flip-flop.

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,840
Yippee-dippee.

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,260
What?

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,620
Live from Hollywood.

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,600
Hollywood?

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,700
Now, now, wait a minute.

25
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,940
Oh, yeah.

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,300
The Gateway Dioxinville subgenius radio ministry.

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,620
The star Dance of the Rising F quadratic?

28
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,100
The

29
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,340
ator.

30
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,020
Fantastic Nuks.

31
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:20,580
And this is the end of the film.

32
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,420
This miracle bath will bring money your way.

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,500
This miracle bath will bring you relief from your problems.

34
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,060
This miracle bath will bring success in your love life.

35
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,740
This miracle bath will bring you relief from the sickness in your body.

36
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,180
This miracle bath will take the confusion away from your mind.

37
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,900
This miracle bath will take the pain out of your heart if you're sick

38
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,040
because your loved one has mistreated you

39
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,320
and just seen you.

40
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,440
This machine will push you aside.

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,840
This miracle bath will help you.

42
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,860
I'm sorry, we're not allowed to receive gratuities

43
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,860
as part of our congressional stipend on the Subgenius Show.

44
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,500
And how peaceful it is.

45
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:04,980
How lovely.

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,580
How impossible to tune in on this antiquated machine.

47
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,020
How far away the bolts are to be sheared.

48
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,720
Yes, for millions of miles.

49
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh, well, we can do Joe Polino when we do that.

50
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,380
Or something like that.

51
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,220
We have horrible tapes of cement mixers being run over 70 miles an hour at Dockstop.

52
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,760
And we have a little bit of a mess.

53
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,140
We're not allowed to use the

54
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,100
We have a little bit of a mess.

55
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,660
Yes, those African bees.

56
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,920
And here they come, flying in formation.

57
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,340
Oh, no, oh, no.

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,960
Get away from me.

59
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,520
Get away from me.

60
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,300
Get them off.

61
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,560
Get them off.

62
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,240
Africanized bees stinging a little Costa Rican man to his just reward in egg heaven.

63
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,120
Well, now, who can say who really deserves a big bee sting?

64
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:51,840
And who doesn't?

65
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,220
Well, we just pretend we can know.

66
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,860
And then the peasants are impressed by this sheer creation.

67
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,600
I think that day is long gone.

68
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,880
The third world has wised up to your trick.

69
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,340
Hey, no.

70
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,040
Come on, caller.

71
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,600
I can still fool with the best of them.

72
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,300
Can I, caller?

73
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,700
Yeah, I don't know if you can fool with the best of them.

74
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,980
Every time I call up, you turn me off the air and the meter keeps running down.

75
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,480
Wait, wait.

76
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,040
I do not.

77
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,960
But I'm going to have to put on the painful headphones because I can't even pick up the caller's sputtering voice.

78
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,720
That caller said I cut him off.

79
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,200
That's silly.

80
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,660
You cut him off at the past.

81
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,260
He called a long time ago.

82
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,560
That's why I cut him off at the past.

83
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,600
Well, he's probably going to call again.

84
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,560
But there's still no future for a caller who won't take the show with a drain of salt.

85
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,340
Pum grano salas, as we used to say at the refractory.

86
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,520
It's hard enough to tune in on this show.

87
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,960
It's full of eccentric sounds, boops, beeps, whistles.

88
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,720
It sounds like a sperm whale in heat at the bottom of a coal mine.

89
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,840
Maybe.

90
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,020
Maybe.

91
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,980
Maybe that's what it is, in fact.

92
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,020
And there's a low level, low frequency hum.

93
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,420
Or, uh.

94
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,140
And I can only.

95
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,200
Oh.

96
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,940
I almost.

97
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,760
I almost lost it there.

98
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,380
Seriously.

99
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,260
One of these days I'm going over the side.

100
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:10,940
Oh.

101
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,920
Yeah, sorry, Hal.

102
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,440
Oh, poor Dr. Hal.

103
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,320
About to go over the side, leaving that show.

104
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,520
You know, this show is composed entirely.

105
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,080
Entirely of other subgenius radio shows.

106
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,500
We got the show from St. Louis, show from Toronto,

107
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,440
the show from Vancouver, a little bit,

108
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,860
the show from Maine,

109
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,700
Portland, Maine.

110
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,600
Hello, dear friends of Portland, Maine.

111
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,380
And of course, the show from Dallas, and the show from Berkeley,

112
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,620
which we can never seem to escape from.

113
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,720
And yes, we did make a lot of money yesterday,

114
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,260
but put it into God, is what we spent money.

115
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:03,260


116
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,360
We'd be worth little more to you every day,

117
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,840
but we're going for other bands.

118
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,520
You love them, don't you?

119
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,640
You either love some or you don't.

120
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,660
Do you love to listen to them?

121
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:12,660


122
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:18,340
Yeah?

123
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,360
Oh, it's okay, George.

124
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,840
George.

125
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,340
George, don't be upset.

126
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,600
I know you're scared.

127
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,860
I know you're all scared.

128
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,780
I know you're bored.

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,720
You'll probably get more bored before this hour's over.

130
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,420
But dear friends, and poor George there, I want you to know there is hope.

131
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:45,240
There is hope from that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

132
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,200
And I have proof of it.

133
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,400
In fact, we got this letter in the mail, dear friends.

134
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,180
I want to share this with you.

135
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,960
This is your preacher, Reverend Ivan Stang.

136
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:02,320
I hope that you're all tuning in as you should be, getting proper reception.

137
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:08,120
We got this letter here from Louisville, Kentucky, addressed to the Crud Foundation.

138
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,420
It has a picture of Bob Dobbs on the back with a Drew scars on his face

139
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,560
and a little thought balloon that says acid coming out of Bob's pipe.

140
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,780
It says Bob Barf.

141
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,520
They don't like Bob, see, friends?

142
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,160
This is the kind of letters we get once a year.

143
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:32,840
Dear Bob, it is obvious you don't know it, so I thought somebody should tell you.

144
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,400
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the only one.

145
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:47,260
He is real, and he made your worthless little body and gives you the breath to breathe every day.

146
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,180
Thank you.

147
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,180


148
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,180


149
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,180


150
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,180


151
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,180


152
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,180


153
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,180


154
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,180


155
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,920
You are a deranged lunatic who will burn in hell.

156
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:03,280
And when you are being tortured in hell, you will remember this letter.

157
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,520
So go boop yourself, Bob.

158
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:18,100
You're, spelled Y-O-U-R, a worthless boop boop who has nothing but boop to say.

159
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:24,480
P.S. I work for the IRS, and I am watching you, and we'll see you soon.

160
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:30,960
And your attorneys won't mean boop when you deal with us.

161
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,300
So face up.

162
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,300
You're boop.

163
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,040
You're, yeah.

164
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,480
I'm bored with that kind of thing, too, dear friends.

165
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,320
You know, God.

166
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,460
Fuck you.

167
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,640
You have, I work for the IRS, and I are watching you.

168
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,960
I hope you're listening.

169
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,680
I hope you're listening.

170
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,360
We got friends in the IRS.

171
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,100
Your boss in the IRS, as a matter of fact.

172
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,160
Your boss in the DEA.

173
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,600
Your boss in the FBI.

174
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,020
Your boss in the CIA.

175
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,900
In the national security.

176
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,980
In the SA.

177
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,400
In everything.

178
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,820
In organizations whose acronyms you never even guessed.

179
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,820
They're all working for Bob.

180
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,160
And there ain't no escape.

181
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,380
None at all, nay.

182
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,120
And, uh, y'all.

183
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,760
That's why we have to deal with the conspiracy.

184
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,820
It goes back to that, that caller.

185
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,060
That if I was able to take control, and I do have control,

186
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,840
but if I was able to present it in the pink world,

187
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,580
then I could, I could bring in this real alternative.

188
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,220
And the way to have an alternative is to change the environment.

189
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,620
One of the ways would be to turn off the electric environment.

190
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,660
Can you imagine doing that?

191
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,620
That'd be one, that's not an alternative idea.

192
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,180
That's an alternative.

193
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,840
That's an alternative percept.

194
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,340
But the pinks are never gonna let you do that.

195
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,840
So, they will let you have all the celebratory retrievals and replays and celebrations of ideas and cultures.

196
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,060
Because they know the medium is the message.

197
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,300
Not the content.

198
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,100
Not the...

199
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,140
The control environment is those of the emperor.

200
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,160
This is his new clothes.

201
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,980
Is that he's just gonna keep it on.

202
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,420
He's not gonna turn it on.

203
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,280
A lot of money could be made.

204
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,560
Yeah.

205
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,460
And he's not even making money.

206
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,340
He doesn't even want that.

207
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,620
Train and you can't sleep at night.

208
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,160
You get up, you look at the moon.

209
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,160


210
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,160


211
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,160


212
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,980
You look out the window.

213
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,200
You walk the floor.

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,020
Nothing seems to go right.

215
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,100
Every little thing you just stay up there.

216
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,400
Praise god.

217
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,460
You write from the mill an1343 right now.

218
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,520
Don't you wait till the morning.

219
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,380
You get up right now and get your pencil and paper.

220
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,400
And write your Mother Truth.

221
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,480

E gusto para ti, AceH Francisöosse one Somebody took my husband and you're some kind.

224
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,860
Uncle Hal is now wrestling with the inner story out there.

225
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,620
Oh, I hear inner story.

226
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,620
I hear slow inner story gas releases.

227
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,920
I was wrestling with the death angel.

228
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,100
He had a hold of my...

229
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,720
The death angel?

230
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,080
Can't breathe.

231
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,700
I'm really blacking out.

232
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,580
Can't take it.

233
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,660
Pull the oxygen button.

234
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,400
Yeah, okay, here.

235
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,260
There on your belly.

236
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:15,980
Show too much.

237
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,920
Can't read.

238
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,720
Uh-oh, can't read show?

239
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:18,840
Tape over.

240
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:18,840


241
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,780
Inner related story.

242
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,320
Tape over.

243
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,960
Tape already flipped over.

244
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,700
Oh, you should have flipped over the tape.

245
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,100
Pushed into a residential...

246
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,900
40 minutes ago.

247
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,500
Oh, yeah, I did.

248
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:26,780
40 minutes ago.

249
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,660
The show was...

250
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,120
Oh, my God.

251
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,120
And there are only six minutes left of the whole show.

252
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,640
Too many aspirations in goal.

253
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,880
It started trying to celebrate Veterans Day.

254
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:42,600
Yeah, we were trying to have a parade, but the show went crazy and out of control like some foreign war.

255
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,860
And we were supposed to visit Rattlesnake Ranch and the thing, can you take it?

256
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,840
And Dinosaur Park.

257
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
I guess I'll have to wait till next week.

258
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,820
And a more organized, more sorrowful show.

259
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,240
Because the military is going to take over the show at this point and organize it along strict principles of chain of command.

260
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:05,160
Here, the show cadets are practicing in their beautiful field blue uniforms while the majorette swirls her flaming baton.

261
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:16,080
The gymnastic troupe spells out the name of Sugar Wesser School in electronically amplified orange letters.

262
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,380
Wee.

263
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:26,200
Yes, in the wee hours of the morning, this parade is one of the principal attractions at the Cow Hollow Cogswallop Festival.

264
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:36,360
Tiny androids and the audience boo their disapproval of the healthy, wholesome, and hideous 4-H club.

265
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,180
But soon, oppressions bear me down to earth.

266
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,640
Nor care I that they rob me of my mirth.

267
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,140
I'm sorry.

268
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,140


269
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,460
You got...

270
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,580
Why?

271
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,280
Yes, it is funny, isn't it, friends?

272
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,000
I'll bet you think it's a joke.

273
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,260
I'll bet you think the church is just one big laugh.

274
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,580
Well, you're probably right.

275
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,140
I mean, I got some proof of that right here, you know?

276
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:13,920
I mean, here we are from an article by Jay Kinney that appeared, oh, in some pink boy book at some point.

277
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,320
Backstage with Bob.

278
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,040
It's 9.30 or so.

279
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,960
Backstage at the...

280
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,980
Stone, a nightclub on Broadway in San Francisco. Guy Deyul, the ex-cattle rancher from Bolivia

281
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,340
with the artificial septum, is fondling an Uzi, the Israeli automatic weapon favored

282
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:33,780
by death squads in Central America. The Uzi, like the ridge between Deyul's nostrils, is

283
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:39,660
plastic. Deyul, who is an imposing 40ish figure in a tan trench coat, looks uncannily like

284
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:45,440
G. Gordon Liddy and has the air of a man who is no stranger to life and death situations.

285
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,280
Deyul is a subgenius.

286
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,060
How can you remember all this? You must be making it up.

287
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,640
No, I'm not.

288
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,100
Well, I embroider a little so that you can see it the way I do.

289
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,460
God help me.

290
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,920
You atheists never stop talking about God.

291
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,840
And you gays never face facts. Fantasies are no escape.

292
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:44,440
If you've got the keys to that door, I will gladly follow. Otherwise, I will escape.

293
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:45,800
Why?

294
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:46,720
Because I bicycle.

295
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:46,720


296
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,940
And that's why feels so wrong!

297
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,460
Just a ax.

298
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:57,080
Get aข, got it from the look of it...

299
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,060
So like're then confident?

300
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,060


301
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,760
Do what I can, but don't do anything.

302
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,140
I should've tried치

303
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,620
...

304
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:10,960
Feels good, I should say.

305
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:10,960


306
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,520
Like I was trying to climb, but I had it.

307
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,020
...

308
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,200
Here?

309
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,200


310
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,920
Here?

311
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:14,920


312
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:14,920


313
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,280
how it will be done. Can you imagine this is what NASA and them are looking for? They're

314
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:25,420
trying to figure out how they can make, you know, a cheap means of a stable environment

315
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:32,580
space. Well, what you do is you send up your little shuttle, and you have an apparatus

316
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:40,360
that will blow up a plastic balloon. All right? Now, as you blow up the plastic balloon, and

317
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:46,360
you can put it in any aesthetic form you want, the various pumps we use today, you blow up this

318
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,700
huge, you know, very strong plastic flexible material. Let's say you make it into a sphere

319
00:15:53,820 --> 00:16:00,340
with a platform. Now, what do you do next? You then reinforce the inside of the plastic balloon

320
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:08,060
that you're going to live inside with liquid, with a spray, which comes from a container

321
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,340
containing liquid concrete.

322
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:17,780
And iron filings. So what you do, you spray that liquid concrete and iron filings on the

323
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:25,200
interior of the balloon. It then solidifies, freezes it, rigidifies it, and then, and you

324
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,600
can have any shape you want, once you've decided the pressure on the balloon. That is what we did.

325
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:40,120
We pumped up the plastic covering, put the spray of the liquid concrete and iron filings on the

326
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,600
interior, solidified it, and then we built, we moved inside, we block it off temporarily,

327
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,200
maintain pressure, then you put your door in, then you go in, and you set up living

328
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,340
quarters. That is how Dobstown was built. This is the first time in history it's ever

329
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:00,160
been explained, and it was done many years ago by us. That's what we use for running

330
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,240
the solar government, and that's what NASA's going to do now that they've heard it here.

331
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:10,060
You've made a prediction about Europe opening up and becoming debt-free.

332
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,600
Democratic. Yeah. Does that mean eventually the Cold War is going to end completely?

333
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:23,900
It's going to, it's ended in the north, but the problem is the Pentagon Bolsheviks still want to

334
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,860
keep fighting, and they're going to go, and they are, and they have been this week, they went south

335
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:34,440
and east in the sense of Middle East. So we now have a new complex zone, the north-south dialogue.

336
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,000
So instead of aiming at Eastern Europe, it's going to be aimed at

337
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,340
the North? Yeah. So instead of aiming at Eastern Europe, it's going to be aimed at the North?

338
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:45,720
The Middle Eastern countries. Yeah, the Third World, Africa, Asia, and Latin America, especially in Latin America for the Bolsheviks,

339
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:54,000
because the good news is that Gorbachev has a heavy chunk of influence in the Far East and the Middle East and Asia, Africa rather,

340
00:17:54,100 --> 00:18:02,380
and if he can keep the edge over the trouble stirred up by the Pentagon Bolsheviks, then we'll just have trouble in Latin America mainly.

341
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:09,720
And we have our job here in Canada and the United States to root out that influence and bring some slack to the Latin Americans.

342
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:17,640
But we don't need to worry about an east-west situation. Actually, I think the Rockefellers are merging with the Russians at this point,

343
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,780
the native Christian Russian faction, just to prop up their own northern empire as it crumbles, you know.

344
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:29,460
So they're forced to align with a more powerful situation in Russia, and therefore they're forced to be peaceful.

345
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:35,540
But they're still going to create problems as after effects down south, so that's our problem right now.

346
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,740
And we're going to have to deal with it.

347
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:52,740


348
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:52,740


349
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,220
It's a big problem.

350
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,240
It's a big problem.

351
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,640
It's a big problem.

352
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,180
It's a big problem.

353
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,580
Out on stage, Janer Hyperkleets is stalking back and forth across the stage,

354
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,700
Out on stage, Janer Hyperkleets is stalking back and forth across the stage, delivering a hell-raising show of the American Revolution.

355
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,540
sermon to an audience of several hundred souls.

356
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,620
Jayner mows lawns for a living in Little Rock, Arkansas, and cuts an odd figure in his garish

357
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,360
orange and green pants, looking like the penultimate hit, Come to the Big City.

358
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:26,080
It is not totally clear just what Jayner is raving about in his Little Rock twang, something

359
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,240
to do with launching the head, golfing, Bob, heaven, and his sex life, or lack thereof.

360
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,380
But what hardly seems to matter is any of this, because Jayner is a subgenius.

361
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,040
There are a number of very important goals to accomplish together in this first lesson.

362
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,720
Our overall goal, of course, is to get you your all-important first job in radio.

363
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,460
I'm sorry, yeah, it's only the staying talking.

364
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,740
I took two stayings yesterday, and I still feel...

365
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,260
Is anybody there?

366
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,600
There?

367
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,160
There?

368
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,640
There?

369
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:55,900


370
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,060
There?

371
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,360
We're going to hook up the echo.

372
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,540
It's just a coffee officer.

373
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,040
Is that caller still there?

374
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,420
There?

375
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:01,680
There?

376
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,320
I don't think he's still on the radio.

377
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,660
The sound effects are getting louder and louder.

378
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,100
They're overwhelming.

379
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:06,700
Everything.

380
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,760
The caller is totally buried under the weekend.

381
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,260
Do you hear anybody?

382
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,860
And the show's only half over.

383
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,000
We're out of jokes.

384
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,400
Yeah, look what happened.

385
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,580
That was the funny half.

386
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,840
The part that comes now is really not funny.

387
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,840
I'm going to tell people how to saw a board in half now.

388
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,720
Speak into rectifier.

389
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,580
Yeah, you're right.

390
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,260
Am I right?

391
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,100
Yeah, you're right.

392
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,940
We're deconstructing the show now.

393
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,000
You know what I'm saying?

394
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:29,420
Yeah.

395
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,300
You know what I'm saying now?

396
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,000
Yeah, okay, I'm right.

397
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,260
Stop this badnage and persiflage with this worthless insult.

398
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,180
And shift to caller B, who is probably fantasy caller,

399
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,580
panting to get on the air.

400
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,400
I think so, huh?

401
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,420
Hello.

402
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,980
You're on the air.

403
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,020
Everything will be in the same package.

404
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,220
All you need to do is just mix it with your bathwater.

405
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,960
Praise God.

406
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,580
Get in and wash your body all over.

407
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:02,360
And give praises to God that he thought about you and your time of need.

408
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,440
For truly, God has thought about you.

409
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,800
Do the best.

410
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,760
Serve a little peace.

411
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,560
Serve a little happiness.

412
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,180
And all you need is a little do.

413
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,260
Praise God.

414
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:22,000
Can you put a little do in your plan to bring a little joy in your life?

415
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:29,080
If you want joy to reach deep down within, I want you to do today.

416
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,680
Get up and do right now.

417
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,540
His lady.

418
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,700
The commission on regulations.

419
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,760
Don't permit me to say boop on the radio.

420
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,140
Okay, we're trying to find intelligence here on the caller.

421
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,260
Unfortunately, this caller turned out to be just a boop.

422
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,120
Hi, Bob.

423
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,740
Hi, George.

424
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,660
Hi, how are you?

425
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,600
George, I saw you over at the labor thing on the west side

426
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,060
with the poster for J.R. Bob Dobbs, vote for everything.

427
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,060
And I'm just happy to see that you're the only candidate of the five

428
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,560
who has gotten behind Bob.

429
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:04,960
I'm the only candidate of the five who has gotten behind Bob

430
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,480
for all the other offices beside mayor.

431
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,860
So I ask everybody in this town who loves slack and who loves Bob

432
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,180
to get behind George Forbes for mayor.

433
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,660
That verifies I've been on the west side.

434
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,500
All right.

435
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,400
Is that Pope Jimbo?

436
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,000
Yes.

437
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:20,460
Yes.

438
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,320
Praise Bob.

439
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,400
All right, Bob.

440
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,080
Hey, congratulations on your induction into the Hall of Fame there.

441
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,640
Yeah, it just goes to prove if you hang around doing anything long enough,

442
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,080
something good will happen to you.

443
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:31,980
Praise Bob.

444
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,720
Thank you, sir.

445
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,520
Praise Bob is right.

446
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,260
Hi, Darryl.

447
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:37,580
This guy, this guy, and then they're all rascals to hell with him.

448
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,600
Every time.

449
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,000
If only he threw somebody on that would be acceptable.

450
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:43,700
Yeah.

451
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,880
Yeah, I'm surprised.

452
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,880
I'm very surprised to see Mike White made it, and it's very interesting.

453
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,340
But there's this guy, Bob Dobbs, I think he'd be a very good writing candidate.

454
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,740
That's the guy with the pipe.

455
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,480
Oh, yeah.

456
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,500
I think, you know, because that would send as good a message

457
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,280
as anything else.

458
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,440
Praise Bob.

459
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,720
Yeah, he's the head of the Church of the Subgenius.

460
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,260
Yeah, you don't happen to be partial to him because your name is Bob.

461
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:12,980
No, no.

462
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,180
No, no, it had nothing to do with that.

463
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,700
Okay, see, I would vote for a Chris and admit it, any Chris there is.

464
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,640
Hey, good talking to you.

465
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,900
Take care, Bob.

466
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,700
Good night.

467
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,700
The party of Bob.

468
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,460
Okay, five minutes till 10 on talking to Robert.

469
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,940
But it will take at least 100 years.

470
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,480
But the science fiction magazines I read were saying we could do this.

471
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:33,480


472
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:33,480


473
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:33,480


474
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:33,480


475
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:33,480


476
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:33,480


477
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:33,480


478
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:33,480


479
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:33,480


480
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,200
We can do it in the 1960s.

481
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,560
Well, it turned out the science fiction magazines were right and my teachers were wrong.

482
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:46,360
And that's when I began to believe more in science fiction than in teachers who hold

483
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,060
their jobs.

484
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,620
Bob, I'm going to take a break for a second.

485
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,580
And when we come back, we're going to discuss where things have been since you worked with

486
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,800
C. Leary on that book.

487
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,020
Is this the time to punch up the channel of your choice?

488
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:03,100
Oh, you're here.

489
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,900
I want the charger card.

490
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,840
Oh, okay.

491
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,500
Where is it?

492
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,800
It's the other room.

493
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,920
Your time is now.

494
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,920
The walk before the walk.

495
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,980
I got it.

496
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,000
Your time is your time is your time.

497
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,940
Is that your daddy's charger card?

498
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,860
Yeah, I found it in his dresser next to his gun and balloon.

499
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,640
Personal weather.

500
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,860
Inside 98.

501
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,500
Outside no.

502
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,080
Delight.

503
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,100
Eye irritation.

504
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,600
Okay, okay, punch it up.

505
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,240
Which one?

506
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:36,660
85.

507
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,360
Okay, here we go.

508
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,960
FM-8, yeah.

509
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,540
Mm-hmm.

510
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,020
There he comes again.

511
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,020
FM-88.

512
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:43,520
Okay.

513
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,100
Well.

514
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,040
Now, hear me say he.

515
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,320
Does that make me, am I, does that make me sexist now?

516
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,500
No, I think most fools are men.

517
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,420
Well, okay.

518
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,760
Well, maybe that's why I just defaulted to the most foolish sex.

519
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,760
Maybe that's why it's so rare to find a good female subgeniity today.

520
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,060
Hey, why don't you, Debra, why don't you put the, our new favorite?

521
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:07,000
I'm going to put the new phone computer on that'll screen out that, the idiots from Colin.

522
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:07,440
Oh.

523
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,000
The ones that don't know how to talk once they make the connection.

524
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,820
You mean the one where I throw the phone out the window?

525
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,860
Yeah, that's the one.

526
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,620
That's the one.

527
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,500
Okay.

528
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,000
You guys.

529
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,840
See, he's getting better.

530
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,820
He only rings once and then he hangs up.

531
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:25,440
Yeah, well, by the way there, Dr. Philo, I noticed you have the magic saxophone of the

532
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,580
gods in your hand.

533
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,920
I couldn't help but notice that.

534
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,040
Yes, I use the saxophone to invoke famous old-time saxophones.

535
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,040


536
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,040


537
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,040


538
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,420
I'm sure you've had some genius radio artists from the past.

539
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,620
Well, I'll tell you what, let's see if it works.

540
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,800
Why don't you do a quick invocation and see if we can bring up the spirit of Ken Nordean.

541
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,500
That might be fun.

542
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,060
Hi, girls.

543
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,360
We will teach you how to announce from written scripts.

544
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,100
We will discuss the most common mistakes in English and how to avoid them.

545
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,960
And we will give you the first of several intensive lessons in the correct pronunciations

546
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,860
of words which are most often mispronounced and which you will often find in the process

547
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,420
of announcing.

548
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,380
Let's begin.

549
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:05,920
Yeah.

550
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:10,960
But before we put your voice to work, do your ah and ah exercises.

551
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,460
Okay.

552
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,580
To relax your voice.

553
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,420
Ah.

554
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,600
Ah.

555
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,240
Ah.

556
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,260
Ah.

557
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,100
Ah.

558
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:19,820
Ah.

559
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:19,860


560
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,200


561
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:20,380


562
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:20,720


563
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:20,720


564
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:20,960


565
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:21,420
Ah.

566
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,620
Ah.

567
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:23,620


568
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:23,620


569
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,260
Ah.

570
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:24,260


571
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,480
Ah.

572
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,160
Ah.

573
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,840
Ah.

574
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:48,720
Ah.

575
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,360
Ah.

576
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,300
Ah.

577
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,360
Ah.

578
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:53,880
Ah.

579
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,100
Ah.

580
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:54,620
Ah.

581
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,080


582
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,080


583
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,080


584
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,080


585
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,080


586
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,080


587
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,080


588
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,080


589
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,080


590
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,080


591
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,080


592
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,120
Ah.

593
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,120


594
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,120


595
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,120


596
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:55,120


597
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,420
Minus the twouß.

598
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,860
All good!

599
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,840
Yes!

600
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,260
Ooh, that's lovely.

601
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,920
Kind of gets you right here.

602
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,320
I bet you could get a grant from the Arts Council for that.

603
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,440
Not only that, but, you know, I think it's actually liable to work.

604
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,000
Speaking of dreams, I had one just the other night.

605
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,260
Seems I had only just put on my pajamas and settled off into slumber

606
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,800
when suddenly I woke up naked and shivering.

607
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,420
Where are my pajamas, I thought.

608
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,060
I looked around where I was in my dream

609
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:52,060
and I saw I was on an asteroid covered with snow.

610
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,120
And I was cold, floating out in the middle of nowhere in outer space

611
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,420
on this asteroid.

612
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,200
Just then, a clown walked up to me

613
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,120
wearing my pajamas.

614
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,040
Hey, get back my pajamas!

615
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,040
I cried.

616
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,600
The clown just smiled enigmatically

617
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,960
and squeezed his nose with a musical toot.

618
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,000
He turned then and pointed to a valley off in the distance

619
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,620
amongst the snow-covered hills,

620
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,600
gesturing that I follow him.

621
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,860
Having nothing better to do,

622
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,620
I trotted along beside him,

623
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,460
trying in vain to make small talk with him

624
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,480
in hopes that I might cajole him into surrendering my pajamas.

625
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,920
But my words seemed to have little effect on the clown.

626
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,180
And as we got closer to the point,

627
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,000
I began to see that it was filled with people.

628
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,180
And they were all wearing identical outfits.

629
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,880
In fact, they were all wearing my pajamas.

630
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,120
And the clown gestured me into the crowd

631
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,000
and I saw that all the people not only wore my pajamas,

632
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,320
but bore the face of the clown as well.

633
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,880
They fell silent.

634
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,020
And first one, and then a few others began to giggle.

635
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,180
And then a few others began to giggle.

636
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:02,440
And then a few others began to giggle.

637
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:02,440


638
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,060
To laughter until everybody,

639
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,880
all the clowns were becoming hysterical,

640
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,240
rolling on the ground and laughing and pointing at me.

641
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,280
I was so ashamed and embarrassed.

642
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,000
And I tried in vain to cover my nakedness.

643
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,640
And then, and then their leader,

644
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,160
the clown that had led me there,

645
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,940
sidled up to me and whispered,

646
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,080
Don't you understand?

647
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,140
The joke is on you, but it's for you as well.

648
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,180
That is madness.

649
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,220
That is madness.

650
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,080
I exclaimed, said the clown.

651
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,700
And then, and then I understood.

652
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,320
And I began to laugh too.

653
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,880
Because when you're mad,

654
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,400
I mean, when you're completely mad,

655
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,220
the world is just as stupid and frightening as it always was.

656
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,180
But you can twist yourself around it

657
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,820
like a snake around the wildly spinning barbecue.

658
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,280
That doesn't matter anymore.

659
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,920
I mean, really, it doesn't matter anymore.

660
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,760
And you know something else?

661
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,480
I never did.

662
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,440
Get like a dog.

663
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,500
Ha ha ha ha.

664
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,680
This is a great call in the US.

665
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:16,460
Okay.

666
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,020
Table one day.

667
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:18,740
Next two.

668
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,060
And you are listening to

669
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,800
the subgenius radio ministry

670
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,140
hour of slack.

671
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,900
Here on KNON 89.3 FM in Dallas, Texas.

672
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,500
Welcome to channel 85.

673
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,660
Nice to have you in our little net.

674
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,620
Oh, that's K-N-O-N 89.3 FM in Dallas, Texas.

675
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,180
Thank you.

676
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,080
In unwatched programming,

677
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:49,840
co-owner and co-partner with my co-operator, Clark Cable.

678
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,040
The peengland sonar is now fully operational.

679
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,420
And Commander Atwood is turning the dial up to all engines ahead.

680
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,920
Well, see, what happens, actually,

681
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,080
is you stick the caller's brain here in the cappuccino machine

682
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,480
and it foams up the left side of the brain.

683
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,360
My God, a new source of power.

684
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,780
Now we're separating the left and right side of the brain here.

685
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,140
This is what we call the back side of the brain.

686
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,200
That's right, the fork goes on the left side of the brain

687
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,880
while the spoon and the knife go on the right side of the brain.

688
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,020
This here is the back side of the brain,

689
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,060
the buttocks of the brain,

690
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,640
and the behind the elopes here.

691
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,020
You're not...

692
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,180
Notice this cleavage on the rear end of the brain.

693
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,760
Now this is what we call...

694
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,120
I don't want to see...

695
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,800
I saw this.

696
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,140
It's like this health movie.

697
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,240
It goes on and on about the hindbrain.

698
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,300
Smith did it.

699
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,160
Your hindbrain is the...

700
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,460
He makes us watch it because he animates it.

701
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,920
Oh, Smith already did it, huh?

702
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,680
All right, well, I'm going to try to tell people about the wonderful...

703
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,580
Hey, wait, I didn't want to go to church.

704
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,880
...hypocritical campus and the...

705
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,700
Oh, yeah, that's the best part of the brain there is.

706
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,320
Okay, here we go.

707
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,940
Is the show brain.

708
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,500
Then the thalamus or...

709
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,440
Or the 848.

710
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,560
That's right, and this show uses multi-optic...

711
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,000
Multi-mode optical fiber.

712
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,560
...the tinnium or aura complex.

713
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,640
The rhombus...

714
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,180
8484425, wake up and dial this number.

715
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:00,940
It's a record jack.

716
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:05,040
It's about to fall over and do terrible damage to the rare ukabalabonga chorus record.

717
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,180
Check the meter here.

718
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,140
Okay, Palmer, I know you feel funny.

719
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,240
Oh, look at it.

720
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,140
It's opening, erupting.

721
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,620
If that thing gets near the ship, it's going to rupture the skin.

722
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,480
Put on your helmet, quick.

723
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,500
Wait a minute.

724
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,660
Are we allowed to do the tapping?

725
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,920
Aren't there cannons in the Church of the...

726
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,580
The subteam just says we are supposed to be miserable and take the KPSA elevator up to the...

727
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,600
Out here in space, we can do what we want.

728
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,120
Oh, okay.

729
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,660
We're free of gravity and Earth's primitive rules and regulations.

730
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:35,960
Primitive.

731
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,440
Here, out in space, without any censorship at all, we are perfectly free to say...

732
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:41,960
And...

733
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,520
We can even...

734
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:47,980
Say it loud.

735
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:48,840
Earwax.

736
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,200
Just small, quiet...

737
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,060
Hey, they didn't answer that one.

738
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,020
I think it broke training.

739
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,620
Using the AFBMBs...

740
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,660
How about...

741
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,120
Let's go surfing after the show.

742
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,320
Let's go surfing now.

743
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,380
Oh, they let that one by, too.

744
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,220
What about true history?

745
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,540
Belly button lint.

746
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,120
Yeah, they let that one by, too.

747
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:04,800
Wow.

748
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,760
How about...

749
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,320
This guy's can say anything.

750
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,780
A to N shirt loop.

751
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,720
You know, it's funny.

752
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,300
I didn't even think they would censor...

753
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,100
8484...

754
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,220
I'm sorry, dear friends.

755
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,580
I'm sorry about what happened.

756
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,300
No, dear friends.

757
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,580
But the best estimates of subgenius membership...

758
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,040
Well, they're...

759
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,400
A little questionable.

760
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,560
They're thought to be maybe about the same size as the forces of Lyndon LaRouche,

761
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,900
but we have more slack.

762
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,420
Still, we're a decentralized phenomenon,

763
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,000
as police departments around the country have learned.

764
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,240
The threat that the average subgenius represents

765
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,060
is the danger of the lone berserker run amok,

766
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,400
not the threat of lockstep fascism.

767
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,560
Subgenii are not interested in selling you flowers at airports.

768
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,020
No, that's not our style.

769
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,780
We're far more likely to sidle up to you in a public laboratory

770
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,120
and urinate on your shoes.

771
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,900
Let's continue with Bob...

772
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,420
Robert Anton Wilson,

773
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,540
who's going to be talking with Dr. Leary tomorrow night

774
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,300
about the inner frontier of the mind.

775
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,460
Anything else that you wanted to add

776
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,920
before we go ahead to our next caller, Bob?

777
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,980
I'll take the next caller.

778
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,840
Okay, let's go ahead.

779
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,460
At 578-1300.

780
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,220
Hi, what's your name?

781
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,580
Hi, yeah, my name's Arthur.

782
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,120
Arthur, you're on.

783
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,800
Yeah, I was talking to a fellow over at the Bargain Spider

784
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,440
over at the Case Western Reserve,

785
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,200
a university.

786
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,200
Mm-hmm.

787
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,560
So, anyway,

788
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,820
he's telling me that this Mr. Wilson

789
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,560
is into this J.R. Bob Dobbs guy.

790
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,900
And I heard this guy earlier

791
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,560
call and talk about him.

792
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,220
Uh-huh.

793
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,840
You want to know more about him?

794
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,040
I'd like to know what he had to do with Bob

795
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,280
and what Bob was all about.

796
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,040
Okay, well, J.R.?

797
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,160
J.R.

798
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,840
J.R.

799
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,020
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

800
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,420
He's the saint of sales.

801
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,520
Okay.

802
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,380
He's the founder of the Church of the Subgenius,

803
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,720
the first industrial age revolution,

804
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,280
the first industrial age religion, I mean to say.

805
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,560
The Church of the Subgenius is based on the teaching

806
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,460
that L. Ron Hubbard taught Bob on an elevator

807
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,600
when they were stuck on a stalled elevator

808
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,220
in Palm Beach in 1957.

809
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,080
It's the secret of power,

810
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,300
which is, you know how dumb the average guy is?

811
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,560
Mm-hmm.

812
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,200
Well, mathematically, by definition,

813
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,560
half of them are even dumb.

814
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,140
There's no one dumber than that.

815
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,860
Heavy thought, but very real.

816
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,640
If the average guy is right in the middle,

817
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,940
median, is that?

818
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,240
That's right, yeah.

819
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,460
Then half have to be dumber.

820
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,800
The other half, of course, conversely, have to be smart.

821
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,860
Yes, but they don't join things like Scientology

822
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,100
or the Church of the Subgenius.

823
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,820
I'm a pope in the Church of the Subgenius.

824
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,300
There you go.

825
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,360
See, they start their own.

826
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,980
Where's your yarmulke if you're such a pope?

827
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,880
Anyway, you know, the little white skull cap?

828
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,500
You know, he's...

829
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,020
He's not only bishop of Rome,

830
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,360
but he's also the rabbi of Rome.

831
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,860
Well, he does wear a yarmulke.

832
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,600
Yeah, he sure does, and that's what it's about.

833
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,420
This Martin guy wasn't lying to me then.

834
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,120
Arthur, he told you true.

835
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,160
All right.

836
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:08,960
All right.

837
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:09,620
Okay.

838
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
All right, thank you, friend.

839
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,820
Okay, you gonna pop around tomorrow night to the Civic, maybe?

840
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,340
Yeah, I already got my ticket.

841
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,700
Oh, you'll check it out, huh?

842
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:16,860
Yeah.

843
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,200
Very good.

844
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,680
Okay.

845
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,500
What's happening is this.

846
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:19,900
Yeah.

847
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,240
Proceed.

848
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:21,960
Hello?

849
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:22,540
Hello.

850
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,540
Yeah, yeah, you talk about eccentric.

851
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,740
You got subgeniuses listening to you.

852
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,120
Ah.

853
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,480
I mean, how eccentric can you get?

854
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,480
Are you a subgenius?

855
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,100
Yes, I am.

856
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:31,720
Oh, very, very good.

857
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,640
I'm the pope of all Cleveland.

858
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,860
Very good, very good.

859
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:34,660
Yeah.

860
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,680
I'm a big fan.

861
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:41,040
Well, I've got your tape from when you were talking to Stangdown in Texas.

862
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:41,780
Oh, yeah.

863
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,060
And, yeah, great tape.

864
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,220
I listen to it occasionally.

865
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:51,700
So is subgenius a church disguised as a joke or a joke disguised as a church?

866
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,000
Either way you want it.

867
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,280
Actually, if you ever, and I'm not pushing the book, I'm not selling it or anything,

868
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,260
but the book of the subgenius, I don't know if you've seen it, but...

869
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:02,940
Of course I have.

870
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,460
Okay.

871
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,660
I should have known better, of course.

872
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,700
If you get past it, past some of the big cartoons and things,

873
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,080
you see a lot of things in there that make you think.

874
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,580
And it's pretty deep, really.

875
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,400
Yeah, I agree.

876
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,640
I shouldn't really be telling this over the air.

877
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,700
Well, why not?

878
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,080
I'm taking a chance at the Stark Fistle.

879
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,080
Remove me.

880
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:23,940
Ah.

881
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:24,880
Danger.

882
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,360
I know, there's a lot of, I should explain for our audience,

883
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,340
there's a lot of inside stuff here.

884
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,900
The subgenius is either a, as you heard,

885
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,360
either a religion disguised as a joke or a joke disguised as a religion,

886
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,320
and no one is sure which, including probably the people who...

887
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:43,680
Bob!

888
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,060
...who thunked it up.

889
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,560
Director of washed and unwatched programming,

890
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:52,340
and co-owner and co-partner with my co-operator, Clark Cable.

891
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,380
Look great in here.

892
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,640
Why don't you switch the board to self-control, Clark, and come on camera?

893
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,300
Sure.

894
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,560
He's coming in right now.

895
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,400
Hello, subscribers.

896
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,800
I'm the reproducer here at 85.

897
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:13,040
It's my job to keep things looking real.

898
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,920
Even if we are on tape.

899
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,360
Even if we are on tape.

900
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,320
Are we?

901
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,480
I don't know.

902
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,600
If I was at home watching, I could tell you, Fred.

903
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,940
Well, you can bet your card you won't regress.

904
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,360
Just get the charge you're getting for 85.

905
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,900
The best in our style of local programming.

906
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,280
Yeah, sure.

907
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,960
May 1st, 1985.

908
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,840
I've decided to turn over a new leaf.

909
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,400
No more booze.

910
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,520
No more drugs.

911
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,700
No more cigarettes.

912
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,400
50 push-ups.

913
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,620
50 sit-ups.

914
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,640
50 squat thrusts every day.

915
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,260
I'm gonna be somebody.

916
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,220
I'm gonna do something big.

917
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,200
I'm sick of being a nothing.

918
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,240
Watching people look through me like a dirty pane of glass.

919
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,220
I'm gonna be famous.

920
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,720
Just like those people on radio and TV.

921
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,340
I'll be famous if it kills me.

922
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,860
May 4th.

923
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,180
I've been real busy with my training.

924
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:23,920
May 5th.

925
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:23,920


926
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:23,920


927
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:23,920


928
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:23,920


929
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:23,920


930
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:23,920


931
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,560
Not just physical training, but mental training, too.

932
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,700
Now I can concentrate.

933
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,260
I concentrate so hard, sometimes my head hurts.

934
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,180
I pretend I have a red dot on my forehead,

935
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,300
just like those Bhagwans from India.

936
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,380
I concentrate on hours, but nothing but that red dot on my forehead.

937
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,860
I can feel my brain move forward against the red dot,

938
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:48,360
pushing, pulsing, rubbing against the inside of my skull.

939
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,580
It feels like it's gonna explode.

940
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,100
It wants out.

941
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,120
May 6th.

942
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,380
May 7th.

943
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:53,460


944
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:53,480
May 9th.

945
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:53,480


946
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:53,480


947
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:53,480


948
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:53,480


949
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:53,520
May 13th.

950
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:53,520


951
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:53,520


952
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:53,520


953
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:53,520


954
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:53,520


955
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:53,520


956
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:53,520


957
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:53,520


958
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,520
May 18th.

959
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,440
May 20th.

960
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,440


961
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,440


962
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,440


963
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,440


964
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,440


965
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,440


966
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,440


967
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,440


968
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,340
My butthole is in so much pain I feel I feel I want to cry.

969
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,680
May 31st.

970
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,900
May 31st.

971
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,800
May 31st.

972
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,220
May 31st.

973
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,380
May 31st.

974
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,160
Why did a delivery person buy me an acting service when there's cette?

975
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,320
We own this dress.

976
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,320


977
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,320


978
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,320


979
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,640
Considering now is not the time to pay,

980
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,420
but there's going to

981
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:13,740
go up to make a better

982
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,040
difference.

983
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:14,780
It's just akas felt like a kind, because they'reiterally, that soft.

984
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,540
The intra disturbance tends to對 М.

985
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:23,840
May 6th, I saw a movie on TV where this guy gets his brains blown out with a gun.

986
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:31,160
The backside of his head was missing, but the front only had a small hole, a red dot, just like mine.

987
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,380
May 7th, I pawned my TV set and got a good deal on a gun, like the one in the movie.

988
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:43,380
I could only afford six bullets, but one is all I really need.

989
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,440
The red dot is getting bigger.

990
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:52,400
May 8th, I only have my gun and my transistor radio to keep me company.

991
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,020
Whenever I go outside, I hear the neighbors whisper.

992
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:01,240
I can't hear what they're saying, but I still hear their whispers, even in the night.

993
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:10,120
I try to stop breathing, to stop my heartbeat, and yet, no matter how quiet I become, I cannot make out what the whispers say.

994
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,360
What are they trying to tell me?

995
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,520
May 9th, the red dot has grown stronger.

996
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,120
I'm so big, I dare not leave my apartment during daylight hours.

997
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,620
Today, a policeman stopped me and asked if I was all right.

998
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,660
Of course I'm all right.

999
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,000
The problem is with everybody else.

1000
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,280
If only they could see with my third eye.

1001
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,360
May 10th, even at night, it is unsafe to leave my apartment.

1002
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:44,060
Tonight, I looked up and discovered the entire sky was full of shining eyes looking down at me.

1003
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,280
I can't stand it, all those eyes.

1004
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,280
I want to gouge them out, but it would take light years to reach them.

1005
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,020
May 11th, I listen to the radio a lot.

1006
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,240
They cut off the power, but I still got batteries.

1007
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,280
They haven't gotten my phone yet, so I can make requests for special songs.

1008
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,620
Sometimes they even dedicate them.

1009
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,740
I tell them to dedicate all music to William.

1010
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,500
That's the name of my gun.

1011
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,600
May 12th, I fell asleep to the radio,

1012
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,720
and woke up with a voice in my brain.

1013
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,100
This wasn't a whisper, but an anti-whisper.

1014
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,720
A voice so loud, I couldn't help but obey it.

1015
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,120
It told me to wake up, that all America had slept too long.

1016
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,420
I did, and the voice kept talking to me.

1017
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,860
He said his name was Prell, Alan Prell.

1018
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,800
He told me to call a number and I did, and he spoke with me on the phone.

1019
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,080
He asked me what I thought we should do about all the crime in the streets.

1020
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,100
And I said we should shoot them all.

1021
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,540
He said he liked me. I like him too.

1022
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,740
I hope he talks to me again.

1023
00:42:54,360 --> 00:43:00,180
May 13th, once more, I went to sleep to the radio, but Prell didn't speak to me.

1024
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,840
I waited and I waited, but he wouldn't speak to me.

1025
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:09,500
I called the phone number, but the lady said he wouldn't speak to anyone for another six days.

1026
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,480
I have six bullets. Isn't that a coincidence?

1027
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,500
May 14th, the red dot has nearly covered my forehead.

1028
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,660
I can't go outside anymore, not even with the hat.

1029
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:28,080
My peanut butter and crackers are getting pretty low, but I still have plenty of Twinkies.

1030
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,680
When I tried to call Prell, I discovered they had cut off my phone.

1031
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,660
I wonder if he had anything to do with it.

1032
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,960
May 15th, I'm out of peanut butter and crackers now.

1033
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,340
From here on out, it's just me and the Twinkies.

1034
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:48,300
The landlord came by and told me to pay or move out.

1035
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,200
I showed him William, and he went away.

1036
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,840
The red dot is so big now, I think it reaches into my brain.

1037
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,440
I may no longer be the boss.

1038
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:08,980
May 16th, the police came to kick me out, but I saw them coming, and climbed out the fire escape with William and my radio.

1039
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,660
Found an empty shed up on the roof.

1040
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,140
Look at me, Ma.

1041
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,260
I'm on the top of the world.

1042
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:22,400
May 17th, looking down at the streets from up here has improved my perspective.

1043
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,080
Everyone looks like a bunch of ants.

1044
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:30,080
If I had a big enough magnifying glass, I could just burn them all up.

1045
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,280
But unfortunately, there's no sun during the night, and that's when most of the scum comes out.

1046
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:43,000
The pushers, the pimps, the junkies, the living slime that evolved from out of the gutter.

1047
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,080
I'm too good for this town.

1048
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,220
I'd be wasting my talents wasting this scum.

1049
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,900
What I need is a big time scum.

1050
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,740
Somebody worth wasting.

1051
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,960
May 18th, it rained today, and the shed roof leaked.

1052
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,120
I had to spend most of my time keeping William dry.

1053
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:09,820
I could see all the ants below running around trying to keep their dirt from getting rinsed off.

1054
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:15,260
One day, a real rain will come and wash all this scum away.

1055
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,400
And I'll say, I told you so.

1056
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,920
May 19th, at last, Perel spoke to me again.

1057
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,960
But this time, I had to go to a pay phone to call him on the air.

1058
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,180
I told him I was running out of money calling him.

1059
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,620
He called me a communist and hung up.

1060
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,660
I called again, and he hung up on me again.

1061
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,920
He thinks he's such a big shot.

1062
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,180
I'll show him who's a big shot.

1063
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,200
Right, William?

1064
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,660
May 20th, I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it any longer.

1065
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:59,580
May 21st, I hear the voice consistently taunting me, teasing me, daring me to shut it up.

1066
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,560
There's no way to be certain just when the decision was made.

1067
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,620
Perhaps it was made a million years ago.

1068
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,720
Only one thing is certain.

1069
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,680
I must kill Alan Prowl.

1070
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,760
May 22nd, today is just like yesterday, only more so.

1071
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,960
May 23rd, now that I know my purpose, it'll be easier to go about my mission.

1072
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,560
First, I'll give him one more warning, one last chance to redeem himself.

1073
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,780
Then, I will pounce.

1074
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:40,220
I will blow him away on the air for all the world to hear.

1075
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:45,240
I know this is the only thing that I can do that everyone will appreciate.

1076
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:51,060
I will be remembered for my poor but earnest contribution to mankind.

1077
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,300
May 24th, I have no mirror.

1078
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,320
I can't see the red dot, but I know it's there.

1079
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,520
It hurts more and more.

1080
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,320
May 25th, I confiscated some money from a mugger.

1081
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,480
It's not the same as stealing, since he stole it from someone else.

1082
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:17,080
I probably should have executed the bastard, but I don't want to waste my bullets.

1083
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,260
I'm saving them for Prowl.

1084
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,160
And I'm saving my money to call him up, too.

1085
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,020
I want to give him one last warning.

1086
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:32,040
May 26th, at last, I got my chance to call up Prowl on the air.

1087
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,080
And I gave him his final warning.

1088
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,560
The poor, unsuspecting fool.

1089
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,240
I told him I was going to take him out, and he thought I meant lunch.

1090
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:46,420
If he only realized how close his impending doom really is.

1091
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,880
The other callers hate him, too.

1092
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:52,280
There's not a jury in the land that would convict me.

1093
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,260
I'll be a national hero.

1094
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,580
Prowl's days are numbered.

1095
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,860
Only six more to go.

1096
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:02,220
May 27th.

1097
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,180
It's Memorial Day today.

1098
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,120
I put a towel on my head and went to the local cemetery.

1099
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,660
I grabbed some flowers and looked all over the place for an appropriate place to plant them.

1100
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:17,600
Why can't they ever organize those places in alphabetical order?

1101
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,320
Finally, I found it.

1102
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,300
The Prowl family crypt.

1103
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,220
The flowers were already wilting by the time I left.

1104
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,340
Only five more days.

1105
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,740
May 28th.

1106
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,240
There's a war going on in my mind.

1107
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,040
A war between the whispers and the voice.

1108
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,700
The voice yells,

1109
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,080
Kill Prowl!

1110
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,340
Kill Prowl!

1111
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,680
Kill Prowl!

1112
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,740
I still can't hear what the whispers are saying.

1113
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,100
I guess the yeas have it.

1114
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,440
Four more days.

1115
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,700
May 29th.

1116
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:57,700
I called the number again and got the address to the station where Prowl works.

1117
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,840
It was so close.

1118
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:58,840


1119
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,220
It was so easy.

1120
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:02,100
I told them I had a special delivery.

1121
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,740
Do I ever.

1122
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,500
Three more days.

1123
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,040
May 30th.

1124
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,180
Last night I had a dream.

1125
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:15,660
I dreamed I was a radio talk show host and somebody came to shoot me.

1126
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:22,500
Then, when I was dead, the police caught the guy, tossed him into prison and threw away the key.

1127
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,820
In a few years, everyone forgot about the murder.

1128
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,640
And the fellow in prison that committed the murder.

1129
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,640
There's a moral to all this.

1130
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:32,960
Dreams are stupid.

1131
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,400
Who needs them?

1132
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:36,940
May 31st.

1133
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,100
Hey Prowl.

1134
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,720
You talking to me?

1135
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,640
You talking to me?

1136
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,540
There's no one else here.

1137
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,140
What's that, William?

1138
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,780
He's talking to you?

1139
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:51,120
One more day, Prowl, and you'll be talking to both of us.

1140
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,760
June 1st.

1141
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,720
I woke up today.

1142
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,320
And discovered my headache was gone.

1143
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,200
And the red dot was completely healed.

1144
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,160
No more voices.

1145
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:04,920
No more whispers.

1146
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,540
No nothing.

1147
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,860
I feel like a new man.

1148
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,700
I've decided to leave this town.

1149
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,140
Find a job.

1150
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,200
Start a whole new life.

1151
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,200
After I finish off Prowl!

1152
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:39,840
HELLO!

1153
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:46,520
It's just a plain pịt

1154
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,500
I've no money.

1155
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:47,500


1156
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:47,900
And I got it so bad.

1157
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:47,900


1158
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:54,260
And it's going to be a very Women Techniques 굉장히 key condition,

1159
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:54,580
I have to say.

1160
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,700
All right, Jack.

1161
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,240
What is this?

1162
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,140
Oh!

1163
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,080
Oh!

1164
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:01,560
Oh!

1165
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:16,800
Well, there you have it.

1166
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,980
The warped, twisted, murderous diary of a madman.

1167
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:24,620
Recreated and dramatized from the original manuscripts.

1168
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:28,300
As it was found amongst the smoldering ashes of the Assassin's Department.

1169
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,420
The journal was protected in a fireproof strongbox.

1170
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:35,400
Yet all other remains were rendered unrecognizable by the blaze.

1171
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:36,660
Who knows?

1172
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,700
The cold-blooded killer may still be at large.

1173
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:46,180
I commissioned this tape at great emotional cost to me and the rest of the Prell clan.

1174
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,940
It reopened many wounds that can never heal.

1175
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,140
And yet, I felt it was necessary to warn you, the listener.

1176
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,600
Of the constant danger.

1177
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:58,320
Of the constant danger we, the proponents of free speech, face on a daily basis.

1178
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:03,580
My dearly beloved son, Alan Prell Jr., has already paid the ultimate price in blood.

1179
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:09,060
That dark day, June 2nd, 1985, is a day that shall live in infamy.

1180
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,620
Lest we forget.

1181
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,300
Alas.

1182
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,960
One day you may turn on the radio to discover me missing.

1183
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,060
How I shall be silenced is unknown.

1184
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,080
Be it by bullet, stroke, or the stroke of a pen.

1185
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,540
There is no way.

1186
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:24,600
There is no way.

1187
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,420
There is no way to predict how the enemies of democracy will attack.

1188
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,500
But attack they most certainly will.

1189
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,100
And the only one question remains.

1190
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:38,380
And that is, will you, my fellow American, respond to the call to arms?

1191
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,640
Will you prevent the flag of freedom from falling?

1192
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,740
If so, speak now or forever hold your peace.

1193
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:49,700
Because you're going to need that peace to protect yourself from those out to shut you up.

1194
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,920
Take it from me, Alan Prell Sr.

1195
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,720
I learned the hard way.

1196
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,720
Through the sacrifice of my firstborn.

1197
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,140
Alan Jr.

1198
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,580
1946 to 1985.

1199
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,100
I cannot go on.

1200
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,080
But fortunately, fortunately we're about out of time.

1201
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:14,400
So until next week, this is Papa Prell saying so long till next time again and God bless.

1202
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,360
And God bless you too, Alan.

1203
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,060
We know you're up there somewhere.

1204
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,480
And we'll keep carrying the torch as long as God and Arbitron permit.

1205
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:26,840
And we'll keep carrying the torch as long as God and Arbitron permit.

1206
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,020
Oh yes, dear friends.

1207
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:34,840
And time is running out for your weekly hour of slack.

1208
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,420
Yes, it's the end of...

1209
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,760
That's as much slack as you're going to get this week.

1210
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,340
At least according to the word of Bob.

1211
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,940
He may be able to find slack some other way.

1212
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,920
In fact, you should stay tuned to do just that.

1213
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,680
In the meantime...

1214
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,280
If you really think you want to know...

1215
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:08,860
Please feel free to write for free information from that pleasant post office box here in Dallas, Texas.

1216
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:13,780
I'm going to give that number because I know you want to hear it.

1217
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,140
That's right.

1218
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:21,720
Write to Bob for free information from post office box 1403.

1219
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,280
That's right. Write to Bob for free information from post office box 1403.

1220
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,440
Right here in Dallas, Texas.

1221
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,040
75214.

1222
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,040
I'll give that number again.

1223
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,200
Because I know some of you were just too...

1224
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,600
You know...

1225
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,680
To get it the first time.

1226
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:40,600
That's...

1227
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:42,540
Bob.

1228
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,260
At post office box 1403.

1229
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,720
Dallas, Texas 75214.

1230
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,180
75214.

1231
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,080
Hey, we really enjoyed it,

1232
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,640
and we can't wait to see you again next week.

1233
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,280
We'll see you then.

1234
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,420
We'll see you then.

1235
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,580
We'll see you then.

1236
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,700
We'll see you then.

1237
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,080
We'll see you then.

1238
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:52,300
We'll see you then.

1239
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,240
We'll see you then.

1240
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,260
We'll see you then.
