1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:07,740
The year is 1992 in the old show rerun that I'm about to play.

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,960
We're packing for the escape, Thessal's friends,

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,700
so this show, Hour of Slack number 948,

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:22,840
is really good old Hour of Slack number 390 from 12 years ago,

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,100
and yet it could happen tomorrow.

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:26,420
Tomorrow.

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,080
Stuck in a nowhere job?

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,520
Tired of rhetoric about privacy rights,

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,200
illegal speech and seizure,

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,140
or innocence until proven guilty?

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,660
Don't get PO'd, join the P-Lease.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,480
Yes, the P-Lease,

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,020
America's fastest growing organ of law enforcement.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,560
In just one day, you'll become a highly trained urinalysis deputy,

15
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,180
empowered by law to make on-the-spot urine checks.

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,480
Watch the fun as you make them drop drawers and pee in a cup anywhere,

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,960
in crowded elevators, in church,

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,500
or family barbecues.

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,100
If any testees have used illegal substances in the last six years, you'll know.

20
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,460
And as a P-Lease deputy, you'll have the power to impound,

21
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,220
imprison, confiscate everything they own,

22
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,680
including illegal substances.

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,140
So the next time you hear them say civil rights,

24
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,540
don't get PO'd, join the P-Lease.

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,580
Just send $2, cash, check, money order, or credit card

26
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,140
to You're in Trouble, One Vicious Circle, Utter Missouri 1330.

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,560
Act now while law for laughs and get the amazing little stoolie fecal sampler.

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,080
Don't get PO'd, join the P-Lease.

29
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,300
You say the taxman just took away your barrel and your bleep is freezing in a high wind.

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,300
Your car just made a sound like a dying moose and came to a halt on the off ramp

31
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,120
after spitting out a bucket of gear teeth.

32
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,360
Just finished knocking back your third bottle of NyQuil during the Wren and Stimpy Festival

33
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,840
and you feel like taking a whiz on the electric fence.

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,320
The aliens removed your brain for their pathology studies and you don't even care?

35
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,720
Well, my friend.

36
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,260
You're ready for a big healthy dose of the subgenius hour of slack.

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,800
No one knows how to put the m-huh back in Christmas

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,560
like J.R. Bob Dobbs and his twisted henchman, the Reverend Ivan Stang.

39
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,240
Your good friends and prayer partners in your bid to secure your place in hell

40
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,840
and stop worrying about all this unapproachable crapola.

41
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,380
So, refuse to take your medication for a week

42
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,780
and tie yourself to the kitchen chair for the next neuron-popping episode of

43
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,760
the subgenius hour of slack.

44
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,820
On that bastion of bogus southern hospitality,

45
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,360
this station,

46
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,060
and almighty

47
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,320
this city,

48
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,420
this state,

49
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,020
where the horses have silver wings,

50
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,280
the whales all speak French,

51
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,920
and the politicians are honest.

52
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,160
Yeah, right, and Ross Perot's gonna pay off my student loan too.

53
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,980
I mean, praise Bob!

54
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,880
Have the technology, have the tapes.

55
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,100
Bob told me to make this.

56
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:47,920
Not gonna resist.

57
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,880
And if during the proceedings a small chlorine-oxypropylene bag should drop down,

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,640
open the receiving flap and inhale deeply.

59
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,520
Don't ask questions.

60
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,320
Prepare to have your mind scanned for possible bozosaurian traces.

61
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,240
Scanning now.

62
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,140
...

63
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,640

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,600

00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,640
...

66
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,080

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,160


70
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,160


71
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,160


72
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,160


73
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,340
...

74
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:15,340


75
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:15,340


76
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:15,340


77
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:15,340


78
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,880
Knife down.

79
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,080
There must've been around for so much money.

80
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,820

Who, who are we talking about,

Amen.

90
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,280
We are incidentally guested this morning by a distinguished member of the clergy,

91
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,700
the Right Reverend Archbishop.

92
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,740
I am happy to say that I have received a vision from J.R. Dobbs

93
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,360
that you have been promoted to Archbishop.

94
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,160
Oh, God, that's news to me.

95
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,260
That's pretty exciting.

96
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,580
I was just a sacred scribe until half an hour ago.

97
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,560
Well, I guess being on this national broadcast

98
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,120
has helped you to get a little bit of a feel for the church.

99
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,940
It has had a very good reaction.

100
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,080
We had a story yesterday that I'd like to get to the bottom of, frankly,

101
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,380
about cow mutilations.

102
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:00,680
Now, these cows were suffering from having their udders removed.

103
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,200
Their peni were sliced off, surgically, I might add.

104
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,280
With incredible surgical precision.

105
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,040
Yes, it was.

106
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,940
And the other thing that was reamed out was their rectum.

107
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,520
I have no idea why anyone...

108
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,100
And I quote...

109
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,660
I quote from the Bible to give some testimony

110
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,760
to the fact that this is going.

111
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,200
The fire of God is fallen from heaven

112
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,000
and hath burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them.

113
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,100
Am I only the escaped one alone to tell thee of?

114
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,640
That, of course, is Job, chapter 1, verse 16.

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,600
Job.

116
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,400
Nowadays, when you've got a stale economy, you call them Job.

117
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:46,800
Job.

118
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,700
Job, chapter 1, verse 16.

119
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,000
So, cow mutilations is...

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,760
Can I give you some facts and see if you can verify these for me?

121
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,700
Oh, please do.

122
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:04,040
I am advised by a study done by my research director, Rob Robbie.

123
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,240
A tiny percentage are done by miscellaneous small cults

124
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,080
like Satanists and the Davidians, bikers, etc.

125
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:17,580
About 10% are done by one major Odinist right-wing Christian cult.

126
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:24,860
composed mostly of Texas oil millionaires who are essentially seeking, I guess, a ritualistic way of curing their impotence.

127
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,140
Now you know what Ross Perot does in his spare time.

128
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,880
Calmulations.

129
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,060
Yeah, well, he's got the silent choppers and, you know, all the equipment.

130
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,320
Well, I guess you really need it.

131
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,880
And the motivation.

132
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:44,460
I am advised, sir, and I'm glad I have you face-to-face because I don't like to back down from these types of confrontations,

133
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:50,140
but I am advised that a great deal of subgeniuses, part of your church, all right,

134
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,920
fresh from Dobstown on their first initiation test, are involved in these mutilations.

135
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,820
And that it's not done as a test of their mettle.

136
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:10,100
It's a scientific fact that the only proper way, well, to divine the future is by reading fresh animal bowels.

137
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,400
Well, I'm sorry.

138
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,300
This is a serious matter.

139
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,200
Hey, it's right there in Book of the Subgenius.

140
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,120
It says so right there in Black and White.

141
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,260
It does say that, then.

142
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,440
Then you have admitted to that.

143
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,500
Well, sure.

144
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:29,340
I mean, you haven't lived until you've gone out on a nice little cattle mutilation initiation hunt.

145
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,220
Probably the largest and most ruthless gang of saboteurs in this country.

146
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,420
I know.

147
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,300
For six months they thought I was one of them.

148
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,440
Distrins for all the lawyers, doctors, ex-wives, and all the other...

149
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,620
The gold diggers out there!

150
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,860
What is it, man?

151
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,920
Oh, and let them die with dignity.

152
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,640
Why, you dirty...

153
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,420
But, boss, but, but, but, but...

154
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,200
Isn't it wonderful what you can do with some wire and a few electric bulbs?

155
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,380
A little child looks up at me, sometimes with their eyes open.

156
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,440
You know, right about 500 grams is when their eyes begin to open.

157
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,320
My half-staff turns to me and says, Dr. Foroth, what do we do?

158
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,820
I didn't come in here with three points and a poem today.

159
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,140
I could care less whether you think I can preach a lick or not.

160
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,000
You understand that?

161
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,720
All I care about is saying, Thus saith the Spirit of God.

162
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,980
All I care about is getting in the mountain and standing behind that desk

163
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:37,940
with lips anointed from coals off the fire, ready to declare the word of the living God.

164
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,300
And I'm ready.

165
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,220
They were red as crimson.

166
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,440
They were red as crimson.

167
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,260
Now they're white as wool.

168
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,680
You don't have to encourage somebody that knew they were a dirty, rotten hunk of stinking, sinful flesh.

169
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:56,420
No matter how you dice it out, no matter how you dice it out,

170
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,840
it's still a matter of existing.

171
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,920
If it feels good, do it.

172
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,000
Anything goes.

173
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,100
Drug is being hallucinated.

174
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,180
Well, we're speaking now, of course, as you know, with Father Joe Mama,

175
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,300
who is at the end of the Democratic Convention.

176
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,000
We're looking down on the floor.

177
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,640
You can see at the subgenius convention just what happened.

178
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,560
We heard the news about Jesus and the handgun.

179
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,260
We'll be going to descriptions of that soon.

180
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,500
We just wondered what you saw from where you were.

181
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Well, I felt that the proceedings were very interesting from an academic standpoint, of course.

182
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,700
I can say that without any hesitation.

183
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,260
That is, without any hesitation.

184
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:56,320
That the chaos that ensued was typical of that involving any sort of political assassination.

185
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,160
I personally think Jesus is a patsy.

186
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:00,880
Yeah.

187
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:06,360
He, uh, this magic bullet theory.

188
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,540
Yeah, me too.

189
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,460
The magic splinter theory also.

190
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,420
There are all these theories.

191
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,460
They're just theories.

192
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,420
Well, I mean, you know, I mean, they'd only be theories.

193
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:14,800
I mean, I tried it.

194
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,120
Only Jesus would be accused of being able to kill a man with one bullet with three different

195
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,720
entry rules.

196
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,360
I mean, you know, what do they think this guy is?

197
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,100
Some sort of God?

198
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,460
I mean, let's get real.

199
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,860
I believe we got a whole lot of folks sitting in church think they're saved that aren't.

200
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,160
That's the reason we got to hire 14 more preachers to counsel them all day long.

201
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,860
Shout now!

202
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,080
Shout now!

203
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:41,940
Oh!

204
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,640
Yeah!

205
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:44,420


206
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:46,940
Yeah!

207
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,920
Brother Rock, don't put that condemnation on me.

208
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,480
Let's play God.

209
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,520
My dear young man, you know as well as I do that God is dying all over the world.

210
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,880
Man invented him but doesn't need him anymore.

211
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,460
Man is God now.

212
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,200
As a matter of fact, he always was.

213
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,120
Overpopulation, pollution, famine, nuclear holocaust.

214
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,240
War.

215
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,500
This civilization is driving us into the sea of extinction.

216
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,180
The keynote is control.

217
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,620
Bless the province of politicians, not scientists.

218
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,680
Yes, but we're the only ones who are trying to combat the problem now.

219
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:40,860
In 20 years' time, we will be in positions of power and then we'll be ready to act for the good of humanity.

220
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,400
Ah, just like that.

221
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,520
Like the Church of the Subgenius, dear friends.

222
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:59,200
We've been, uh, enjoying media barrages here on the Hour of Slack from many of our friends.

223
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,340
Starting with the P. Lease by Brain Rot Theater.

224
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,780
Uh, Hell Pope Huey's new contributions and promos.

225
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,260
Reverend Joe Riley's evil bull daughter.

226
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:14,380
Uh, Reverend Joe Riley's evil bull daughter.

227
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,260
Barrage.

228
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,140
And the barrages of Dr. Legume.

229
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:23,460
And, uh, KHSU Subgenius Show.

230
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,540
And good Reverend Morton Downey.

231
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,400
And a wonderful collection of Reverend Parsley.

232
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:37,400
From our dear friend, Reverend Uncle Jimmy.

233
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,980
As well as some KPFA Berkeley puzzling evidence.

234
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,160
And Papa Joe Mama.

235
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,600
And more of these things coming up.

236
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,280
Uh, friends.

237
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,580
Oh, by the way.

238
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,460
As, uh, Vincent Price was just saying there.

239
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,260
We got an amazing document in the mail.

240
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,780
Uh, a top, uh, a copy of what supposedly is top secret material.

241
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,660
A document called Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars.

242
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:12,960
Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars.

243
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,100
A blueprint for your eventual enslavement.

244
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,740
And, uh, I, I don't want to say who sent this to us.

245
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,180
Of course, this could, I suppose, possibly, uh, be a hoax.

246
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,060
Uh, whoa.

247
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,360
I can't put, can't use that tape, friends.

248
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,360
That tape deck.

249
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,780
I'm going to use this one up here.

250
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,560
Did you hear that?

251
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,480
That noise that came in?

252
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,340
There's no telling what they were trying to do to us there.

253
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,100
With that one.

254
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,720
But, you know, as the preface to this thing says here,

255
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,180
conspiracy theories are not new in history.

256
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,940
For example, plots to kill Caesar and overthrow Rome abounded.

257
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,820
But there are many who go out of their way to ridicule and silence

258
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,760
those who today speak of conspiracies.

259
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,720
Why do you think they don't want people to think about conspiracies?

260
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,980
As seldom does hard evidence emerge that by its very content

261
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,320
indicates it serves as a blueprint for a conspiracy.

262
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,940
Yet the very nature and information in the top secret

263
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,460
Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars introductory programming manual

264
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:25,200
reads like a government technical manual from some secret group of

265
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,580
think tank planners who have put many years of research and development

266
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:35,860
into creating a new science of social engineering so they can better manipulate the masses.

267
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,240
This document was uncovered quite by accident on July 7th, 1986,

268
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:48,560
when an employee of Boeing Aircraft Company purchased a surplus IBM copier for scrap parts at a sale

269
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:55,360
and discovered inside details of a plan hatched in the embryonic days of the Cold War

270
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,000
which called for control of the masses through manipulation of industry,

271
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,480
people's pastimes, education, and political leanings.

272
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,280
It called for a quiet revolution, pitting brother against brother

273
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,540
and diverting the public's attention.

274
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:31,640
Sobe Yani de la quemembert

275
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,120
control of social energy.

276
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,500
All science is merely a means to an end.

277
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,080
The means is knowledge.

278
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,300
The end is control.

279
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,580
Beyond this remains only one issue, who will be the beneficiary.

280
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,660
In 1954, this was the issue of primary concern.

281
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:10,500
Although the so-called moral issues were raised, in view of the law of natural selection, it

282
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:16,820
was agreed that a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence are no

283
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,800
better than animals who do not have intelligence.

284
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:28,820
Such people are beasts of burden and stakes on the table by choice and consent.

285
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:36,460
Consequently, in the interest of future world order, peace and tranquility, it was decided

286
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,480
to privately wage a quiet war against the American people.

287
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:40,480


288
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,480
The public was the ultimate objective of permanently shifting the natural and social energy or wealth

289
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:54,160
of the undisciplined and irresponsible many into the hands of the self-disciplined, responsible

290
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,940
and worthy few.

291
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:03,260
In order to implement this objective, it was necessary to create, secure, and apply new

292
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:09,960
weapons, which, as it turned out, were a class of weapons so subtle and sophisticated in

293
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:16,920
the principle of operation and public appearance as to earn for themselves the name of silent

294
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,720
weapons.

295
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:26,160
In conclusion, the objective of economic research as conducted by the magnates of capital, banking,

296
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:33,560
and the industries of goods and services is the establishment of an economy which is totally

297
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,920
predictable and manipulatable.

298
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,940
In order to achieve a total and absolute peace, the economic system must be completely controlled

299
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:39,940


300
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,200
and controlled.

301
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,100
In order to achieve a totally predictable economy, the lower class elements of society

302
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:51,800
must be brought under total control, i.e., must be housebroken, trained, and assigned

303
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:59,040
a yoke and long-term social duties from a very early age, before they have an opportunity

304
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,740
to question the propriety of the matter.

305
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:09,940
In order to achieve such conformity, the lower class family unit must be disintegrated and

306
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:16,380
by a process of increasing preoccupation of the parents and the establishment of government-operated

307
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,560
day care centers for the occupationally orphaned children.

308
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,400
The quality of education given to the lower class must be of the poorest sort, so that

309
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:33,320
the mote of ignorance isolating the inferior class from the superior class is and remains

310
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,720
incomprehensible to the inferior class.

311
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,940
With such an initial handicap, even the most powerful of the lower class must be taken

312
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:39,940


313
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,120
into account.

314
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:46,160
Even bright lower-class individuals will have little, if any, hope of extricating themselves

315
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,860
from their assigned lot in life.

316
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:57,480
This form of slavery is essential to maintaining some measure of social order, peace, and tranquility

317
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,720
for the ruling class.

318
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,860
The silent weapon shoots situations instead of bullets.

319
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:15,440
It is propelled by data processing instead of chemical reactions, originating from bits

320
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:22,080
of data instead of grains of gunpowder, from a computer instead of a gun, operated by a

321
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,520
computer programmer instead of a marksman, and under the orders of a banking magnate instead

322
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,260
of a military general.

323
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:37,540
The public cannot comprehend this weapon, and therefore cannot believe that they are

324
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,840
being attacked and murdered.

325
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:46,580
The public might instinctively feel that something is wrong, but because of the technical nature

326
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:51,340
of the silent weapon, cannot express their feeling in a rational way or handle the problem

327
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,160
with intelligence.

328
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,740
Therefore, they do not know how to cry for help.

329
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:07,280
Ah yes, and then it goes on to describe the silent weapon, dear friends, Mr. Rothschild's

330
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,260
energy discovery.

331
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,880
Apparent capital as a paper inductor and so forth.

332
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:20,120
And they use a sort of shock testing, by which the prices of commodities are shocked and

333
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,560
the public consumer reaction is monitored.

334
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:28,440
The resulting echoes of the economic shock are interpreted theoretically by computers,

335
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,280
and the psycho-economic structure of the economy is thus discovered.

336
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:38,240
It is by this process that partial differential and differentialization is achieved.

337
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,240


338
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:45,980
Hence matrices that define the family household make possible its evaluation as an economic

339
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:53,120
industry, or in other words the household as dissipative consumer structure.

340
00:20:53,460 --> 00:21:00,600
Then the response of the household to future shocks can be predicted and manipulated, and

341
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,820
society becomes a real regulated animal, with its reins under the control of a sophisticated

342
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,220
computer regulator.

343
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,180
The system is then regulated by a self-regulated social energy bookkeeping system.

344
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:17,300
Eventually, every individual element of the structure comes under computer control through

345
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:22,140
a knowledge of personal preferences, such knowledge guaranteed by computer association

346
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:29,880
of consumer preferences, through the universal product code, or UPC, the zebra strike pricing

347
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:37,340
codes on packages, with identified consumers, identified via association with the use of

348
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,200
a credit card.

349
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:56,000
The document, dear friends, then goes on to describe the formula for the economic model

350
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,520
of the silent weaponry, with various diagrams of the three industrial classes, and looks

351
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,940
sort of almost electronic.

352
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,200
The way it's laid out will for instance be as follows.

353
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,200


354
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:08,200


355
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:17,020
The E-model of economic inductance, time flow relationships, and self-destructive oscillations.

356
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:24,880
And then it comes to this little situation here, dear friends, by which we find that

357
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:33,900
the social welfare program is nothing more than an open-ended credit balance system,

358
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,200
which creates a false capital industry to give non-productive people the opportunity

359
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,200


360
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,200


361
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,200


362
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,540
to operate at more labor-intensive cost.

363
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,440
And eventually, people who give market value Ribbon with the

364
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:45,580
intent to make the money come into their books and salvage them, as you've heard and then

365
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:45,780
more and more.

366
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,360
But who are the Gladiator Games?

367
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,360


368
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,360


369
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,360


370
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,360


371
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,360


372
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,360


373
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,360


374
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,360


375
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,040
Screen text 3 becomes a desk.

376
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,280
Screen text 4 lists low and mid cost onuu for the one who mainly consists of low and

377
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,600
prof accordants.

378
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,740
Screen text 537 Frants free of charge.

379
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:07,320
Scene text 6という for those who tend to sit in a must set with a lover.

380
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,200
Screen text 7 Was a point.

381
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:15,660
In this, the method of introducing large amounts of stabilizing capacitance is by borrowing

382
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,840
on the future credit of the world.

383
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:25,300
This is the fourth law of motion and consists of performing an action and leaving the system

384
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,640
before the reaction returns to the point of action.

385
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:36,920
A delayed reaction and by this means politicians become popular in their own time and the public

386
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,340
pays for it later.

387
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,440
In fact, the measure of such a politician is the delay time.

388
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,980
The same thing is achieved by a government printing money beyond the limit of gross national

389
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,980
product, an economic process called inflation.

390
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,020
This puts a large quantity of money in the hands of the public and maintains a balance

391
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:04,920
against their greed, creates a false self-confidence in them and for a while stays the wolf from

392
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,140
the door.

393
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:14,240
But they must eventually resort to war to balance the account because war ultimately

394
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:21,860
is merely the act of destroying the creditor and the politicians are the publicly hired

395
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:28,960
hitmen that justify the act to keep the responsibility and blood off the public conscience.

396
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:36,900
If the people really cared about their fellow man, they would control their appetite and

397
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:36,900


398
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:43,140
their greed, their procreation, etc. so that they would not have to operate on a credit

399
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:48,660
or welfare social system which steals from the worker to satisfy the bum.

400
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:56,980
Since most of the general public will not exercise restraint, there are only two alternatives

401
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,660
to reduce the economic inductance of the system.

402
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,900
One, let the population bludgeon each other to death in the name of the system.

403
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:19,640
Two, let the government take control of the world by the use of economic silent weapons

404
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:26,240
in a form of quiet warfare and reduce the economic inductance of the world to a safe

405
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,820
level by a process of benevolent slavery and genocide.

406
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,880
The latter option has been taken as the obviously best option.

407
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,220
At this point it should be crystal clear to the reader why absolute secrecy about the

408
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,620
silent weapons is necessary.

409
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:49,300
The general public refuses to improve its own mentality and its faith in its fellow

410
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,640
man.

411
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:57,760
It has become a herd of proliferating barbarians and, so to speak, a blight upon the face of

412
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,280
the earth.

413
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:05,100
They do not care enough about economic science to learn why they have not been able to avoid

414
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,720
war despite religion.

415
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:13,020
Their religious morality and their religious or self-gratifying refusal to deal with earthly

416
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:19,400
problems renders the solution of the earthly problem unreachable by them.

417
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:28,220
It is left to those few who are truly willing to think and survive as the fittest to survive

418
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,120
to solve the problem for themselves as the few who really care.

419
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,680
Otherwise...

420
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:43,800
Exposure of the silent weapon would destroy our only hope of preserving the seed of future

421
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,980
true humanity.

422
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:54,500
And see dear friends, I have gone and just exposed the secret of the silent weapon over

423
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:00,500
the radio, destroying their hope of preserving the seed of future true humanity.

424
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,660
But since when, my friend, did we need to preserve the secret of the silent weapon?

425
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:04,660


426
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:10,420
If you are a full-blooded human, then why have the full-blood human not a drop of yeti blood

427
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:10,960
in it?

428
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,920
And I don't see any point in us mollycoddling those people.

429
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:23,880
And as far as I'm concerned, you should respond to the secrets revealed in this document written

430
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:33,200
by the higher-ups in the conspiracy itself by contributing to your voice of the Church

431
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,660
of the Subgenius.

432
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:41,200
If you think the subgenius in your area, dear friend, ah yes, because we love you

433
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:50,100
and we want to save you from that evil, evile conspiros.

434
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,620
Ah yes.

435
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,280
God understands.

436
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,120
He doesn't condemn you.

437
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,500
No!

438
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,000
Excuse me!

439
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,880
God does not understand!

440
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,300
No!

441
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,720
Excuse me!

442
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,440
God does not understand!

443
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,540
I was moist and fully self-actualized,

444
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,620
brimming with the vital juices of life,

445
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,200
a hero to every guy,

446
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,280
a source of lust to every girl,

447
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,120
and the nightmare of every mom.

448
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,020
Yes, I was flying high

449
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,220
and leaving a trail of delightful turmoil in my fetid wake.

450
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,540
But just as I thought it couldn't get any better,

451
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,080
just when I thought I was about to be elected God

452
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,440
so as I could fix this mess good and proper once and for all,

453
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,500
Negi sucked me dry.

454
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,060
I had my Harley.

455
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,520
I had my Harley.

456
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:02,520


457
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:02,540


458
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,160
I was all tuned up for a turf-ripping run

459
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,420
through the fields of middle-class complacency.

460
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,680
I was set to teach the fair maidens of the cheerleading society

461
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,560
what it meant to be left widespread,

462
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,480
grass-stained, and sweaty in the wake of my gladular excesses.

463
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,640
All thoughts of Tupperware, pink bows,

464
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,460
and evening news over a nice dinner

465
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,580
skewered on the pike of my flaming societal rage.

466
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,680
Oh, yes!

467
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,760
I was fully prepared to set fire to everything in sight,

468
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,240
burning new pathways in the brains of the pink and mewling scum

469
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,500
who haunt the mall,

470
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,520
making even the most of my life a waste.

471
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,180
I had my occasional excursions thereof

472
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,360
in pursuit of some minor plastic crap,

473
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,680
a sleigh ride through hell unbounded.

474
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,080
I was fully loaded and snorting

475
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,200
with hellish anticipation of the unforgettable rampage

476
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,460
which would splash the front pages of magazines

477
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,180
and newspapers worldwide.

478
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,940
But suddenly,

479
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,860
Negi sucked me dry.

480
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,140
The lab was fully stocked,

481
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,440
the quivering subjects strapped down,

482
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,420
the batteries,

483
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:02,700
the batteries charged,

484
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,680
and the electrodes in place.

485
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,800
The drill bits were sharpened,

486
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,320
the clamps well-oiled,

487
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,280
the beakers filled with the vile fluids of my intent.

488
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,300
The hookahs were primed,

489
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,560
the incense burning,

490
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,140
the sacrificial chickens,

491
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:16,860
goats,

492
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,980
former employers,

493
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,060
and imaginary enemies drugged and ready.

494
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,280
The generators were churning,

495
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,500
the light bill paid,

496
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:29,500
the guns loaded with the best explosive shells money could buy.

497
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,940
But suddenly,

498
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,740
Negi sucked me dry.

499
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,100
Oh, you can wear a fake beard and dark glasses.

500
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,580
You can trade buses, planes, and rickshaws till you're dizzy.

501
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,000
You can nail the basement door shut,

502
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,080
crank up the anti-virus programs,

503
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,360
turn out the lights and muzzle the kids.

504
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,380
You can wear three rubbers, a gas mask, and a raincoat, and nothing else.

505
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,200
You can buy an arsenal of automatic weapons and nerve gases.

506
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,920
You can build your own pocket.

507
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:00,920


508
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,700
You can dig a moat around the house and fill it with piranha.

509
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,920
You can buy a six pack of slobbering pit bulls and a gross of tigers for the perimeter.

510
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:19,040
You can put in voice print, retina print, and tongue print computers with crisscross lasers aimed at the doormat where the subject to be scanned will stand.

511
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:24,280
You can hire Batman, Hannibal Lecter, and Hulk Hogan for bodyguards.

512
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:30,320
You can fly straight up in the air, screaming like a banshee, flinging fluids and vital organs everywhere.

513
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,500
But sooner or later, no matter how far you run or how big your gun,

514
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,940
you're gonna have to look in the mirror like everybody else and admit to yourself,

515
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,700
Neagy sucked me dry.

516
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,260
And you can do it on top of your ass,

517
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:26,240
like how Bullizi did.

518
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,240


519
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,320
C crédits

520
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,520
God does not understand.

521
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,560
You said I'd pick up my foot, but he'd put it down.

522
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,780
You said the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord.

523
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,940
Lord, I don't want to fall in the ditch.

524
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,460
I don't want to be the blind leading the blind.

525
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,020
God, I need the Holy Ghost conviction to keep me on the right track,

526
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,320
to keep me in the center of your will,

527
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,900
to keep me progressing toward the glory.

528
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:57,380
I'm destined for the throne, and I refuse to take a bypass.

529
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,520
I refuse.

530
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,240
And we've got slaughtered men and women of God

531
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,600
laying around us like cordwood.

532
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,060
They're dead. The life's gone out of them.

533
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,880
No unction, no anointing.

534
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,320
You know why? They refused conviction.

535
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,380
They were numb to conviction.

536
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,060
They turned a deaf ear to the wooing voice of the Spirit of God,

537
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,580
and now they're dead.

538
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,900
My God, that's worth the price of admission.

539
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,780
I know his name.

540
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,320
I know his name.

541
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:33,900
I know his name.

542
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,180
He didn't leave with no exact...

543
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,140
Telephone rang, it would not stop,

544
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,560
it's President Kennedy calling me up.

545
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,640
He said, my friend Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?

546
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,020
I said, my friend John.

547
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,800
The subgenius must have slack!

548
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,240
The subgenius...

549
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,720
...boss.

550
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:55,840
Three!

551
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,480
Wow!

552
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,420
Wow!

553
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,540
Remember, there's a big difference between kneeling down and bending over.

554
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,800
He didn't leave with Lucifer.

555
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,020
Kill Bob!

556
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,980
I know what you want.

557
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,040
You want to kill me.

558
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,600
No!

559
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,300
No!

560
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,380
No!

561
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,660
Can, you know, shoot the s*** with the best of them.

562
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,720
But what about Nectar?

563
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,060
Well, when the fly finds it's time to mate, or rut,

564
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,120
he puts out his feelers, turns up his olfactory and other sensory nerve inputs,

565
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,980
and scans the horizon for the picant, marshmallow smell of a female fly in heat.

566
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,800
Ah, lucky fellow.

567
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,620
He's found.

568
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,360
Yes, her mysterious dance seems to lift up his day and light up his night.

569
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,660
But it's all right.

570
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,480
As she comes to accept him, it's no secret that the fly's orgasmic pleasure

571
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,440
is matched only by his built-in proportionate inability to remain in a fixed location for any length of time.

572
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,820
For no sooner has the mating couple filled each other's goby nodules with albumin and spoo

573
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:25,280
than the fly, ever-touring, ever-seeking Nectar, flies off to another destination,

574
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:31,360
smiling all the while as the facets in his mirror-like covering reflect grace, land, and mansions of endless stars.

575
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,220
Thus filling in the blank spaces of nature's lost address book.

576
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,880
Is it all in the name of love?

577
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,140
Or is this conscious pest but a note in the marvelous symphony of nature's universe?

578
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,780
Perhaps we'll never know.

579
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:47,740
But the next time you see a common fly, remember, there's more to this pesky fellow's life

580
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,800
than rancid oatmeal and his attraction to that light bulb over your bed.

581
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:58,360
Yes, one of nature's most misunderstood anomalies, Mr. Fly will always be a part of our insect world.

582
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,020
Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!

583
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,620
Woo-hoo!

584
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,480
Taratit that time.

585
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,800
Here I am again, Mga Patatid, a Kaiban Sabuhay at Living Gun.

586
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:18,420
Narito Nanaman, an inyong wonderful and sexy doll, upang mahatid sa inyong pananahimik,

587
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,140
ang maga topsy-turvy news sa ating local cinema.

588
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:27,440
Kayat, let us prepare everything now, especially ourselves, for this wonderful tisibisyan.

589
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,360
Nagayon pagasumaka.

590
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,620
Sumahin natin.

591
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,600
Ang katanagyan nini torso.

592
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,700
Bogi si tirso handsome.

593
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,660
A good dresser.

594
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,900
Si mantasata clean-cut.

595
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,220
Ata si tirso ayamohas.

00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,080
Aya umawitata sumayaya.

597
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,200
Then, ang naging second love.

598
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,720
Naman ninora na si Manny.

599
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,960
Angi close-up natatim.

600
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,260
Si Manny kahihit short.

601
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,860
Sa height kung itatitibi ke torso.

602
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,760
Katititi hindi si handsome na tulidni torso.

603
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,120
Si cute.

604
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,360
Naman atmey rune.

605
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,600
Ti-ting-tan-ta-na-it.

606
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,820
Hi, missus.

607
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,380
Talatang ang hirap ni ganga-maga-maga-maga-ano.

608
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:11,380
Imagine.

609
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,780
Ang mahala-maling ang mainga-bilhaming.

610
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,640
Ang dami-dami-pang maga-mananga-mangaka.

611
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,320
Ma-discourage ang manaka-maga-maga-burglars.

612
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,440
Oh, kung hingi man discourage ang magaito, at least make it difficult for them.

613
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,280
Lalo ne para-dun sa mga amateur sneak thieves.

614
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,320
Cloe Robinson.

615
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,460
Big-eye na big-eye na ang damahong in sa peliculaang big-eye.

616
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,800
Tom Tully is out of Beth Morgado.

617
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,340
Well, hindi da bomba on pelicula a little sex-lang.

618
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,940
Dear Mr. Auri, I am one of a million readers of your wonderful column,

619
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:50,080
which I believe can help me find a lot girl-right fo me.

620
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:57,320
I didn't even think before that I would be in need of your help, for I had girlfriends, yet they all deceived me.

621
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,260
However, I don't have any friends.

622
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,260


623
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,760
I don't have to blame even any one of them.

624
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,720
I've realized that we're not really men for each other.

625
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:11,700
With regard to the girl I'm looking for, she must be of a practical type, Caucasian, Catholic, understanding enough to get my situation.

626
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:19,960
She must not be necessarily beautiful or sexy, but charming and sexy and beautiful and simple to please my sophisticated heart.

627
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,040
Ngagli.

628
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:28,900
She must be a teacher, even pursuing still such a profession at 22 to 25 years of age, standing five to five.

629
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:36,620
Speaking of my humble self, I am an A.B. degree holder, and at present still pursuing my studies for a B.S.E. degree,

630
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:43,000
and at the same time employed in one of the private firms in the greater Manila area, making Manila folders.

631
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,320
Till here, and I'll be hoping for the best of your kind help.

632
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,080
Thanks in advance, and more power to your column.

633
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,960
Very respectfully, Tyrone.

634
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,940
Lang iligayang pangling mo roadside mailbox, sang house number na lang.

635
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,260
Mang laga gunga.

636
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,260
Ngat ni gansih ganga pang lang at num ro, an baya.

637
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,860
This way.

638
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,760
The Church of the Suns.

639
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,680
P.O. Box 140.

640
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,760
phrase 0.

641
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,240
6 Dallus.

642
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,540
Terseus.

643
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,580
7-5-2-1-4-3

644
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,320
Praise Bob.

645
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,060
That's right.

646
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:27,640
He- that Malaysian address is Bob, at post office box 140.

647
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,240
Praise Bob.

648
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:29,240


649
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,200
306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

650
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:43,380
But the new number is P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

651
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:51,460
You really can write for more free information from Bob at that number.

652
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,360
But I'll be giving that sacred post office box number again.

653
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,560
But in the meantime, I wanted to let you know what you have been listening to, dear friends.

654
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,040
We've heard Hell Pope Huey doing a Neagie sucked me dry.

655
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,400
A lovely sort of testimony there.

656
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:21,000
More of Reverend Parsley from Reverend Uncle Jimmy's tape that he sent in.

657
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,880
We've barely scratched the surface of that.

658
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,560
Dr. Legume's media broge.

659
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,340
Dr. Riley's media broge.

660
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,800
Bleepo Abernathy talking about flies in rut.

661
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,980
And that was the Fire Sign Theater.

662
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:43,160
Very rare recordings doing the Filipino ads there.

663
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:55,040
And coming up, we'll hear some ranting by Reverend Mike Cole in Cleveland.

664
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,280
A little bit of that.

665
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:09,800
Some, an amazing little piece about snake handlers that was sent in on a tape called America Freedom Acts by a devil guy.

666
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:23,180
I got a bag in the mail that had a, it had inside a black hood, an envelope of ashes, a piece of paper with devil writing and blood on it, and a vial of some milky fluid.

667
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,700
That tape.

668
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,500
And more KPFA coming up.

669
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,480
And, well, we'll just see.

670
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,100
We'll try to get down to the Rudy Schwartz project.

671
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,240
Oh.

672
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:37,760
Hi.

673
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,000
Are we not, men?

674
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,640
We are the subgenius!

675
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:46,900
Ah!

676
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,500
Oh, and Crop Circles.

677
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,420
That was another one.

678
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,020
You're doing Crop Circles now.

679
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,240
Yeah.

680
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:53,340
Yeah.

681
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,340
It's, it, it, those two little old gentlemen in England took credit for it.

682
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,200
They were those 13,000 Crop Circles.

683
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,980
But obviously it had to have been a lot of subgenius help.

684
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,880
Well, I knew they had to have some help of some kind.

685
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,680
But I always thought that this was perhaps from a UFO.

686
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,720
A lot of them are from UFOs.

687
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:14,200
But they're, they're little minor joyriding UFOs.

688
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,500
Not the important UFOs that Bob Dobbs is in touch with.

689
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,100
Bob Dobbs is in touch.

690
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:27,060
One of Bob's main messages is that the world is going to end on July 5th, 1998 at 7 o'clock.

691
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:27,320
And the world is going to end on July 5th, 1998 at 7 o'clock.

692
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,500
Why, why, why that particular time and that particular day?

693
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,280
Uh, just, I guess it's a random choice on the part of the aliens.

694
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,360
The men from Planet X, or the sex goddesses from Planet X, have found themselves better.

695
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:39,660
Oh, my God.

696
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,720
I, I...

697
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:54,140
You're listening to the Church of the Subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack

698
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,520
with your host, the Reverend Ivan Stang.

699
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,160
Thank you.

700
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:57,300
Thank you.

701
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,300


702
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,300


703
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,300


704
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,300


705
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,300


706
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,300


707
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,300


708
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,300


709
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,300


710
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,300


711
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:57,300


712
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,040
I never steer you wrong.

713
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,440
Tell me where to turn.

714
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:07,700
Here.

715
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:19,180
Well, I was, I was thinking just the other day that we don't have that many of them subgenius holidays.

716
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:26,120
Oh, well, yeah, every, every day is Bob's birthday.

717
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:26,460
Yeah.

718
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:31,760
But, uh, I guess it's been a little bit tiresome in a while.

719
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,280
But I was thinking about July 5th.

720
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,840
Oh, it's, it's kind of a ways away.

721
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,560
You know, it's not that far away.

722
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,360
July 5th.

723
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:54,620
I remember, I remember Reverend, uh, Reverend Stang.

724
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,140
Yeah.

725
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,180
Yeah.

726
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:56,360
Yeah.

727
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:56,440
Yeah.

728
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:56,440


729
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:56,440


730
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:56,440


731
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:56,440


732
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:56,900
Yeah.

733
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:01,400
And, and he was talking, he was talking about that, uh, what goes off.

734
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:10,940
And he was telling, the importance of stay 1998.

735
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:23,540
And he, he, he was saying, he was saying, oh my God, what was that he said.

736
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,180
I've got to stay up all night.

737
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:31,320
and throbbing and dooning and gleaning

738
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:39,940
and doing X-Day chants about how the time is nigh for their arisal

739
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:45,300
and songs, you know, X-Day holiday songs like Take Me Off to Space,

740
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,640
which we'll be playing soon.

741
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,960
And on X-Day morning, of course, well, the grown-ups have been up all night,

742
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,520
but the kids get up real early because on X-Day,

743
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,920
the children are allowed to eat breakfast.

744
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,260
When we pulled up in the yard, I told the children here,

745
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,780
I said, we're going to have ourselves a time tonight.

746
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:08,440
I just knew that old church was going to be full of spirit, and it was, honey.

747
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,460
It was.

748
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,160
We went in there.

749
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:16,820
After we sung about three songs, they were shouting all over that church.

750
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,600
I've never seen so many people in one church shout.

751
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:24,120
And in a little while, they shouted themselves right around in back office.

752
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,500
Three loud.

753
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,600
Two ladies and two men.

754
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:33,420
Well, now, when we were hooking up, we saw some curtains or something laying over some boxes back there.

755
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,840
We didn't pay any attention to it.

756
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,660
Didn't know what was in there and didn't care.

757
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:47,500
But in a little while, they came out around us with five of the biggest rattlesnakes I have ever laid my eyes on.

758
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,620
I like to die.

759
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:04,880
When the service was over, they told us that the biggest rattlesnake they had in that service was five feet long.

760
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:10,780
Honey, the one they brought by me was 27 feet long.

761
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,860
They, they, and let me say this.

762
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,180
I'm not knocking these people.

763
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,060
I promise you I'm not knocking them.

764
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,920
I don't know if they're right or wrong, you know.

765
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,200
I'll tell you.

766
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:29,360
They, they claimed that they, they read in the Bible where Moses had enough faith to take up the service.

767
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,940
And some members of their congregation claimed to have that much faith.

768
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,840
And I'll tell you one thing I found out before I left there.

769
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,840
They had a whole lot more faith than what I had.

770
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:49,920
That, now, now, this one woman stopped about two feet from where I was trying to pick and sing.

771
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,400
I didn't even know what kiaz is.

772
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:07,040
She, she took that rattlesnake with a head as big as your fist and held it up and stuck it right down in her face and shouted in its ear.

773
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,780
If a rattlesnake's got a ear.

774
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,800
She wrapped that thing around her neck.

775
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:19,900
She threw it down on the floor, kicked off her shoe, and put her bare foot on top of it.

776
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,940
And she threw that thing down on the floor.

777
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:30,440
It's tail missed my foot about that far.

778
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,200
I done a little shouting myself.

779
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,080
And she thought I was in the spirit.

780
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,880
And brought me one of those rattlesnakes.

781
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:49,880


782
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:49,880


783
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And she said,

784
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,160
What in the world are we going to do?

785
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,040
And I said,

786
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,480
Just take it easy.

787
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,780
Don't panic.

788
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,280
I said,

789
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,740
Just look around and find out where the back door is.

790
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:19,880
She said,

791
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:19,880


792
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:19,880


793
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:19,880


794
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:19,880


795
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:19,880


796
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:19,880


797
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,180
I already looked and there ain't none.

798
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,700
I said,

799
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,560
Reckon where do they want one?

800
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,700
And this lady walked up to me.

801
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,220
She said,

802
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,080
Brother Windy,

803
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:46,480
You mean to tell me if the Lord commanded you to take up the serpent, you wouldn't take him up?

804
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,100
I said,

805
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:49,780
Yes ma'am.

806
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:50,740
I surely would.

807
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,940
But he didn't and I ain't.

808
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,880
Then the devil pulls out the mask.

809
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:57,760
It's me, Bob.

810
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,820
Defeated.

811
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:28,320
Oh God.

812
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:31,800
Growing a translation mistake.

813
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,280
Looking up for the überhaupt.

814
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:34,580
This is where we found youruccidates.

815
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,740
They're tutaj.

816
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:49,620
This is their means of a living.

817
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:55,940
And you must stand united on this and stamp out this frightful assassin of our youth.

818
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:00,980
Because it is only through enlightenment that this scourge can be wiped out.

819
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:14,440
You're going to be ready for the finals in 1998, my friend.

820
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,320
Let me be slack.

821
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,140
Why don't you buy me a vibrator?

822
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,120
Why don't I put it in your mouth and you hum?

823
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,820
A person walking down a sandy beach barefoot,

824
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,160
whose foot has been numbed by Novocaine,

825
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,360
steps on the jagged edge of a broken bottle,

826
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,700
slits their foot,

827
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,600
and bleeds,

828
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,500
to death.

829
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,900
Because they never knew there was a problem.

830
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:59,080
My loss was his gain.

831
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,960
This was a manipulation, a tilting of the luck plane in his favor.

832
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,080
And what goes up must come down.

833
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:13,520
And when you're talking about the luck plane, you're talking about both sides at once.

834
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,820
One goes up, the other goes down.

835
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,660
I happen to be on the wrong end of the luck plane.

836
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:26,160
But Mr. Rob Dobson, you see, was on the right side of the luck plane.

837
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,660
And I bet he had a damn good seat for tonight's game.

838
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,660
What a wonderful paradise.

839
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,360
Is that a paradise?

840
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:35,140
Sort of.

841
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:42,960
He's on the coast, up north here, with all of his, well, what can you say, aliens and friends.

842
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,160
Oh, it's a family reunion.

843
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,620
What about me?

844
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,800
That's the code word we use, too.

845
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:55,520
Yes, it's a mighty big family tree we subgenius grow from.

846
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,220
That's right.

847
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,260
You never can tell what sort of branches can branch off here.

848
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:06,200
Well, we're going to the convention floor right now for that report about Jesus and a handgun.

849
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,580
Let's see what they have to say down there.

850
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:12,200
Jesus was running around at the spa last night with a handgun.

851
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,500
Really? Okay. You can see Reverend Stang there.

852
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,440
There you are.

853
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,680
And a wounded side and a crowned side.

854
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,380
I've got a positive idea on this, boys.

855
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,060
And I had a gun.

856
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,480
He was looking for Bob.

857
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,340
He was hunting for Bob. And so what happened?

858
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,120
Well, he was bumming drinks.

859
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:27,560
Yeah?

860
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:28,920
And he found him.

861
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,360
If you see him running around town, you'd be on the lookout.

862
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,480
Yes, he was.

863
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:36,300
And a wound in his side, a crown of thorns, a loincloth.

864
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,360
Yeah, and then I saw him going off with Connie, too.

865
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,480
That's a drinking, fighting Jesus for you.

866
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,880
It sure is. Quite a guy.

867
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:43,980
He was a real nice guy.

868
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:44,640
Did he miss Bob?

869
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,940
I wasn't around at that point.

870
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,560
No, no, I don't think he did. I don't think he hit Bob.

871
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,200
He missed him.

872
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:48,560
Yeah.

873
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:54,220
Something must have happened. We think the bullets were caught in some sort of void time warp or something.

874
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,240
Time warp or something. Yeah, I saw one of them.

875
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,180
I think there were even three different heads who were alive.

876
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,860
That's always a problem with those deities.

877
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,220
One of the things you have to do on the show here is wash the little ice bombs.

878
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,140
Over here in the corner is a sink over here.

879
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:09,440
And you can wash their little bodies.

880
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,300
That makes it all happen.

881
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,260
Okay, yeah, yeah.

882
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,260
Ran, ran.

883
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,240
Okay, we might have to leave the floor.

884
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,720
It looks like the crowd's getting ugly down there with Reverend Ivory staying.

885
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,380
Uh-oh.

886
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,600
Uh-oh, they busted through the...

887
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,100
Are you afraid to die?

888
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:29,220
Well, there you go.

889
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,980
They busted through the third medium into Stang's brain.

890
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:36,380
They now reside there until we can perform the radio exorcism on the second half of the show.

891
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:41,200
Yes, I was there in the bar that night, the night that Jesus was allegedly running around,

892
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:43,680
but that was no handgun in his pocket.

893
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,300
He was just happy to see another cult.

894
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,820
He wanted those followers back.

895
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:48,980
Customer service.

896
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:49,880
Yes, dear.

897
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,080
Papa Joe here.

898
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,040
And, you know, I'm...

899
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:58,180
You're far too young to remember this, but when I was a boy, we didn't have any of these weaklings.

900
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,820
Jesus with a handgun.

901
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,780
We only prayed to an almighty God that puts fear, fear in his disciples.

902
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,160
I'm talking about Jesus with a hand grenade.

903
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,080
Fear in his cereal?

904
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,140
No, Jesus, back in my day, Jesus had AK-47.

905
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,460
Jesus had a Stinger missile.

906
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:17,800
I know, but...

907
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,200
Stang, that's the old world.

908
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,920
You're in new thinking now.

909
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:21,340
...a handgun.

910
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,960
But see, that's what's happened today.

911
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,900
People get sloughed off with these cheap imitations.

912
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:32,820
Yeah, but Papa Joe, Mama, I can't even have a list of high-ranking officials that were

913
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:34,860
there that night and were actually such geniuses.

914
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:35,540
All right, punch it up.

915
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:44,500
Well, it has been alleged that certain hierarchies have carried weapons of destruction on their

916
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,780
persons during public appearances, but this is merely a matter of time before we can get

917
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:47,780


918
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:47,780


919
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:47,780


920
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:47,780


921
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:47,780


922
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:48,760
to the real issue.

923
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:54,160
Let me assure you, these allegations of opening up on the audience, dispensing with people

924
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,620
that didn't applaud loud enough, these are purely exaggerations.

925
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:04,860
Okay, all right, there was some shooting on the audience, but it was target practice.

926
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,720
We were deliberately missing.

927
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:07,880
No, tell the truth.

928
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,980
Okay, okay, so all right, a few people were hit, but that was from...

929
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,240
And we dial up Rocky Man.

930
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:14,720
...rickety.

931
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,640
What a beautiful future it is.

932
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,760
And how many people were killed?

933
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:17,760


934
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:17,760


935
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:17,760


936
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:17,760


937
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:21,640
Listen, would I lie to you? Would I lie to you?

938
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,500
Those people that died, those were people that wanted to die.

939
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,100
They jumped up in the line of fire.

940
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,340
Would you lie to me? What about that night you told me you were...

941
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,120
Well, never mind.

942
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:36,200
Never mind, never mind. Quote the Raven, never mind.

943
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,540
Get off of me!

944
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,660
He screamed at the orderlies when told he was actually

945
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,560
Farlow Fudd, doctor of dental surgery.

946
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:49,260
He struggled with his bonds and snapped his jaws at them viciously,

947
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,180
his mouth foaming like a St. Bernard's.

948
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:55,340
The drugs had shown some beneficial effect at first, but as time wore on,

949
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:59,140
his violent reassertion of his fictitious persona pushed aside any hope

950
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,140
that chemical management would lead to a breakthrough.

951
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,880
Get the electrodes, sighed Dr. Fine.

952
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,140
He shook his head in resigned frustration.

953
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,860
The man had already absorbed the full charge of four diehard batteries

954
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:11,060
and was still no better.

955
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:15,200
His burning devotion to this Bob Dobbs was most disturbing.

956
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,920
Either it was the product of a fevered, sick mind,

957
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:22,360
or this Bob had somehow tormented the man into a state of burning psychotic loyalty

958
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,080
unlike anything they'd seen before.

959
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,460
Perhaps it was both.

960
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,160
Hell-poke Huey, indeed.

961
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,720
Well, regardless, I have a job to do, thought the doctor,

962
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:33,280
as he pulled on his thick rubber gloves and goggles.

963
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,440
And to think I used to enjoy this, he thought.

964
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,260
Something had to work soon.

965
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,320
There were only three orderlies left,

966
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,800
and one of them refused to approach this patient again,

967
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:45,140
even with the peril of being fired over his head.

968
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,560
As the raving man had put the others in the ICU

969
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,540
with snapped bones and large pieces bitten out of them,

970
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,120
the doctor couldn't really blame him.

971
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,260
Perhaps he really was the Pope of Hell.

972
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,680
He was certainly earning his self-imposed title.

973
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:57,780
Oh, well.

974
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,320
One last try with electricity,

975
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,440
and then it would be time to turn to firearms.

976
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,900
Suddenly, there were screams in the hall,

977
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,920
followed by a terrifying, rumbling crash

978
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,320
that sounded like someone had loosed a thunderhead in the building.

979
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,480
The multifaceted sonic chaos made him feel like a frightened child again,

980
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,060
and his bladder loosened violently.

981
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,100
Against his better judgment,

982
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,200
he ran from the room and turned the corner

983
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,580
to see the orderlies in pools of their own blood,

984
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,600
their arms ripped from the sockets,

985
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,360
unimaginable burns, smoking,

986
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:26,940
and filling the air with the acrid tang of ozone.

987
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,000
Worse yet, one of them had been separated from his head,

988
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,200
which lay forlornly in the corner like a discarded ragdoll,

989
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,680
except that ragdolls didn't ooze loops of intestine

990
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,820
and purple-pink brain matter.

991
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:42,000
My dear God, his nose has been bitten off,

992
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,940
Dr. Fine thought as he vomited,

993
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:44,040
and he was in a state of shock.

994
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:47,020
I guess he shouldn't have called the man names when all this started,

995
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:47,820
he thought absently,

996
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:50,460
part of his fractured mind shutting itself off

997
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,540
in a bid to prevent a complete breakdown.

998
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,040
There was a huge hole in the wall,

999
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:57,920
jaggedly rent as if some unimaginable force of nature

1000
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,020
had gone berserk,

1001
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,680
which was, ironically, exactly what had happened.

1002
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,340
A few bricks fell from the smoking edges of the gas as he watched,

1003
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,740
mouth agape, vomitous, unwiped,

1004
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:10,300
as he tried to wrap a protective cocoon around his mind

1005
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:12,140
until he could get to some tranquilizers.

1006
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:13,360
Hmm.

1007
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,420
Bob Dobbs and Hell Pope Huey, he mused absently.

1008
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,240
I'll remember those names.

1009
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:33,900
Ah!

1010
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,820
Yes, dear friends, and...

1011
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:43,540
Oh, you can remember...

1012
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,440
the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs

1013
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,160
by writing for free information.

1014
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:48,900
That's right.

1015
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,600
You can get all kinds of free stuff in the mail

1016
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:56,220
just by letting us know you care enough

1017
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:00,020
to send off for that wonderful packet.

1018
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,220
You can write Bob.

1019
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,920
You got that pencil ready, friend?

1020
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,080
I'm going to give you a couple of different addresses tonight.

1021
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,300
You can write to Bob at Post Office Box

1022
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,040
181-417

1023
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,240
Cleveland Heights

1024
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,020
08107

1025
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:14,400
Ohio

1026
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:17,500
44118

1027
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,440
But, but, but, but, but...

1028
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,960
Agent L!

1029
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:28,680
Now, the conspiracy talks about something called deviant sex.

1030
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:35,680
To the conspiracy, deviant sex is anything except having, uh,

1031
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,160
trying to have a baby in the missionary position.

1032
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,900
That's the only thing we consider to be a sin!

1033
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:42,540
Alright!

1034
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,280
Am I preaching right now?

1035
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,900
Am I preaching right now?

1036
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:51,120
That knew they were a dirty rotten hunk of stinking sinful

1037
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,860
hunk of stinking sinful flesh

1038
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,700
dirty rotten hunk of stinking sin

1039
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,600
dirty rotten hunk of stinking sinful

1040
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,720
hunk of stinking sinful

1041
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:58,860
dirty rotten hunk of

1042
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:01,120
They were red as crimson, now they're white as wool!

1043
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,520
dirty rotten hunk of stinking sinful flesh

1044
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,960
Oh, now that's hogwash.

1045
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:08,200
Every person pulled his hair and clawed the ground!

1046
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,000
This is a battlefield, sir!

01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:12,000
This is no recreation room!

1048
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:12,960
That's it!

1049
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,280
That's the great sin!

1050
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,620
But, who wants to play Russian with red?

1051
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,220
The next time that somebody wants you to go to bed with them,

1052
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,740
with or without a condom,

1053
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,220
you're packing along a loaded revolver with you when you go.

1054
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,660
And not only that, when you go to bed with that person,

1055
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,280
you're not just going to bed with that person,

1056
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:53,500
you're going to bed with every other person that person has ever gone to bed with before in their life.

1057
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,680
So just picture it as if you're all crawling into one bed together.
