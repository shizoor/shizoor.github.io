00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:15,960
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,280
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station

3
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,260
and only in the city of...

4
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:45,980
Dr. Howell, just so you know, we're live and recording. We haven't officially started yet, but we can.

5
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,500
We probably need to get them bitches up here.

6
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,540
From PR News in Washington, I'm...

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,900
President Obama has ordered 500 staples, underscoring the shift the way Americans are shopping.

8
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,920
Today the world can see that the United States is united.

9
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,740
For now, the president's executive order authorizes ass freezes.

10
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,120
Or PR News, Washington.

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,240
Now we hear doctors now have new reason to hope that three and a half infected baby girls

12
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,140
might be born with the HIV virus in a study that begins later this year.

13
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,360
The GOP-led U.S. House...

14
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,180
Where Democrats...

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,340
Are in the majority.

16
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,100
On Wall Street, 77164537.

17
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,500
A new study in the journal Pediatrics links smoking to PR News.

18
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,600
Because there's no evidence that cigarette use actually leads to PR News.

19
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,420
From Washington...

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,480
I'm not happy, I'm not happy, nobody's happy, okay?

21
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,100
Happiness comes in small doses, folks.

22
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,900
It's a cigarette or a chocolate chip cookie or a five second orgasm, that's it, okay?

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,160
You come, you eat the cookie, you smoke the butt, you go to sleep, you get up in the morning,

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,100
you go to fucking work, okay?

25
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,880
That is the end of fucking list.

26
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,920
When I fucking jack off long enough, I end up jizzing, dude.

27
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,060
I'm assuming the same shit works for you.

28
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,820
Real fucking smart answer, why don't you fucking aim, huh?

29
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,180
I have a particularly explosive ejaculate, it just goes everywhere.

30
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,720
It's like a fucking wild fireman's hose.

31
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,540
You just gotta grab on and pray to God it doesn't get in your eyes or your mouth.

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,500
What the fuck kind of jerking off is that?

33
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,520
What, you never had any brothers?

34
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,240
You didn't learn to jizz in a fucking sock or on a fucking tissue?

35
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,980
No, I don't have any brothers.

36
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,260
I was raised in a house of women.

37
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,260
I highly doubt they fucking taught you to fucking close your eyes and fucking come wherever

38
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:31,800
you want.

39
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,620
I mean, you're getting all worked up over a fucking porno mag.

40
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,840
Who has goddamn porno mags anymore?

41
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,300
Welcome to the 21st century, Buck Rogers.

42
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,380
You designed a house with fucking iPads in the walls.

43
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,800
You're jerking your dick like a goddamn pilgrim.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,860
That's right, man.

45
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,160
I like to fucking read.

46
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,600
You think that's the only thing I jerked off in here?

47
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,120
I've been dropping loads around this fucking house like a goddamn dump truck.

48
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,220
You don't cover my stuff.

49
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,180
I'll go wherever the fuck I want, James.

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,240
I'll fucking come and get you.

51
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,480
I'll come on your fucking kitchen.

52
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,880
I'll come on your fucking art.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,280
I'll come anywhere I want.

54
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,240
I will fucking come right on you.

55
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,040
I will come like a fucking madman all over you, McBride.

56
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,640
Ooh, I fucking wish you'd come on me right now.

57
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,280
I fucking dare you to come on me.

58
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,720
I'm gonna jerk my dick so fucking hard in here.

59
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,100
I love that phrase.

60
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,740
Mommy, mommy, daddy put white pee in my front butt.

61
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:26,440
That's found that scrawled in the edge of a punk zine that Onan found a long time ago.

62
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,220
Princess Weaver.

63
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,220


64
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,220


65
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,220


66
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,220


67
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,220


68
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,220


69
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,220


70
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,220


71
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,220


72
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,220


73
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,220


74
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,400
She doesn't think that's funny.

75
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,320
Yes, there are some-

76
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,040
But it is the way we do it.

77
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:31,700
Yeah.

78
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,160
You know, when people see us raping or whatever, they laugh and laugh and laugh.

79
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:37,500
Oh.

80
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,360
Because it's so inept.

81
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,300
I'm not an idiot.

82
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,440
I know why you guys don't fucking call me or hang out with me anymore.

83
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,100
It's because I party so fucking hard.

84
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,660
I always have, ever since I was a baby.

85
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,160
I wouldn't just suck on my mama's titties.

86
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,300
I would fucking bang them and motorboat them.

87
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,200
Everything I've been doing, I've been doing it.

88
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,200


89
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,980
It's just been a cry for help.

90
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,840
When I came on your magazine, James, it was a come for help.

91
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,900
Just been crying and coming and crying and coming.

92
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,360
Tears from the tip of my penis, dudes.

93
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:17,320
Again, I'm going to break my usual rule and read a rant.

94
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,900
In this case, it's a great rant.

95
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,320
And the guy who wrote it, Good Reverend Roger is his name.

96
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,160
Good Reverend Roger.

97
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:33,700
Who I think is stuck in Phoenix where it's 125 degrees or something.

98
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,520
He was going to be at X Day and he couldn't come.

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,700
And I don't know whether he can rant worth a hooey.

100
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,420
So I'm just going to deliver his rant because it really says, it's a great subgenius rant.

101
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,080
The title of it appears to be,

102
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,920
We are freaks.

103
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,740
We are genetic stuntmen.

104
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,640
We are the weaponized ape.

105
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,120
We are so far ahead of everyone else that we are constantly accused of cheating.

106
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,220
We are the fifth horsey of the apocalypse.

107
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,740
We sing in the shower.

108
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,720
We dance in the shower.

109
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,060
And we laugh at the emergency room personnel here.

110
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,260
We are the ones who bitch about the results.

111
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,780
Bleeding head good, healed head bad.

112
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,440
We know we'll pay to know what we really think.

113
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,560
So we put our brains on layaway.

114
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,360
Because it turns out that the payment isn't in green, outside of the church anyway.

115
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,380
It's in slacking and flapping our way to a bright new tomorrow.

116
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,860
With fresh fears scrawled on horrors scrolls.

117
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,960
We are the last yeti.

118
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:55,260
We know rock and roll and what James Brown was trying to scream out the windows while the cops chased him across four states.

119
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,340
We are superior mutants.

120
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,740
And we don't need your stupid causes and political theory because we know the truth.

121
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,440
And the truth is, the future ain't done with you yet.

122
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,940
On that note, the future is bad for you.

123
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,940
That's why we all went back to 1979 and only kept the truth.

124
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:17,940


125
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,420
And that's the good shit.

126
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,420
Time is loose, brothers and sisters.

127
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,380
And sometimes it gets downright gooey.

128
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,700
But would you really want it to behave itself?

129
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,040
No, of course not.

130
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,760
Because if it did, that means you'd be only getting Taylor Swift right now.

131
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,640
And no rehab to make things better.

132
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,000
Singing about being down in the dark where the sickness lives.

133
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,580
Do you have the sickness, friends?

134
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,920
Do you know what it's like to rant until your spleen explodes?

135
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:53,160
In front of perfectly harmless bystanders at the gay bar?

136
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,180
Can you, as a great subgenius once said, get down with my sickness?

137
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,700
I hope so.

138
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,240
This new style America sort of demands it.

139
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:12,080
And it will crush you like a bug if you aren't prepared mentally and physically.

140
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,800
There's no way to go farther back than 1979.

141
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,640
For reasons that are too technical to explain.

142
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,200
But would you really want to?

143
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,860
1979 was the absolute height of American fabulousness.

144
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,720
And that's really all anybody wants.

145
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:38,440
Even the hardcore Christian right just wants to ensure an eternity of fabulousness for themselves.

146
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,980
Although they'll kill you if you try to make them admit it.

147
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,780
Can you, my people, shit your pants in the street?

148
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,060
In the face of authority?

149
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,640
Can you slap the snot out of what's expected of you?

150
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,660
Can you drive that militarized Studebaker down the lost highway?

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,540
Blasting the boogie pimps on 8 track and getting all of the puke out the window?

152
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,180
Shit yeah!

153
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,640
This century was made for us!

154
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,980
And it is ours to play with!

155
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,300
To light on fire or kick down the stairs!

156
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,140
Provided only that we remain safely in 1979.

157
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,840
Can I get a witness?

158
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,840
Say, I'm just trying to explain.

159
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,920
To offer my excuse.

160
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:35,200
They bought us and sold us and lied to us and stuffed us full of filters and slammed us into these uniforms.

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,360
I don't want a uniform, wrote Roger.

162
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,880
I want to be Roger.

163
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,280
And I don't really want anyone else to feel like they have to.

164
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,280
I just want more fropping and less punishment.

165
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,980
Life was supposed to be fun.

166
00:08:52,320 --> 00:09:00,640
It's about 80 years of screeching hysterical laughter and getting your monkey on in ways that concern nobody else.

167
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:08,780
But they made it about terrorism and prison and not getting caught, you criminal bastard.

168
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,220
They killed Johnny Cash!

169
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,860
And they killed Elvis!

170
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:18,860
And they shut down Motown and gave us war and war porn instead.

171
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,220
And life in prison if you say shit about it.

172
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,820
But that is not for you and I.

173
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,240
We know.

174
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,000
We understand.

175
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,640
There is no they.

176
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,920
There's only us.

177
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,280
312 million profoundly retarded primates in this nation alone.

178
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,640
All terrified of stuff that doesn't exist.

179
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,960
Yeah, you heard me.

180
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,900
None of the things you've been trained to be afraid of are real.

181
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:59,560
They are social fictions generated to punish people because that's the easiest mindset for homicidal apes to adopt.

182
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,940
But we are not apes.

183
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,820
We are yeti.

184
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:10,640
And we scoff at their speed limits and their moral rectitude.

185
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,140
And their quote, approved social activities, unquote.

186
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:21,400
That's why we've got shit like Tucson and Portland and Providence and Wisteria.

187
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:28,620
And that's why we will always escape until such time as they kill us.

188
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,560
E-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I.

189
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,400
Praise the good Reverend Roger.

190
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,140
I told you that was a pretty good one.

191
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,220
That was part of my sermon from Starwood Festival last year.

192
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,540
Praise the good Reverend Roger.

193
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:53,200
Yes, dear friends, as you might have suspected, this is a special Internet only Hour of Slack.

194
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,600
And normally we produce a clean version for our beloved broadcast stations and an un-clean one for the Internet.

195
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:08,820
And this is also the first time in months that I've sat down in my office and done an all edited show from home.

196
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:16,980
And the way my hands and butt feel reminds me of why we've lately preferred driving to the WCSB station and doing the shows live.

197
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,740
It's much faster.

198
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:26,060
On the other hand, this being an Internet only special, I don't have to worry at all about fitting it all into exactly one hour.

199
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,840
Praise Bob.

200
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,960
Every year or so we accumulate an hour or two worth of songs or rants that just don't work if you censor them.

201
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,420
In this case, 17X Day and Starwood No. 34 are coming up fast.

202
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:48,720
And yet we have several choice tracks stockpiled that were recorded last year at 16X Day Drill, at the Starwood Festival, and at the Pittsburgh Divival.

203
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:56,820
We've also heard some of the live stage Hour of Slack stuff from 16X Day with Dr. Hal and some of the other guests.

204
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:56,820


205
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:56,820


206
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,360
I've also heard some of the live clips from the movie This Is The End.

207
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,280
Those I've already played.

208
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:10,840
Coming up though, my ranting at 16X Day, Reverend Andrew the Impaled and his 16X Day sing-along, All You Need Is Fuck.

209
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:20,400
Three improv jam songs from X Day's version of Multiple Fisted Tales of Connie, in this case mostly Bishop's Dick and Priestess Pisces.

210
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,580
More censored live stage Hour of Slack with Dr. Hal and Dr. Legume.

211
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,780
Some Bob Noggin.

212
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:26,820


213
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,600
Some

214
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,620
Very Unsafe for Work.

215
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,300
And a media mix by Reverend Exister.

216
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:41,820
But first, and it's a butt song, the Rudy Schwartz Project from their new album, the song Some Heroin Up Your Butt.

217
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,920
Chuck me a new lighter and a spoon.

218
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:07,580
I'll be fetchin' out the comments, scrapin' through some crested vomit where my breakfast has been strewn.

219
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:15,980
If you want a big advantage, and less arterial damage in the lazy, hazy month of June.

220
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:24,020
Lube up the tube and squirt some heroin up your butt on a Sunday afternoon.

221
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:33,820
If your forearms have deep furrows, you look like William Burroughs.

222
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,800
Dr. Manway.

223
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:42,460
Absorption is more thorough, cause the best locale is your anal canal.

224
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,700
Cardiac arrest, goddammit!

225
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:09,160
Dr. Manway washes the suction cup by squishing it around the toilet bowl.

226
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,540
A hit of smack.

227
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,580
A crosser.

228
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,600
Your ischial rectal fossa.

229
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:37,960
Ain't really gonna cost ya when you listen to me and take a new IP.

230
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,220
I like the way it nestles against my excretory vessels.

231
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,220
Caring means sharing, so lend me your spoon.

232
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,580
Snap off the cap and squirt some heroin up your butt.

233
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,700
On a Sunday afternoon.

234
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,080
Pop the tube and squirt some heroin up your butt.

235
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,000
On a Sunday afternoon.

236
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,000
Would you like to hear some sexy stuff instead?

237
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:17,580
Yeah!

238
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,900
Okay, this is something I usually use in weddings.

239
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,700
Because...

240
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,400
You know, people are getting married, they need to know where little subgeniuses come from.

241
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,060
Subgeniuses, of course, are the descendants of kind of crossbreeding between humans and yetis.

242
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,580
That's why we refer to humans as a different race.

243
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,120
But this is a brief explanation.

244
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,560
Ninslow wrote this up originally.

245
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,360
Why sex feels good and pain hurts.

246
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,540
A brief explanation of the yeti bat squid symbol.

247
00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:08,240
In该 crimes, for science everyone's demandé recently,

248
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,760
інτά겠습니다 деньги와 이곳 expandica,

249
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:09,940
ужικworld,

250
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,120
Henna Survival of p consultancy.

251
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,120


252
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,120


253
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,520
Man происходит Senator Hillary Clinton.

254
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:13,920
Come on.

255
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,980
The same, does it sound ?

256
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,080
Well, I was.

257
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:22,280
This can change anything.

258
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,200
There not just psychics.

259
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:28,560
make little subgeniuses, friends. You young wedded people need to know this. When a face-fucking bat

260
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:36,880
attacks a male yeti subgenius and ejaculates its poisoned sperm down his throat and the yeti is

261
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:43,340
not promptly treated with face-fucking bat sperm antidote pudding, it must find a prairie squid to

262
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:52,260
fuck or it will die. When a bat sperm infected yeti fucks a prairie squid, the squid empties the

263
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:58,300
yeti out like a man-shaped condom, leaving only the undamaged skin lying in a heap on the ground.

264
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:05,920
The prairie squid stores and mutates the yeti sperm and ejaculates it into the female yeti on

265
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,340
not infrequent occasions. The prairie squid mutated yeti sperm swims up the tubes and impregnates the

266
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,080
females entirely.

267
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:20,800
The prairie squid mutated yeti sperm impregnates the females entirely, transforming her into a vast

268
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:28,460
egg bag with a little human torso on one end. Sound good, girls? The thousands of prairie squid

269
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:34,560
mutated yeti sperm impregnated yeti eggs hatch out into thousands of face-fucking bats who then

270
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:41,200
seek out yetis to face-rape. Wait a minute. This isn't where little subgeniuses come from,

271
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,000
Princess Wee. This is where face-fucking

272
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,320
bats come from.

273
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,140
This is where face-fucking bats come from.

274
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:52,360
No wonder there's so damn many face-fucking bats and so few subgeniuses. Or little subgeniuses, anyway.

275
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,000
If you guys quiet down over here, you're distracting me. I'm trying to focus up here. It's very, very important here.

276
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:07,760
Trust me, this is difficult. You know what? We're gonna cut to the other song. I think we can cue up the song that we have in there.

277
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,580
I was going around collecting fucks from people for a couple of days here.

278
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:18,720
And this is the product that I made with that. So you go ahead and cue that up, fox, with

279
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,520
if you can find that.

280
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,880
La la la.

281
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,300
La la la.

282
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,680
La la la.

283
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:37,520


284
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,700
La la la.

285
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:38,700


286
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,940
La la la.

287
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,720
No one you can fake that can't be fucked.

288
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,320
No one for whose sake you can't be sucked.

289
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,760
Nothing to do when the sausage left you.

290
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,200
Believe me!

291
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,280
No one who is slick who can't have slack.

292
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,660
No one who hears this who can't get back.

293
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,020
No one who is slick who can't get back.

294
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,660
I can't read my own writing, but believe me!

295
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,860
Oh, something about the mushrooms. Yeah, fucking great.

296
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,660
All you need is fuck.

297
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,500
All you need is fuck!

298
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,000
All you need is fuck!

299
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,800
Fuck! Fuck! That's all you need.

300
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,020
No one you can hide from the sword.

301
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,600
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

302
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,000
I mean, you guys can all say fuck, but you can listen to the work that you guys already did.

303
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,200
I mean, you people have missed out on the fucks. I'm really sorry.

304
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,180
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

305
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,020
All you need is fuck!

306
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,840
All you need is fuck!

307
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,400
All you need is fuck!

308
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,640
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

309
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,540
No one you can hide from, you can't have hope.

310
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,500
No one you can Skype, you can't be scoped.

311
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,680
No kind of rule that says you can't be a

312
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,160
fool for dreaming.

313
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,260
All you need is

314
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,240
fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

315
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,020
All you need is fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

316
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:40,500
All you need is fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

317
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,700
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

318
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,760
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

319
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,020
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

320
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,020


321
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah, f-fuck!

322
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,940
Suck you! Yeah!

323
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:52,900
Yeah!

324
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,120
Suck you! Suck you!

325
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,620
All right.

326
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,280
Thank you for that.

327
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,320
Sucking cock should be taught in school,

328
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,300
Cool, Bob, old buddy. It's an art.

329
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,040
Now, how's sweet little Vera here now that she guzzled it down?

330
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,320
She can fuck all night, Mr. Rankin, but she's not too much on cock sucking.

331
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,200
At least not in the six months we've been married.

332
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,020
Well, give her time, Bob. She will.

333
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,420
Now, you take my Wilma there.

334
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,760
When we first got married, she didn't know shit about sucking,

335
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,840
and now, by Christ, she damn near drains my old balls dry.

336
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,000
You think she had a spring on her tongue the way it zings around?

337
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,160
Well, listen, Al, you old fuck.

338
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,100
Sucking you off is like sucking up a piece of spaghetti.

339
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,760
But I bet Bob here will make me a delicious full-course dinner.

340
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,300
And listen, Vera, don't you worry.

341
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,320
I know how you feel right now.

342
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,860
You don't like the idea of swapping orgies,

343
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,940
but if it makes your husband the new office manager, you'll endure for his sake, right?

344
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,460
Yeah, I guess so, but I never...

345
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,780
Well, I mean, I just don't know.

346
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,960
Listen, how do you think Al got to be first vice president?

347
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,020
By hard work?

348
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:01,980
Bullshit!

349
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,880
I fucked, sucked, and licked him up the ladder.

350
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,580
And I still do to keep him there.

351
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,960
And so will you for Bob.

352
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,420
Now, listen, while we're rapping, let's get out of our clothes.

353
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,960
My fucking prick's ready to break my zipper,

354
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,060
and I can't wait to see those tits of Vera's.

355
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,800
Jesus, I saw you that day when you met Bob at the office

356
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,180
dressed in that miniskirt and a tight white sweater.

357
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,380
I knew I was gonna give Bob the promotion

358
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,380
if he'd just let me suck you and fuck you for a weekend.

359
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,640
And old Wilma's mouth there, she's been watering for a year at Bob's cock.

360
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,700
Last one undressed has to kiss everybody's ass.

361
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,240
Come on, Vera. Hurry, unless you like ass kissing.

362
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,040
Now, now, come on. No fair now, Wilma.

363
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,940
You know I'm a little fat and I can't move too fast.

364
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,060
Tough shit, ass kisser.

365
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,560
You got some fucking legs, Wilma.

366
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,920
I can't wait to feel them wrapped around me.

367
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,060
Right around your head, lover.

368
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,860
You're gonna lick and suck me out of your ever-loving fucking skull.

369
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,980
Jesus Christ, Wilma!

370
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,940
Look at the size of Vera's tits.

371
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,380
Oh, my aching balls.

372
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,500
Before this weekend is over, I'm gonna put my cock between them

373
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,420
and fuck till I come all over her face.

374
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,420
Oh, baby!

375
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,340
You'll get a better look as soon as I get off your socks, you slowpoke.

376
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,920
You're gonna be on your knees kissing her ass.

377
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,540
Oh, shit. I lost again.

378
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,340
Bob, baby, you got six inches just hanging loose there.

379
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,360
How big does it get when it gets hard?

380
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,900
How do I get it hard, hmm?

381
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,040
Big enough to choke you, sweetheart, and a kiss will start it.

382
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,420
Oh, Al, your tongue tickles my ass.

383
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,560
But don't stop.

384
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,100
Come on, Bob. Let me kiss that hammer of yours.

385
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,780
Now, if an ass like Vera's got, Al will take at least ten minutes.

386
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,980
Yeah, let's wait till he kisses me.

387
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,300
Then it'll really jump.

388
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,580
Hey, now bend over, Vera, so my tongue can work on that little brown star of yours.

389
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,080
Oh, man, it's pale brown on the outside and pink in the center.

390
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,140
Wilma, a virgin asshole.

391
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,160
If I ever saw Wade, wait till my prick opens that up.

392
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,860
Oh, you wouldn't try to fuck me in the ass, would you?

393
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,940
I mean, I never... I couldn't.

394
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,980
Oh, shit. Fuck it. Lick it.

395
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,800
I'm sorry, Bob. I've got a scar. I'll bust.

396
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,980
I'll start licking the inside of your thighs like this and like this and this.

397
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,760
Keep going, Wilma, but slowly.

398
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,960
Suck it, Al. Suck it.

399
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,920
Oh, I didn't think a tongue could go that far.

400
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,700
If I don't stop soon, I'll suck your brains out, Vera.

401
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,560
You son of a bitch, Bob. It's nine inches and it's still not hard.

402
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,780
I know you're back there. Holy Christ, it's no wonder Vera's wild.

403
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,560
That's some tongue, Al.

404
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,660
Screw you all. What the fuck am I supposed to do now?

405
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,400
Play with myself? Will somebody suck me or fuck me or anything?

406
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,580
Come on, Al. It's their first time.

407
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,480
Let's be proper hosts and suck them all.

408
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,660
Are you kidding, Wilma?

409
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,280
My tongue's waiting to get into Vera's little red cunt hairs.

410
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,860
All right, you two over there.

411
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,020
That cap, side by side.

412
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,500
And you, Vera, watch me and listen to me so you can properly learn how to suck cock.

413
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,380
All right, Wilma, but let's hurry up because my box is tingling.

414
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,080
Then slowly, all around his balls like so.

415
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,620
Holy shit, don't stop.

416
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,360
Oh, Al, your tongue tickles my cunt hairs.

417
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,680
Put it in deeper.

418
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,000
Now, Vera, you lick up the shaft slowly.

419
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,920
Good God, Al, don't stop. Go deeper and faster.

420
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,160
Bob, squeeze them hard.

421
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:01,780
Certainly.

422
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,780
Keep watching, Vera, or you'll never learn.

423
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,860
Look, next, just take the head of his cock in your mouth and push your tongue into his piss hole and suck lightly.

424
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,660
Like this.

425
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,820
Wilma, suck it, buddy. Just keep going.

426
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,660
Suck me hard, you fat sucker.

427
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,020
Lick.

428
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,620
By Jesus Christ, blow my brain.

429
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,640
Oh, you dumb cunt.

430
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,260
Next, Vera, you...

431
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,780
Oh, shit, she's not listening.

432
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,680
So brace yourself, Bobby, baby.

433
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,220
I'm going to suck your eyeballs out.

434
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:32,580
Oh, fuck.

435
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,220
Atta girl, Wilma.

436
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,540
Oh, suck.

437
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,240
Suck.

438
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,820
Ooh, your finger feels good in my asshole.

439
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,540
But watch, your nails are sharp.

440
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,560
Oh, big prize, it hurts.

441
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,580
No, no, don't stop.

442
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,160
It feels like you're tickling my belly button from the inside.

443
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,620
Suck, you old fuck.

444
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,040
Suck.

445
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,640
By the way, tonight's night is all about fuckery.

446
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,580
So come on up.

447
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,940
If you got an instrument, everybody who hears my voice, bring an instrument.

448
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,680
And a beer.

449
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:54,920
On stage.

450
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,660
And a beer.

451
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,260
Swinging sticks and swinging dicks.

452
00:25:59,480 --> 00:25:59,840
Swinging sticks and swinging dicks.

453
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:00,880
Swinging sticks and swinging dicks.

454
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:01,940
Swinging sticks and swinging dicks.

455
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:01,940


456
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,520
резистency

457
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:09,520


458
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:20,680
You listen, we're gonna give you the real coke here.

459
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:20,860
You listen, we'll beat you the fuck out of you.

460
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:20,860


461
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,000
Catch you when the bone is hot.

462
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,020
You say you wanna blow it.

463
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,420
Spill it on the monitor.

464
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:23,520
And throw it.

465
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,180
And you say you want to be.

466
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:31,560
And get it from me.

467
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,380
Excuse me, were you talking?

468
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,700
You sounded like a chicken squawking.

469
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,720
Let's be honest, you're just a sheep.

470
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,160
Spirits eat play toy, blind and weak.

471
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,280
Bow wow, the wolves are on the loose.

472
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,860
Let me give you a little bit rope,

473
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,920
and you can hang yourself with the noose.

474
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,440
I have no pity for the pinks or their kind.

475
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,480
Too bad this movie has no rewind.

476
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,960
Perhaps they'll regret the laughs and the taunts.

477
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,040
False sense of security they so love to flaunt.

478
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:31,920
I've got no reason to be afraid.

479
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,260
No pity, nor do I have remorse.

480
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,840
They get what they deserve.

481
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,280
The plot's run its course.

482
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,260
They took from my brothers our pure, yeti blood.

483
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,500
They stole from our sisters who share common love.

484
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,620
They deserve no less than that that they get.

485
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,160
They chose their path, and now they'll die by it.

486
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,000
So brothers and sisters, my partners in slack,

487
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,340
raise up a glass.

488
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,420
While the earth is turned black.

489
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,320
Are you just fucking stupid, or you're an asshole too?

490
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,640
It must take a lot of effort to be as pink as you.

491
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,340
Come on, try a little bit harder.

492
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,320
Your impotence is showing through.

493
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,320
You should just fucking kill yourself

494
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,520
before we get a hold of you.

495
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,400
Tell me something, because I'm betting I'm right.

496
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,440
You couldn't even find the clit if it was in your fucking pipe.

497
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,400
Bob damn, motherfucker.

498
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:53,000
How do you fucking live without the TV to tell you to wipe your mouth after you shit?

499
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,160
I'm not a fucking bitch.

500
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,760
You're a fucking bitch.

501
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,960
You're a fucking bitch.

502
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,320
I'm not a fucking bitch.

503
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,320


504
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,320


505
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,320


506
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,320


507
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:01,320


508
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,220
Oником.

509
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,220


510
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,780
Oamamyee.

511
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,820
aza.

512
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,360
This dude has the most of

513
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,740
his time.

514
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:21,680
Bob that's aamatto.

515
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:21,680


516
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,580
favourite.

517
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:29,980
Maybe because he's got it on you.

518
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,300
He's got it on you.

519
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,560
so, so mean.

520
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,520
My words are cruel and bring you

521
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,540
bad dreams.

522
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,360
Maybe it's just that you're a

523
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:39,720
prick.

524
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,180
Another impotent fucker with a

525
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,380
broken dick.

526
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,440
But she likes this yeti dick

527
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,060
just fine and it

528
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,300
makes her come right on

529
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,520
a dime.

530
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,980
We've lost many battles

531
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,820
but we're winning the war.

532
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,180
There's no turning back.

533
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,000
There's no unlocking the door.

534
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,960
Enjoy this vengeance

535
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,640
so saccharine and sweet.

536
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,280
Inhale deeply of the

537
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,960
smell of burnt meat.

538
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,380
Those who have fucked with you

539
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,820
well they'll be undone.

540
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,940
The journey of eternal

541
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,760
pleasures for us has begun.

542
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,000
Make your pills.

543
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,860
Dobbs did you right.

544
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,360
And look out those saucer

545
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,100
windows with the earth good night.

546
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,520
Relax.

547
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:09,980
Lean back.

548
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,320
And smile with Bob's

549
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:13,740
grin.

550
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,120
My brothers, my sisters

551
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,880
the real fun

552
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,760
now begins.

553
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:50,000
I had no connection with them.

554
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,440
That was like four pages of

555
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,040
random words.

556
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,340
Oh well I'd like the new

557
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,600
wisteria map that Irasu

558
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:00,900
did.

559
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,020
That was almost even more

560
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,220
cynical than your map.

561
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,380
Even put down your put down map.

562
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,140
It got online and people

563
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,600
found it distasteful.

564
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,220
No.

565
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,400
Amateurs found it distasteful.

566
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,420
The people who actually

567
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,220
run this place loved it

568
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,200
and in fact made us promise

569
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,320
to give them all the spare

570
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,900
copies of that map that we

571
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,380
have left.

572
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,200
It is quite good.

573
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,180
Or they wanted to buy them.

574
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:25,900
They were going to buy the

575
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,200
rest of the wisteria giant

576
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,960
dick eating spider maps.

577
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,800
Which I put on postcards.

578
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,840
Nicely printed cafe press postcards

579
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,360
last year.

580
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,220
Nobody bought a nary a one.

581
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,940
I had a couple of people buy them

582
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,740
yesterday when I was running the

583
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,160
swag shack.

584
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,520
Well that may have been wisteria's

585
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:45,860
staff.

586
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:46,780
See.

587
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:47,980
Yeah.

588
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,840
Some people can't take a joke.

589
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,040
Money is all the same.

590
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,560
Maybe it was your advanced sales

591
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,020
technique.

592
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,300
It's not so bad that they can't take a joke.

593
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,140
But when they look at a map

594
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,700
and they see all this shit on there

595
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,120
and they get to the part

596
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,580
where it says something like

597
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,000
something racist or sexist

598
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,380
or homophobic you know like

599
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,360
angry facts camping for example.

600
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:08,780
Right.

601
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,060
Let's say that would be a common

602
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,480
thing for somebody to get really

603
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,080
upset about.

604
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,640
Angry facts camping.

605
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,500
That's really offensive.

606
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,120
Where the two black people camp.

607
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,800
So they find this and they get offended.

608
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,820
But somehow manage to slip past

609
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,860
the giant dick eating spiders

610
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,660
and think wow this isn't a joke.

611
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,320
How did they.

612
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,220
So it's not like fucking with

613
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,320
them if they can't take a joke.

614
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,040
They can't if they can't even perceive a joke.

615
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,460
Exactly.

616
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,220
Fuck them even harder if they can't perceive a joke

617
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,200
because they make it hard on those of us

618
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,660
who are smart enough to want to laugh.

619
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,460
They'll think this could never happen to me.

620
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,340
Those spiders would never nibble my Johnson.

621
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,380
That only happens to others.

622
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,960
Well it's because it's not giant enough.

623
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,700
Well it's probably true.

624
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,120
The spiders themselves aren't really that big.

625
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,820
They're not much bigger than your hands.

626
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,320
Their jaws are large.

627
00:33:59,580 --> 00:33:59,940
Yes.

628
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,320
Hey.

629
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,020
Most spiders.

630
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,280
Actually would bite you if they could.

631
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,520
But their jaws are too small and weak.

632
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,200
But the ones that give you trouble have jaws that will

633
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:08,960
pierce your skin.

634
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,280
But these will go even farther.

635
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,940
There was actually a theory before people actually saw

636
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,720
one of the spiders.

637
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,700
There were two kinds of giant dick eating spiders.

638
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:26,280
There was the giant dick eating spider which was giant

639
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,820
and only ate dicks.

640
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,720
And there was the the giant.

641
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,840
Dick eating spider which would only eat giant dicks.

642
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,340
That was nearly microscopic.

643
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,600
That explains so much from last night.

644
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,960
Now I thought I was going insane.

645
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,220
It was two different kinds of spiders.

646
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,000
Yes.

647
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:50,640
And they were fighting over whether which they were fighting over my dicks because some of

648
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,680
them are giant of course and some are well human sized.

649
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,020
Well the microscopic ones hunt in packs.

650
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:58,920
Right.

651
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,760
Yeah that was what confused me.

652
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,640
Did you have appropriate instruments to record this?

653
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,980
Oh I was too busy screaming to record it at the time.

654
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,640
Luckily I've got a hell of a lot of spare dicks.

655
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,640
I think it all depends on where you put that hyphen.

656
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,860
There's other things I don't have spares of and you know I have to be really careful about

657
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,280
those.

658
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:23,720
Right.

659
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,500
Like my third nostril for instance.

660
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,360
You can just replace as long as the screw threads match.

661
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,220
Right.

662
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:30,800
Yeah.

663
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,640
You have to be careful where you put the hyphen in Giant Dick Eating Spider.

664
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,640
Yes.

665
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,660
It makes a world of difference.

666
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,700
Punctuation.

667
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,100
I guess yeah.

668
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:39,420
It matters.

669
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:39,620
That's it.

670
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:54,180
So he was standing watching the stage and I was spinning on a ramp that was so full

671
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,340
of yeti rage.

672
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:05,840
He handed me a beer and said hey come on over here.

673
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,420
I said hi what's your name.

674
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:22,180
He said I love the one way you said the word cunt.

675
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,760
I've been listening to you for years.

676
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,000
On the hour of slack.

677
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,820
I've even made my own personal remix of it.

678
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:35,820


679
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:35,820


680
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:35,820


681
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,340
The best places tracks.

682
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:46,680
I gotta admit, it felt a little bit weird.

683
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:55,120
But a smile and some eyes just drew me a little near.

684
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:04,480
And then I found out we had a lot in common.

685
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,900
No tolerance for pink bullshit or drama.

686
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:15,620
And well, he liked to play guitar.

687
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,400
And I pretended I could sing.

688
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,980
So we started talking and thought, what the hell?

689
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,380
Let's make this a Yetis thing.

690
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,700
A Yetis thing.

691
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,860
Yes, sir.

692
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,300
Let's go ahead and make this a Yetis thing.

693
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,440
A Yetis thing, yes.

694
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,940
We decided to make it a Yetis thing.

695
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,160
Yetis thing.

696
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,320
Yetis thing.

697
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,960
We decided to make it a Yetis thing.

698
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,800
A Yetis thing.

699
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,580
So the time's passed.

700
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,220
We got closer and intertwined.

701
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,200
We got intertwined.

702
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,200


703
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,940
Like the little grains of froth in the boss pie

704
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,820
burning to the same exact temperature and time.

705
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:46,480
And we knew it was the right thing.

706
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,300
And we went to the drive-in one next day night.

707
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,700
He asked me, and I said yes.

708
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,020
And I tell you, folks, it's all right.

709
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,920
So the lesson here, brothers and sisters, all of us children,

710
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:18,020
we know that rearranging our minds,

711
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,020
we already guess we don't,

712
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,140
but we have to pretend to do it and develop wisdom.

713
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:31,160
It was way back when we simply cannot do without it.

714
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,160


715
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,220
I'll tell you this, brothers and sisters.

716
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,700
With the medicalемуinfl HIESI,

717
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:35,700


718
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:35,700


719
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:35,700


720
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:35,800
If you don't listen, your love won't work.

721
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:41,600
Do not make the mistake of wasting your time and just walking away from him or her.

722
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,220
Because you know, you know it's right.

723
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:45,420
You know.

724
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,320
Distance does not stop the Yeti thing.

725
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,420
Yeti thing.

726
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,380
Yeti thing.

727
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,700
Time and distance don't stop that Yeti thing.

728
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:05,940
Yeti thing.

729
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,640
God damn it, Preacher.

730
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,280
Don't start talking crazy to go with everything else.

731
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,160
Also, when I read the scriptures, I do not feel as love as I used to.

732
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,720
Oh, is that so?

733
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,940
That is too bad.

734
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,880
Join the fucking club of most of us.

735
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,980
Let me tell you something, Preacher.

736
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:46,260
I see you skulking around when Bob comes in.

737
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,720
You're trying to hide your fucking eyes.

738
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,400
You're a fucking mess.

739
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,060
And I am in the process of wearing out my own fucking welcome in this camp.

740
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:02,100
And I wouldn't expect to be around here much longer for people to be disgusted by so they don't notice what the fuck is going on with the conspiracy.

741
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,560
That nameless thing that makes you do shit 9 to 5.

742
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,180
That you don't care about.

743
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,160
And pays you for it.

744
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,060
Pays you good.

745
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,040
Great deal.

746
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,160
Waste half your life to survive.

747
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,300
It was a happier day when Bob Dobbs walked the earth.

748
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:26,080
Because in those days, the conspiracy wasn't in the church.

749
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,860
And that's what I'm talking about tonight.

750
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,000
The conspiracy in the church.

751
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,420
Yeah.

752
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,680
I've had a lot of experience.

753
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,620
The conspiracy.

754
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,580
I'm not an artist.

755
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,080
I'm a preacher.

756
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,300
I don't make my living at this.

757
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,140
I have to make my living doing other things.

758
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:43,760
See?

759
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:44,940
Horrible things.

760
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,480
For them.

761
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,040
The church is filling up with pink boys.

762
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,780
Halfway subgeniuses.

763
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,140
Halfway subgeniuses.

764
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:02,740
They're the ones who go,

765
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,380
Oh, Reverend Stein, I think Buck is real funny.

766
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:07,060
And doctors for Bob are real funny.

767
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,280
But Reverend Stein, you talk about all this serious stuff.

768
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,320
It didn't make me depressed.

769
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,540
And I say, little Bobby, you shouldn't be depressed.

770
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,620
Because you're going to fry in hell.

771
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:23,900
While we true apostles of Dobbs are in that mothership.

772
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,540
Waving to those poor people down below.

773
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,600
In the estate vessels of the sex goddesses.

774
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,020
Oh, yeah.

775
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:31,880
Bobby.

776
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,700
Oh, yes.

777
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,060
Bobby.

778
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,020
Say it.

779
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:39,640
Those who would make this church just like all the other religions.

780
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:40,820
Yeah.

781
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,800
It's frustrating dealing with them.

782
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,760
Very frustrating.

783
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,700
Because they never know that I'm talking about them.

784
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,120
There's plenty of them here tonight.

785
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,200
Bobby.

786
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,080
Bobby.

787
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,680
Like moonies.

788
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,420
They wouldn't know true slack if it crawled up their ass in the form of an evil snake.

789
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,900
Not that slack often takes the form of an evil snake crawling up your ass.

790
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,500
But they're the kind.

791
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,780
You can spot a Bobby.

792
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,640
They're the ones that are walking around all day long going,

793
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,000
Bob slack, Bob slack, boop slack, boop boop slack.

794
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:11,920
I've got slack now.

795
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,560
I've got Bob.

796
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,140
I'm free.

797
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:13,800
I'm saved.

798
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,280
I said Bob slack, Bob slack every day for two years continuously.

799
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,600
But it was different in those days.

800
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,140
In those days, you had to send your way into Dobbs town.

801
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,220
And you had to come up with new sins.

802
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:29,360
You couldn't just borrow somebody else's sins.

803
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:30,720
It's...

804
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,480
But they have this stupid impression that slack is a sin.

805
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:34,480


806
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:34,480


807
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,820
Slack automatically comes with a subscription to the Starkfest.

808
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:38,800
Comes with their membership.

809
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:44,100
For a Bobby to know slack, I don't know if it's possible.

810
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,300
Bob.

811
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,300
Slack.

812
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,140
Bobby.

813
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,160
Bob.

814
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,260
Slack.

815
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,080
Slack.

816
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,160
Bob.

817
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:53,940
Slack.

818
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:54,980
Slack.

819
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,080
Bob.

820
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:56,980
Slack.

821
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:57,980
Slack.

822
00:43:59,200 --> 00:43:59,200


823
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,200
Slack.

824
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,080
We're gonna grind here.

825
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:02,920
Bob.

826
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,220
Slack.

827
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,440
Bobby.

828
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,240
Bob.

829
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,380
Slack.

830
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:08,740
Latest.

831
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,400
Bob.

832
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:10,580
Slack.

833
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:11,660
Latest.

834
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:12,240
Bob.

835
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:13,620
Slack.

836
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:15,460
Talk.

837
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,240
Bob.

838
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,060
Slack.

839
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:19,060


840
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:19,180
God.

841
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:19,900
�

842
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,020
Black.

843
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:20,260
Black.

844
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,100
Black.

845
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,880
Oh, she wandered into this, some kind of a march.

846
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:02,540
It was a bunch of very, very old hippies marching and having a protest or something.

847
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:08,640
And they had a little contest where they wanted people to roll oregano in paper tubes.

848
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,160
It's real flimsy paper.

849
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:17,100
And it was like, how fast can you fill these paper tubes with this oregano?

850
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:21,380
Oregano. And one guy managed to do more than she did.

851
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,340
I think she did something like, I think her average time was 15 seconds per.

852
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,820
And she did it for three minutes.

853
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,380
It'd be four minutes.

854
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:37,040
It was like, yeah, 12 or 15 little tubes that she rolled up.

855
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,440
And she got second place.

856
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,100
How many did the other gentleman get?

857
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,540
He only did one more than she did.

858
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,860
So just by the cuff.

859
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,420
Yeah. Yeah.

860
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:50,040
And they're sexist, you know, and planetists.

861
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:55,840
I imagine hers were much better packaged, possibly.

862
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,700
Maybe she just took that extra second to make sure they were nicer.

863
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,160
She used to be able to do that while driving.

864
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:07,000
She could drive, steer with one hand and roll little tubes of something with the other hand.

865
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,320
I never did understand that.

866
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:13,340
Is that my husband asking me to sing about penises?

867
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,240
All right.

868
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,120
I ended up trying to remember it.

869
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,000
I said, give us a go and I'll keep thinking about making lots of violin involvements today.

870
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,000


871
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:30,680
and then I started thinking, well, I could try that.

872
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:30,680


873
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:31,220
But you know?

874
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:31,220


875
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,340
It was a really strange experience.

876
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:32,340


877
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,360
I will grab it.

878
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,120
Not going to the gym, but not going to the gym and just being there in my basement

879
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:36,120


880
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,540
You know, it was kind of a complex experience for them.

881
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:37,540


882
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:37,620
Right?

883
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:37,620


884
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:37,620


885
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,260
Yes.

886
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:44,860
Then, you know.

887
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,220
Lurking in the woods late at night.

888
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,900
Watching you right now.

889
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,600
There's the Sasquatch, some call it Yeti.

890
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,840
With a ten-foot cock.

891
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,760
And he's lurking right outside of your tent as you sleep.

892
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,100
Waiting.

893
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,240
For the exact right moment.

894
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,780
To play his skim flute.

895
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,720
The rod of the Yeti.

896
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,520
The rod of the Yeti.

897
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:08,540


898
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,480
Wow.

899
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,760
Even Connie fears it.

900
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,740
Bob won't come near it.

901
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,820
And it's waiting just for you.

902
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,080
Some say it's purple.

903
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,080
Some say it's red and shiny.

904
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,780
But you don't want that rod of the Yeti anywhere near your hiney.

905
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,840
The rod of the Yeti.

906
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:44,840


907
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:44,840


908
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,240
The rod of the Yeti.

909
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,360
The rod of the Yeti.

910
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,460
It's waiting just for you.

911
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:53,980


912
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,000
And it's ramming through.

913
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:13,880
It's ramming through.

914
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,860
Some say John Holmes has a pretty big dog.

915
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,760
Obviously, they haven't been around this Yeti for very long.

916
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,500
Rod of the Yeti.

917
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,520
Rod of the Yeti.

918
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,700
It's waiting just for you.

919
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,900
Right you, right there.

920
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,620
The Rod of the Yeti is waiting for you.

921
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:42,660
And you.

922
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,240
And you.

923
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,220
And you.

924
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,740
What will you do when he comes after you?

925
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,860
Several extra days ago, there was a young Bobby named Reverend Funny Name.

926
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,680
And we had tried to warn him about the dangers that lurk in the woods.

927
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:12,860
And of course, he didn't follow the notation that says to never camp in the blue tent.

928
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,480
But, you know.

929
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:15,180
But, you know.

930
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,560
Bobby's do this shit.

931
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:24,880
And so Reverend Funny Name was camped about over there.

932
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,300
In his blue tent.

933
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,940
Minding his own business.

934
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:35,520
Drinking lots of beer and smoking lots of frap and getting rather well spent.

935
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:42,420
And he finally decided to wind down for the night and get some sleep.

936
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,840
And he was asleep.

937
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,520
Pretty early in the week.

938
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,460
And well, he was laying in bed.

939
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,280
And he heard this noise.

940
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:57,960
Just like that.

941
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:08,600
Sort of like a heavy breathing from a really, really fat taxi cab driver.

942
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,700
And he was like, what the fuck?

943
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:12,180
What the fuck?

944
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,160
What the fuck?

945
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:14,820
What the fuck?

946
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:14,820


947
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:14,820


948
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,260
And he got nothing of it.

949
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,060
He figured, well, you know, I'm Reverend Funny Name and I'm new here.

950
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,580
They're probably just messing with me.

951
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,600
I'll just sleep this off and ignore it.

952
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:32,820
So he rolled over and turned his back to the tent door.

953
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,200
Got comfortable.

954
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,300
Still here.

955
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,120
Now he's starting to get a little scared.

956
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,320
but nah, it's probably just the drugs talking.

957
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:52,680
Curls up and pulls his knees up a little bit.

958
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,740
He heard the tent slowly unzip.

959
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,260
And honestly, the last thing we heard

960
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,980
of Reverend Funny Name was him going,

961
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,540
oh shit, oh!

962
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,960
That Yeti rod.

963
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,480
You know what the biggest problem with the Yeti rod is?

964
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,420
What's the biggest problem with the Yeti rod?

965
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,020
The Yeti rod just keeps coming and coming.

966
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:33,300
And coming and coming and coming.

967
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,100
It's not the end of my story,

968
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:44,100


969
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:44,100


970
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:44,100


971
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,240
brothers and sisters.

972
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,640
A few years later,

973
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,820
a young Connieite showed up.

974
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,960
And she had a few too many beers

975
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,080
and was sitting in her tent.

976
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,040
You know what she heard?

977
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:07,180
Hoo, hoo, hoo.

978
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,640
She figured she'd ignore it too.

979
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,380
You can imagine how this is gonna go, but.

980
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,440
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

981
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,620
She heard her tent unzip.

982
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,900
And the last thing we heard from her was,

983
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,540
oh, oh!

984
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,700
Oh, wow!

985
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,180
Oh, yes!

986
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:38,920
Yes!

987
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:43,160
Yes, strange, furry stranger!

988
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,100
Oh, yes!

989
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:44,820
Yes!

990
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,800
Yes, please, mister!

991
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

992
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,400
Oh, my God, yes, yes, yes!

993
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,380
She comes back every year now,

994
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,760
and I'm not gonna tell you who she is.

995
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,980
But I can tell you that now that she's had

996
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,540
what the Yeti rod has to give,

997
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,280
you boys are shit out of luck.

998
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:18,260
I'm gonna tell you the moral of this story.

999
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:21,120
The moral of this story

1000
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,400
is if you're in your tent at night

1001
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,980
and you hear

1002
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,340
hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo,

1003
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,220
and you don't wanna get fucked,

1004
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,360
well, actually, you're fucked either way.

1005
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,540
By the Yeti rod!

1006
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,080
The Yeti rod.

1007
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:44,720
The Yeti rod.

1008
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,800
The Yeti rod.

1009
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,500
The Yeti rod.

1010
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,700
And tonight he may be coming for you.

1011
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:11,960
And you.

1012
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,120
And you.

1013
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:13,200
And you.

1014
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,340
And you.

1015
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,740
You can always leave yourself up to protect

1016
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,360
and it does a little less damage,

1017
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,600
but sorry, folks.

1018
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:30,620
There's a victim every year.

1019
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,220
That's normal.

1020
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,180
A toast to your運えば

1021
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:42,180


1022
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:42,800
I'm not feedin' animals.

The Bible says the guy named Me merchandizer.

1028
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:04,800
Lord that I got it back. Jesus isn't the name of the Lord. God is the name of the Lord. Jesus,

1029
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:10,240
God, is the same. It's a trinity. Jesus is unholy ghost. It's like Neapolitan ice cream.

1030
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:15,700
I don't even know what the fucking commandments are. We're all good people. I can look at each

1031
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:20,720
one of you in the eye. I know you're good. I'm good. We're actors. We bring joy to people's

1032
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:26,440
lives. Yeah, but we don't do it for free. We get paid handsomely, much higher than the average

1033
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,060
profession. It's not like it was just handed to any of us. We worked really hard to be here.

1034
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:36,760
You pretend like it's hot when it's cold. You're sitting on the beach. It's freezing. You and your

1035
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:43,160
drawers talking about some everybody's surfing. I think God might have just fucked up, made a

1036
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:47,520
mistake, and left us behind by accident. I mean, he's got a lot of shit on his plate.

1037
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:55,520
Hello, dear friends. Dr. Gordon here. And now as July the 5th approaches,

1038
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:02,940
it's time to ask yourself, are you right with Bob? Have you tithed to the church?

1039
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:09,300
Because friends, if you haven't, they're going to know and you're going to fry.

1040
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:20,080
So check out your emergency X-Day supplies. Check out your wallet and tithe the contents to Bob.

1041
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:26,380
You'll be glad you did. Consider the alternative if you don't.

1042
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,420
Oh, fuck me. Oh, little cunt. My little red cunt. Oh, so good.

1043
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:36,620
Hey, hey, hey, hey, watch this, Bob. I'm going to shove this ice cube up Wilma's ass. Now watch her go then.

1044
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:44,140
Whoa, what did I tell you, Bob? Whoa, she's really thrashing now. In another minute,

1045
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:47,640
there'll be nothing left of the ice. I used to do that to her all the time about 10 years ago.

1046
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:54,540
We had a maid who loved to bush up. Oh, Wilma lover. I'm coming. Bite me.

1047
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:55,300
Bite me.

1048
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:06,560
All right, my little nightclubbers. As soon as you catch your breath, we'll have a little drink and relax.

1049
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:11,480
Yeah, and after that, let's all take a shower together and get cleaned up. There's a long night and a weekend ahead of us.

1050
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:18,600
Right on, old buddy. Poor Vera's cunt's been untouched by a male cock tonight, but I'll remedy that.

1051
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:22,960
And dear Wilma hasn't felt my 11 inches up it yet.

1052
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,820
Oh, Mike Killman.

1053
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,420
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

1054
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:34,380
Bob, when I fucks my cunt, let me suck you off and make me swallow it all this time.

1055
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:39,040
Oh, Maria, I can't begin to take it. I like the taste. I like it. I like it.

1056
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:50,040
And dear darling, we have to eat each other's cunt. It's not as juicy as sucking cunt, but it's heaven.

1057
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,900
In fact, while we're licking cunts, I think that this one I'm going to have Bob's ass fuck me.

1058
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,420
Oh, it's going to be...

1059
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:57,440
It's going to be a terrific weekend.

1060
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,160
Oh, Bob, you are going to be one great office manager, boy.

1061
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,040
You bet your sweet ass, Al. And Wilma.

1062
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:13,520
Thanks to Dr. Philodrumon for making that clip from Bob's sex life available to us.

1063
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:18,920
The singing, or ranting with music, was Pisces, with multiple-fisted tales of conning.

1064
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:25,300
Bishop's stick on bass, I think, although it could be Reverend Angry Larry and or Reverend Sud's Bishaw in there, too.

1065
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:26,420
Thank you.

1066
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,420


1067
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,420


1068
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,420


1069
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,420


1070
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,420


1071
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,420


1072
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,420


1073
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,420


1074
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,420


1075
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,420


1076
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,420


1077
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,420


1078
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,420


1079
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:26,420


1080
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:32,320
This is Hour of Slack number 1469.5XXX, an internet-only special.

1081
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:41,540
And since we have no time limit, I'm going to now let play two very weird performances from Fat Man D's combination,

1082
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:46,720
Pittsburgh's subgenius revival, and Tommy Amoeba's birthday party.

1083
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:55,440
The second one is our old, old friend from way back, and I mean like 1981, St. Tentatively a Convenience.

1084
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:01,060
Who, using a sampler, with a friend reading the names of heavy metal bands,

1085
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:06,840
who, due to their names, were banned from a Catholic heavy metal station.

1086
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,320
He'll explain it again at the end.

1087
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:15,880
But before that, I'm going to play a thing that requires some explanation.

1088
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:24,980
The artist is Eric Singer, and what you'll hear are vocal samples played on the Slimotron, Eric Singer's own invention.

1089
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:31,920
The Slimotron is a very large, upright wooden board with nails all over the surface.

1090
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:37,240
Each nail is set to trigger a specific vocal sample or sound effect.

1091
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:40,060
But what triggers them is slime.

1092
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:41,880
Metallic slime.

1093
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,260
Oobleck, with ferrous oxide or something in it.

1094
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:54,760
So that as it dribbles and droops randomly down the board, each nail that the slime touches causes its personal weird sample.

1095
01:00:54,980 --> 01:01:07,560
So, what you're hearing is an audio piece composed semi-randomly by the dribbling of conductive slime blurping gradually from nail to nail across the board.

1096
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:14,920
Reverend Eric Singer is steering it in so much as he is doing the dribbling of the slime.

1097
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:20,640
Oh, by the way, this is the amino acids in the background, and they will be at 17 next day.

1098
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:22,140
Thank you, and praise Bob.

1099
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:34,120
Ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for all of our incredible contestants in this incredible game of Pin the Pipe on the JR Bob Dog 10.

1100
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:42,760
Some say it's blasphemy to have a Bob without a pipe, and I say that's why we place the pipe in the face.

1101
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,360
This is a face-based religion.

1102
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:47,280
Our Bob is not a jealous Bob.

1103
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,320
Without any further ado, I would like to introduce our next act.

1104
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,960
This young man has traveled all over the world.

1105
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:54,960


1106
01:01:54,980 --> 01:02:07,080
Building musical robots, playing the saxophone, and causing a large number of Pittsburghers to erupt in flames far, far before the rupture itself.

1107
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:08,840
He helps us prepare.

1108
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:20,900
From the League of Electronic Musical Urban Robots, also known as LEMUR, please give it up for Eric Singer!

1109
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,280
To you, when it's gluttony.

1110
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:35,520

of non-Newtonian fluid flow with operator parametric control.

1114
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:18,080
Jesus. Bob. Jesus. Bob. Jesus. Bob. Jesus. Bob. Jesus. Bob. Jesus. Bob. Jesus. Bob. Jesus.

1115
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:35,820
Subtitling and E prohibited by the YouTube programs.

1116
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:37,780
Subtitles removed because English is not quite full.

1117

As some of you may have figured out,

1301
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,920
those were 53 banned names

1302
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:39,880
that were banned from a heavy metal station

1303
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:40,000
that was a heavy metal station

1304
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:40,000


1305
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:42,640
at a Catholic university in New Jersey.

1306
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,760
As performed by Deb,

1307
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,460
a local from a band called Lady Beast,

1308
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:48,580
a local heavy metal band.

1309
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:50,040
And this radio station

1310
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,340
calls itself a pirate radio station,

1311
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:55,000
which makes it all even stranger.

1312
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:55,800
That's it for me.

1313
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:57,400
Thank you very much for being here.

1314
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:00,340
Give it up for St. Tentatively Inconvenient!

1315
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,640
His first subgenius appearance

1316
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,280
in almost 30 years.

1317
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:08,660
In almost 30 years.

1318
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,000
And I really appreciate it.

1319
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:12,000
Really, I can't wait to hear the reasoning

1320
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:12,680
for that.

1321
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:15,740
I don't understand what got him

1322
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:17,560
so far away.

1323
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:19,340
We have such ridiculous parties.

1324
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:22,160
It'll be exciting to see if he comes back

1325
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:22,960
into the fold

1326
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:25,900
where it's warm and soft.

1327
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,140
Little chunks.

1328
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:33,740
Friends, we're glad you listened

1329
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:35,960
to this show, and we're even more glad

1330
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,880
that some listeners have donated enough

1331
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:39,680
to help us keep on going for another

1332
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:40,740
couple of months.

1333
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:44,160
Not just this show, but subgenius.com

1334
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,700
and all the other archive sites.

1335
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:47,860
But if you

1336
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,240
truly love Bob,

1337
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,800
and want some of that slack back to rebound

1338
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,820
to you,

1339
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:55,620
you should go to subgenius.com

1340
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:57,840
front page, or especially the radio

1341
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,720
page, or the catalog store

1342
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,000
pages, and help out

1343
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,620
financially as best you can.

1344
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,100
Now, we know what it's like

1345
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:07,980
to be on the brink of total poverty,

1346
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,940
and we don't want any subgeniuses

1347
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:11,600
to make their own situations worse.

1348
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:13,880
But some of you still

1349
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:14,640
have jobs.

1350
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:17,920
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1351
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,920
even if it's only once a month

1352
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,480
from enough of you.

1353
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,880
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1354
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:27,200
All we're saying is that

1355
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:29,900
blowjobs could go the way of

1356
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,760
Steve Jobs if you don't

1357
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:32,680
pay Dobbs.

1358
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:35,880
We also take checks and money orders

1359
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:39,320

01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:43,460

1367
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:55,320
to help Let There Be Slack.
