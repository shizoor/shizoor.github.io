You know, outside organizations are wonderful,
but they can only supplement the example and inspiration
children should first receive from their...
So genius, powerful, smart.
Within a year, most of the juveniles that exist today
would disappear because the family that prays together
stays together.
Remember, what we are looking for is that not only in space,
but also in time.
Because first it will be awkward, and then strange,
and then weird, and then awful.
Will you shut up?
It's your problem.
And we, you know, went through some pretty serious shit back then.
Anything in particular?
I think that you're driving me mad.
You're driving me mad.
You're driving me mad.
You're driving me mad.
You are driving me mad, emphasized.
Can you put your finger on why this might be?
Well, there's...
That's a lot of stuff to talk about.
Let's go back to the very beginning.
Nothing so good as a heart in pain.
Nothing so sad.
Nothing so sad.
As a tear in vain.
It is delight.
Call me a bunch of idiots.
Teenage girls.
Biggest freak.
Biggest freak.
Bob is a no-talent performer
riding the crest of a wave of mass hysteria.
Mass hysteria.
Mass hysteria.
No talent.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't even want to think about it.
I don't want to think about it.
Think about it.
About it.
He ain't nothing but an idiot.
Bob can't sing.
Can't play the guitar.
I can't do nothing.
Idiot.
Idiot.
Never screamed at Bob.
Never screamed at Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Give up.
The idiots.
Well, I beat on it.
I have for quite a number of years.
With a little intelligence.
Happy music.
But when you hear rock and roll, it gets you on fire.
Or...
Rapid amount of action.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Little wiggle.
My wiggle.
And they keep us in business.
I mean, the rhythm and the action.
Every movement will bring a surge of screams.
When I was with Bob.
Well, did Bob turn you over?
He's a very amusing guy.
I really feel that he means well and that he does not mean to exploit women.
I know I've complained a lot about his making me take my clothes off over and over and the sex.
It helped to be drunk.
It helped to be drunk.
It helped to be drunk.
It helped to be drunk.
It helped to be drunk.

And so you could sort of say, well, there he is right on top of me.
Like a little bear.
Like those little doodle-deedle.
Too little, actually.
And that's the first time we ever heard that complaint about Bob, dear friends.
Too little?
Usually they gripe that there are too many.
Friends, welcome to Hour of Slack number 1206 from the Church of the Subgenius.
I'm your host and prayer partner, Reverend Bob.
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang.
And I am wildoing in Slack because that gigantic subgenius history online class is finally over.
And X Day is coming.
In fact, July 5th is when we subgeniuses will migrate to Brushwood, the clothing optional resort and campground in Sherman, New York,
where we shall await the end of the world of the normals and a new world for we the dues-paying.
And ordained subgeniuses.
As opposed to you mere gimme-Bob type listeners.
We know this must be the year because it's the 14th year we've awaited those saucers on July 5th.
And 14 is the charm.
But I can't advertise on this fine public supported non-commercial station.
So if you want the inside scoop on what we're really up to, you can look at subgenius.com.
And before I forget, credits, friends.
The opening collages going backwards in upside down order were by Puzzling Evidence,
Norrell Preff of norrellpreff.com,
The Kleptones spelled with a K,
and Mr. Fernando Nandi Lemur.
We have some new songs and some nice live recordings from all over subgenius land this week.
But we'll start with the Instructators Instructorings from the Puzzling Evidence show on KPFA
with host Puzzling Evidence, Philo Drummond,
and from AskDrHal.com, Dr. Hal.
But you must ask yourself, are you a subgenius?
Can you hack XDAY?
It's an awesome, momentous decision, but you have to make it and you have only a few seconds to make it.
And number five is to be used only in an emergency.
Don't forget, the special instructions about number seven, which will not be repeated until the top of the next hour.
Now that you're ready for it.
Stay tuned.
Page 12.
Do we have our instructors in the audience waiting to be instructed by this instructional video?
Now don't obstruct the instruction from our instructors.
Look, that instructor's sleeping over there. Somebody kick his foot. Wake him up.
Obfuscating internal...
What? What?
Now, Hal, if you know, we want 100% anticipation.
Well, now isn't that asking a little too much?
None of this instructor obstruction will be...
...tolerated.
Did the instructor leave enough time to read the process and discuss the information?
Maybe enough time to process the information in some classes, but not enough time for discussion?
Whereas here, we have nothing but discussion time.
We don't even think about process. We just think only about discussion. That's what happens. The process gets fractured in the process.
The matter under discussion.
It's like the process of the process is a procedure that we will no longer allow to be utilized in this haphazard manner, causing the evaluation forms to be skewed.
I think we need to demand a little better legibility on the workshop evaluation forms from our class participants.
None of that crying, you little sniffering rats.
Oh, he's a little shaver.
And how well...
How well did the instructor...
...mix the drinks?
Well, you know, you're putting a lot on that instructor, man. He had to do everything. I mean, he's only human. How is he going to get all that stuff?
You know, we've got to look to a leader. Where are we going to go unless we don't look to the instructor?
I mean, we have to look to someone with leadership qualities because we're just a bunch of sheep.
Ah, to that. We must look to the living slack man.
You know, we've got to look to the master, J.R. Bob Dobbs, for direction. He can inspire you, as he did Reverend Sweetness McGee, heard here spilling out his rant of liquid slack.
This is the first time in a long time, without time, that I am talking to you.
So here it is, brothers and sisters, my rant of liquid slack.
For the only thing sub about being subgenius is being below lowbrow. Sub infinitum. Underground ain't obscure enough. And tastelessness is salty with a hint of sour.
Weeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
And it is left behind on a curve of urban camping, busking for pennies.
Cookery abounds, yet it loses its impotence. Like a punch-drunk Viagra donkey after poised coitus matlock re-drinking.

I need more. But not because I have not. But to feel more. Put the needle on the record.
Abnormality withdraws. Like a kid who rides too many roller coasters. The log plumes are passe.
Gimme triple loops, quadruple shoops, quintuple roots. The Yeti blood boils in the brain.
We have each other. For now.
Drawn by the inexplicable dice roll.
TWENTY!
Double damage, motherfuckers! You got it right in the third eye!
Break out the squeegee!
Squeak, squeak!
Streakless, while streaky.
The phallus flopping to the beat of the meat.
Hamburger with mayo, no mustard.
The end times are near. Duh!
Bob is my retarded uncle who thinks everything is funny.
Bob is my big brother.
Who watches out for them.
Bob is my underpicked teacher who gives a damn.
Bob is my fleshlight in a world of darkness.
Bob is the round peg in the square hole.
Bob is not smiling. He's glaring.
Bob is not quite equal to some of his dots.
Thank you.
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Bob is my fleshlight in a world of darkness.
Bob is not smiling. He's glaring.
Bob is my big brother who watches out for them.
Bob is not quite equal to some of his shots.
It's double damage, motherfuckers. You got it right in the third eye.
No. It stems from your complex. You are not normal. You are screwed up. I'm a mutant.
You're a mutant.
But like I say, we're the funny weirdos making fun of the bad weirdos.
I understand them. They don't understand me. They are the normals. They're all that I'm not.
But I'm a subgenius, a whole different species. If I had my way, they all would be shot.
For when I was young, the pigs ruled the world. Now all that has changed, cause Bob's flag's unfurled.
I spit on normals cause I hate their guts.
I am a subgenius. I am a subgenius.
They like their jobs for all the wrong reasons. They wear me down with their false holler smiles.
But my kind triumphed and now we will kill them.
Dead Normals!
bodies for mile after mile. For when I was young, the normals held sway. Now all that has changed,
cause Bob has his day. My shoe will soon kick a hole in their butts. I am a subgenius. I am a
subgenius. I am not bitter for all they did to me. They're only humans. They're deaf, mute, and
blind. But I am a subgenius, and I have a duty. The utter destruction of all humankind. For when I
was young, the pinks ruled the world. Now all that has changed, cause Bob's
flat.
Soon I will grind their face in the dust. I am a subgenius. I am a subgenius. Thank you.
A Reverend Dr. Uncle Onan Canobite there singing his song, I Am a Subgenius,
live at X Day Drill 1998. Friends, did you know that Uncle Onan
is what you might call my secret ghost speech writer and co-author on our latest book,
The Subgenius Cyclopedia of Slack, eh? And just the cutest thing, that's what all the girls say.
Before Onan, a bit from The Large. He is large and I am small. Anyway, let us now return to
The Puzzling Evidence Show of May 22nd, where Dr. Philo Drummond addresses some of the critical
eye issues of our eye times. I think there should be an awesome movie app for my new iPhone.
So when we begin our movie discussions. You did? Okay. Maybe is it, is it like right on the tip of your tongue?
No, it's gone. If you hold it in front of your eye teeth, maybe they can read it and see what it was.
Okay, here we go. Eye teeth.
The silence of the universe increases daily.
Eye teeth? Come on, don't mess around.
Nor without horror.
Wait a minute. Aren't your eye teeth artificial?
It's just funny to them. Yeah, they are.
Well, they're not going to be able to read. You need real eye teeth.
The chorus of the Egyptians.
No.
From all sides.
I'm stuck on a cartoon.
Proclaim him.
Well, we can imagine how big the food is going to be in this cartoon.
We can imagine all the good things that are going to happen.
And not worry about when our face gets stuck in an electric fan.
Ow!
Or how it puts a shotgun and blows you in the face.
Shoots you in the face with a double-barreled shotgun.
And all you end up with is a, like a charcoal-looking, hideous simulacra of some ancient.
Hey, wait, wait.
Now, it went all thug on us.
Shanting as the ball turned out free.
Turned out free.
Hey, Dave, you were talking to me on the phone earlier about being concerned about all the human killings.
Because I know you're kind of softy about those creatures.
I'm looking at the CNN website, which always has a survey on it, right?
This particular survey says that, asks, does one nation have the right to tell another nation whether it can launch a rocket?
Yes or no?
And I'm not going to vote, but it seems that 57% says that one nation does not have the right to tell another nation whether it can launch a rocket.
And 43% feel that it is okay to tell another nation not to launch a rocket.
So 43% think it's okay to tell other people what to do?
Well, the funny thing is, is what difference does it make?
Well, the funny thing is, is what difference does it make?

Well, the funny thing is, is what difference does it make?
I mean, by definition, when you make a rocket, you're going to launch it anyway.
I mean, give me a break.
That's what rockets are for.
Deep, deep, deep.
We are joined by stops around the world.
We are joined by stops around the world.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, it's natural, cool, yet a powerful tremendous, especially young people, teenagers, going to ship powerful.
Later on, Doctor.
Mm-hmm.
It's just so exciting.

It's just so exciting.
The enormous timber upright up.
This is no small two by four piece of lumber.
It's a huge long beam.
Cruel dick, cruel dick.
These fictions were becoming quite routine.
Common criminals all the way to the butt.
And I was out.
Go ahead.
Full of men.
Let's go back.
You got to have it today.
Scum of the earth, barbarians.
Scum of the earth, barbarians.
Scum of the earth, barbarians.
And now they're nailing him.
Scum of the earth, barbarians.
That is a mouthful.
That is a mouthful.
And hung, and hung the Nietzsche's, the Barter's, the Darwin's, the Lenin's, the Marx's.
And fully grasp the meaning of it physically.
Fill that hole.
Fill that hole.
Fill that hole.
Fill that hole.
Fill that hole.
It's just trouble.
That trouble you were talking about.
Everything's trouble now.
The whole thing.
You know, everything.
Everything's trouble.
I had a moment of trouble just as I was driving.
I was going real fast.
I was going fast.
This is trouble.
Then I saw Johnny Law behind me going, zoom right in on me.
The cops.
And then, he's...
This was...
On the way over here.
On the way over here.
You weren't...
You weren't...
You were just driving, right?
You were just driving.
Just driving like a drunk guy at 2.30 in the morning.
Oh, you're driving.
That guy must be loaded.
I have a good time.
Because nobody's on the road.
Yeah, I do that a lot myself.
I get on sometimes on the freeways.
Nobody there.
But tonight, for some reason, it seemed more crowded.
It was like late night revelers.
At 2.30, listen to the end of the Over the Edge.
And then listen to the show.
Right now, they're out there driving.
And their wives are all unhappy when they drive in at 5.02.
And the show's over.
Yeah.
That's what it is.
Well, I guess.
I think that's what it is, too.
This guy's just awake.
He's down there slaughtering cattle.
Why are you doing that?
He's just left his...
He fell asleep in the car.
He's laying in the car with the radio on.
The saliva is...
Spread out in the beer.
Falling out in the beer vomit.
He's mixing with the saliva on the front seat.
The show turned up all the way.
The show turned up all the way.
Yeah, we're looking at your house right now.
Yeah.
It's 1-841 Warren Drive.
Okay, I'm going there.
I'm going to go to 1-841.
Don't go there.
Don't go there.
I'm going to go there.
That's trouble.
I don't know if it's going to be anywhere nearby.
Don't you understand?
No, I don't understand.
It's a trouble problem.
Yeah, we are.
We're aware of the caliber of disaster
indicated by the presence of a pool table in your community.
Yep, trouble.
Well, you got trouble, my friend.
Right here, I take trouble right here in River City.
Why, sure, I'm a billiard player.
Certainly, mighty proud to say I'm always mighty proud to say it.
He just lets those words just spill right out.
Mary, Mary.
Have you cultivate horse sense?
You're a bullhead with a keen eye.
Did you ever think and try to find an ironclad lead for yourself?
Yeah, he was like Billy Graham.
He was convincing.
But just as I say, it takes judgment, brains, and maturity to score in a box-time game.
I say that...
And then he booms.
And then he booms.
And then he booms.

And then he booms.
And then he booms.
And then he booms.
And I call that soft.
1841, Warren Drive.
And then I say first, medicinal wine from a teaspoon, then beer from a bottle.
Yeah?
Oh, wait a minute.
What's the matter?
I'll call you back.
What?
Hello.
Oh, yes.
Glad you called.
Well, they the boat that boat.
So?
So, popper the water.
What's the matter?
Somebody just came in the front bag.
What do you mean?
Hello.
Hello.
That was Lemur.
Well, not Lemur himself, but a Lemur piece.
Before that, a puzzling evidence show starring QuiveringBrain.com, AskDrHal.com, and YouTube
slash PuzzlingEvidenceTV.
And now, from Lemur...
Hey, you're not even listening.
Wake up!
Hmm?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was daydreaming.
About Dobbs?
As usual, about Dobbs.
Me?
Cling thinks I'm in the same class as Dobbs.
I know.
Oh, thanks.
Look, no one, not even an admitted genius such as Dobbs, could miss how the trick is done.
Dobbs, he...
Yes?
What were you going to say?
I'm not sure.
Dobbs said I had the whole head.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's right.
So that night, I went to see Dobbs.
It's nice of you to come to see me.
I was wondering if you'd forgotten me.
No, you're not forgotten, Dobbs.
It's quite the contrary.
Oh?
Yes, I don't.
Certainly, please do.
Thanks.
May I offer you a drink?
Please do.
Oh, I'm glad.
Yes, I'm very happy.
I'm not.
Hmm.
I even mentioned that, I think.
Yes, you did.
Yes.
Go on.
Hmm.
You see, Dobbs, I...
Okay, boys, come on in.
Huh?
But just a moment.
In the beginning, everything was the same.
A glob of cosmic soup expanding at a very fast rate
and existing at a very high temperature.
Because the faster things move, the hotter things are.
In the early universe, things were moving incredibly fast,
so it was incredibly hot.
In the instant an atom was created, it was annihilated,
by high-energy collisions.
Only after about 500,000 years was it cool enough
for the atoms to coalesce.
The energy of collisions was no longer sufficient
to disengage or overwhelm the proton-electron attraction.
For the first time, you have distinction.
There's a place in space where there is an atom
and a place where there isn't.
You have structure.
You can then have individual entities.
Matter.
Stars.
Galaxies.
Life.
Taste is also a distinction.
You can tell an apple pie from any other kind of pie.
The exception being that beyond a critical temperature,
there is only temperature.
There is no easily discernible distinction.
You have just tasted the early universe.
Wow.
What worries me is that the singularity already happened.
Ah, you know, I don't...
It's funny, I heard your little thing on the singularity as a belief system.
I don't know.
It's merely an idea.
Yeah, besides, if it's real singularity,
it can only happen one time,
so how can we talk about it forever?
No, that's what I'm saying.
It's like we hit our peak sometime in the past few thousand years,
and it's all been downhill since then.
It just appears to us to be progress,
but that's a mistaken...
It's just a possibility.
I'm not saying that.
I do not believe that human nature has changed one iota
in all of recorded history.
Oh, yes, I have.
We've developed a language.
We've looked the same 100 times.


100,000 years ago,
but we didn't have as good language centers in our brain.
100,000 years ago...
Yeah, it's hard to say,
but 100,000 years ago,
we basically still lived like chimpanzees.
But we looked like we do now.
Yeah, there's evidence to be contrary.
But think about 10,000 years ago,
we were probably more skilled and more everything than we are now.
Think about Utsi or whatever his name is,
the Iceman, when they...
100,000 years ago,
human beings had all...
They already colonized far greater areas than chimpanzees ever will.
Even chimpanzees have little tool factories they use to gather...
Oh, yeah, yeah.
They're definitely smarter than chimpanzees.
What I'm saying is the language element and so forth
didn't start showing up.
That was a gradual mutation.
Long after our bodies had become more or less skeletally
and in a muscular way, the way they are now,
it still took a while for our brains to get...
Even as small...
As smart as we are now.
And that ain't saying much.
There is...
So that's my only worry about...
I understand the singularity.
My problem is I feel the ideogularity breathing down my neck all the time.
I don't...
This movie that we're stuck in right now,
this one really, it makes my...
It kind of makes me feel anxious about what's going to happen next.
I think there's some level of...
Reacher with the Adam brain meets a monster that challenged the world.
Impending.

Potential destruction of our very...
Very souls.
But there's no more dramatic tension
because we all know that's actually going to happen.
Like a huge weight lift.
It is.
It was like a weight lifted off our shoulders.
Yeah, I mean, once you just admit that we're all doomed,
everything becomes easier.
Yeah, the depressive...
Don't worry, everything's...
And then, of course, there's that anticipation
that the clock ticks for five.
Yeah, it's the ticking time bomb,
which means we have to torture each other
to find out when the show's coming to an end.
Here, take this water.
Here, take this board.
Oh!
How many minutes?
Members of the board.
Yeah, we know that the ticking of the clock makes you under...
It's not so much anxiety as it is...
Oh, sorry.
...inevitability.
Something that you know is ultimately the time will run out.
So it stood 90 years on the floor.
That thing that you...
It was taller by half than the old man himself.
Then that thing that you wish will happen.
It will happen.
It will happen.
Now, this music informs the listener that...
Cool, isn't it?
...there's some salvation, partial redemption
at the end of the anxious, anticipatory inevitability.
Wow, look at that.
Well, Herman Goering had a great train set, too.
Herman Goering, yeah.
Herman Goering...
What are you talking about?
Between killing and running trains...
In the basement of his house at Caranval,
he had a huge train layout.
What?







I guess we have to go there now.
It's a hell of a set of real.
I feel like that was a burning man for a minute.
He was getting ready to start dancing.
He was going to spin around in a whirling dervish.
He must have an enormous space in his house developed
for these beautiful model trains.
Oh, no!
There's a killer loose.
I know.
No.
Not in his nose.
Well, at least it's not in his nose.
Lemur's nose.
Before that, puzzling evidence, and I do mean puzzling,
and before that, a clip from Dr. Sinister's Radio Synesthesia
on WCN.
WCSB Cleveland, Sundays at 10 p.m.
In this case, with callers Lonesome Cowboy Dave,
Dr. Agon, and myself.
Now, let us descend into the 2008 Baltimore subgenius revival
with Priestess Pisces introducing Reverend Carter LeBlanc's
reading of Reverend Jimbo's rant.
Fade in!
Anyway, I need Carter's help, and I've got a story to tell.
Recently, I got a message, and if any of you were here last year,
you know what I mean.
Last year, there was a subgenius named Jimbo D'Limbo who was here,
who currently can't be with us because he's in an undisclosed location
in a country you might have heard of called Iraq.
And he basically got in touch with me and said that he wanted something red.
And I read it over and realized that I couldn't do it
because I don't have a penis.
I don't have a penis.
It sort of requires a penis, and since Carter, I believe, has a penis,
I think that he can handle this for me.
So what Carter will be reading is a message to everyone in the room
from Jimbo D'Limbo, who is currently at an undisclosed location somewhere in Iraq.
Thank you.
So this is Jimbo's epistle to the Baltimore.
Friends, we live in times of great distress.
War, and rumors of war, economic and ecological disasters,
and lack of predictable saucer landings are all prominent
on this densely populated, slowly orbiting turd.
All good signs that if J.R. Bob Dobbs wasn't exactly right,
he was at least...
I'm not sure if I'm on the mark enough to put Stang's money where his mouth is.
But where does that leave us, the allegedly loyal followers of I?

But now let's have a word with our newcomers who have some different ideas.
And we want everyone to come. It's just a lot of fun to come.



The details and all that money will go to the same cause.
The...
Bob in the Bottle. Naturally.
Fine porque you have?
Does a member of the other's team still want it?
Let's do it now.
All the way down.
think very carefully can you identify this damn
Cutting. Cutting.
No.
Cutting, cutting...
Oh, listen to this.
Here we go here. Listen, listen.

Uh, drill, uh, drill.
So close, listen.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Sorry, no, time's up.
Here, the sound's going in.
Ready to take a good deep whiff.
Smell the odor of balls.
One, two, three, quick.
Oh, she said it in that quick whiff.
They'll be tasting, baby.
They'll be touching hard.
Yeah, she can reach all the way down.
This can't hurt you in any way, Joan.
Don't get afraid.
It's not alive.
Can't hurt you.
Here we go.
Here's a towel for you, and there's one for you, Joan.
Well, everybody's buying more and more because in the bottle is a natural.
Naturally refreshing, naturally delicious.
That's why it's naturally everybody's favorite.
I'm going to have to point out that the human killings, I think they might be involved with the syntax.
So you're, uh.
Yeah, if you get your word over wrong.
You know, yeah.
You'd like to smoke.
Guys, syntax is.
And you're out of money, out of cigarettes.
Syntax is so important because if you don't have the right syntax,
your sentences are not going to be as good as they are.
They're not going to make any sense.
Only a cigarette smoker who has quit would think that a dog urinating on the floor in an argument with his mother is enough to shoot three police officers over.
Well, no, the real reason.
Or that somebody made fun of your accent is enough to go postal.
The guy in Pittsburgh was saying that, well, those damn pinko liberals are going to come take his guns away.
So he had to use them while he still could, I guess.
Right.
Well, that makes perfect sense.
It's funny how these paranoid militia types were completely underground for the last eight years.
You know, when we really weren't.
They were out of food and they're out of smokes.
Now they have something to do.
Well, yeah, that's true about the syntax and stuff.
But I think they should, the impropriety tax, we should, anybody who makes, who like farts in public or something should be not only exposed to public ridicule, but taxed.
There you go.
To the grave and beyond.
Well, I think everyone who pays that.
That would be part of the carbon emissions tax.
You could work it in there if you wanted, yeah.
Belching, any other form of exhalation.
From any orifice.
Said citizens shall be cited by the city of Cleveland Bluffs.
And before there'll be big PR campaign in the media, there'll be like Time or Newsweek and there'll be like a split screen of a man and a cow both burping and stuff.
And it'll say something like bovine and human.
How different are we really?
You know, my question is, do we sit in a cell?
How can we cash in?
How can we cash in?
Well, our friend, Mr.
Sister was worried.
That they would start taxing fat people on the basis that they were consuming more food than everybody else, which, of course, is not necessarily the reason somebody gets overweight.
It's not necessarily the reason to tax.
My poor paranoid friend.
I mean, he's actually a fairly spherical looking person.
He is kind of like Frosty the Snowman.
He was thinking that's what they're going to do next.
First, they're taxing us poor.
Poor.
Poor.
Poor.


Cigarette smokers.
And then they're going to start taxing us fat people for eating too much food.
And everybody who drives an SUV for being in an SUV and so forth.
I thought that was a little bit paranoid.
Of course, on the other hand, I've seen people be thrown in jail for 20 years because they had a hemp seed on their clothing somewhere.
And that is a sad, sad case.
For sure.
Yes.
So, you know.
A paranoid is merely someone in possession of all the facts.
Yep.
Fair is a river in Africa, as Nenslow said.
Yeah, but that's not true.
Fair is where you take your pig and hope you get a prize, my sister said.
She didn't get a prize for a pig either.
Life is definitely a competition.
I would say it's more like a rigged crap game.
Yeah, it's not fair because the winners always win.
I hate that.
Well, you know, whenever I'm a loser, it's like it's just not fair.
Well, the house you rig it for the losers are actually the winners.
Well, no, there's no 50 percent probability.
The house always has a slight rigging.
It's like point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero.
And then it'll be a nine.
And then you will be a one.
Well, I guess the decision is, do you want to work for the house or do you want to be the house?
Well, you could just, you know, or do you want to stay away from the house?
That's an option.
A lot of people don't.
Don't even think about what move away from the house.
You can just walk away to quote Ken Casey.
But see, in American culture now, we'd want to sell the house at a vastly rigged price.
I just walked away from my house.
Well, you were forced out by a court order.
We don't want to get into it right now.
Well, you know, it's right around in my neighborhood, the garbage cans and barrels that were nobody could sell for the last
few months.
I mean, I've been in the neighborhood for a couple of weeks now.
Suddenly the prices got so low that they're all being bought up.
The garbage cans and barrels.
Well, yeah.
And dumpsters and all the homes, you know, the homes around here.
Tents, the the cardboard boxes, the tin shacks, the crude wigwams.
You can take it.
Oh, man, if you've got a yurt, you're like the richest guy in the block.
Nobody here has a yurt.
Oh, is that over on the next block?
There's a couple of yurts.
Spreading out into the exurbs too widely.
There's just more space for the homeless to walk.
Only warlords can afford yurts anymore.
In a short period of time, we're going to.
It's funny.
If you go to other countries, actually, the poor all live in the fringes of the cities and the rich live in the city center.
Oh, gentrification.
Well, that's so they can get their lattes quicker.
Yeah.
And I've always thought it a little funny that people felt rich because they had to live in the city center.


And they had to drive an hour and a half to work and back every day.
Oh, yeah.
That was a little odd.
It's okay to be smart and it's okay to do things intellectually.
And it's also okay to do things with a gut reaction.
And it's also okay to combine the two.
And usually the way the media plays on the fears of the public, especially during the 50s and 60s, that anybody who had an IQ over 28, let's say, was probably a threat to the community.
Because.
You know.
A person who can think for himself is just liable to realize that commercials don't mean anything.
And what they write in the newspaper is wrong.
You know.
And it's fashionable to disparage people who are smart.
And the bad part about that is a lot of people who were born smart pretend to be dumb so they can have friends.
And that's a tragedy.
You know.
I try and encourage people, if they are intelligent, to not be ashamed of it and go out and do what you're going to do.
And forget about having friends and acting dumb in order to have friends.
Because those friends aren't going to do you any good anyway.
And if you know deep down in your heart that you are a dumb kind of a person, don't be ashamed of it.
You know.
That's the way you are.
Have a good time.
You're dumb.
You can sit in front of a television, drink beer and watch hockey and love it.
You have none of the problems of people who know more than you do.
Because the more you know, the less you'll like it.
So, you know.
Everybody should be happy with what they got.
Easy for you to say, Frank.
You're dead.
That was Frank Zappa on WCSB.
Before that, radio synesthesia.
But now, we must admire Philo and Dr. Hal as they admire a rich little boy's toy train.
Look at that engine.
Boy, that's loud.
That's a real toy train.
One that the kid can ride on.
He's looking at it.
He's actually feeding that little tiny train.
He's stoking the firebox and now he's...
And it's actually working.
He's using a...
And now he's oiling the wheels.
You know, better they have an intricate drive mechanism.
Now, that's not the way they do real trains.
They don't get giants out there to lift the various train cars and put them on like that.
I mean, look.
He is going to ride on it.
See?
Man, he's the luckiest kid in the world.
Yeah, how does he luck out with his cool train kit?
Yeah.
Why didn't we get the lucky...
Oh.
And then James Bond comes back.
Wow.
Just when we thought it was safe to go back into the CIA, suddenly there's a war going
on with the executive administration.
Or specter.
The secretariat for torture, murder, mayhem, and espionage.
The speaker of the house is somewhat chagrined.
Oh, yeah.
Johnny English.
This was great.
Did you see this?
This was funny.
See the movie?
Yeah.









I don't know.
No, I haven't, but I was going to just because of the music.
Yeah, you should if you're a Dean fan.
It's a good Dean movie.
Yeah, but...
Ladies and gentlemen, education holds America's future.
Perhaps your future.
The subgenius power of...
What?
What?
First to give you premium quality.
A felony.
And first to give you a good job.
















And to give you scientific facts in support of smoking.
A felony.
And do it today.
I am so excited.
So excited.
I am so excited.
So excited.
We have got to get rid of...
Michelle Bachman.
We have got to get rid of...
Michelle Bachman.
I can't wait to get rid of...
Michelle Bachman.
Who does absolutely red hot lies.
Michelle Bachman wants red hot lies.
Uh, Michelle Bachman.
Michelle Bachman.
I can't believe...
Michelle Bachman.
Red hot lies.
Always...
Weak.
Makes your head spin.
Red hot lies.
You...
Down.
With that...
Uh...
Uh...

Uh...
Uh...
People.
People.
People.
Even more young people.
Man people.
Red hot lies.
People have to go.
People are weak.
Man...
You know what?
Do this again.
Do this again.
You know what?
Michelle Bachman.
Michelle Bachman.
There is no way...
Congresswoman Bachman.
Congresswoman Bachman.
Absolutely driving me crazy.
Crazy.
It just never seems to end.
Crazy.
No.
Who is coming?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
What is happening?
It just never seems to end.
And it's crucial that your audience come out.
Come out.
Come out.
I'm going...
Come out.
Absolutely driving me crazy.
Come out.
Absolutely driving me crazy.
Come out.
We have got to get rid of...
Michelle Bachman.
Crazy.
We have got to get rid of...
Michelle Bachman.
Michelle Bachman wants red hot lies.
Crazy.
And I think people should be shocked.
Well, these writers' consortiums are always on the very vanguard.
This tippy pinpoint of an actual social movement is about to take over, and I think all of us
talking about zombies so much tonight means that the zombie thing's going around, man.
It's like...
It's...
You know what I mean?
I see zombies everywhere.
Like, holy zombie Jesus?
No, we're all pondering the idea.
Maybe we...
Could we?
Is it?
Are they, you know...
Oh, by the way, next week is...
I wish.
Next week is zombie Jesus day.
Oh, that's right.
It is.
Yeah.
That's one guy...
It might cure the economy.
There's a zombie repellent.
Magic bunny day.
I don't know.
I think...
Don't you wish they would have crucified the Easter bunny instead?
I forgot.
Yes.
My dad did!
He crucified it.
Or might as well have.
I thought it was the Easter bunny.
Easter bunny.
And Jesus should fight the dead.
Strangled it, skinned it.
And see who comes back to life.
Pulled, gutted it.
Actually gutted it, then skinned it.
You know, roasted it, served it up for dinner.
The Easter bunny.
Yum.
I think...









It never had a taste for rabbit since then.
It looks like cat.
Looks too much like cat, unless you make a stew of it.
So when the Russian folks in your neighborhood were having ham, daddy had gone out and got
himself a rabbit to serve on Easter day to show you damn kids what happens to the Easter
bunny.
Now, if that ain't country, I don't know what is.
He raised rabbits.
He still does, as a matter of fact.
And I'll probably inherit the rabbits.
I'll have to learn how to dress them.
Dress a rabbit, a goat, and so forth.
I know what this economy's...
Where this economy's going.
I've dressed a goat before.
I'm developing a taste for squirrel.
We have a little squirrel farm in our backyard, and we're working on squirrel recipes.
Some people think that's low class, but hey, there's a lot of squirrels around.
Did you ever dress up a sheep like, you know, like with a miniskirt and a pair of sunglasses
and stuff, that kind of shoot you a girl look, you know?
That's pretty good.
Yeah.
It's mighty, mighty good eating.
I think I just missed something.
Were you talking about grandma-faced sandwich?
Well, that's a way of putting it.
Floridians call it cooter pie.
Oh, turtle soup.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not turtle soup.
Cooters.
Conch.
Oh, my ears are bleeding again.
Is that a demonic thing, or is that from the show?
It's my tinnitus.
It's contagious.
Perfectly.
It's normal.
Man.
Bleeding out the ears could be a sign that you've been up.
I hope you listeners heard that.
My tinnitus is contagious.
Tinnitus is a hearing disease.
Maybe that came from Lagoon.
Now, take a good look at my youth years of being a DJ.
Hey, Stang, how was your hearing before that starter pistol got fired at your head?
Yeah.
There you go.
I think it was that Hendrix concert when I was 15.
I still have it from the Devo show I saw three weeks ago.






My ears are still ringing.
Oh, they'll always ring then.
In my case it sounds like crickets and cicadas.
As a person who's tried to commit suicide and missed numerous times, the sound of the
gun going off like less than two feet from your head will give you tinnitus, tinnitus,
tinnitus, tinnitus, tinnitus.
Yeah.
Your ears will ring for a real long time.
You'll think somebody's calling you at all hours.
Right.
Who is that?
Who's that?
Who's that?
It's the sound of your shell dripping of the water.
No, it's the sound of the hour of slack stolen from Radio Synesthesia with Dr. Sinister, Lucifer
Convolute Dave, and caller Dr. Agon, all of them members of the Church of the Subgenius.
And if you want to know infinitely more about the church and its funny books and movie shows
and so on, and X Day in New York on July 5th, then you could check subgenius.com or write

Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.
Now we will join Philo in the Movie Stars Graveyard.
The Movie Stars, and it's right there.
It's on this beautiful, it's a graveyard that's on a bluff that overlooks the ocean.
These dead people have the greatest view you would imagine.
You can just, it's beautiful just to walk around there and look at these beautiful buildings
and then see this gorgeous view that normally only dead people get to enjoy.
What you can see in a metaphorical sense.
Oh, like in the Disney ride with little heads that turn in.
Hey, do we have to say something now?
It's like my watch, there's an alarm going off now.
What?
Mistakenly.
Or time going by.
It's time going by quick.
And now a quick respite with the psycho-skeletons, or skeleton in this case, playing the bass
parts of the Jimi Hendrix classic, Power of Soul.
And now we are in the movie stars' graveyard.
It's like a new world, it's like a new world.
It's like a new world, it's like a new world.
It's like a new world, it's like a new world.
It's like a new world, it's like a new world.
Thank you, psycho-skeletons.
Now back to Puzzling Evidence talking about Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.
Praise Bob.
How was the music to that one?
It's coming up right now.
And you know, that's my favorite subgenius movie because that's how I imagine Bob.
Ah, well.
That's exactly how I see Bob.
There's a scene at the end where they finally break into the big chamber and they find Bob
and he's all desiccated.
He's a withered mummy.
That's how you see Bob?
Well, I see him, he starts the doomsday machine and then you find out he's been dead for 18 years.
He's just a withered mummy sitting there.
And there's a little note in his hand saying, I'm sorry.
And the rocket's going .
It's like, oh man.
I gotta watch that again.
I haven't seen that in so long.
I think I'd like to watch it again.
And he got me at the 20,000 robots coming down Broadway.
You know what I mean?
Oh, I loved it.
In fact, I think what happened is that I had trouble with it because I was so infatuated
with the way it looked, I couldn't even keep up with the storyline.
When a Broadway baby says goodnight, it's early in the morning.
That was that music was from when she just pulls the cord in the future plane and you
can go underwater.
Oh yeah.
Up until the building.
I want six of those.
No kidding.
Man, this skit.
Oh, now that we're getting a number of calls here.
We're trying to ride herd on this crisis as it erupts.
And here in the studio with Dr. Philo Drummond and other top flight newscasters, we will
be bringing the story to you as it happens.
Late breaking news suggests that this is the most momentous tale to have toddled down the
turf in many a myrmidons mood.
And now for a complete uptick on the upchuck and bull roar, I lead you by the nose, by
the mouth, by the tongue.
I am Dr. Philo Drummond.
Yes, thank you.
Thank you.
And I have this announcement that in 2010, a space odyssey, there were more than 1,355,000,
give or take 1000 monoliths on the surface of Jupiter.
In other news, we found out that only humans and horses have diamonds.
Like the dead Frank pool shows up.
Yeah.
This just in.
In Eastern Africa, you can buy banana beer.
This beer is brewed from bananas.
Give me two.
The old English word for sneeze is fiosen.
Fiosen.
I think we need three over here.
And now, St. Stephen is the patron saint of bricklayers.
Gosh, look at that.
Tomorrow, children are poisoned most frequently by eating harmful plants.
Did you know in 1980, the city of Detroit presented Sedanum Prod.

You know that yourself?
A typical Muslim is Athena that changes the way they think.
Yes, but how does this happen, Buddha?
It's the relationship-


It might be true.
... But, and a divine cause officially still living today in the distant past.
This is cute.
Yes.
We're not breathing, theieu'atu, Elena.

That's actually helped us.
We've seen an explosion.
This is meaningful.
These men think you know where Toledo is.
You've got to tell them.
They can't make me talk.
