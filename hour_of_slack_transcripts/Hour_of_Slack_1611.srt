1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
Oh my god!

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:11,520
My friend, can your heart stand the shocking facts about Bob?

3
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,060
If you think that it's actually true, then please find that package, Bob.

4
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,700
Bob!

5
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:01,980
Bob!

6
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,140
Hello there.

7
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,640
You know, I've been all around this wonderful world of ours,

8
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,280
and in all this world, nothing else is Bob.

9
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:22,960
Bob!

10
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,260
Bob!

11
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:26,340


12
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,560
Bob!

13
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,220
Bob!

14
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,720
Bob!

15
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,960
Bob!

16
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,380
It's a beautiful thing.

17
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,700
Here comes a beautiful thing named Princess Leigh.

18
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,320
A beautiful world.

19
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,200
Oh, she came to get the camera.

20
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,000
To get the telephone.

21
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,160
Oh, her name's Doug.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,220
That's the camera.

23
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,500
One and only Doug on Earth, is what it says.

24
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,080
Oh, yours says the one and only Doug on Earth?

25
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,220
That's one thing we...

26
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,080
That's what my name tag says.

27
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,980
I don't know if we...

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,340
You mentioned this on the show.

29
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:32,920
Yes.

30
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,120
I made the mistake of, on the 19X Day Facebook page,

31
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,460
in all sincerity, going...

32
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,480
And I felt like I needed to say this,

33
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,000
because Facebook switched me over to my human name.

34
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,540
I couldn't get my real name back.

35
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,740
That was your boss, too.

36
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,880
So I put on Facebook as Doug Smith.

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,680
Doug Smith.

38
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,680
I said, please, my fellow subgeniuses, the new folks,

39
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,240
you know, don't call me Doug.

40
00:02:59,380 --> 00:02:59,900
Well...

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,240
I instantly realized, after posting it,

42
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,620
I realized I'd done the wrong thing.

43
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,460
And sure enough, everyone here is named Doug.

44
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,480
Oh, joke.

45
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,540
They make name tags with the name Doug on them.

46
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,620
Oh, I know. I've seen them.

47
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,360
Yes.

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,420
That's all you can see.

49
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,520
It's just Doug's all the way down.

50
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,820
Lois may guess my secret identity.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,980
Must think fast.

52
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,780
I told everyone not to call me Steve or Earl or...

53
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,840
That's what I should have done.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,260
Because I was actually the first one to take your post,

55
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,700
and I cut and pasted immediately after yours

56
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,220
and switched it around.

57
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,540
And then everyone jumped on the bandwagon.

58
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,280
Yeah.

59
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,680
Don't call me this.

60
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,500
Don't call me that.

61
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:45,860
Yeah.

62
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,280
I was like...

63
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,220
But I don't know this Doug character,

64
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,500
but the funny thing is his name was all over the place.

65
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,480
Well, it's one more of those examples of what happens

66
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,400
when you tell subgeniuses,

67
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,980
subgeniuses not to do something.

68
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,360
Or if you even ask politely for them not to do something,

69
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,300
that's how to get them to do something.

70
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,820
But yet you still can't say,

71
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,540
hey, give me $100,

72
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,780
or don't give me $100 when you're here.

73
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,460
I tried that.

74
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,840
That was the first thing I did,

75
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,320
is don't give Reverend Stang money.

76
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:15,680
Yeah.

77
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,840
That's like telling him...

78
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,220
All your money.

79
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,240
Don't give a clown drugs.

80
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:20,800
Drugs, right.

81
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:21,900
Ta-da.

82
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,860
The first thing you want to do is give that clown some dope.

83
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,980
Don't get K-Rob Stone,

84
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,900
before the show.

85
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,140
Well, that's one of ours.

86
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,380
There are many rules,

87
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,860
but you know, sometimes...

88
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,420
Don't post pictures or memes involving bears.

89
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,240
Consequently,

90
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,460
the church was in a sea of bear gags

91
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,500
until it was gagging on bear gags.

92
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,120
It got a bear plug.

93
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,800
Susie came up with a great...

94
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:52,940
A what?

95
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,800
A bear plug.

96
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,860
A tampion, yeah.

97
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,960
Yeah, yeah.

98
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,960
Susie came up with a much better idea.

99
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,920
A much better thing of calling it,

100
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,520
and that would be...

101
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,040
You said bear canola.

102
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,260
Yeah, bear canola.

103
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,580
Reverend Zaphod suggested the same thing.

104
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,440
Yeah, bear canola.

105
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,500
The Ursus canola.

106
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,080
Yeah.

107
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,160
Is the species name of the rape bear,

108
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,180
because canola is made from rape.

109
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,460
Oh, yeah, yeah.

110
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:20,920
Yes.

111
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,600
Now, you could put that on a shirt,

112
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,340
and people would not think twice about it,

113
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,640
but if you put bear rape...

114
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

115
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,200
Can I say that?

116
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,880
You have to now.

117
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,980
Well, yeah, I have to now.

118
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,300
All right.

119
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,240
But let it be said here

120
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,700
that no one is thinking of inconveniencing a bear in any way.

121
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,740
No, these are bears that rape young subgenius men

122
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,460
if they can capture them,

123
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,540
and they do it for seven years.

124
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,920
They're seven-year rape bears,

125
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,460
which makes it a thousand times worse,

126
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,640
and we're not saying rape is funny.

127
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,500
We're saying that rape bears,

128
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,140
are funny.

129
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,400
Like the one in that Leonardo DiCaprio movie?

130
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,500
Yeah.

131
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,540
Does that bear actually do anything besides mauling?

132
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,820
It was on the internet for a long time.

133
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,320
Oh, the bear rapes him.

134
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:12,940
You can see it.

135
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,440
I was waiting to see that, and it didn't.

136
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,560
You saw the movie?

137
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,540
Yeah, I saw the movie.

138
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,260
I didn't get that.

139
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,140
It's a great movie.

140
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:19,800
Mm-hmm.

141
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,260
Yeah, I watched closely.

142
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,620
I was waiting to see the bear-rape Leonardo DiCaprio.

143
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,680
Well, the people who can't be taken in

144
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:28,940
by the bear.

145
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,280
They can't be taken in by anything,

146
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,860
have decided not to be taken in

147
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,140
by the idea that the bear didn't rape Leonardo.

148
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,220
I mean, do you think people left the theater

149
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,540
when they realized that he didn't?

150
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,580
Some, probably.

151
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,120
Yeah.

152
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,960
Like, oh, what a jip.

153
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,020
And I paid 19 bucks.

154
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,940
Yeah, and $20 for a bag of popcorn.

155
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,540
I didn't even see that bear's willy.

156
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,140
Yeah.

157
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,980
I didn't even see a full frontal of the bear.

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,540
I still don't know.

159
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,060
I still think it's forked.

160
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,760
I have no idea.

161
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,780
That was just a guy in a suit.

162
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,520
It's a Jungle Book movie.

163
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,740
It's a CGI suit.

164
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,600
Bring back the bear necessities song.

165
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,400
That's part of the sex video.

166
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,320
It's in the picture.

167
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,380
Not in the Leonardo DiCaprio one,

168
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,820
but in the live action double,

169
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,900
I mean, you know, the Jungle Book.

170
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,340
That would be a funny thing to re-edit

171
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,780
that scene in the Leonardo DiCaprio

172
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,380
and put bear necessities playing behind it.

173
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,560
Don't let me keep you back.

174
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,060
I may have to work on that.

175
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,060
Much work for subgeniuses to do in this world.

176
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,340
All to get a joke, a very, very inside joke.

177
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,040
Yeah.

178
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,460
Messing with the mouse, that's brave.

179
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,100
Subgeniuses have been known to slave away for years

180
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,660
on one stupid inside joke.

181
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,780
One minuscule joke that only a handful of people get.

182
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,320
Right.

183
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,860
And now you've totally forgotten about it.

184
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,780
Well, that's the thing.

185
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,860
You stop and into the vacuum rushes

186
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,900
the next strangely configured subgenius joke.

187
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,500
Yeah.

188
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:57,720
Yeah.

189
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,040
Yeah.

190
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,040


191
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,040


192
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,040


193
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,040


194
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,040


195
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,040


196
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,040


197
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,040


198
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,040


199
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,040


200
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,040


201
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,040


202
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,040


203
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,040


204
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,040


205
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,340
The last animal video I edited was about our newt.

206
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,780
And when I picked the music for it,

207
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:11,360
I knew that only three people would really get it.

208
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,620
But it's so well done.

209
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,520
Haven't you got any blowback from that?

210
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,540
Has anyone said anything about it?

211
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,400
Yeah.

212
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,560
Titor said that he could watch when that little piece,

213
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,260
that newt spits a little white thing out of his mouth.

214
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,000
He says, I could sit and watch that all day.

215
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,740
That's amazing.

216
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,020
Yeah.

217
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,200
It's great the way you have that synchronized.

218
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,180
Yeah.

219
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,800
It's a wonderful, wonderful.

220
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,140
Well, I used the music and some soundtrack voice

221
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,760
from The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms.

222
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,140
Yes.

223
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,580
Cecil Kellaway's excited blow-by-blow description of the creature.

224
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,340
Yeah.

225
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,520
That was mainly for you, Dr. Howell.

226
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,400
I figured you'd get a chuckle out of it.

227
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:52,800
Oh, I loved it.

228
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,760
About three other people would get it.

229
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,300
I hope I can play it on my faltering computer

230
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,040
when I return to work.

231
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,800
I hope I can play it where I live.

232
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,300
Well, I'll just pull out my phone and play it right now.

233
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,800
See, I've got magic TV right in my pocket.

234
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,260
I can sit and watch Walking Dead right now.

235
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,020
Well, that's all right.

236
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,520
Well, whip it out.

237
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,880
We know your technological capability.

238
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,600
I got this wax tablet that you can write on

239
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,860
and then it disappears just like that.

240
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,660
Yeah, that's a tablet all right.

241
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,640
An abacus?

242
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,360
I got my tablet.

243
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,840
Your etch-a-sketch.

244
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,000
I've been enjoying learning new technology

245
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,680
like lawnmowers and hairbrushes, razor blades.

246
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,700
Hairbrushes?

247
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:38,980
Yeah.

248
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,000
I never used those.

249
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,540
Deodorant.

250
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,300
I never used any of that modern-day stuff.

251
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,980
That electric hairbrush thing was...

252
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,300
Yeah.

253
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,020
You'd think it would have taken off real well.

254
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,420
That was one of Bob's craziest schemes,

255
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,680
the electric hairbrush.

256
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,280
Yeah.

257
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,480
They have electric toothbrushes,

258
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,180
electric all sorts of things.

259
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,820
Electric toothbrushes are nothing,

260
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,000
but something for women to, well, you know.

261
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,180
Yeah, yeah.

262
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,140
They're good for that.

263
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:02,580
Dental hygiene.

264
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,780
Are they good for that, Susie?

265
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,240
Electric toothbrushes?

266
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,380
It took me a while to realize you could turn them around

267
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,780
and not have to use the brush side.

268
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,860
You guys are talking about toilet...

269
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,660
But I'm British.

270
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,560
I'm pretty tough.

271
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,760
You're talking about toilet...

272
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,600
Using those toilet paper, right?

273
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,080
Electric toothbrushes, toilet paper.

274
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,980
I never thought about that, but...

275
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,460
Well, that was the only thing I could think of.

276
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,280
Well, no.

277
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,860
For wiping?

278
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:24,840
For wiping?

279
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,220
Yeah, yeah.

280
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,460
I guess they get these old recesses.

281
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,740
For getting deep in there,

282
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,460
to get that thing all just sparkly clean.

283
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,520
That's what I thought they were for.

284
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,860
Well, I suppose, you know.

285
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,840
Now, I've had a problem with the...

286
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,640
No wonder Princess Weasel is complaining about the taste.

287
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:37,980
God.

288
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,380
Well, you do have to use paste.

289
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,860
Butt paste.

290
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,260
Yeah, yeah.

291
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,900
Boudreaux's butt paste is what I usually use.

292
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,100
That's my favorite brand.

293
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,420
I wondered why that stuff was by your toothpaste.

294
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,060
There's more product placement there.

295
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,520
I've been using Spackle.

296
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,640
Spackle.

297
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,260
Wow.

298
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,400
Spackle.

299
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,580
Spackle that cracked shell.

300
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:57,800
No.

301
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,880
It's smooth now.

302
00:10:59,260 --> 00:10:59,820
Oh, yeah.

303
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,620
All the little wrinkly bits.

304
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,320
You sit down on that belt sander.

305
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,040
Yeah.

306
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,600
Sparkle.

307
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,360
Yeah, you get that thing out nice and shiny.

308
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,660
Bag balm and...

309
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,480
No dingleberries.

310
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,040
No.

311
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,280
No.

312
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,080
I was surprised that Sparks came out.

313
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,260
What's with that?

314
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,680
That means you're using JB Weld.

315
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,220
Ah.

316
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:18,620
There, see?

317
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,620
There's more product placement.

318
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,300
The orange sock brought to you by JB Weld.

319
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:25,880
Malta meal.

320
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,920
JB Weld.

321
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,540
This is the...

322
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,500
And Ovaltine.

323
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,860
Infinite cascade of product placement.

324
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,480
And Bag Balm.

325
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,680
Yeah, Bag Balm.

326
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,700
Bag Balm and crackling.

327
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,480
The official sponsor of X Day.

328
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,220
Mm-hmm.

329
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,160
Oh, and Big Butt Malt Liquor.

330
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,720
I just thought I'd...

331
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:42,560
Wait.

332
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,140
There is this stuff called Big Butt Malt Liquor.

333
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,400
Baby butt paste or something like that up at the house.

334
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:49,640
Oh, yeah.

335
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:49,640


336
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:49,640


337
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,500
Boudreaux's butt paste.

338
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,480
Yeah.

339
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,760
It has a picture of a happy baby on it.

340
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,300
Well, I wouldn't be.

341
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,000
Because his ass is no longer chapped.

342
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,080
At least he's happy.

343
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,660
I'd be happy, too, for the same reason.

344
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,120
And there's anti-monkey butt powder.

345
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,780
Right.

346
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,860
Monkey butt powder.

347
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,160
Anti-monkey butt.

348
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,700
For your monkey?

349
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,720
Named Anton?

350
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,220
Yeah.

351
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,260
There's a...

352
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,600
Do ants get on it?

353
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,940
No wonder it needs powder.

354
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,880
There's also a chapstick called chicken poop.

355
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,500
Chicken poo.

356
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,800
Yeah, chicken poo.

357
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,200
Chicken what?

358
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,960
The drugstore in Stangsville advertised monkey...

359
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,900
He even got me chicken poop.

360
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,680
Monkey butt itch and chicken poop and some other...

361
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,600
Well, out of the country...

362
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,540
Childishly named funny...

363
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:26,820
A lot of diseases.

364
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,300
Poop.

365
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:27,540


366
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,680
Poop.

367
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:28,740
Poop.

368
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:28,740


369
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:28,740


370
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:28,740


371
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:28,740


372
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:28,740


373
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:28,740


374
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:28,740


375
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:28,740


376
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,960
They've got this hair stuff called moco de correa or gorilla snot.

377
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:33,900
Yeah.

378
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,400
Yeah.

379
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,300
That was it.

380
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:35,740
That was it.

381
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,460
That was the other one.

382
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,200
Gorilla snot.

383
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,980
And the logo has an ape's head with a big dollop of snot coming out.

384
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,320
Well, they make gorilla snot for musicians to hold onto the picks.

385
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,580
You put a little bit of that on your fingers and it keeps...

386
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,700
So you don't drop your pick.

387
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,180
That's pretty good.

388
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,460
And they also use it for drummers to put on their drumsticks so they don't lose their

389
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,860
sticks and it's called gorilla snot.

390
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,720
Is there something...

391
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,360
work on pasties. Is this all

392
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,580
Ren and Stimpy's fault? Because I think

393
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,580
that's where it started. No, I don't believe that.

394
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,480
Boogers. Boogers and farts started

395
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,520
appearing on television.

396
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,980
I was using boogers as glue

397
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,200
long before Ren and Stimpy. But recently

398
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,540
there used to be a check on

399
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,480
that. Then a Japanese

400
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,320
book came out and this

401
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,660
according to what I've been able to ascertain

402
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,260
was the start of it all, called

403
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,360
Everybody Poops. Oh yeah.

404
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,820
Which was an incredible seller

405
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,320
and led the way to all

406
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,220
the many books about snot

407
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,200
and farting and so on. Also

408
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,260
Walter the Farting Dog by

409
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,840
William Cotswinkle.

410
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,620
It was an incredible success.

411
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,380
Sold millions of copies.

412
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,160
I have grandkids now.

413
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,520
Everybody followed and

414
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,120
now there's snot

415
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,320
and farts and so on on TV

416
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,880
every time you turn around.

417
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,880
Because it's safe. Well there was the

418
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,160
Barfo-Rama series for young

419
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,900
adults and

420
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,000
senior kids and it involved

421
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,540
the five unfortunate

422
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,780
fluids. Which are like

423
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,140
pee, poop,

424
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:02,780
spit,

425
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,060
earwax,

426
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,880
and sweat.

427
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,840
And you can get candies in all

428
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,620
those flavors now. I think the

429
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,660
earwax was a stand in for

430
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,880
spuzz, which was a mystery you'd

431
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,700
find out later on.

432
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,680
Spuzz. Earwax.

433
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,900
The first book I read in that series

434
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,440
was Dog Do Afternoon.

435
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,760
It was about the

436
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,520
battle of the little subgenius

437
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,820
kids versus the rich snots.

438
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,620
It starred Al Pug

439
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,100
Chino.

440
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,560
It involved bags of

441
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,660
dog crap. That this kid

442
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,460
had a job picking up dog crap

443
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,500
for pinks. And so he decides

444
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,160
to use it as a weapon.

445
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,700
And he collects bags of it and all of the

446
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,360
rich kids are in this above ground

447
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,440
pool. And there's this

448
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,620
subgenius girl who has joined the rich

449
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,540
kids. They can exploit her.

450
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,620
Her name is Skank.

451
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,620
I felt very close to Skank.

452
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,340
Skank's pretty disgusting.

453
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,900
Why would you say that, Susie the Floozy?

454
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,720
Ah, it works.

455
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,920
But yeah, they coat the edge

456
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,760
of the above ground pool with

457
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,740
Crisco. And then they start

458
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,840
lobbing the dog turds, the sacks of

459
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,900
dog turds. They start throwing the dog turds

460
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,060
in on the rich kids. But Skank

461
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,740
licked the Crisco

462
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,780
off of one side of the pool so

463
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,700
that they can escape.

464
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,520
Wow.

465
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,680
Of course later there's a turnaround

466
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,380
in Skank.

467
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,880
Skank turns on the repressor.

468
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,460
Is this a children's book?

469
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,960
A children's book. Dog do afternoon.

470
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,960
There's a wonderful scene in the janitor's

471
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,040
closet where they...

472
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,900
Don't you love that expression?

473
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,260
The rich kids

474
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,860
shut the subgenius kids

475
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,200
in this janitor's closet.

476
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,740
And there's like this peephole

477
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,840
to the boys' shower

478
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,960
room from the janitor's

479
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,920
closet. And they give the kids

480
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,660
five bucks to fart in the

481
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,700
hole. And all of the

482
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,640
subgenius kids are passing

483
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,440
out one by one from the accumulated

484
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,500
farts. And this one

485
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,760
poor teacher opens the door

486
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,840
and the fart hits her

487
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,800
like a fistful in the face and all these

488
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,020
half-dead kids. And the last

489
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,120
they heard, she went off and joined a cult

490
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,880
after seeing a horrible

491
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,320
spectacle. They're very good books.

492
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,400
Kids these days don't know what they

493
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,840
got. No.

494
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,980
I would have killed for a copy of Jurassic Fart.

495
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,680
Absolutely. I would have traded my brother's

496
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,720
arm for the stuff that kids

497
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,020
can get now. The legend of Big Fart.

498
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,680
There are like 20 of them.

499
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,060
Well, I'll be damned.

500
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,000
And you know, you never find them at thrift

501
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,920
stores because if a kid is lucky enough

502
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,460
to get a Barfarama book,

503
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,000
they hang on to that bastard. It's golden.

504
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,560
Oh, I know what my boys,

505
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,080
grandboys are getting for Christmas.

506
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,840
And a lady writes them.

507
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,780
Their mom's going to be real happy

508
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,880
about that. And a lady writes

509
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,540
them. A lady writes them. See?

510
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,580
Actually, knowing my daughter, she's

511
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,120
probably already got the whole set.

512
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,620
They're being raised as geeks,

513
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,920
she explained to me.

514
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,460
We're raising the boys as geeks.

515
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,760
They were in a kids

516
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,820
theater workshop

517
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,740
all summer and learned

518
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,360
how to swim and

519
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,720
probably learned how to have all

520
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,720
kinds of weird sex that they never told us

521
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,700
about, ever. That's not geek.

522
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,040
I think they're being raised gay.

523
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,960
I wouldn't be surprised.

524
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,540
I wouldn't be at all surprised.

525
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,460
What I'm picturing is,

526
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,880
the Addams Family movie

527
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,260
with Pugsley and Wednesday,

528
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,960
that's what I'm kind of picturing is

529
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,060
they're doing things like that

530
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,340
and not the quote-unquote

531
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,140
normal things that kids do.

532
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,580
You're sick, Larry. I'm sick?

533
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,760
Oh, I know.

534
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,900
Price Bob. Yeah.

535
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,740
And you, sir, are not.

536
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,120
Oh, that's a

537
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,180
mean thing to say.

538
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,600
Hey, I am the Lord

539
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,960
Angry Larry.

540
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,660
Damn. But generally, I'm not angry.

541
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,980
Slash him up and pour some lemon juice on him.

542
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,580
I'm more of a moderately annoyed Larry.

543
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,500
A spritz?

544
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,560
Irritated Larry. Moderately annoyed.

545
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,700
Well, you sure did let your

546
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,780
anger out with your guitar last night

547
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,760
during the rants.

548
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,540
And Reverend Fox

549
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,460
let out a lot of...

550
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,360
Yes, what an incredible recitation.

551
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,960
Oh yeah, that was a good rant.

552
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
Apparently, I was the only person who could

553
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,460
hear a lot of it,

554
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,000
ironically.

555
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,740
But everyone else will hear it.

556
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,040
You'll hear it the way I heard it.

557
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,660
On the saucers, yes.

558
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,640
On the hour of slack.

559
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,820
Which is sort of like

560
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,380
a pretend saucer.

561
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:35,720
Right?

562
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,280
It's going to play on the saucers, right?

563
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,140
This is here? Really?

564
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,260
Yeah, the hour of slack will also play on the saucers.

565
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,400
Only I won't have to do it.

566
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,260
You can't turn it off.

567
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,440
Don't, don't, don't.

568
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,260
That's part of it.

569
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,820
Yeah, but I won't...

570
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,880
We won't have to do it.

571
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,320
We'll have to simulate...

572
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,300
The lacquer created by Juan

573
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,440
will do it a little better than we would be able to.

574
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,820
Sort of like holograms?

575
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,560
Spontaneous, a little more imaginative.

576
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,120
Their pronunciation's just a little better.

577
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,600
Holograms with

578
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,380
intelligence?

579
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,600
No, not holograms.

580
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,880
It'll probably be physical.

581
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,000
Oh, okay.

582
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,000
There'll be another you, another Hal,

583
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,060
another Susie.

584
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,180
I could always use another me.

585
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,820
Androids made out of pork products?

586
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,240
Yeah, by product.

587
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,700
Pork byproducts.

588
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,580
Well, your other me might want to make use of you.

589
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,700
The Scrapple me

590
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,700
will be funnier than the me me.

591
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,440
Than the me me.

592
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,860
Because it's made by

593
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,640
Muam, the ultimate

594
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,220
artificial intelligence.

595
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,300
Better pork than pink.

596
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,340
Dominate your clones.

597
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,060
Dominate your clones.

598
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,620
There will be time.

599
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,000
The problem is

600
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,880
then you have the old problem of

601
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,140
no, no, he's the clone.

602
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:55,600
No.

603
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,100
Shoot him.

604
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,020
No, no.

605
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,300
I hate it when that happens.

606
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,940
Until someone shoots the real one

607
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,220
and then they're all gone.

608
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,640
Is that how it works?

609
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,160
I think so.

610
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,260
Well, you've been reading too much sci-fi,

611
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,200
Reverend Angry Larry.

612
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,440
Well.

613
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
That's just the old script writer's trick.

614
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,440
That's what?

615
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,180
It's vampires that work like that.

616
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,620
Yeah.

617
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,300
Kill the master vampire and all this.

618
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,160
Yeah, but there's still more vampires out there.

619
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,220
He's saying that if you kill the main vampire,

620
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,080
all of them will die.

621
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,340
The cruel vampire.

622
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,040
But,

623
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,140
there's still other vampires out there.

624
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:27,780
There's other sexes.

625
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,280
Yeah, either they don't die.

626
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,160
They're just not important.

627
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,480
I know because I play one on TV.

628
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,540
A very drunk one.

629
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:36,860
So.

630
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,960
Yeah, we were going to show

631
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,660
Reverend Angry Larry's TV shows,

632
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,640
but people just aren't watching TV

633
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,600
at this campground.

634
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,640
They're looking at their phones.

635
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,760
Maybe we will tonight in here.

636
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,020
That would be good.

637
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:48,660
Yeah, okay.

638
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,120
All right.

639
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,980
We've gotten, you know.

640
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,020
Monster movies, Angry Larry.

641
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,760
Yes.

642
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,900
The Teeters really wants the Grindhouse.

643
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,400
Yeah.

644
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:55,420
Yeah.

645
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:55,740
We should have a movie.

646
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
We've got an orgy of viewing.

647
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,980
Well, talk to Reverend Fox about that

648
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,500
because he's the one with the projector.

649
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,280
Reverend Fox.

650
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,400
It's his fault.

651
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,080
Oh, also, Dr. Leguim wants to rant

652
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,380
through your computer

653
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,800
so everyone can see it.

654
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,220
Don't break it.

655
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:11,780
Don't do it.

656
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,660
Yeah, so you'll have to put you in touch with him.

657
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,220
No, no.

658
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,920
He's got to be here.

659
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,540
Got to be here.

660
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,120
So, yeah, I guess we'll be watching

661
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,540
the Sir Graveson show this evening.

662
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,540
Well, Dr. Dark's projector,

663
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,580
I think, is acting like it's on the blink

664
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,000
and I think it needs to rest.

665
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,480
On the blink.

666
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,500
It's displaying funny stuff.

667
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,700
They were showing Monsters Crash

668
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,400
the Pajama Party down there earlier.

669
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:36,900
Yes.

670
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,620
That's Fox's projector.

671
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:38,940
Yeah.

672
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,900
And Reverend Anna Maul brought a projector

673
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,700
but it only projects one thing,

674
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,740
an instructional film about how to deal with death.

675
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:48,860
Wow.

676
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,460
You are going to love it.

677
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,360
She was going to give it to the Bulldada auction.

678
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,800
I decided to keep it for the church

679
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,040
because it's going to come in handy.

680
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,600
People are dropping like flies.

681
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,980
And this thing is so cold and clunky.

682
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,680
It's hilarious.

683
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,940
She was projecting it on the full metal Dobbs head

684
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,820
during an insane concert the other night.

685
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,620
Marvelous fusion.

686
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,900
Yeah, I was able to enjoy it

687
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,660
and even film it being projected

688
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,560
on the metal Dobbs head.

689
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,140
It's just kind of a strange image.

690
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,040
Seen here on slide C,

691
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,220
drawer D.

692
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:27,900
Yeah.

693
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,840
In the repository in Grindstone, Pennsylvania.

694
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,560
This is the calmest X-Day day for me this year.

695
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,140
And the show without music is so calm.

696
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
I could...

697
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,900
Oh, that's just because I wasn't playing your favorite music.

698
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,360
I was playing video game music.

699
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,220
It sounds just like monster movie music.

700
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,020
Susie said it didn't sound...

701
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,880
It didn't sound enough like porn.

702
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,760
No, no.

703
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,060
It was too bouncy.

704
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,080
Yeah, she was looking for, you know,

705
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,080
something, you know,

706
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,880
John C. Holmes kind of film music.

707
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,580
Boom chicka wah wah.

708
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,100
Well, you know,

709
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,380
I've used that for my microorganism movies.

710
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,920
You know, I'm mostly...

711
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,840
Do you have multiple microorganisms?

712
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,860
Come to think of it...

713
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,600
Oh, yeah.

714
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,520
You toast girl.

715
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,560
Zillions of them.

716
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,000
Wow.

717
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,760
Some of them are on you right now.

718
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,460
I thought I needed to be host of.

719
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,000
And you too, listener.

720
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,020
You're covered with...

721
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,020


722
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,020


723
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,440
With my little microorganism.

724
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:26,820
Ooh.

725
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,660
Everybody is.

726
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,980
It's crawling with them.

727
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:29,580
Yep.

728
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,580
You don't notice them,

729
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,220
but you'd notice them if they were gone.

730
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,060
Oh, yeah.

731
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,600
The seething means it's working.

732
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,160
The seething.

733
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,240
And what about those water bears and other...

734
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,540
Oh, tardigrades?

735
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,460
Yes.

736
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,660
Those are so scary looking up close,

737
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,680
but they're kind of cute from above.

738
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,140
I was so proud when I graduated from the tardigrade.

739
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,480
The farther away from them,

740
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,660
the better they look.

741
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,120
And they can survive anything.

742
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:53,960
Apparently.

743
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,020
So can roto-frogs.

744
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,040
But yeah, I use porno music with my micro-photography.

745
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,580
It's so inappropriate.

746
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,880
It seems to work.

747
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,400
Yeah.

748
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,220
Spiral keats.

749
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,580
I have to say, Dr. Howell,

750
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,120
you're drawing your little doodling here,

751
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,800
and that's Bob after or during his pleasurable moment.

752
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,340
It might be.

753
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,060
It definitely does look like it,

754
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,140
and he's dropped his pipe.

755
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,800
Unless that's supposed to be...

756
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,840
Is that supposed to be Harry Reams?

757
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,600
That could be Jack Kennedy.

758
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,080
It's not Harry Reams, certainly.

759
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,040
I'm just judging by the mustache.

760
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,520
You never saw Harry Reams and Jack Kennedy in the same place.

761
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,800
Oh, I guess it's not a mustache.

762
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,760
Forgive me.

763
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,280
There's a conspiracy theory for that.

764
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,340
Nasolabial folds.

765
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:41,820
Oh.

766
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,660
Mm-hmm.

767
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:49,000
Now the rain has started to return in earnest, frankly.

768
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:49,900
Mm.

769
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,080
And so the rain may indeed shake,

770
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,520
but it's not going to shape the remainder of X-Day.

771
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:02,160
We will have to factor it into everything that we do

772
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,560
as the Earth is refreshed one final time.

773
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:11,000
Well, normally we await the saucers at that open field

774
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,080
with the stone circle around it.

775
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,440
It's very picturesque,

776
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:20,060
but maybe we'll have to just pile into this thing

777
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,840
until exactly 7 o'clock

778
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,720
when we have to run outside

779
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,020
or we'll crash our heads.

780
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,180
We'll have to put our heads into the ceiling,

781
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,220
and that's like sheet metal up there.

782
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:28,660
Wow.

783
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,540
When they lift us up,

784
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,160
you know, we could get hurt pretty badly

785
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,500
if we're not standing outdoors.

786
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,640
You mean really ruptured?

787
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,700
Yeah, yeah.

788
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,560
I mean...

789
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,000
Yeah, but I mean...

790
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,360
That's a pretty...

791
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,060
It's leaky.

792
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,860
It's leaky,

793
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,940
but it's still going to be hard for a human body

794
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,080
to pierce that sheet metal ceiling.

795
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,400
But once we're aboard,

796
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,540
we will instantly be renewed.

797
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,100
Yeah.

798
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:52,500
That's right.

799
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,940
We might get a little damaged.

800
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,260
Yeah.

801
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:54,720
Don't worry.

802
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,280
Don't worry if you see your fellow subgeniuses

803
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,900
screaming and writhing in agony

804
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,200
or bursting into flames.

805
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,160
Or if they appear to be being ripped apart in midair.

806
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,420
It's all for the best.

807
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,800
Yeah, don't run towards them.

808
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,200
Just continue on your way.

809
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,780
You know, the flashing sun,

810
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,980
when it erupts,

811
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,940
is probably going to steam them all like shrimp,

812
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,640
the whole of this brain thing.

813
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,200
And from the hovering saucer ships

814
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,960
will trickle barbecue sauce

815
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,860
and 11 herbs and spices.

816
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,220
We should probably get some condiments ready.

817
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,640
We got a bunch of,

818
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,960
we got a fresh loaf of bread.

819
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,920
See, we're already planning lunch.

820
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,280
We might have a little bit of bread,

821
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:30,960
so we could probably.

822
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,260
Seven condiments will sink beneath the ocean.

823
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,540
I always thought about eating fried pink.

824
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,040
I guess steamed would be good.

825
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,220
Highly esteemed are the best.

826
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:41,400
Poached.

827
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,020
Poached pink.

828
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:42,820
Uh-huh.

829
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,080
Poached pink.

830
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,680
Those African poachers, yes,

831
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,840
they certainly deserve to be consumed.

832
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,220
Pink atartar.

833
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,540
Pulped by angry elephants.

834
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,620
Who will eagerly tenderize them for the subgeniuses.

835
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:05,040
Yes, we can just hold on until it all happens.

836
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,040
It has to happen.

837
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,520
I'm out of revenge fantasies at this point.

838
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,720
I've used them all up.

839
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,800
I haven't.

840
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,480
I'm mostly interested in preservation of collector's items.

841
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,520
I don't have that many special paints I want to kill.

842
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:24,700
I don't have that many special paints I want to kill.

843
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,700
There's one fifth grade teacher.

844
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,700
I don't even need to say her name.

845
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,600
But she's going to be resurrected from the dead.

846
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,120
Just so I can.

847
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,180
Kill her again.

848
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,120
Miss Kettlebaum.

849
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,740
I could have gone a long way in the spelling bee,

850
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,480
but she said,

851
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,500
Now, I can spell servile.

852
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,460
And I said, S-E-R-V-I-L-E.

853
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,280
And it was S-E-R-V-I-L-E?

854
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,220
Yeah.

855
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,960
She said, I'm going to say it again.

856
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:54,700
Servile.

857
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:54,920
Servile.

858
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,780
S-E-R-V-I-L-E.

859
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,000
And the next kid, no, I'm sorry.

860
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,540
That's wrong.

861
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,460
She was so surprised that I got it wrong.

862
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,160
Because I was pretty good at spelling.

863
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,260
And the next kid comes up and goes,

864
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,240
Servile.

865
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,000
S-A-V-E-R-I-L.

866
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,840
And that was it.

867
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,540
Mrs. Darden is going to relive that moment soon.

868
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,340
Over.

869
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:24,560
And then she's going to know why the pain has come back.

870
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,120
Again.

871
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,380
Forever and ever.

872
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,440
Well, maybe not forever.

873
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,280
I'm not that mean.

874
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,660
I'll let her think it's going to be forever,

875
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,520
and then I'll put her back in her grave.

876
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,660
She's still alive.

877
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,120
Still alive.

878
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,840
On her face.

879
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,380
Yeah.

880
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,520
Face down.

881
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,220
Mrs. Darden.

882
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,600
There, I said her name.

883
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,440
But that's about it.

884
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,960
You'll be getting some angry letters from her estate.

885
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,480
I mean, anybody could reproduce the Grand Canyon,

886
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,960
but I'll have the original.

887
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,420
And the originals will be,

888
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,800
very, very valuable.

889
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,360
Money won't matter,

890
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,460
but Earth artifacts.

891
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,020
I just, if I know my subgeniuses,

892
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,780
they're going to start.

893
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,440
Yeah, after a day of being away from Earth,

894
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,200
they're going to say,

895
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,460
well, when is this going to be over?

896
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,400
When do we get to go back to?

897
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:12,980
Work.

898
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:13,480
Yeah.

899
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,200
Well, I like this girl that I work with,

900
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,580
and I miss seeing her.

901
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,640
It would be like Brexit.

902
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,380
But see, the minute you think that,

903
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,380
the excess,

904
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,240
and mom will make that happen,

905
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,780
and it could be that that's why we think

906
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,900
we're still sitting here right now on Earth.

907
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,580
Yes, that's a theory that isn't mentioned enough.

908
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,460
That our rupture did take place years ago.

909
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,240
Yeah, but we're just too unimaginative

910
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,360
to really believe, you know?

911
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,620
And so we, it's like, yeah, yeah.

912
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,440
Could be.

913
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,940
Is it sort of like in the Gamera movie?

914
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,360
When the kid was like,

915
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,820
boy, I wish I could get a sandwich.

916
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,160
There it was.

917
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:52,480
Right.

918
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,280
A sandwich.

919
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
So be careful what you wish for.

920
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,500
Excreted by a giant fiery turtle.

921
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:56,980
Yes.

922
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,860
But there's your sandwich.

923
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,260
Wow.

924
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:58,840
Yeah.

925
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,840
That's the best way to get a sandwich.

926
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,300
Yeah.

927
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,120
Mm-hmm.

928
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:02,760
Chilonian.

929
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,720
Excreted by a giant fiery turtle?

930
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,360
Mm-hmm.

931
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,240
That's how it happens in the movies.

932
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,420
Spinning turtle, I might add.

933
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,540
Spinning, flying, sparking, giant, angry, indignant turtle.

934
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:12,880
Sandwich.

935
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,140
With huge tusks in the lower jaw.

936
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,000
I guess I need to watch that one.

937
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,700
And also, poop out a sandwich for you.

938
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,160
You don't remember that one?

939
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,500
Where the kids were on the,

940
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,240
the kids were on the,

941
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,480
it's the stupid one,

942
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,700
where the kids talk to Gamera,

943
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,500
and they're in the submarine.

944
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,080
He is the friend of all good girls and boys.

945
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:29,640
Yes, exactly.

946
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,740
That sounds terrible.

947
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,780
Oh, it was bad.

948
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,360
It's no Godzilla on Monster Island.

949
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,800
And who was the guy that did the,

950
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,720
he was a famous voice actor.

951
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,640
He did the voice for Heatmiser and all those,

952
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,840
and he also did a lot of stuff for Disney.

953
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,380
Not Paul Freese.

954
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:51,900
Paul Freese.

955
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,400
Yes, that was it.

956
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:52,680
It wasn't.

957
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:52,680


958
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,160
It wasn't Paul Freese.

959
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:53,500
Okay.

960
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,560
Yeah, he did everything.

961
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,140
I'm almost positive he did the overdubbing

962
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,880
for, like, the ship.

963
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,880
Or whatever.

964
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,360
I'm pretty sure that was him.

965
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,060
Maybe not.

966
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,240
He's one of those people that,

967
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,620
when he died, it's like,

968
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,520
well, now we can't have a subgenius movie.

969
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,200
When John Carradine died,

970
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:10,900
I felt like,

971
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,680
there's no point in even thinking about a subgenius movie.

972
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,940
Or you could sample every recording he ever made

973
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,280
and have most of his words.

974
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,660
Piece together all the words.

975
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,140
Yeah, right.

976
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,360
Or write dialogue,

977
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,900
which is exactly like dialogue in monster movies.

978
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,320
You know,

979
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,840
flash, gigantic scorpions are climbing around the wreckage,

980
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,980
destroying passengers.

981
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,340
And all of that stuff.

982
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,960
You know, just write scenes like that

983
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,120
into the subgenius movie,

984
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,320
and there you'll be.

985
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:37,640
There you go.

986
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:37,920
Yeah.

987
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,440
These things write themselves.

988
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,720
I love the lyrics in the Godzilla film.

989
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,540
I love it.

990
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,400
Just found out that there was lyrics in that song.

991
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:46,920
Oh, yeah.

992
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,380
It was great.

993
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:48,920
That's probably,

994
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,080
that might be on this show,

995
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:50,760
or it could be.

996
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,200
Tiny tanks.

997
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,020
Tiny tanks.

998
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,880
Lots of tiny little tanks.

999
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,800
Here they are.

1000
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,680
Lots of tanks.

1001
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,140
Here are coming lots and lots of tiny,

1002
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,440
tiny, tiny tanks.

1003
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,240
Tiny tanks.

1004
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,580
And they're coming here.

1005
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,640
Now.

1006
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,540
Now.

1007
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,420
Now.

1008
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,880
I guess if I would have heard you,

1009
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,260
I would have been able to play exactly what you were doing.

1010
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,500
So hopefully we got some of it anyway.

1011
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,340
Yeah, you got it.

1012
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,600
But I am working on a surf version of that.

1013
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,140
We could do it tonight, or try.

1014
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,340
You know, if I had ever learned,

1015
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,140
how to play guitar,

1016
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:28,160
my band would have specialized in movie and TV themes.

1017
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,340
Heavy, hard rock versions.

1018
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,160
I will be right back.

1019
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,860
Like, it'd be the hard rock version of the Andy Griffith theme.

1020
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,320
Hard rock version of the Leave it to Beaver theme.

1021
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:38,980
Uh-huh.

1022
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,780
Green Acres, you know.

1023
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,740
That's actually been done.

1024
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,780
A lot of those have been done over the years.

1025
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,940
Vic Mizzi.

1026
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,560
Vic Mizzi.

1027
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,300
That was the guy who did the Green Acres.

1028
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:52,600
Yeah, the Green Acres music.

1029
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,940
Farm livin' is the life for me.

1030
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,060
Adam's family.

1031
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:02,460
England spreadin' out so far and wide.

1032
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,140
Red barns and green, green fields.

1033
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,740
You can take Manhattan, just give me the countryside.

1034
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:15,840
Green Acres, we are there.

1035
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,520
The day in the life of Green Acres.

1036
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,340
New York is where I'd rather stay.

1037
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:31,420
I get allergic when I'm smelling hay.

1038
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:37,060
I just adore a penthouse view.

1039
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,440
With a look at Central Park.

1040
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,400
Darling, I love you, but give me Park Avenue.

1041
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,100
Green Acres, we are there.

1042
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:59,640
The chores, the stores, fresh air, Times Square.

1043
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,620
You are my wife, goodbye city life.

1044
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,180
Green Acres, we are there.

1045
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:21,500
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, Green Acres is the place.

1046
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:40,160
Where we were and whatever we were doing when the last train left for Green Acres.

1047
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,760
With a side trip to, uh.

1048
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,500
Petico Junction.

1049
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,480
Petico Junction, yes, Hooterville.

1050
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:51,480
In fact, a guest on my show pointed out that a number of those shows are all linked together.

1051
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:51,480


1052
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:51,480


1053
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:51,480


1054
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:51,480


1055
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:51,480


1056
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,340
together in the same universe, including Hogan's Heroes.

1057
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,160
What?

1058
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,540
Some of those prisoners had home memories of Hooterville and Petticoat.

1059
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,540
Really?

1060
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,200
And Jug Tussle?

1061
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:02,840
Yes.

1062
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,840
Oh, no, that's a new one.

1063
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,600
It was pointed out.

1064
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,120
Damn.

1065
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,500
By my guest.

1066
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,320
He showed me.

1067
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,140
He cited it.

1068
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,940
Well, Beverly Hillbillies.

1069
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,180
Beverly Hillbillies is also linked to those.

1070
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,880
It's in the same universe.

1071
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,120
Billy's Petticoat Neighbors.

1072
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:16,440
Right.

1073
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,620
Gomer Pyle.

1074
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,220
Gomer Pyle, of course, yes.

1075
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,640
Anything featuring Goober.

1076
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,780
And then, of course, the whole Andy Griffith show.

1077
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,580
F-Truth.

1078
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:30,820
That might be historically linked, possibly.

1079
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,480
F-Truth.

1080
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:37,920
An episode in the past, maybe, before Green Acres ever was planted

1081
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:46,100
or before the Fair Daughters splashed in the tower at Petticoat Junction.

1082
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,920
The time tunnel.

1083
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,320
54.

1084
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,100
We could throw them all.

1085
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:50,460
We could throw them all together.

1086
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,380
There's a holdup in the Bronx.

1087
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,280
Brooklyn's broken out in fights.

1088
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,740
There's a traffic jam in Harlem that's backed up to Jackson Heights.

1089
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,360
There's a scout troop short a child.

1090
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,140
Crew chefs do at Idlewild.

1091
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,040
Car 54, where are you?

1092
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,020
Not 64.

1093
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:11,800
54.

1094
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,060
Which starred who?

1095
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,760
Have you ever imagined sex with Joey Ross?

1096
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,560
It starred Joey Ross.

1097
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,000
I have.

1098
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,200
I've gone to that trouble, but I know others who have.

1099
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,820
Also starred in the incredible movie, Sh, the Octopus.

1100
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,440
I don't know if you've ever seen it.

1101
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,500
That would be some rough sex.

1102
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,160
One of the most unusual movies ever made.

1103
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,020
Sh, the Octopus, it's called.

1104
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,400
Have you ever seen that one, Stan?

1105
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,340
No.

1106
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,500
You never saw Sh, the Octopus?

1107
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,440
No.

1108
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:39,720
Really?

1109
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,660
I remember the movie.

1110
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,880
Is that a sequel to Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte?

1111
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,300
No, it's not.

1112
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:48,620
Or Hack, Hack, Sweet Has-Been, starring Olivia Hackahan.

1113
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,180
But.

1114
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:56,660
But Sh, the Octopus stands with earthworm tractors as one of the most subgenius films.

1115
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,580
You have to have seen earthworm tractors.

1116
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,020
No.

1117
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,280
Wow.

1118
00:36:59,340 --> 00:36:59,900
No, I haven't.

1119
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,360
I didn't see Ant Farm Dickhole, though.

1120
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,800
Ant Farm Dickhole was shown here at X Day a few years ago.

1121
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,220
But, you see.

1122
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,000
You think these are jokes, but they're real movie titles.

1123
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,600
The Octopus is a strange film.

1124
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,940
And it has some.

1125
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,140
One incredible special effect in it.

1126
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,060
I thought I may have discussed that in the past.

1127
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,000
I think you did.

1128
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:26,420
Yeah.

1129
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,660
But many are the treasures to be found.

1130
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,200
Yes, you don't have to dig that deep to find them either.

1131
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,380
In either Book of the Subgenius or the pamphlet number one,

1132
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:45,500
the worst, the greatest worst movie in the world is mentioned.

1133
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,220
It's called Scarlet Love.

1134
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,840
It's a love directed by Palmer Rocky in Dallas.

1135
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,320
It was shown four walled for one week.

1136
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,220
I saw it twice.

1137
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,840
Me and everyone else in the theater just about died laughing.

1138
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,380
The director was mortified.

1139
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,800
And he moved.

1140
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,840
I pursued him.

1141
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,200
I tried to encourage him that it would fit into the midnight movies thing.

1142
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,520
It was really a crowd pleaser.

1143
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,640
He didn't mean it that way.

1144
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,200
Well, the.

1145
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,080
He died.

1146
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,860
The last time I begged him about it, he said,

1147
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,340
that movie is never going to see the light through it away.

1148
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:25,920
It's a prince.

1149
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,380
They're all dead.

1150
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,320
But later, a lab guy in L.A.

1151
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:42,660
wrote to me and said, I know you're interested in this movie, and he he still comes into our lab every week and rents our screening room to look at his movie.

1152
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,160
And he makes notes because he's still planning to change it.

1153
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,200
This is like 15 years.

1154
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,860
Later, wow.

1155
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,240
But it then then terrible one.

1156
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,460
You say that he died.

1157
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,860
And I thought, well, that's it.

1158
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,520
Nobody's ever going to see that movie.

1159
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,000
Well, guess what?

1160
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,660
Some film lab guys did.

1161
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,320
They kept movies that were being thrown out of film labs.

1162
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:12,120
My movie, World of the Future, was being thrown out of the lab in Dallas when the guy who narrated it and worked there said, hey, Doug, is this supposed to be in the trash?

1163
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,420
That's how it got saved.

1164
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,780
But somebody saved Scarlet Love that way.

1165
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,000
It's got a new title, apparently.

1166
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,940
But Philo found the article about it.

1167
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:26,100
These people have a bunch of shelf movies that they save.

1168
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,700
They were just lab technicians.

1169
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:33,480
And Scarlet Love is the first one they're planning to restore and put on DVD.

1170
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
I'm excited about that.

1171
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,920
Yeah, that's another reason not to kill yourself before X-Day.

1172
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,660
I'm telling you, no matter how bad it gets, wait until Scarlet Love comes out.

1173
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,120
You'll have a reason to live again.

1174
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:46,280
Yeah.

1175
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,900
It's that good bad.

1176
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:52,460
Just as suddenly everything in your life gets straightened out,

1177
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,500
all your financial troubles are now away.

1178
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,640
You've been given a clean bill of health.

1179
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,060
There's new love in your life.

1180
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,880
Everything is fine.

1181
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:06,600
Now it's time to burn everything up and shoot up in the sky with this base creature.

1182
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,440
Ta-da!

1183
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,440
Yeah.

1184
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:14,380
I was going to say, I'm thinking that the movie we might be showing is Manos.

1185
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:15,700
Manos.

1186
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,620
The Hand of Death.

1187
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,360
I've never watched that all the way through.

1188
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:18,960
Hands of Fate.

1189
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,420
No, it is pretty difficult.

1190
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:27,540
Now I understand the person who played the little girl in that has written a book and is doing conventions and stuff.

1191
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,840
Actually, she was the Manos.

1192
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,160
That's his daughter.

1193
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,000
The man that plays Manos.

1194
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,740
That's his daughter.

1195
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,680
Like Red Button's daughter.

1196
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,400
Yeah.

1197
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:43,740
And they are making another movie, a Manos 2, as a comedy.

1198
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:44,840
Manos 2.

1199
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,440
There's nothing else.

1200
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,560
There's nothing else you can do with it but do that.

1201
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:46,680
Finally, they did it.

1202
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,820
They have a GoFundMe or a Kickstarter or something to try and put this out.

1203
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,960
But it showed a picture of the man that played Manos.

1204
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,200
And, I mean, he still kind of looks the same, but, you know, a bit older.

1205
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,260
Clearly, there's some mileage on there.

1206
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,580
Yes.

1207
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:01,900
Yeah.

1208
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,720
Unfortunately, the goat guy is John Reynolds, I think it was.

1209
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,360
He committed suicide sometime.

1210
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,020
Yeah, you know, the prosthetics they made for his legs.

1211
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,600
He put them on backwards.

1212
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,120
Oh, good Lord.

1213
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,360
So, the guy was in pain all the time.

1214
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,620
And so, he got hooked.

1215
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,720
This is what I've...

1216
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,300
He kept kicking himself.

1217
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,200
He was...

1218
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,140
Because he was supposed to be a pan, you know.

1219
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,360
And his...

1220
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,340
And that's the reason why he walked so wonky.

1221
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,320
Because he was wearing these prosthetic legs backwards.

1222
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,600
And no one bothered to tell him that, you know, hey, put those on the other way.

1223
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,900
The movie was shot, I believe, in eight-minute increments.

1224
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,560
However much...

1225
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,880
An eight-millimeter...

1226
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,900
Were they buying short ends or something?

1227
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,640
Yeah, they were just...

1228
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,500
He would buy whatever.

1229
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,220
And everyone was promised money.

1230
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,580
And they didn't have sound.

1231
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,220
It was made in eight-millimeter?

1232
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,540
I don't know if it was eight.

1233
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,280
Probably 16.

1234
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,700
There was a hand crank thing, so it would be like a hundred-foot roll.

1235
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,900
That's about two and a half minutes.

1236
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:00,440
Yeah.

1237
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,800
He was shooting it in that.

1238
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,440
And all of the voices on the film are three people.

1239
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,220
The little girl is portrayed by an adult.

1240
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,960
And apparently when they premiered the show, the movie,

1241
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,820
the little girl cried because it wasn't her voice.

1242
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:20,900
Oh.

1243
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,300
Literally, it was three people that voiced everyone in the movie.

1244
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,800
And the main man in the movie is the guy that wrote it, directed it, starred in it, everything.

1245
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,360
And, yeah.

1246
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,380
But to me, that's one of the worst.

1247
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,520
There's so many that are much worse.

1248
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:40,740
Oh.

1249
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:40,980
But...

1250
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,200
Have you ever heard of...

1251
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,380
Neil Breen?

1252
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,540
Neil Breen?

1253
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,120
B-R-E-E-N.

1254
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:47,960
Wow.

1255
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:52,740
He was a Las Vegas realty agent who had a lot of plastic surgery

1256
00:42:52,740 --> 00:43:02,660
and decided to become a film auteur where he's a producer, director, writer, lead, caterer, everything.

1257
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:03,760
Food service.

1258
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:08,240
I didn't think true badness could exist anymore.

1259
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,340
Neil Breen has reaffirmed my faith.

1260
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:11,960
Yes.

1261
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,040
Yes.

1262
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,180
Yes.

1263
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,180


1264
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,180


1265
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,180


1266
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,180


1267
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,180


1268
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,180


1269
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,180


1270
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,180


1271
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,180


1272
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,180


1273
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,180


1274
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,180


1275
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,960
Every movie, he's some messiah out to save man by...

1276
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,320
Usually by hacking government secrets.

1277
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,840
And he has all these laptops that are never on.

1278
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,720
And he drops tuna on his crotch.

1279
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,860
And it's just...

1280
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:25,440
It's nuts.

1281
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,700
It's totally nuts.

1282
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:27,320
Okay.

1283
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,600
You have to elaborate on...

1284
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,900
He drops tuna on his crotch.

1285
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:36,540
Well, that's one of his movies, Double Down, where he's out in the desert wearing mom jeans

1286
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,480
with a lot of dead laptops.

1287
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,080
He's always got dead laptops.

1288
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,180
And he does an illustration.

1289
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,080
He's a little advised nude scene.

1290
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:48,000
You get to see the back of his nuts in one, which I could have lived without seeing the

1291
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,760
back of his nuts.

1292
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,200
But he's had so much work done, he looks like a surprised fox.

1293
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,040
When...

1294
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,280
What's this guy doing?

1295
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,700
What era is this?

1296
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,500
It's contemporary.

1297
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:00,800
Oh, he's still...

1298
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,780
Well, he actually has laptops.

1299
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,720
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1300
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,920
He's a YouTube.

1301
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,440
YouTube has a Neil Breen.

1302
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,020
Oh.

1303
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:07,320
God.

1304
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,780
Well, that gives us something to look forward to.

1305
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,240
Right.

1306
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,060
Straight to YouTube.

1307
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,720
Faithful findings.

1308
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:12,280
Double Down.

1309
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,820
There's a lot of movies like that.

1310
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,140
Oh, yeah.

1311
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,400
I am here dot, dot, dot, dot now.

1312
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,500
Four dots in the ellipses.

1313
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,600
That's one dot too many.

1314
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:28,520
And none of his leading ladies will ever want to be in the same room with him again.

1315
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,340
It's a rough ride.

1316
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,700
Oh, well, he got it in the can.

1317
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,200
He got it done.

1318
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,120
He got it done.

1319
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,140
He got it in the can.

1320
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,440
That's more than many people...

1321
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,700
Oh, if I had a nickel for every time that happened to me.

1322
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,240
You'd have ten cents.

1323
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,320
Yes, I would.

1324
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,900
I'd have little or no cents.

1325
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:51,160
Well, this is certainly an inspiring episode of the Hour of Slack.

1326
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:56,660
It's strange how they all occasionally veer into cinema criticism.

1327
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:04,620
Yes, the visual dimension is close to every subgenius in off moments.

1328
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:09,680
One tends to return to those times spent watching the flickering screen.

1329
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:15,180
I always believed that the Church of the Subgenius was kind of based on films.

1330
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:15,800
Yeah.

1331
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,600
Worlds.

1332
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,040
Yeah.

1333
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,660
That was where I got my inspiration.

1334
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,820
Monster movies and radio preachers.

1335
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,800
Oh, yeah, so that's the reason why, you know...

1336
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,820
I mean, I've always...

1337
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,280
That's what intrigued me.

1338
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,260
Well, Bob is the ultimate monster in some ways.

1339
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,240
Mm-hmm.

1340
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,900
You think he could take Godzilla?

1341
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,280
Yeah.

1342
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,160
Oh, yeah.

1343
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:39,200
But Godzilla would slip on Gamera's banana peel.

1344
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,700
You know, and break his neck.

1345
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,920
Combine Toei and Toho monsters in the same picture?

1346
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:52,840
Well, the problem is we need a shot of Bob carrying the swooning girl like all the other monsters.

1347
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,740
Then he can legitimately join the Pantheon.

1348
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,500
They all carry the swooning girl, even the creature from the Black Lagoon,

1349
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,000
who can hardly have a pragmatic interest in her.

1350
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,600
Well, this isn't a value judgment,

1351
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,140
but the difference between comic fiction...

1352
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,960
...and monster fans is...

1353
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,700
...is an abyss, yeah.

1354
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:18,320
For the monster fans, the primary image is the big ugly guy carrying a pretty girl,

1355
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,700
whereas for comic book fans, what's the primary image?

1356
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,400
Two guys grappling in their tights.

1357
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:24,640
Yeah.

1358
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,440
Yes, yes.

1359
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,360
So, you know...

1360
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,800
That's why I've never really been a comic...

1361
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,280
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

1362
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,140
No, and they're battering the bejesus out of each other.

1363
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,740
Gary Arlington, while he was still alive, said,

1364
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,120
All the people in the comics in my store, what are they doing?

1365
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,360
They're hitting each other.

1366
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:42,920
You open these things, and I sell them,

1367
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,120
and they're hitting each other on every page.

1368
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,160
And...

1369
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,760
Yeah, you say that like that's a bad thing.

1370
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,840
I'm quoting Gary Arlington.

1371
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,800
They're not ripping off limbs or, you know, shredding,

1372
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,280
putting them in a corpse-grinding machine?

1373
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,480
Well, they're not sitting down and having watercress sandwiches.

1374
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,020
No, no.

1375
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:04,480
I don't want to say that.

1376
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,460
That might be a good comic book to me.

1377
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,140
The astonishing...

1378
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,980
I can see Bob carrying his swooning Godzilla.

1379
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,000
Right.

1380
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,160
That would be beautiful.

1381
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,280
In a bikini.

1382
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:14,940
Yeah.

1383
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,540
Godzilla and Bob walking away in the Tokyo sunset.

1384
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,700
All right, subgenius artists, get busy.

1385
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,280
Yes.

1386
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,400
You've been giving your son...

1387
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,680
I would actually buy that.

1388
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,480
I'm such a Godzilla nut.

1389
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,680
I would buy...

1390
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:34,020
If somebody was to paint a Godzilla and Bob walking...

1391
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:35,580
Yep.

1392
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,940
Well, they're not to the same...

1393
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:38,000
Howard, you got your work done?

1394
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,660
I'm going to cut out for you.

1395
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,980
Scale, which is the problem with the proposed King Kong versus Godzilla movie.

1396
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,980
You've got to respect scale.

1397
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,960
Or some Ultraman-like thing like,

1398
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,540
no, all of a sudden he is Mega Bob.

1399
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,040
You know.

1400
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,220
Well, Bob can...

1401
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,200
Yay, look at his pipe.

1402
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,020
He can grow.

1403
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:02,880
And so now, Mr. Godzilla, not so fearsome, are you?

1404
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,180
Light my pipe with that nuclear...

1405
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:06,680
With your breath.

1406
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:06,980
Yeah.

1407
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,140
It's not the size of the lizard that counts.

1408
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,560
It's what he does.

1409
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,060
It's how radioactive his breath is.

1410
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:19,340
Yeah.

1411
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,500
The new one, I'm pretty excited about the new one coming out.

1412
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,520
The new Godzilla?

1413
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:24,880
Yes.

1414
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,360
But that's King Kong, isn't it?

1415
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,580
Or is it...

1416
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,300
He's...

1417
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,900
I can't remember what it's called.

1418
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,420
He's rebuilding himself.

1419
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,640
So all of the early things where he's...

1420
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,220
He's almost like a zombie in the beginning.

1421
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,680
And he grows into his skin.

1422
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,380
Zombie Godzilla?

1423
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:42,780
Well, I think...

1424
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,200
I always thought that'd be a great idea anyway.

1425
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,960
It's never been appropriately acknowledged

1426
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:50,540
that Godzilla died at the end of the first Godzilla movie.

1427
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,620
He's unquestionably dead.

1428
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:53,080
No, no.

1429
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,660
You see his skeleton.

1430
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,340
No, no.

1431
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:59,600
He was destroyed by Professor Serizawa's oxygen destruia.

1432
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,320
Mm-hmm.

1433
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:00,740
Right.

1434
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,280
Perfection like Godzilla cannot die.

1435
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,460
Then the second film called...

1436
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,240
What was it?

1437
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,500
The War of the...

1438
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:08,680
No.

1439
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,140
War of the Gargantuan?

1440
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:10,760
No, that wasn't the second one.

1441
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,840
The Grapple of All Monsters?

1442
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:12,080
No, no.

1443
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,620
The second one was...

1444
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,160
Was it Mothra?

1445
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:15,700
Yes.

1446
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:16,840
It was not.

1447
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,380
It was Gigantis the Fire Monster.

1448
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,060
Right, right.

1449
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,760
Because they couldn't call him Godzilla back then.

1450
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:31,860
But the populace knows that Frankenstein is the same name for the monster as the Doctor.

1451
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:36,220
And so eventually the movie makers simply have to accomplish...

1452
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:37,560
They have to accommodate that.

1453
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,640
And so it has been done with Gojira.

1454
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,620
But it's not the first Gojira.

1455
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,640
And the assiduous collectors of the little statuettes know that well

1456
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:52,620
and can tell you, looking at each one, which one it is from which movie.

1457
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,520
That's the kind of things subgeniuses know.

1458
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:00,460
Then there's the kind of things they don't know.

1459
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:04,520
Like how to repair their own car.

1460
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,380
Fix the toilet.

1461
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:06,220
Balancing a checkbook.

1462
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,420
Yeah, balance a checkbook.

1463
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,900
Eat healthy.

1464
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,160
Socialize.

1465
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,020
Reverend Angry Larry can fix a car, right?

1466
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:15,360
Yeah.

1467
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,740
But you can't fix the modern ones.

1468
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,420
They've got brains and nervous systems.

1469
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:19,900
No, modern ones I take those in.

1470
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:20,460
No.

1471
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,100
Yeah, the old ones you can fix.

1472
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,540
My 57 Chevrolet i, that I can fix.

1473
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:24,860
Yeah.

1474
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,860
That's at a human dimension.

1475
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:30,240
It's not a solid state electronics.

1476
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:31,940
Mine's tube.

1477
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:32,880
Yeah.

1478
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,320
It's not solid state.

1479
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,140
It's a tube amp.

1480
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:36,820
Right.

1481
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:37,960
It's a tube car.

1482
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:42,700
Here we see Akoba driving Tumac out of his home.

1483
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,220
Oh, is that 1 million BC?

1484
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:47,780
Yes, this is the 1941 Hal Roach version.

1485
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,320
Well, I'm ready to stop the show and go watch that.

1486
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:56,580
His mother, Sura, mourns, but Akoba is determined and knocks Tumac out.

1487
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,320
And he's immediately chased by an enraged mammoth,

1488
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,240
which doesn't occur in the 1966 remake.

1489
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,260
Some people said it's just hard to believe.

1490
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,220
Oh, there's new pilots.

1491
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,180
Bondi, she's so sad.

1492
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:16,680
That the original, that Robert Brown, who plays Akoba in the remake,

1493
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,020
how could he possibly defeat his huge muscular son?

1494
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:24,400
You know, and why was everyone cowering from this guy?

1495
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:27,660
Well, there's an explanation that all the critics don't understand,

1496
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,760
and that is he's a mean old man.

1497
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,900
So you bet he could do all of that and more and have them all,

1498
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,460
all terrified of him the way he is in the movie.

1499
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,820
Then after his unfortunate accident,

1500
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,740
goring by a musk ox in the first movie,

1501
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:47,120
and in the second movie,

1502
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,660
being mutilated by falling off a cliff after chasing a goat,

1503
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,080
then he's not as powerful.

1504
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,280
Yeah, I haven't seen this movie since I was a kid.

1505
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,080
The mammoth is pushing the tree that he's on and he's knocked out,

1506
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:05,200
and he floats down the river full of weird reptiles,

1507
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,320
but is somehow never...

1508
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:07,360
Not consumed.

1509
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,720
Until he lands at the beach where Loana the Fair One turns him up.

1510
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,020
Again, these are the things that subgeniuses know.

1511
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:18,740
Oh, yeah.

1512
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,320
Well, some of us are condemned to know such things.

1513
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,580
They may not know first aid or how to swim,

1514
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:27,700
but they know the plot of every monster movie made from 1910 to...

1515
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,040
Remember that caveman movie?

1516
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,780
Swim like they did in that movie.

1517
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,500
Now you're all right.

1518
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,760
Well, I knew about Manos.

1519
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,220
Come on.

1520
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:35,520
Right.

1521
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,880
Nobody knows about that stuff.

1522
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,800
What is the hand in the title of Manos?

1523
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,120
It's on his robe.

1524
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:42,940
Yeah, it's his robe.

1525
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:43,940
He's got red hands.

1526
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,100
He's got two red hands on there,

1527
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,360
which is funny because Manos means hands,

1528
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,800
so it's just hands, the hands of fate.

1529
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,240
Here, Tumac, unconscious, slips down the river

1530
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:00,700
and we see him traveling through the prehistoric primordial world.

1531
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,900
I like the fact that the screen is very lumpy.

1532
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,180
The ripples help us.

1533
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,660
We're watching it.

1534
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:06,960
It's a sheet.

1535
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:07,800
Backwards.

1536
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,600
But we're behind.

1537
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,600
We're on the other side.

1538
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,140
There's La Juana.

1539
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,220
We're watching the behind the scenes here.

1540
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:13,120
Isn't she beautiful?

1541
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,760
She looks like a big wrinkle to me.

1542
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,160
Oh, yeah.

1543
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:21,280
Well, she would today had she lived, but she killed herself for love.

1544
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,500
Well, you know, we're blocking the good screen.

1545
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:24,360
Yeah.

1546
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,560
If we got out of here...

1547
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,460
Screaming.

1548
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,920
The situation could change, but I bet it won't.

1549
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,180
She's astonished to see Tumac.

1550
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:33,680
We're settlers.

1551
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:34,820
We settled for...

1552
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,500
Oh, she's screaming Tumac.

1553
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:36,900
We're all together.

1554
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:42,680
Now she's somewhat interested in him, as you can see from this cutaway shot.

1555
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,540
Both versions of the movie are essentially a silent film

1556
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:49,440
with everything in it expressed gesturally,

1557
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:53,620
although there's all sorts of stuff on the soundtrack of both versions,

1558
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,140
most creatively in the second version.

1559
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,180
Well, here we are watching the movie.

1560
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,180
See, I think we ought to shut down this circus

1561
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,640
and watch...

1562
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:11,780
If you have enough recorded stuff for Muam, I suppose we could.

1563
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:15,380
Well, you know, we just, according to the machine here,

1564
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,680
we've been talking for one hour and 55 minutes,

1565
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,460
so that's two hours of slack.

1566
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:23,480
Squeeze out a final five minutes and then shut down.

1567
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,360
Then you'll have two, count them, two hours in the can.

1568
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:27,700
Right.

1569
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,180
Show fiber.

1570
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,380
Or we just watch the movie.

1571
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:30,900
Squeeze it out.

1572
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:31,680
Yeah.

1573
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:36,160
So, friends, you've been listening to the Hour of Slack.

1574
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:36,600
Hour of Slack.

1575
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:36,640
Hour of Slack.

1576
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,780
From the Church of the Subgenius.

1577
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,560
If you're interested in learning more about

1578
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,700
Reverend Angry Larry, Dr. Howell,

1579
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,640
Reverend Susie the Floozy,

1580
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:49,760
or J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1581
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,020
that information is all there at subgenius.com.

1582
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:58,100
But it's too late because in just a few hours it's all going to fry.

1583
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,620
Well, some version of subgenius.com,

1584
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,880
this is part of the contract,

1585
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,820
that's going to get off with us.

1586
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:11,020
You think you're going to escape all that subgenius propaganda and stuff?

1587
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,340
It's going to be more intense than you ever dreamed.

1588
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,180
That's going to be on the beacon satellites.

1589
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,520
Well, yeah, because we've got those large speakers on the side of the craft

1590
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,560
that are just going to blast it up.

1591
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,600
It will not be possible to turn it off.

1592
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,580
You might as well understand this.

1593
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,800
It's going to be a constant of your future existence.

1594
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,100
But then it's going to be a battle of...

1595
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:34,680
Oh, no, well, why are we playing your show, Dr. Howell?

1596
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:35,800
I thought we were going to play your show.

1597
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,280
We're going to play the Hour of Slack and bombard them.

1598
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,400
We're going to play them all simultaneously.

1599
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,840
What about Bob's Slacktime Phone House and Sir Graveson?

1600
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,280
What about the other shows, Howell?

1601
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,100
Why are you playing the KPFA show only?

1602
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:48,540
Oh, my God.

1603
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,280
Then we'll have to have a schedule.

1604
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,460
Then it starts all over again.

1605
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,340
I guess you didn't look at your booklet.

1606
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,340
I guess you didn't read your schedule.

1607
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,940
You were going to stop off and grab the Grand Canyon, correct?

1608
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,100
Yeah, among other things.

1609
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:05,340
Okay.

1610
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,520
Yeah, but that's going to be fairly large.

1611
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:12,980
So I think it's possible that we can all have our own, you know, areas.

1612
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,180
Or you can grab the...

1613
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:18,600
I don't have dibs on the Great Barrier Reef, but you better grab it quick.

1614
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:19,500
It's going fast.

1615
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,160
No.

1616
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,760
Somebody ought to pick that up while there's still any of it left.

1617
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,780
I want the Statue of Liberty because I really want to be in it.

1618
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,260
I wanted to make a lighter out of that.

1619
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:29,980
Yeah?

1620
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:30,720
You can say statue.

1621
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,840
There'll be enough prop for, you know, we'll need the Statue of Liberty.

1622
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,080
Right.

1623
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:35,660
She'll actually...

1624
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:36,440
She'll actually light up.

1625
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,160
Uh-huh.

1626
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,280
You know, she'll let...

1627
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:43,600
That torch will actually be on fire, and it will be constantly pushing out the smoke of Bob's pipe.

1628
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,760
Ah, yes, friends.

1629
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,360
The promise of Exit.

1630
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,680
See, we did another five minutes.

1631
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,560
In fact, we're over.

1632
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,280
I told you.

1633
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:51,480
Oh.

1634
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:53,220
Now we're over.

1635
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,960
I didn't edit out all the times I said fuck.

1636
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,520
So there's a lot more stuff coming your way.

1637
00:56:58,780 --> 00:56:59,860
Don't worry, kids.

1638
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,640
This is hardly the last feeble flicker that it appears to be of the Church of the Sanctuary.

1639
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,140
It's not a subgenius.

1640
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,060
No, yes it is.

1641
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,280
It's all gonna burn.

1642
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,260
There's more fun and antics.

1643
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:11,400
What are you saying, Susie?

1644
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,660
Like hours away.

1645
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,600
It's almost X-Day.

1646
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,540
What time is it?

1647
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,100
Who cares?

1648
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:18,900
Tempest bugger.

1649
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:19,740
Who cares?

1650
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,200
Earth time, it's 5 o'clock.

1651
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,340
Wow.

1652
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,780
So we've got like 14 hours.

1653
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:27,840
Eastern Standard Time.

1654
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:33,000
14 hours before, to quote the title of another movie, the Earth Dies Screaming.

1655
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:33,660
Mm.

1656
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:34,480
Okay.

1657
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:35,800
I'm not gonna lie.

1658
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,680
You have only five o'clock.

1659
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,360
I have a little later than that, are you sure?

1660
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,120
It'll feel so good when it stops.

1661
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,220
Oh.

1662
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,760
That's the principle behind a lot of things.

1663
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,960
You've been listening to the Horror Slam.

1664
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,040
...you folks listening by record.

1665
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:55,880
Once the church is gone, there's going to be a cataclysmic judgment and millions will die

1666
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,700
in those next few years.

1667
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,480
And you might be a bit clueless but don't worry about it.

1668
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:11,180
For those of you that loosen your loose ends, we'll stop the 끄 어�, and continue watching

1669
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:11,900
our comical seisse candy trip to the safely and unused

1670
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:11,900


1671
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:11,900


1672
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:16,760
So don't come right up here and turn around and watch some killer took제� backups?

1673
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,260
I'll be there.

1674
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,720
I feel égalementанный as well.

1675
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:26,400


1676
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:26,400


1677
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:26,620


1678
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:30,260
It's the end of the world

1679
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:31,480
As you know it

1680
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,700
I feel fine

1681
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,420
Hey, oh, let's go

1682
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,180
Shoot them in the back now

1683
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,760
What they want, I don't know

1684
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,460
They're all raised up and ready to go

1685
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,720
Turn around, go back down

1686
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,180
Back the way you came

1687
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:57,060
Can't you see that flash of fire

1688
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:00,740
Ten times brighter than the day

1689
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:05,060
And behold, a mighty city

1690
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:08,100
Broken in the dust again

1691
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:12,000
Oh, God, cry the man

1692
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,740
Broken in the dust again

1693
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:20,100
It's gonna be me

1694
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,160
It's gonna be me

1695
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:22,360
It's gonna be you

1696
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,740
We're gonna do everything we want to

1697
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,340
It's gotta be now

1698
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,980
And I can't wait

1699
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,180
To say goodbye to fear

1700
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,200
And all that pain and hate

1701
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,140
Oh, like a flaming baton

1702
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,340
That's burning the world

1703
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,260
Like George Bush on acid

1704
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:49,680
Stringing the duke on

1705
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,160
Gonna be a new day

1706
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:53,540
Gonna be a new world

1707
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,400
Gonna be a new world

1708
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:01,300
Gonna be a new world

1709
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:02,760
I'm a consent

1710
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,680
To anyone's last words

1711
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,900
There's nothing left for you to say

1712
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,180
Soon you'll pretend anyway

1713
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,560
Well, no one here

1714
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,580
Is getting out alive

1715
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:20,000
This summer's really lost my mind

1716
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,380
And I don't care

1717
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:22,140
I'm a consent

1718
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,280
So close your eyes

1719
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,480
And get yourself to mind

1720
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,960
And think about the times

1721
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,200
It's been and what they've been

1722
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,880
To me it's nothing

1723
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,440
To me it's nothing

1724
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,160
To me it's nothing

1725
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:42,580
To me it's nothing

1726
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:49,280
We're only gonna die

1727
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,800
From our own arrogance

1728
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,140
That's why we're gonna die

1729
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:55,040
We might as well take our time
