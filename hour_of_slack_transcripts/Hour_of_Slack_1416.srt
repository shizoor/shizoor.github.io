1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
Something wrong with the recorder?

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,160
Don't think so.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,220
Is their system the same?

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,440
Yes. It is according to the directions on the carton.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,400
Sveeeh...

6
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,480
Sveeeh...

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,700
Sveeeh...

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:21,840
It sounds confusing, and that can be helpful when trying to find out quickly who might be up to

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,980
The Self Genius Hour of Sveeeh!

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,940
It really jumps out.

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,400
His latest Pulitzer Prize winner book,

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,980
People Seeing Things That They've Seen Before.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,120
Shadow people, entities that people have seen before,

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,080
ghosts that people have seen before.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,160
My God! It's, it's, it's, it's, it's just, it's...

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:47,860
The Giant Bob.

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,680
We welcome you.

18
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,280
Won't you kindly seat yourselves and be comfortable?

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,020
I'm controller of planet X.

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,700
And I've invited you here to discuss something that's very important.

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,520
Meanwhile, the Church of the Subgenius, a parody cult of slackers who worship a character named Bob Dobbs,

22
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,580
had planned their own Armageddon date.

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,360
July 5th, 1998.

24
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,080
But the next day, they were still here.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,200
So they did what they liked to do best.

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,080
Throw wild parties called Divivals,

27
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:34,460
where members enjoy such events as blood wrestling, pig worship, and naked Bobtisms.

28
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,880
A subculture of the bizarre.

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,620
And the tempo control.

30
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,640
Disco.

31
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,060
Wait, whoa, whoa.

32
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,060
Oh, Bob.

33
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,960
Oh.

34
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,400
Oh.

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,160
Turn on.

36
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
Tune in.

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,080
And...

38
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,100
So what do you call it?

39
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,740
Why do you want to be normal?

40
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,240
The rupture is upon us, dear friends.

41
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,320
That fateful day.

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,480
July 5th, 1998.

43
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,520
Next days are coming.

44
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,740
And the pigs are bumming.

45
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,820
Next days are coming.

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,260
And the pigs are bumming.

47
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:34,900
Ha!

48
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,600
Ha!

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,700
Sure, when the rupture hits,

50
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:47,580
we'll all be in our first class window seats on the pleasure saucers watching the little pink boys fry.

51
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,520
Ha!

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,440
Turn on.

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,060
Tune in.

54
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,060
and slack off!

55
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,900
You certainly don't want to preach to people.

56
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,940
X days are coming!

57
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,660
And the pigs are bumming!

58
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,380
Sure, J.R. Bob Dobbs is my savior.

59
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,180
And of course I want more slack.

60
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,960
And I'm smoking prop non-stop.

61
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,960
But what I really want...

62
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,540
Oh yeah, that's it.

63
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,560
Those lovely alien nympho mutants.

64
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,380
Nonstop orgies on the pleasure saucers.

65
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,200
Oh yeah.

66
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,960
Oh, I love to be naked.

67
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,180
Oh, I love to be naked.

68
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,260
More, more.

69
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,560
Oh, fuck.

70
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,760
Turn on.

71
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,400
Tune in.

72
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,340
And slack off!

73
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,420
Why don't you want to be normal?

74
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,100
X days are coming.

75
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,500
And the pigs are bumming.

76
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,680
Yeah!

77
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,260
I said X days are coming!

78
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,000
And the pigs are bumming.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,820
And the little pigs are bumming.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,200
And the pigs are bumming.

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,720
And the pigs are bumming.

82
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,760
Those conspiracy-dude pink boy normals are gonna fry!

83
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,680
They won't even know what hit them.

84
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,580
That old Stark fist is gonna come down hard.

85
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,600
But nothing's guaranteed, dear friends.

86
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,020
I'm a card-carrying member of the Church of the Subgenius.

87
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,940
I'm the almighty king of subgenius.

88
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,320
I never showed up to death, fuck!

89
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,860
I never wasn't born with dignity from the injury.

90
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:51,860


91
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:51,860


92
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,100
Well, listen here.

93
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,040
If there is any man's life that has never been whether you're fucking or not.

94
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:53,640
Just like my fucking friend, Robin Choi.

95
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:53,640


96
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:53,640


97
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,600
The only thing I have is my unshakable fate.

98
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,200
In Bach!

99
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,460
Not long ago.

100
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:02,940
Turn on.

101
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,580
I'll get through them.

102
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,220
And I'll...

103
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,180
Why do you want to be known?

104
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,400
X-Days are coming.

105
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,700
And the pigs are bumming.

106
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,960
Don't you want to be saved?

107
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,120
No.

108
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,680
X-Days are coming.

109
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,680
And the pigs are bumming.

110
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,420
Listen to me, mister. It's salvation I'm talking about.

111
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,600
I think you will agree the report we have just heard from our astronauts is truly amazing.

112
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,620
On the newly discovered planet,

113
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,660
there exists a race of stars.

114
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,720
Superior beings with highly advanced scientific knowledge,

115
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,640
especially in medicine.

116
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,920
And furthermore, they have extended their hand in friendship to the people of the Earth.

117
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,620
It is our duty as Supreme Council

118
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,300
to carefully study the proposal as set forth by Planet X

119
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,400
and arrive at an early decision.

120
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,300
We'll receive a wonder drug.

121
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,580
Then we can save the people of the Earth from sufferings.

122
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,660
The organizations of...

123
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,920
The organizations of women have no objection.

124
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,900
We acknowledge the sincere message of peace which was forwarded by the controller of the new planet.

125
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,740
Also, it appears to me that we can learn humanity from these people,

126
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,940
as well as scientific knowledge.

127
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,180
Thank you.

128
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,000
The Council shall therefore order cooperation with Planet X.

129
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,320
First, first, first, first.

130
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,720
We must get off.

131
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,300
We must get off.

132
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,640
We must get off this place.

133
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,320
First.

134
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,900
First.

135
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,800
We must leave.

136
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,200
We must get off.

137
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,660
We must get off.

138
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,640
First.

139
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,220
First.

140
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,220
First.

141
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,960
First.

142
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,660
First.

143
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,140
First.

144
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,220
First.

145
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,340
First.

146
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:09,380
First.

147
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,220
Now, who gonna talk for you on Earth?

148
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,600
Who gonna say the words?

149
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,360
Can I get a witness?

150
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,140
First.

151
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,680
First.

152
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,400
Who gonna pronounce the final epithet that's gonna take you off on this world?

153
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,100
First.

154
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,260
Who gonna speak for you?

155
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:23,800
First.

156
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,360
First.

157
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,160
Who gonna talk for Earth?

158
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,140
First.

159
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,420
First.

160
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:27,560
First.

161
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,520
We know who speaks for the nation.

162
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:29,960
First.

163
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,220
First.

164
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,200
But who speaks for the planet?

165
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,920
First.

166
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,060
First.

167
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,680
Who speaks for Earth?

168
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,220
First.

169
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,080
Cold veins of steel.

170
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:37,580
First.

171
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,000
Hombre's without hearts.

172
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,380
First.

173
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,140
Human beings without minds.

174
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,440
First.

175
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,340
A world of pain.

176
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,520
No luxury.

177
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:43,920
First.

178
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,600
No comfort.

179
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,120
First.

180
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,740
No delight.

181
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:46,300
First.

182
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,680
Suffering at every corner.

183
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,220
First.

184
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,480
Enjoy yourself.

185
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,180
First.

186
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,480
First.

187
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,440
Enjoy yourself.

188
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,340
First.

189
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,100
First.

190
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,140
First.

191
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,060
First.

192
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,040
First.

193
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:56,640


194
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,160
First.

195
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,780
First.

196
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:57,880
First.

197
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,120
First.

198
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,220
First.

199
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,220


200
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,240
First.

201
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,300
We must get off.

202
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,720
First.

203
00:07:59,720 --> 00:07:59,980
First.

204
00:07:59,980 --> 00:07:59,980


205
00:07:59,980 --> 00:07:59,980


206
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,440
We must get off this place.

207
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,420
First.

208
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:04,980
First.

209
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,060
First.

210
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,220
First.

211
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,140
First.

212
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:08,900
First.

213
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,500
First.

214
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:09,860
First.

215
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,140
First.

216
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,160
First.

217
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,160


218
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,160


219
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,160


220
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,840
Is there all more?

221
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,440
First.

222
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,160
First.

223
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,260
There is no future.

224
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:13,800
First.

225
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,320
First.

226
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:14,640
First.

227
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:14,800
First.

228
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:14,800


229
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,320
We have destroyed the land we live in.

230
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,980
First.

231
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,100
First.

232
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,100


233
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,980
We are the one who will enslave the Earth!

234
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,100
Just the way it's been done for billions of years.

235
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,060
This is the Sly George Face of Evolution.

236
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,080
This is the slow pivot, slumbering, blubbering face of evolution.

237
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:41,960
You know, to know, you know, to know, you know, like, you know, to go, you know, kind of, kind of, kind of like the reptilian agenda.

238
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:47,060
You know, the masculine and feminine in the galactic core with reptilian source energy.

239
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:55,940
Multidimensional, malevolent, conscious, feminine deities that are under the control of very evil beings of the Draco reptilians.

240
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:01,100
But, um, but the Anunnaki brought in its own huge monster that we're dealing with.

241
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,880
This is Earth headquarters.

242
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,500
Contola here.

243
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,780
Your orders, sir.

244
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,420
You are to execute plan two, item four of schedule five.

245
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,020
Plan two, item four, schedule five. Yes, sir.

246
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,160
Come on, little green.

247
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,160
I was cruising through the city on a Saturday night.

248
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,040
When I saw some land up there, it was low, kind of bright.

249
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,900
I went into a ship with a little green man.

250
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,620
I was a man.

251
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,920
I was a man.

252
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:55,920


253
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,220
We were standing in a circle starting helium.

254
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,600
I looked around some more.

255
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,180
There was a party going on.

256
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,020
And there was Berla Ngozi.

257
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,620
He was singing this song.

258
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,140
Calling all the members of the human race.

259
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,220
It's Humble Man 69 from Outer Seas.

260
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,840
Calling all the members of the human race.

261
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,200
It's Humble Man 69 from Outer Seas.

262
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,560
Playing 69 from Outer Seas.

263
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,200
Outer Space.

264
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,680
Outer Space.

265
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,900
Outer Space.

266
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,320
Playing 69 from Outer Space.

267
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,780
Outer Space.

268
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,120
Outer Space

269
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,380
Playing 69 from Outer Space

270
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,240
Calling all the boys and girls in the US of A

271
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,540
It's time for Playing 69 from Outer Space

272
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,200
Doesn't really matter if you're black or white

273
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,560
Anything is fine if it feels alright

274
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,240
Calling all the boys all over the world

275
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,540
Grab yourself a girl and give it a whirl

276
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,060
Calling all the girls all over the land

277
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,400
Grab yourself a man and a wham, bam, bam

278
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,320
Love in a spaceship

279
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,860
Love in a spaceship

280
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,300
Love in a spaceship

281
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,680
Love in a spaceship

282
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,620
Playing 69 from Outer Space

283
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,300
Playing 69 from Outer Space

284
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,800
Playing 69 from Outer Space

285
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,200
Playing 69 from Outer Space

286
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,460
Playing 69 from Outer Space

287
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,040
Playing 69 from Outer Space

288
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,560
Playing 69 from Outer Space

289
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,280
Playing 69 from Outer Space

290
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,280


291
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,280


292
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,280


293
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,280


294
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,280


295
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,280


296
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,280


297
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,280


298
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:41,900
Outstanding.

299
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:57,560
Thanks for watching.

300
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,000
My people and I appreciate your warm welcome.

301
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,820
This day will always be remembered by the universe

302
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,780
as when our two civilizations joined together

303
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,860
for the benefit of galactic mankind.

304
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,000
We are friendly, our aims are peaceful,

305
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,760
and we seek to establish cooperation and eternal friendship

306
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,700
between our two worlds.

307
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,440
Control to speak with forked tongue, maybe, huh?

308
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,760
It's fun and inane

309
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,140
when the trumpet calls X day

310
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,600
in a brother and sister band

311
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,940
when they blow the world away.

312
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,880
We shall have paradise.

313
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,560
Subgenie of the world, unite.

314
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,700
Alien sex every night.

315
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,660
Subgenie of the world.

316
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,300
Subgenie of the world.

317
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,400
Subgenie of the world, unite.

318
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,420
We shall have paradise.

319
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,880
Stand hand in hand

320
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,780
when the trumpet calls X day.

321
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,860
In a brother and sister band

322
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,680
when they blow the world away.

323
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,120
We shall have paradise.

324
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,640
Subgenie of the world, unite.

325
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:41,880
Subgenie of the world, unite.

326
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:41,880


327
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,180
Alien sucks everybody

328
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:50,680
Satini of the world, satini of the world, satini of the world, unite!

329
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,520
I am the controller of planet X.

330
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,680
To the people of the Earth, I command that you obey the following orders.

331
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,660
Orders?

332
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:08,640
You will place the Earth under our absolute control and be governed as our colony.

333
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,960
What is a governess as a colony?

334
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:16,500
If you do not obey these orders willingly and immediately, we shall destroy your civilization.

335
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,700
Double trust and think.

336
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,540
So we stumble right into a trap.

337
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:27,620
I repeat the order. Earth will continue to exist only as a colony of planet X.

338
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,900
No! No!

339
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,640
They must have lied to us.

340
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,960
Well, wait a minute. What's wrong with Earth being a colony of planet X?

341
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,580
Actually, that's not so bad.

342
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,460
Is it?

343
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,280
Well, it hasn't been detailed to us yet, has it dear?

344
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,800
Well, it's got to be better than what we have now.

345
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:52,240
I guess.

346
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:59,780
Okay, well, let's see. What happened here? What's... what... what happened?

347
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:08,920
Um, thanks to Mr. Sister for the planet X clips from, uh, Monster Zero or something like that.

348
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,380
Uh, thanks to...

349
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:15,960
To Lonesome Cowboy Dave and also Einstein's Secret Orchestra for the subgenius anthem.

350
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,260
That was the last song played.

351
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:27,960
The song before that, Plan 69 from Outer Space, was by the Kirkendall Void of Cleveland itself.

352
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,900
Good old Cleveland.

353
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:38,220
Uh, Earth First, that strange mix, was by Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

354
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,080
Uh, Professor Chas.

355
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:46,520
Uh, with also Lonesome Cowboy Dave and, uh, whoever else.

356
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,080
Not you, Princess Weave, that time.

357
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,940
Oh, no. Not me.

358
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,020
Michelle George was there.

359
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,520
And, uh, X Days of Comin' by Bill T. Miller, King of Slack.

360
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:07,960
The collages, uh, so far have mostly been by Fernandan and E. Lee Murr, but there will be more from him,

361
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,360
and from Reverend Royal D. King.

362
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:10,360


363
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,160
Capitator.

364
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,700
This music in the background is Petra Hayden,

365
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,340
who does, in this particular album, movie soundtracks,

366
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,700
all a cappella and overdubbed.

367
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,840
Potter Nostril was playing in the background

368
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,420
one breakfast morning.

369
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,420
Praise Potter Nostril.

370
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,460
And I thought I was losing my mind

371
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,840
because it was some of my favorite movie themes,

372
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,400
but just off, you know.

373
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,140
And yes, friends, X Day is a-coming.

374
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,360
We're here in the studio for once.

375
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,120
Probably the next time that happens,

376
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,320
we'll be with Dr. Hal,

377
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,580
because it's a busy, busy, busy June coming up

378
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,160
as we head in towards the end of the world.

379
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:05,300
I can tell you about some subgenius-related events.

380
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,340
I can't tell you to go to them.

381
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,360
But if...

382
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,900
For instance, on June 22nd, Saturday,

383
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,320
in Pittsburgh, why, there's a subgenius devival.

384
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:22,500
Actually, it's Tommy Amoeba's rock and roll birthday gala extravaganza

385
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,400
with a subgenius devival thrown in.

386
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,060
But since the party involves Fat Man D

387
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,680
and her band, The Cultural District,

388
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,220
and since it features Amoeba Knievel,

389
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,360
the incredible spaz band of Tommy Amoeba,

390
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,060
and Andrew the Impaled,

391
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,420
St. Andrew the Impaled,

392
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,560
and even St. Tentatively a Convenience.

393
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,360
Isn't that remarkable?

394
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,980
Well, one of the last times...

395
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,380
I'm not sure the last time I saw him,

396
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,080
but one of the last times I saw him,

397
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,440
I couldn't see him,

398
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,500
because he had split from the...

399
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,600
At 1982,

400
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,360
World Subgenius...

401
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:18,180
convention in Chicago after braining Pope's sternodocs with some kind of heavy music synthesizer

402
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,320
device in a creative argument.

403
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,140
But that was many lifetimes ago, and everyone has forgotten everything.

404
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:33,720
And if we ever knew any of it to begin with, so it'll be really interesting to see alternatively

405
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,780
and see what he's up to.

406
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,000
That should be a fun show.

407
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,820
That's a Saturday, June 22nd at Howler's Coyote Cafe in Pittsburgh, or Pittsburgh,

408
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,440
as St. Andrew the Impaled instructed us it should be said.

409
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:07,060
I was at this amazing cacophony society event last weekend as emcee of all things and saw

410
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,000
our old friend David Apocalypse.

411
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,960
He used to be a...

412
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,740
a sideshow Marvel partners with Andrew the Impaled in a group called Circus Apocalypse.

413
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,080
And he's going to be moving back to Pittsburgh soon.

414
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,280
That'll be good, because he's a real troublemaker, a crazy man.

415
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:28,440
He'll juggle knives at you, and he doesn't know how to juggle knives well.

416
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:38,580
So it's not fake blood, and it's not a fake cowboy who calls in...

417
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,660
Cowboy, hell.

418
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,640
Are we getting him on the air or not?

419
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,980
I don't know.

420
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,780
It is off the air.

421
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,320
I'm hearing your...

422
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,120
a delay.

423
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,980
I'm hearing a delay, too.

424
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,860
I'm hearing an unusual, strange echo in this whole room, as if...

425
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,860
as if...

426
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,040
No?

427
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,180
Okay.

428
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,440
I think it's the ghost of the old prophets walking around with stinky sandals and bad

429
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:06,760
eyesight.

430
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,520
Well, I kind of like this strange...

431
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,920
Yeah, me too.

432
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,040
This is like...

433
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:18,020
You see, listening audience and Dave, from our point of view, we're hearing Dave in our

434
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:24,900
headphones as well as on a big, loud speaker, which I suppose maybe if I start turning things

435
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,240
down, well...

436
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,300
That's what it is.

437
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:27,880
Oh.

438
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,800
The speaker is giving Aaron information to the audio...

439
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:33,840
Test.

440
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,100
This is like the lonesome cowboy Wizard of Oz sound.

441
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,600
Yeah.

442
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,680
The voice.

443
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,380
Would you like to look at my underpants?

444
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,080
I wish you hadn't brought that up.

445
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,100
No, I have them right here with me in a shoebox.

446
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,720
Aren't they cute?

447
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,560
You sure you wouldn't want to take one home?

448
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,680
Look at the markings.

449
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,640
They're so smart, too.

450
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,060
Well, I've been giving them names and...

451
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,440
Hello?

452
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,680
I don't know about those markings, Dave.

453
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,160
Well, I think this one is a...

454
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,720
a...

455
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,020
a...

456
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,460
a...

457
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:07,460


458
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:07,520
a...

459
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:07,520


460
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:07,520


461
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:07,540
a...

462
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:07,540


463
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:07,580
a...

464
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:07,580


465
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:07,660
a...

466
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:07,660


467
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:07,660


468
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:07,660


469
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:07,680
a...

470
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:07,800
a...

471
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:07,800


472
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:07,880
a...

473
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:07,940
a...

474
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:07,940


475
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:07,940


476
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:07,940


477
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:07,940


478
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,040
a...

479
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,560
a...

480
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,200
a...

481
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,000
a...

482
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,000


483
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,000


484
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,000


485
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,000


486
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,000


487
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,020
a...

488
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020


489
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020


490
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020


491
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020


492
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020


493
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020


494
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020


495
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020


496
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020


497
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020


498
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020


499
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020


500
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020


501
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020


502
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020


503
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020


504
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:16,020


505
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,980
Like a Hungarian cheesemaker, perhaps?

506
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:20,760
Yeah.

507
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,780
Hmm.

508
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,380
With plenty of lecivor on top.

509
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,360
I see.

510
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,460
Hmm.

511
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,520
That echo is kind of weird.

512
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:34,020
Yeah, I'm pushing buttons like mad trying to eliminate you from the speaker.

513
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,080
Of course, one way I could be able to...

514
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,980
Don't push any of the buttons on your own body or else you might delete...

515
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:57,640
yourself no not that button oh no not that button no wood what the hell it's it's weird to hear um

then they probably have to do a study to how to get out of that what not you know having to obey

564
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:16,340
the law necessarily but get out of the whole idea and stuff and then you know there'll be all kinds

565
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,520
of experts and everybody will have to attend seminars and stuff and they'll get bored with

566
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:25,520
that stuff too but they'll realize that uh what they're doing is too big of a pain in the

567
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:25,680
ass

568
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,780
a pain in the what in the ass oh yeah that's right you can say that now you know i've been

569
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:39,700
cutting that word out of our slack for years just out of uh sort of well yeah and

570
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:47,320
and then i realized that i was hearing it on plain ordinary television once i actually

571
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,740
listened to a plain ordinary television which happened by accident this month

572
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:55,580
well your genes are all screwed up anyway you've got

573
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:00,180
all different kinds of primate genes going around in your head and everything so no wonder you get

574
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,600
confused well in princess we use the wrong detergent when she put them in the wash and

575
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:11,020

580
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:47,400
that we might somehow i don't know kill all their trees in the punch bowl right but yeah

583
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:03,160
i'm surprised that anyone would wonder about that we've been defiling we've been defiling

sacred groves we are that thing floating in the punch bowl yeah there's a new slogan for you

uh but yeah

588
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:31,580
we've been defiling sacred groves for a long time and they always re-sacrified themselves pretty quick

589
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,740
you know the trees mounts back i don't know about the fundamentalist pagans

590
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:41,940
but these aren't funny pagans these are the opposite these are our buddies pagans yeah it

591
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:47,060
doesn't take these are our old pagan friends a couple of hours of of regular pagan sunshine

592
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:53,240
to bleach out all the subgenius darkness ain't yeah yeah just so long as i'm turning in energy

593
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,560
right to turn into a werewolf is not a problem

594
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:09,820
actually whether i don't like the song and turn it into a

595
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:16,260
i've seen it on tv and it's good

596
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,740
got to get this lógica

597
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,180
with my brother

598
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:18,740
moderate

599
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,520
pragma

600
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:19,560
all right

601
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,100
the table.

602
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,780
Because this...

603
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,520
I can't turn this...

604
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,460
There's

605
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,320
an external speaker button

606
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,480
here. The buttons

607
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,600
that used to work no longer work.

608
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,380
We're not ever supposed

609
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,300
to talk about technical

610
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,020
problems on the

611
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,080
radio.

612
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,380
Because after

613
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,680
all, friends, you can tell this is all a recording

614
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,540
that's been heavily edited to

615
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,080
sound like we meant

616
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,300
to do this while...

617
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,700
Double-dozed

618
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,040
and double-dipped

619
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,660
creamy finger pie.

620
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,820
And speaking of...

621
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,200
You're not so special to us.

622
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,560
Climb on in.

623
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,880
Welcome aboard.

624
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,980
There's a finger pie

625
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,540
cook-off at X-Day this year.

626
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,280
It's going to be a great place

627
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,380
for the experiments, too.

628
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,200
X-Day held from July

629
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,420
1st through 7th.

630
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,180
First at Wisteria

631
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,560
Campground in Southern Ohio, and then

632
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,380
aboard probably my

633
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,240
escape vessel

634
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,200
for the last couple of days.

635
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,480
And then Starwood will be in

636
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,320
the same place, my

637
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,120
escape vessel. Or

638
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,920
push comes to shove,

639
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,240
Wisteria

640
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,200
still on planet Earth. Back at that

641
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,740
Wisteria campground, yeah.

642
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,660
The weather's going to be good this time.

643
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,460
We know because somebody checked

644
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,160
weatherwiz.com.

645
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,800
And it said that a month in advance

646
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,640
that it would be 85 degrees.

647
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,500
That's not bad.

648
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,380
Hey, Dr. Sinister,

649
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,500
you would probably know

650
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,200
just which button to push here.

651
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,380
Dr. Sinister just...

652
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,900
The magic, Dr. Sinister.

653
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,400
Was that Dave?

654
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,600
You know, that whole time

655
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,260
I thought Dave was coming from up there.

656
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,440
It's because you're deaf.

657
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,140
Huh?

658
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,460
Is that a what?

659
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,500
Because you're deaf.

660
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,960
Oh, it's because you're deaf.

661
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:20,780
No, I'm kidding.

662
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,260
That's not funny anymore.

663
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,280
Is it stopped?

664
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,160
It stopped.

665
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,340
It was a different...

666
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,020
There's a little knuckle-sized

667
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,300
knucklehead of a speaker kind of hidden.

668
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,120
That's the previous speaker.

669
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:34,560
I could see it.

670
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,480
And if I'd have pulled my headphones off

671
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,660
and really poked around, I would have...

672
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,280
Yeah, I mean, it's the previous speaker.

673
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,020
There's no reason why anything should be

674
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,320
coming out over that speaker once the microphone is on.

675
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,100
You're right.

676
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,040
We've got issues.

677
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,220
We don't just have issues.

678
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,020
We've got bank issues.

679
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,760
Yeah, well, I was...

680
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,640
I was pushing all the preview buttons.

681
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,280
Yeah.

682
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:54,820
That's the thing.

683
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,160
I'm not...

684
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,640
The system's been messed up for...

685
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,180
It's been messed up for weeks.

686
00:31:59,400 --> 00:31:59,860
Oh.

687
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,880
Well, Dave, now we know the secret of your buzz.

688
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,940
It was never your buzz.

689
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,040
The buzz was always everybody else's fault.

690
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:10,640
Yeah.

691
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,080
Just like all political problems.

692
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,240
They're all everybody else's fault.

693
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:15,800
Right.

694
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,380
And they're the reason why everyone,

695
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,800
anywhere has problems.

696
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,000
Everybody else.

697
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,820
It's other people's fault.

698
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,020
No matter what other people do to other people,

699
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,760
it's their own other's fault.

700
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,280
Those liberal libtards and right-tards,

701
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,360
just blamers,

702
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,060
those idiotic, stupid chicken cowards

703
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,840
can only call names

704
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,920
and blame everyone else.

705
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,160
And you see, it's all their fault.

706
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:41,660
Yeah.

707
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,740
But the thing floating in your punch bowl

708
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,400
knows no direction

709
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,360
except for where the wind blows it.

710
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,860
And that's the true test

711
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,300
of a prophetic type of thing.

712
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,020
And that thing floating there?

713
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,240
There's a reason they say it's bobbing.

714
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,240
Because they call that thing...

715
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,920
They call that thing in the punch bowl

716
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,260
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

717
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,500
There's a little hymn for you.

718
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,980
That is sad and yet wonderfully true.

719
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,660
That's the way I see him.

720
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,420
It's kind of like a...

721
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,080
Well, it's been done before.

722
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,380
I thought of Mr. Hankey and various...

723
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,360
It's...

724
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,180
It's not funny, I guess.

725
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:18,560
I...

726
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,640
I'm sorry.

727
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,460
I'm so apologetic.

728
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:21,880
I...

729
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,780
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs!

730
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,560
He just entered the studio!

731
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,520
Well, at least the smell of...

732
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,660
A horrible smell just entered the studio.

733
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:31,800
That's me.

734
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,700
Stroking his member.

735
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,220
He's arguing with a rhesus monkey on his shoulder.

736
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,600
He's the guy you've been waiting to talk to,

737
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,960
but you haven't had the time.

738
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,200
It's J.R. Bob Dobbs.

739
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,440
Bob, how are you?

740
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,640
I have heart palpitations.

741
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,800
You know, the reason that

742
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,360
nobody's talking to you is because you're a...

743
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,260
Nobody recognizes Superman as Clark Kent

744
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,500
is because Clark Kent is kind of like Bob Dobbs.

745
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,280
Nobody would recognize Bob

746
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,000
without the pipe.

747
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,480
And nobody would recognize Clark Kent without the glasses.

748
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,540
That's so true, and by the same token,

749
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,200
the...

750
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,380
Some of the fundy subgeniuses,

751
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,740
the Bobbies, you know...

752
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:05,640
Oh, yes.

753
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,180
Anybody with a pipe.

754
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,220
Anybody with a pipe and short hair.

755
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,280
That's Bob!

756
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,500
That could even have a little mustache.

757
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,240
They could have a little goatee.

758
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,260
Without a pipe and short hair.

759
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,360
Oh, my God, that's Bob.

760
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,640
What if they got the half mustache?

761
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,380
May I ask one question?

762
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,880
Anything with a pipe.

763
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,100
Oh, wow, that's Bob.

764
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:24,940
That's so funny.

765
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,720
What about Subcomandante Marcos?

766
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,600
Oh, so old.

767
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,400
Been there, done that.

768
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,840
G. Gordon Gordon pointed out

769
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,000
that Subcomandante Marcos

770
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,220
was a subcomandante

771
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,660
and indeed does look just like Bob

772
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,740
with a mask on.

773
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,140
He's wearing a bottle of Bob.

774
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,040
Oh, with the same official underwear

775
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,500
and all the great accrutiments,

776
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,500
the red boots,

777
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,240
the big fuzzy red boots,

778
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,960
and the little fake eye tear

779
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,740
like Sovereigns and Temple Nuts.

780
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,420
It's a wonderful, wonderful getup

781
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,160
they got going.

782
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,060
Mine got up and went.

783
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,180
Well...

784
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,800
Whatever the hell you're talking about.

785
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,980
But it doesn't matter, don't you see?

786
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,020
It just don't matter

787
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,300
because it's all a bunch of Bob stuff, right?

788
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,360
If you just make notes,

789
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,060
no sense at all,

790
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,080
and play five records at once,

791
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,220
and say Bob every five minutes,

792
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,240
then it's a Bob show.

793
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,800
W-W-B-Do.

794
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,580
Bob?

795
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,540
Do I sound a little burned out?

796
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,280
Yeah.

797
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:29,960
Yeah.

798
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,660
A little.

799
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,520
Just a little crisp around the edges there.

800
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,900
You said, what would Bob do?

801
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,460
And then you also said,

802
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,420
what would Brian do?

803
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,140
And it made me cry.

804
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,020
I couldn't figure out

805
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,340
what the hell you were saying, man.

806
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,580
That's because you asked the wrong question.

807
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,260
The question is,

808
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,960
what would Bob not do?

809
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,360
What has Bob not already done?

810
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,340
Nothing.

811
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,880
Is there anything Bob isn't about to do

812
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,920
any second now?

813
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,680
Not a damn thing, Jim.

814
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,120
So, you know,

815
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,760
so I think,

816
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,080
I think we got our fair warning

817
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,620
and what we need to do now is

818
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,140
run!

819
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,300
Run!

820
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,460
It's in your very life

821
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,580
dependent upon it!

822
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,420
Get the hell out of here.

823
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,820
Maybe I just need some medical marijuana.

824
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:14,640
Burning.

825
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,360
We found this printout

826
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,800
in the studio here

827
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,700
that says Ohio lawmaker

828
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,480
introduces marijuana legalization proposals.

829
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,600
That one bill focuses on medical usage

830
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,060
and the second one

831
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,400
would be a statewide vote

832
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,100
for marijuana legalization.

833
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,780
Like on Washington or Colorado.

834
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,960
A la Colorado.

835
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,520
Then nobody would want to move anymore.

836
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,440
They'd want to stay here.

837
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,280
Well, and it's Representative Hagan.

838
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,480
Of Youngstown.

839
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,020
That dirty liberal.

840
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,640
The Youngstown Brown.

841
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,500
I hate them liberals.

842
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,180
He's a known liberal.

843
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,180
I'm going to be against legalization

844
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,360
if it means we all have to get

845
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,420
Youngstown quality weed.

846
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,800
Is that the problem?

847
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,540
I don't want any Youngstown Brown.

848
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,960
I don't want the Youngstown Brown.

849
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,080
I want the Cincinnati Red.

850
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,140
What do they call that?

851
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,920
Miggs County?

852
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,200
Miggs County Green?

853
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,140
Oh, yes.

854
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,560
Hocking, Miggs.

855
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,280
And people wonder why we moved it to Wisteria.

856
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,660
Famous around the world.

857
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,820
Yeah, I actually got lost in the woods there

858
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,580
and couldn't find anything.

859
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,120
Right.

860
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,040
Do you really want the Sherman Gray

861
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,720
or do you want the Miggs County Green?

862
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,560
The Sherman County Green.

863
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:27,880
Well.

864
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,020
I want a passport to hell.

865
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,920
I mean, to sweet, sweet, blessed oblivion

866
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,400
via the Church of the Subgenius.

867
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,440
Wah, wah.

868
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,880
I got the Philodrum and Purple.

869
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,560
Actually, it's the Philodrum and Purple

870
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,760
Vayner is the full name for it.

871
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,900
I wouldn't recommend it to everybody.

872
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,380
No, such frappazoolians are known.

873
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,320
That's why the experiments every year

874
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,980
get better and better and more exciting

875
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,180
because more people have brain damage

876
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,420
when they return home to their jobs

877
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,400
as dental hygienists or, you know,

878
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,160
writers or comedians in the funny man's world

879
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,820
and stuff like that or just, you know,

880
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,800
sewing up ditches with tiny little pieces of thread.

881
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,300
They discover not too long after

882
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,080
that much of their brain

883
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,300
is damaged from big chunks of the cerebral cortex

884
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,780
are just like rotting off.

885
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,920
It's a virus.

886
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,160
It's nothing to do with escaping planet Earth.

887
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:26,740
It's a virus.

888
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,480
A very virile virus.

889
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:35,960
I'm sorry.

890
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,360
I didn't mean to rain on X-Day.

891
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,960
They all sound like Princess Wei in the background.

892
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,240
They all are.

893
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,640
Aw.

894
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,080
Now, why is that?

895
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,660
They're all Petra.

896
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,900
All those voices are Petra.

897
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,500
I thought I had the...

898
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,760
You have the voice in your sound.

899
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,320
That was like that Who album.

900
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,740
She also does an old, obscure Who album,

901
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,680
all a cappella.

902
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,360
She does all the parts herself.

903
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:08,280
And I didn't really like that one that much.

904
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,320
We?

905
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,400
Well, it's probably because you don't like Who

906
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,220
as much as some of us do.

907
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,640
No, it was the old Who.

908
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,320
It wasn't...

909
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,560
It was the, you know,

910
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,220
like 1960s.

911
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,300
1965 Who.

912
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,560
So the less people like that kind of stuff,

913
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:20,820
I'm just...

914
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,080
It sounds like you guys are in your living room

915
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,940
or something like that.

916
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,320
But did we...

917
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,820
That's we?

918
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,180
No, that's Petra.

919
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,000
Yeah.

920
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,060
I thought you were referring to the rock formations

921
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,360
in the Southwest you and Stang had visited

922
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,460
so recently ago.

923
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,360
I wish we were still there.

924
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,580
And so do most of the listeners at this point.

925
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,900
And so does that damn Jack Babbitt

926
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,060
that bit off your leg.

927
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:44,340


928
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,180
I tried to.

929
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,060
I tried to.

930
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,020
So, Reverend Stang,

931
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,980
you were saying that after X-Day comes Starwood.

932
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,240
You had mentioned that.

933
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,960
And I agree.

934
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,420
Oh, yeah, that's a hippie festival.

935
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:56,860
It's true.

936
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,580
That is a thing that happens after X-Day.

937
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:03,180
If there's any Earth left for it to happen in.

938
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,660
I actually ended up reading about

939
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,940
that Rosenbaum fellow.

940
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,260
He was involved in a dust-up

941
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,320
in the Wikipedia community.

942
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,600
Well, yeah, it turned out

943
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,820
there'd been somebody sabotaging the pagans

944
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,360
in general.

945
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,700
On Wikipedia for years now

946
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,100
and getting away with it.

947
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,440
And he was finally exposed.

948
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,160
Yes, and it pointed up

949
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,420
a real serious problem with Wikipedia,

950
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,620
which is that one person

951
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,220
can screw up the whole thing

952
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,960
if they're really dedicated

953
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,220
and if they have nothing better to do

954
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:35,920
with their lives.

955
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,160
And this guy didn't.

956
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,220
He felt that the world

957
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,960
shouldn't have pagans in it.

958
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,980
So he edited Wikipedia

959
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,540
to remove as much about

960
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,500
any kind of pagan thing

961
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:46,960
as possible.

962
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,820
That he could.

963
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,360
But was he in the employ of Wikipedia?

964
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,060
No, nobody is in the employ

965
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,600
of Wikipedia to speak of.

966
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,180
It's a voluntary editing thing.

967
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,540
And that's the problem with that

968
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,420
and democracy.

969
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,760
You get what you pay for.

970
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,400
You know, though,

971
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,380
I've tried to edit things

972
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,320
on Wikipedia before

973
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,400
only to have my edits removed

974
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,280
a couple, actually less than a day later.

975
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,320
And it was on a really obscure topic, too.

976
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,880
And it was removed within a day.

977
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,280
And I looked at the commentary on it

978
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,340
and the commentary on it was

979
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:17,340


980
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,020
a comment that the person

981
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,500
who removed my entry left

982
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,680
just showed that the person

983
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,840
was kind of ignorant

984
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,860
about what they were talking about.

985
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,420
And I gave up at that point.

986
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,920
Well, yeah.

987
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,540
You want to know how obscure this is?

988
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,400
This is about that.

989
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:31,980
That was a convoluted and interesting story

990
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,120
that went into itself

991
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,540
as if Wikipedia works sometimes

992
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,200
because that happens

993
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,460
and then this is why

994
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,020
at the same time

995
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,460
he was doing the same thing you were.

996
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,300
Well, it's the nature of the beast.

997
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,120
It's like democracy.

998
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,560
You're going to get,

999
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,140
you know, what you put into it.

1000
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,340
Which quickly becomes demonocracy

1001
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,240
after a while.

1002
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,980
Well, Dr. Philodrum and

1003
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,900
had a problem with Wikipedia

1004
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,420
in the subgenius entry.

1005
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,100
It says that the church

1006
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,620
was founded by Bob

1007
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,440
and then popularized

1008
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,820
by Dr. Philodrum and me,

1009
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:08,980
Reverend Stang.

1010
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,200
Well, under Reverend Stang,

1011
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,740
it also gives my human street name,

1012
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,940
which happens to be

1013
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,340
so incredible.

1014
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,220
It's incredibly common

1015
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,520
that I don't mind anyone knowing it.

1016
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,360
Gary Jones.

1017
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,260
Gary Hogwell.

1018
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,540
Well, meanwhile, Philo decides,

1019
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,980
okay, I'm retired.

1020
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,580
My ex-wife isn't even alive anymore.

1021
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,800
I don't have anybody to answer to.

1022
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,280
I want my human street name in there too.

1023
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,860
So he himself put in,

1024
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,660
added to the Wikipedia article.

1025
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,660
That's a very serious violation

1026
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,820
of the Wikipedia and ethics.

1027
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,340
If you edit that,

1028
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,320
it's something that you are

1029
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,400
personally connected to.

1030
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,540
Well, here's the funny thing.

1031
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,520
All he was doing was giving his real name.

1032
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:55,820
Still alive.

1033
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,380
So who is better qualified

1034
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,240
to say who he is than he?

1035
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,620
What is reality?

1036
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,560
But I understand.

1037
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,000
Jeff Rosenbaum ran into that problem.

1038
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,580
The notability question,

1039
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,280
if nobody else is going to bother

1040
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,140
writing about you,

1041
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,060
then you have no business

1042
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:11,800
writing about yourself.

1043
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,240
Well, here's the sad thing.

1044
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,500
I went in and said,

1045
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,060
hey, y'all,

1046
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,980
because they kept removing Philo's thing.

1047
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,960
He got quite angry.

1048
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:18,960
And I went in and I said,

1049
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,540
look, y'all,

1050
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,000
this is Reverend Stang.

1051
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,740
You've let me correct things in here before.

1052
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,320
This is Philo.

1053
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,140
Give him a break so he doesn't have to destroy

1054
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,640
all of you on X day.

1055
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,080
Well, they did for about two years.

1056
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,840
But this year they started messing some.

1057
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,760
He somebody took it out.

1058
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,640
He went in and put it back in

1059
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,260
and then it turned into the whole stink.

1060
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,340
You know, how dare you say you're Philo Drummond?

1061
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,440
Well, because I am Philo Drummond.

1062
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,860
Well, how dare you say you're not Philo Drummond?

1063
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,700
You're really Steven Roe Wilcox.

1064
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,020
Oh, well, because I am both.

1065
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,120
But you're not supposed to write

1066
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,320
about yourself on Wikipedia.

1067
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,160
Right. So I have to go in there

1068
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,240
and write about him.

1069
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,920
But what happens if it's in the subgenius article?

1070
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,800
Are they going to discount it

1071
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,320
because the biggest expert on subgenius

1072
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,260
or to try to correct something?

1073
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,360
Well, then you need to get a lackey to do it for you.

1074
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,740
Yeah, that's what I've got a job for you, Dr. Sinister.

1075
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,320
All right. I think I'm up to the task.

1076
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,520
You're lacking some of the facial hair you had last time.

1077
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,400
Really?

1078
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,500
I don't remember, actually.

1079
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:29,140
I change facial hair the way most people change underwear, you know?

1080
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,560
The way most people change radio frequencies

1081
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,220
when at around nine o'clock Sunday night.

1082
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,520
I got a monocle tattoo.

1083
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,000
I miss my mustache.

1084
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,600
I hear a kind of interference in the background now.

1085
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,660
Well, there is interference in the background.

1086
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,240
That's Captain Beefheart.

1087
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,080
But look.

1088
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,660
Yeah, it's the phone line.

1089
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,200
And it's probably here.

1090
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:52,340
It's not even necessarily Dave.

1091
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,320
It's not Dave.

1092
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,120
We've been having problems with the phone lines here for weeks, too.

1093
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,960
You now have your own special added buzz.

1094
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,900
Well, except that everyone who calls will get that, I suppose.

1095
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:02,820
Yeah.

1096
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,700
It's probably a viral thing, but I don't know how they do it

1097
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,940
because my phone is not part of the cloud.

1098
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:14,260
The last time I tried to call a station, the Verizon jingle came on.

1099
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,180
I don't have a cell phone.

1100
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:16,960
A battery.

1101
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:16,960


1102
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,360
I don't.

1103
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:18,960
I'm just using...

1104
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:26,160
That's because Barack Hussein Obama has got headphones on listening to your every phone

1105
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:26,620
call.

1106
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,620
Well, he is the Antichrist.

1107
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,480
With his hand on a drone button.

1108
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,480
Because if you say something he doesn't like or if you heckle his wife, he'll drone you,

1109
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:35,740
baby.

1110
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,260
He threatened to drone the Jonas Brothers.

1111
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,480
Did he?

1112
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,680
I think so.

1113
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,580
It was like a White House Correspondents' Center or something a couple years ago, and there

1114
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,900
was a joke about how his daughter's head crushes on the Jonas Brothers.

1115
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:54,760
They said, let me tell you boys, if you think of trying anything, two words for you, drone

1116
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,020
strike.

1117
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,180
It was a joke.

1118
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,080
It was supposed to be a joke, but I didn't find it funny.

1119
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,820
I think it's pretty funny.

1120
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,100
It's a little funny.

1121
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,520
I think it's funny.

1122
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,420
Made me laugh right out loud.

1123
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,360
I love learning.

1124
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:11,660
Oh, man.

1125
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:16,560
The things this country won't do in an effort to create a pay gap.

1126
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,880
The PR event out of any stupid thing there is or conceivably could be.

1127
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:28,640
Well, all the news headlines I'm seeing, I seem to remember from the year of 2006 as

1128
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:28,960
well.

1129
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,840
But that was six, seven years ago now.

1130
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,100
That was back when a Republican was doing it.

1131
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:38,040
And Democrats would protest about that sort of thing.

1132
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:42,860
And then a couple years later, they get their hands on the levers of power and they do the

1133
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:43,600
exact same thing.

1134
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,800
So would you.

1135
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,360
If you could...

1136
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,860
You could listen to everybody's conversations, wouldn't you?

1137
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:49,740
I would.

1138
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,860
You know, I actually heard a story a few years ago, read it somewhere.

1139
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:54,560
I can't remember.

1140
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:02,440
But I guess there was a scandal in the NSA where they were getting recordings of soldiers

1141
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,360
in Iraq and Afghanistan having phone sex with their spouses back home.

1142
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,880
And they were passing around these recordings for laughs.

1143
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,720
And they didn't give us any.

1144
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,700
They didn't send a single one to the station, did they?

1145
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:14,160
No.

1146
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,100
That's how important college radio is.

1147
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:16,340
I thought they were going to send us one.

1148
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,220
I thought this was supposed to be, you know, a public record.

1149
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,080
Yeah.

1150
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,180
I thought it would be sent to every college.

1151
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,320
Every college radio station should be able to play every phone call they want to.

1152
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:30,340
I think the minute you walk into class, you should sit down until the teacher gets ready.

1153
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:36,860
They should play all of the sex phone recordings of the soldiers in Iraq and various parts

1154
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,680
of the world where they're currently stationed right now.

1155
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:45,700
And any sexual innuendo that they, you know, and that's what you have to hear.

1156
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,560
Listen to this interference.

1157
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,700
Dave is on a landline.

1158
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:51,900
Right.

1159
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,720
Now that's landline noise.

1160
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,440
Does Line 2 do this too?

1161
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,160
It depends.

1162
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,360
I mean, it's just all over the place.

1163
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:06,980
Sometimes if you hear people calling up on the other line, you'll hear a while the phone

1164
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,400
is ringing on one of the other lines.

1165
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,380
Yeah, it's been messed up for a while.

1166
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,600
Right now it sounds like someone crumpling paper.

1167
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:15,680
Oh, yeah.

1168
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,340
All the time.

1169
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,440
As soon as I mention it, it stops.

1170
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:26,540
I can just hear that it's not as crystal clear as it was two weeks ago when it kept

1171
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,220
on exploding.

1172
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:33,460
Subgenius listeners, this is the kind of programming that we strive to bring you every

1173
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:33,980
week.

1174
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:38,960
You need to know the justifications for doing why what we do and what we're doing.

1175
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,940
We're fussing and fiddling.

1176
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:45,500
And if you want to be a real subgenius broadcaster, you've got to get down on your hands and knees

1177
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,920
and eat dirt like a dog.

1178
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,900
God knows we've all had to do it.

1179
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:57,160
That horrible sound just had to be bad mouthed by you long enough before it just shut down

1180
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:57,560
altogether.

1181
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,740
It's gone now.

1182
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,140
We have a magical outlook, which could be a factor in this.

1183
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,360
Now which?

1184
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:13,040
She has a magical kind of overview of the situation and thinks that we could conceivably

1185
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,660
shut off the source of the information without her.

1186
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:28,880
I've watched both section of a book and a movie, where a ch warmed up before a scene

1187
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:36,800
kommerpande.

1188
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,180
What if that Hiding

1189
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:43,920
I know a greed for real fortune is here, because I was looking at the prosecutor's

1190
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:44,740
magnum.

1191
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,120
faced by every subgenius?

1192
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,460
Oh, wait, I have an answer for it.

1193
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,460
I could just cut to interesting...

1194
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,260
Actually, it's almost as bad as what we're saying,

1195
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,680
so maybe I should leave it alone.

1196
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,800
But for editing purposes,

1197
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,960
I could end the show here or anywhere

1198
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,620
and simply insert other material,

1199
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,520
if it sounds bad enough.

1200
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:10,340
To match what we've already done.

1201
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,860
I'll have to dig pretty far into the...

1202
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,740
Well, no, I'll only have to go to last week's show.

1203
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,840
Well, there was the ballyhoo about

1204
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,120
we were all at X Day walking around

1205
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,120
and we were commenting on what we were seeing.

1206
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,200
Well, that never materialized.

1207
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,600
Instead, we start talking about a buzzing phone.

1208
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,460
Excuse me.

1209
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,920
I'm not centering.

1210
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:36,940
And we were supposed to be...

1211
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,000
Not supposed to be,

1212
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,940
but there were kind of like some guideposts for...

1213
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,240
In this little episode,

1214
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,780
and we'd be seeing things

1215
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,860
and we'd be talking about them.

1216
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,940
Oh, there's Suzy Fluzy

1217
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,360
with a cardboard box full of underpants

1218
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,380
or whatever.

1219
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,940
And instead, we did this.

1220
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,820
She says she's not going to have

1221
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,740
the cardboard box full of underpants this year.

1222
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,020
But we're lucky enough to still have Suzy.

1223
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:06,380
Suzy's still planning to be there.

1224
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,400
Although it'll be by hook and by crook.

1225
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,460
And without the box of underwear.

1226
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,960
Without the giant box of underwear.

1227
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:15,760
Jeez.

1228
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:18,360
That's going to be really rough.

1229
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:19,900
We'll make it somehow.

1230
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,660
The hairy pants.

1231
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,340
The hairy pants.

1232
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,040
They're so uncomfortable.

1233
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:29,860
I kind of dig them.

1234
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,240
The hairy pants.

1235
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,640
Well, you took a vow, Reverend Stang.

1236
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,780
When you entered this establishment,

1237
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,460
as you call it,

1238
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:39,900
the Church of the Subgenius,

1239
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,320
you took a vow.

1240
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:40,320


1241
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:40,320


1242
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,500
You wear the hair shirt

1243
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,900
to be reminded of your lack of sins.

1244
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,280
My lack of what?

1245
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,660
Your lack of sins.

1246
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,160
You don't have enough.

1247
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,660
Gotta get cracking, man.

1248
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,820
I'm speechless.

1249
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,580
Speechless, I tell you.

1250
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,780
That might be because of the golf ball-sized

1251
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,060
garter in your neck.

1252
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,300
Or it could be because you're making

1253
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,960
a subliminal statement about the state

1254
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,240
of things as they are.

1255
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,180
He's right there.

1256
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,840
I'm not making fun of my neck again.

1257
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,940
Well, at least he didn't mention my ball

1258
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,060
of my foot.

1259
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,780
That probably not a swollen thing

1260
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,180
with a mind of its own.

1261
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,960
That huge ball of my foot

1262
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,720
that won't stop screaming

1263
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:35,780
and giving me weird messages.

1264
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,280
I wish that ball would stop.

1265
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:40,880
Shut up.

1266
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,640
Well, actually,

1267
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,760
I think it is time to end this charade.

1268
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,760
I'm going to go back to

1269
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:52,880
cut-ups

1270
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,440
for the remainder of the show

1271
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,620
so as to let...

1272
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,160
But Dave is a cut-up.

1273
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,000
He's a cut-up, all right.

1274
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,000
He's the class clown,

1275
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,900
they called him.

1276
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,140
Yep.

1277
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,920
They also called him the class crip.

1278
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,120
The class tard

1279
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,320
and all kinds of very erudite

1280
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,420
and mean things.

1281
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,160
I can remember the songs.

1282
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,040
That was my favorite part

1283
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:19,760
of being bullied

1284
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,280
were the songs about being

1285
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,440
lacking in certain areas

1286
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,980
that the other children weren't.

1287
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,680
Now they just call the problem kid

1288
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,680
the class Dave.

1289
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,780
I bit each and every one of them.

1290
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,940
I made them cry

1291
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:37,580
as much as they made me cry

1292
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,560
with my big sharp teeth.

1293
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:42,920
I'm sorry.

1294
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:42,940
I'm sorry.

1295
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:42,940


1296
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:42,940


1297
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:42,940


1298
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:42,940


1299
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:42,940


1300
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:42,940


1301
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:43,840
Wait, is this turning into

1302
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,080
another subgenius support group?

1303
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,280
I'm getting kind of tired

1304
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,700
of listening to subgeniuses

1305
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,880
complain about their mental illnesses

1306
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,560
and stuff.

1307
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,280
That's what you're supposed to be

1308
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,580
bragging about that stuff, peepo.

1309
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,780
You're supposed to be

1310
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:01,260
celebrating your abnormality.

1311
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,200
Sure, the pinks may have

1312
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,160
made you feel terrible

1313
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,600
and insufficient

1314
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,280
because of your abnormality,

1315
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:10,320
but you're not.

1316
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:10,320


1317
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:10,320


1318
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:10,320


1319
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,780
Yeah, let me brag

1320
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,240
about how dysfunctional I am.

1321
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:13,540
Yeah.

1322
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,300
Let me brag about how little

1323
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,160
I get done in life

1324
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,140
because of these awesome

1325
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:19,100
mental illnesses.

1326
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,280
I prefer to do that by example.

1327
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,220
That's right.

1328
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,200
To brag about how much

1329
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,880
I've done by example.

1330
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,420
Oh, exactly.

1331
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,960
Inaction speaks louder than words.

1332
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,840
I really was going to,

1333
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,120
I really am going to,

1334
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,340
okay, everybody shut up.

1335
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,080
I'm going to put on

1336
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:36,640
tapes that are even worse.

1337
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:37,440
Okay.

1338
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:38,600
Okay?

1339
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:39,240
Okay.

1340
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,320
Are you going to shut up?

1341
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:40,900
Shut them up, Bosh?

1342
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,640
Dave, thanks for calling in,

1343
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,000
even though on the exact moment

1344
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,720
that you finally cured the buzz

1345
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,920
on your end of the phone,

1346
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,340
the station gave you a new one.

1347
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,040
It's so symmetrical, though.

1348
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:55,580
We all have to wear.

1349
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,700
Well, I guess I've got to go

1350
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,320
crawl back into my little cage

1351
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,360
and I wish you all well.

1352
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,200
I really do.

1353
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,880
I've had a wonderful time.

1354
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:04,420
Yeah.

1355
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:05,420
Okay.

1356
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:06,940
And do we wish you well, Dave?

1357
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,560
We're all going away now

1358
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,760
and fading out.

1359
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,540
And so are we.

1360
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,860
But my question is,

1361
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,340
have you ever seen

1362
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,740
any alien beings?

1363
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:21,440
Yeah.

1364
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,200
Just some alien beings.

1365
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,400
Beat the hell out of me.

1366
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,140
Well.

1367
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,600
I drink.

1368
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:28,940
I also use drugs.

1369
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:29,940
I mean, stuff.

1370
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,180
I use stuff.

1371
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:31,860
Oh?

1372
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,700
But you're 100% right.

1373
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:34,240
Right.

1374
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,320
Nope.

1375
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:36,060
No?

1376
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:36,900
Yeah.

1377
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:37,500
What?

1378
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,060
I also hallucinate.

1379
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:39,880
All right.

1380
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,120
I'm cool, man.

1381
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:41,880
No, I'm cool, man.

1382
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,620
I don't mind you being the sheriff.

1383
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:48,180
There was one of the head dudes down there

1384
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:53,920
and, yeah, no, they're never going to go into operation, man.

1385
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,780
The way this earth is rolling,

1386
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,380
we'll have them out of town before then.

1387
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:00,820
You know, this is just absolutely ridiculous, man.

1388
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:06,520
I mean, man, that controls the weather for the planet.

1389
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,400
Man, this stuff is toxic nightmare 101.

1390
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,040
That's why they don't care.

1391
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,340
They could care less.

1392
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:19,920
You know, you got to say, hey, man, man, this stuff, we should all do a class action lawsuit

1393
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,980
on these things, man.

1394
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:21,920
They're dinosaurs.

1395
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,880
That's just common sense.

1396
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,420
I mean, heck, and I was up there, too, man.

1397
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:30,520
I couldn't believe that no one was keeping an eye on those dudes.

1398
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:34,080
I mean, they've been garbage dump city forever, man.

1399
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,080
I could see.

1400
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,300
I mean, wow.

1401
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:37,320
Bob.

1402
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:42,380
Man, I am going to write it down on this computer front, man.

1403
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,160
You got to drink your egg orange this morning?

1404
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,480
Oh, yeah.

1405
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,440
I had it with my pancakes, man.

1406
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,000
I was, like, just dead, man.

1407
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:57,960
I'm expecting that to not be the case pretty soon here.

1408
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:02,540
I believe it was Neil Armstrong who made a report or remark, excuse me,

1409
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:03,780
while walking on the moon.

1410
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,540
This is during the live actual broadcast.

1411
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:10,660
When he said that he saw what look like footprints on the moon.

1412
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,320
Do either one of you remember Mr. Armstrong making that statement?

1413
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:15,400
Yes.

1414
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:16,380
I do not.

1415
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:16,940
Do you?

1416
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,120
No, I don't remember that.

1417
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:21,620
Yes, I am correct.

1418
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:28,200
And I, like myself, I could be one of those entities.

1419
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,620
I could be done.

1420
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,420
I am not done.

1421
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,540
Done or not.

1422
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:35,440
Mm-hmm.

1423
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:36,440
Exactly.

1424
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,220
No.

1425
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:38,540
No.

1426
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:39,340
Taking a little day trip?

1427
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:40,660
No.

1428
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:45,080
Um, Bob and I are driving home to Oregon.

1429
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,620
You know, I really thought you were a ball, ball, ball, ball, ball, ball, ball, ball.

1430
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:49,940
I've been set up.

1431
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:50,800
I'll have another one, Bob.

1432
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,760
And whatever a scenery I want.

1433
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,280
No, I'm going to get off.

1434
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,040
See you later, Bob.

1435
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:01,260
I have been following your career with great interest, baby.

1436
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,120
I can't understand a word you said the whole time.

1437
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,020
Did you eat some peanut butter or something?

1438
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,300
Yeah, you sound like a dog.

1439
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,580
Peanut butter on the roof of your mouth.

1440
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,260
Baby, I have come here to defeat you.

1441
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,880
Oh, well, there's strikes two and three right there.

1442
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,060
Did you hear what he just said?

1443
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,460
Well, welcome to America, amigo.

1444
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:25,340
Oh!

1445
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:25,400
Ow!

1446
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,420
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1447
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,500
You are fast, baby.

1448
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,040
But I am faster.

1449
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,800
All right, you let go of me, you nutjob!

1450
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,560
Like the frightened baby chipmunk.

1451
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,180
You are scared by anything that is different.

1452
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,760
I will let you go.

1453
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,380
But first, I want you to say,

1454
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,380
I love Bobby.

1455
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,540
Put on your flip-flops and let's go shopping, dear.

1456
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:58,980
Put on your flip-flops, we'll go flip-flopping, dear.

1457
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:05,520
There's platinum petrol in the car.

1458
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:12,940
We'll go shopping not too far.

1459
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:21,380
When we were young, we would go pill-popping, dear.

1460
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:28,820
We'd be pill-popping, but there was no stopping, dear.

1461
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:36,340
We'd be pill-popping, but there was no stopping, dear.

1462
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:43,640
But right now, I think I'd rather go shopping, dear.

1463
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,340
Let's go shopping, dear.

1464
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:53,940
We can cast away our fears.

1465
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,700
Let's go shopping, dear.

1466
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:01,380
You know the shops are really near.

1467
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:19,080
I don't know what's behind everything, dear.

1468
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,860
You're not a prostitute...

1469
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:26,660
You're a monster, dear.

WeWow ...

1471
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:36,540
You're cooked and ready to publish $1,000اض fullectivial…?

1472
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,180

1473

Cleveland Heights, Ohio

1475
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,140
or see

1476

www.subgenius.com

1477
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,980
Praise Bob!

1478
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,600
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show

1479
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,020
and we're even more glad that some listeners

1480
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:07,400
have donated enough to help us keep on going

1481
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,940
for another couple of months.

1482
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,100
Not just this show, but

1483
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,160
subgenius.com and all the other

1484
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:13,960
archive sites.

1485
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,480
But if you truly love Bob

1486
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,380
and want some of that slack back

1487
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,060
to rebound to you,

1488
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,860
you should go to subgenius.com

1489
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,500
front page, or especially

1490
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,420
the radio page, or the catalog

1491
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,540
store pages

1492
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:31,400
and help out financially as best

1493
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,300
you can. Now, we

1494
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,940
know what it's like to be on the

1495
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,900
brink of total poverty and we don't

1496
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,740
want any subgeniuses to make their own

1497
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:39,880
situations worse.

1498
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:42,920
But some of you still have jobs.

1499
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:44,800
Even five bucks

1500
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,860
makes a big difference, even

1501
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:48,840
if it's only once a month from

1502
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,800
enough of you. Fifty bucks

1503
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,140
makes an even bigger difference.

1504
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:54,860
All we're saying

1505
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:57,100
is that blowjobs

1506
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,860
could go the way of Steve Jobs

1507
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,900
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1508
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:02,900
We also take

1509
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,520
checks and money orders to

1510
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,240
subgeniusfoundation.com

1511
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,500
P.O. Box

1512
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:11,180

1513
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,320
Cleveland

1514
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,140
Heights, Ohio

1515
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:18,860
44118

1516
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,880
Thanks for anything

1517
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,080
you can do to help let there

1518
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,060
be slack.
