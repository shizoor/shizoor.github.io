00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
Like to drop by the Pintest Effect? Well, welcome to the Hour of Slack!

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:17,000
Praise Bob, Gold, and Connie's Rack! Yes, welcome to the Hour of Slack!

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:25,780
La la la, la la la, la la la, Hour of Slack!

4
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:37,800
Uh, yes dear friends, welcome to Hour of Slack, the second of our triple X-prited Hours of Slack.

5
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,120
Uh, it's something I've been meaning to do for a long time, to take advantage of the internet,

6
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:51,440
and well, now that the conspiracy is working double time to shut down this sort of thing on the internet,

7
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,520
we're going to try to pump out as much of it as we can.

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,960
And in these last few days, these final days, yes friends, as you can well imagine,

9
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,440
the Church of the Subgenius has a gigantic collection here at the Subgenius Foundation

10
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:16,580
of rude recorded material, everything from prank calls to evil comedy to naughty songs

11
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:23,360
and bawdy material of all sorts, that would be, really, is too much trouble

12
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,200
to get the fucks out of for regular broadcast on the Hour of Slack.

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,840
But since this one is just for the internet, it can all just be a bunch of fucks, shits, and poo-poos!

14
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,620
And uh, and so, with that, praise fucking goddamn Bob!

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,280
Huuuh!

16
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,380
Don't tell Bob.

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,240
I won't tell Bob.

18
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,360
Fuck that guy.

19
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,140
Come and listen to a story about a man named Jed, a poor mountaineer, barely kept his family from

20
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,700
der 결국 hijacked.

21
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,500
tell me what his story is.

22
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,200
becoming a stick on a tree.

23
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,940
The legs were too short, cutting

24
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:04,940


25
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:16,320
uh for him.

26
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,080
So his fault?

27
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,860
Probably it is.

28
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,640
All right, now everybody just act cool.

29
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,860
I don't think so.

30
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,480
Bob.

31
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,740
Goddamn Bob.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,100
No.

33
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,040
I just want to Bob Ratby's Bob.

34
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,780
Asshole.

35
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,740
Fresh comes in the mornings at 11 and in the evenings at 9

36
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,720
at www.bn.pbs.

37
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,100
P-R-B-S.

38
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,400
Bob?

39
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:02,500
Bob?

40
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:07,780
Bob?

41
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,540
I love words.

42
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,740
I thank you for hearing my words.

43
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,780
I want to tell you something about words that I think is important.

44
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,420
I love that I say they're my work, they're my play, they're my passion.

45
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,620
Words are all we have, really.

46
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,280
You know the seven, don't you, that you can't say on television?

47
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,040
Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksuck.

48
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,340
Motherfucker and tits, huh?

49
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,160
Those are the heavy seven.

50
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,140
Those are the ones that'll infect your soul.

51
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,740
Bob said, fuck them!

52
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,760
They got to be a bad man's show!

53
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,320
Whoa, I see we've got some people here who've been reading their prescriptures.

54
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,320
Come on, Steve, let's go.

55
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,040
Pop it!

56
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,640
Let's go!

57
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:54,440
Come on!

58
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:54,820
Let's go!

59
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,900
Come on!

60
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,340
Let's go now!

61
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,000
What's up?

62
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,420
What's up?

63
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,720
What's up?

64
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,240
What's up?

65
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:00,840
What's up?

66
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,040
What's up?

67
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,180
What's up?

68
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,380
What's up?

69
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:01,420
What's up?

70
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:01,460
What's up?

71
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:01,620


72
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:01,620


73
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:01,620


74
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:01,680
What's up?

75
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:01,680


76
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:01,780
What's up?

77
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:01,780


78
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:01,800
What's up?

79
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,540
Hey, that's happy.

80
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,900
Hello, chicks.

81
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,580
You're last on the road with Ramblin' with your music recorded.

82
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,300
It's a real long deal that I'm going to feel, so stand by while I pad your skills.

83
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,320
Watch this.

84
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,080
Fuck you!

85
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,080
Watch this.

86
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:14,980
Fuck you!

87
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,120
You're drunk.

88
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,920
Yo, this shit right here.

89
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,020
That's fucking shit.

90
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,100
That's shit.

91
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,380
Shit.

92
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,300
He's just the fucking coolest guy, and, uh...

93
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,180
Tell us about Steven.

94
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,640
I know a fist of shit out of him.

95
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,680
He don't give me no shit.

96
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,040
Other than the fact that he makes tapes.

97
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:35,700
Tastes.

98
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,400
Fuck this shit!

99
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:37,920
Shit!

100
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,460
Shit.

101
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:38,920
Shit!

102
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,520
What kind of tapes does he make?

103
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,560
Come with the fucking songs about you, piece of shit.

104
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,240
What the fuck kind of tapes does he make?

105
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:45,860
What the fuck?

106
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,280
What the fuck?

107
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:46,640
What the fuck?

108
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,120
What the fuck?

109
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:47,920
Fuck!

110
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,680
Fuck you!

111
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,020
You have really bad vibes, boys and girls.

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,360
Shit.

113
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:53,800
Listen.

114
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,880
Fuck with him.

115
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,520
Shit.

116
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,620
Fuck with him.

117
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:57,620


118
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:57,780
Twist him.

119
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,700
Fuck with him.

120
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:58,960
Shit.

121
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,840
Fuck with him.

122
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,640
Fuck you!

123
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:01,980
Shit.

124
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,180
Excuse me.

125
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,960
Absolutely wonderful.

126
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,860
I know a fist of shit out of him.

127
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,440
Folks.

128
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,180
Watch this.

129
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,400
Watch this.

130
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,280
Uh, yes, friends.

131
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,640
That, uh, collage there is called Unclean.

132
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:23,000
Done specifically for these unclean hours of slack by Steve McQuillan.

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,020
We also heard some George Carlin and some cut-ups by Fernanda Nande-Lemur.

134
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:36,400
And now, I bet you didn't know this guy was an MC, rapper, Dr. MC Stephen Hawking.

135
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,060
Ah, yeah.

136
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,440
Here we go again.

137
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,640
Damn.

138
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,340
This is some funky shit that I'd be laying down on your ass.

139
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,980
This one goes out to all my homies working in the field of evolutionary science.

140
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:52,980


141
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,920
Check it.

142
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,380
Fuck the damn creationists, those bunch of dumbass bitches.

143
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,200
Every time I think of them my traitor finger itches.

144
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,580
They want to have their bullshit tub in public class.

145
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,360
Stephen J. Gould should put his foot right up their ass.

146
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,400
No, and his heart.

147
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
Adam and his Eve.

148
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,660
Straight up fairy stories even children don't believe.

149
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,200
I'm not saying there's no God.

150
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,300
That's not for me to say.

151
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,760
All I'm saying is the Earth was not made in a day.

152
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:20,700
Fuck.

153
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:21,640
Fuck.

154
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,620
Fuck.

155
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:22,980
Fuck.

156
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:22,980


157
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:22,980


158
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:22,980


159
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:22,980


160
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:22,980


161
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:22,980


162
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:22,980


163
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:22,980


164
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:22,980


165
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:22,980


166
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:22,980


167
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:22,980


168
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:22,980


169
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:22,980


170
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:22,980


171
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,340
Fuck.

172
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:23,600
Fuck.

173
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:23,600


174
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,280
Fuck the creationists.

175
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,000
Fuck.

176
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,760
Fuck.

177
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,760
Fuck.

178
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,480
Fuck the creationists.

179
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,900
Break it down.

180
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,400
Ah damn.

181
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,040
This is a funky jam.

182
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,580
I'm about ready to kick this bitch back in.

183
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,760
Check it.

184
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,700
Fuck the damn creationists I say it with authority,

185
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,360
because kicking their punk asses be my paramount priority.

186
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,080
Them wack ass bitches say evolution's just a theory.

187
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,200
The best step off them brainless fools I'll give them cause to fear me.

188
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,980
Cosmos is a community.

189
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:52,980


190
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:52,980


191
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:52,980


192
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:52,980


193
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:52,980


194
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:57,060
expanding every second every day, but their minds are shrinking as they close their eyes and pray.

195
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:02,500
They call their bullshit science like the word could give them bread. If them bitches be scientists then pat me in the head.

196
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,900
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck the creationists.

197
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,200
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck the creationists.

198
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,540
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck the creationists.

199
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,960
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck the creationists.

200
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,140
P.A.S.E.

201
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,160
Bring that shit in.

202
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,280
Ah yeah. That's right, fuck them all motherfuckers.

203
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,800
Fucking punk ass creationists, trying to set scientific thought back 400 years.

204
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,220
Fuck that.

205
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,520
Hippling superstars,

206
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,520


207
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,380
Justitious motherfuckers want to have that kind of party.

208
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,660
I'm going to put my dick in a mashed potato.

209
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,620
Fucking creationists.

210
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,120
Fuck them.

211
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,320
The year is 2002.

212
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,620
The Church of Scientology attempts to censor free speech, music, and humor.

213
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,040
And you know what Bob Dobbs says?

214
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,300
Fuck them if they can't take a joke, and you can't take a joke, so fuck you.

215
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,100
Fuck them if they can't take a joke, and you can't take a joke, so fuck you.

216
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,400
Scientology is trying to make me silent by telling other people that I'm violent.

217
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,540
They say that I'm a terrorist, I'm really just a satirist.

218
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,440
Delirious is enjoying this particular mess.

219
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,640
I was never a member, I don't hold a glowing ember from a time when they burned me or turned me to a puppet or stole all of my nuggets.

220
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,060
I know ran off of my money, but I think it's kind of crummy how they do it to folks.

221
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,080
I enjoy making jokes about the stupidly serious, the freezing and delirious, when someone points a finger.

222
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,740
So stomach and stomach from the things that they learn, reading

223
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,940
how to be adolored by the Guru Alra Hubbard.

224
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,140
A straight up istedi

225
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,020
creating a zebra dastardly

226
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,480
a convicting petty thief

227
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,320
jamано

228
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,460
pscyedrumus

229
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,720
or a leapsoule

230
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,480
Fuck them if they can't take a joke, and you can't take a joke, so fuck you.

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,300
Fuck them if they can't take a joke, and you can't take a joke, so fuck you

235
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,460
And Termulator, verbal decimator, dogma violator

236
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,280
Cult agitator, lyrical alligator

237
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,080
Humor instigator, fact disseminator

238
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,360
Turned in Hubbard's masturbators into First Amendment haters

239
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,860
Fuck them if they can't take a joke

240
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,520
And the joke's on you for believing in that skimmy, dirty eating little liar

241
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,900
Pants on fire, believe that it's dire

242
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,600
It's forced to inspire, see

243
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,960
Raw as a joke, if you laugh, don't joke

244
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,460
If you can't read the air, if it smells like ham

245
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,260
If it's a roll around, it's a fairy

246
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,360
It's plants when you laugh, and you know you're the evilest man

247
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:14,580
Fuck them if they can't take a joke

248
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,380
And you can't take a joke, so fuck you

249

Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

259
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,060
That one is about Scientology.

260
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:09,060

263
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,880
In the background, we're hearing the swinging love corpses.

264
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:29,300
But now, a Cleveland band called the Kirkendall Void with Super X.

265
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,120
Sex sucks.

266
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,060
Sex sucks.

Sex sucks.

270
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,080
Your brother's leaving bed too.

271
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:15,760
I'd rather fuck myself with a dildo than fuck you.

272
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,900
I would suck my dog's dick.

273
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,300
Before I suck on you.

274
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,700
Sex sucks.

275
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,580
Sex sucks.

Sex sucks.

279
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,660
You get up quick.

280
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,040
Then I say,

281
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,420
You're so goddamn boring in bed.

282
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,740
I could sleep right through it.

283
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,220
I'd rather suck on any chick's clit.

284
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,880
Than fuck you.

285
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,120
Sex sucks.

286
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,920

Sex sucks.

290
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,040
Your brother's leaving bed too.

291
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,980
And I hate fucking you.

292
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,720
Because it's your female brother, but it's your own.

293
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:35,720


294
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:35,720

And I hate fucking you.

297
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,380
You're so goddamn boring in bed

298
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,980
I could sleep right through it

299
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,280
I'd rather suck God's antichrist clit

300
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,920
Than fuck you

301
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,080

00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,920
Sex sucks

305
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,780
Sex sucks

306
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,100
And I hate fucking you

307
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,280
We'll be right back.

308
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,520
We'll be right back.

309
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:06,760
We'll be right back.

310
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,080
We'll be right back.

311
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,620
We'll be right back.

312
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,360
We'll be right back.

313
00:17:46,480 --> 00:18:06,580
We'll be right back.

00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,760
We'll be right back.

316
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,940
We'll be right back.

317
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,760
We'll be right back.

318
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,580
We'll be right back.

We'll be right back.

326
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:28,520
We'll be right back again.

327
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,120
We'll be right back.

328
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,460
We'll be right back too.

329
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,700
and ask him for lessons.

330
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,380
Yeah!

331
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,760
My blowjobs are so good that the Pope declared them

332
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,520
a mortal sin.

333
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,160
This one's really gross, I'm fond of it.

334
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,560
My blowjobs are so good that I regularly eat it

335
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,600
in my stomach pump.

336
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,580
Thank you.

337
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,320
My blowjobs are so good that my longest blowjob

338
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,480
involved time travel.

339
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,460
Here's another one along the same lines.

340
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,200
My blowjobs are so good that my most gravitational pull

341
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,820
is in danger of creating a black hole.

342
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,980
I get Stephen Hawking nightmares.

343
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,560
My blowjobs are so good that if I ever became a lesbian,

344
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,340
the suicide rate would triple overnight.

345
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,420
My blowjobs are so good that last time I hit a popsicle

346
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,460
in public, I was in a pub.

347
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,060
I got charged with violating public abstentions laws.

348
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,000
My tongue can fold in ways that only

349
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,840
MC Escher could understand.

350
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,020
Alright, I think you've heard about enough

351
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,180
bad blowjobs for anything.

352
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,800
Alright, I've got one more.

353
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,460
I didn't write it, but I've got one more.

354
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,600
Alright.

355
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,460
In this Catholic parish, they had 일단

356
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:09,520
priest was out for the day. So visiting deepened Punxsutawney to hear a confession. A girl

357
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,300
confesses that she just gave someone a blowjob. There's a sheet on the wall of the confessional

358
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:21,680
so the priest can refer to it to give penances for standard sins. But he can't find blowjobs

359
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:27,860
on there. So he goes out and asks an altar boy, what does a pastor usually give for blowjobs?

360
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:35,100
The altar boy says, oh, about five bucks. All right, that's enough.

361
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,480
I'd rather maybe get out the gym. Please order some shim so I can keep my job.

362
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,560
Three, four.

363
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:07,860
Tunky the talking bear had no teeths. Tunky the talking bear. They put these things on

364
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,620
his eyes. He couldn't see nothing. Tunky the talking bear.

365
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:24,600
Poor thing, he had these modified things, these modified organs bifurcated. You know

366
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,620
what I'm saying, poor Tunky.

367
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:37,860
Tunky the talking bear. They installed all this machinery up in his head, in his throat

368
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:44,080
down where Tunky talks from. In his lungs, in his eyes, they installed these little machines,

369
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:53,340
gears, things all up in his butt. Poor Tunky. Oh, poor Tunky the talking bear.

370
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,360
Tunky the talking bear.

371
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,840
Tunky the talking bear.

372
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,720
He's suffering. Suffering. Suffering. Suffering. Suffering, suffering, suffering, suffering.

373
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,140
Poor Tunky. Poor Tunky.

374
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:24,380
All them machines. Machines, machines, machines, machines, machines. In his butt, in his butt,

375
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,300
in his butt, in his butt.

376
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,760
Tunky

377
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,660
the talking bear.

378
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:43,800
Tonky the talking bear, Tonky the talking bear, Tonky, Tonky, Tonky, Tonky, Tonky, Tonky, Tonky, Tonky, Tonky, Tonky, Tonky the talking bear.

379
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:55,760
Tonky's all mad, god damn, he's mad as hell, he's got a dick, and he's gonna put it up on your butt.

380
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,360
But hell, that bear got a dick, and he's gonna use it.

381
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:09,760
Watch out for Tonky's dick, Tonky's gonna make you come like the San Francisco earthquake.

382
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:18,920
Tonky!

383
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,080
Tonky!

384
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,700
The paradigm operating here is...

385
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,980
...a function of masculinity, that is to say, according to this text,

386
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:36,380
a justified and legible reaction to bodily and social oppression and phallic aggression resulting in rape.

387
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,760
While this linkage of bondage and rape is a trope in Western literature, going back to the Bible,

388
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,980
with notable examples occurring in both the Gothic genre, such as the Frankenstein legend,

389
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,600
and in American modernism, such as the short story of the living way of authoring, Francis Kukowski,

390
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,160
it finds what is perhaps its most virulent expression here.

391
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,620
In this text,

392
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,840
the impression of Tonky at the hands of a nameless group of what are presumably scientists is mechanical in nature.

393
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,540
They vibrate his penis,

394
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,780
install machines of control in most of his sensory organs,

395
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,320
and generally blunt his ability to reason or sense for himself.

396
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,680
The response is to rape, that is to say, to reassert through violence,

397
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,560
a masculinity erupted by the social order which is seen as intrusive and destructive.

398
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:22,540
Oddly, it is not made clear whether Tonky was a talking bear before this intervention,

399
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,320
or whether Tonky's entry into language is part of suppression.

400
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,740
In which case, an argument could be made that Tonky has been forced to bypass the mirror stage,

401
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,140
resulting in some sort of arrested emotional development,

402
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,680
perhaps stranding Tonky in the twilight world between the symbolic world and the imaginary world.

403
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,460
In any case, Tonky's revenge against the scientists is without a doubt sexual in nature.

404
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:48,720
He is going to use his penis against them for their transgressions against the unquestioned, or natural, one-word order.

405
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:55,460
And there can be no doubt that to be anally penetrated by Tonky as a talking bear is a severe punishment indeed.

D ain't so simple anything you would expect you as someone talking bear he has to do that right okay so that's a cry

for you per se and as so I have been he will fit these letters here I have successfully даль Gul's

412
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,260
Reagan's Polyp, dear friends, has a new album out called Love Overdrive.

413
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:38,280
It's a best-of compilation of this great band featuring many subgeniuses, including Pope Sternodocs.

414
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,140
And you can get the new Reagan's Polyp album.

415
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,820
Actually, it's on Amazon.com and so forth, CDNow.com.

416
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:51,940
But look at www.trashfish.com.

417
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,380
Trashfish.com.

418
00:30:54,380 --> 00:31:06,520
And now, from Amsterdam, Radio Patapo with host Lord Yeti and Pope Black, Pope Phil Monty and Reverend Mickey Finn and Princess Wee and so forth.

419
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,540
I think Philo was there, too.

420
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,080
Anyway.

421
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,960
That being the case, why is there this witch hunt?

422
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:13,880
I don't understand it.

423
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,660
They should leave the man alone.

424
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,200
So is this also a product of your efforts here?

425
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Chelsea Clinton.

426
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,500
Is she?

427
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,840
I know you were sweeping gills.

428
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,760
You visit the bathroom floors from McDonald's for years and years.

429
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:34,000
Personally, I think that Chelsea Clinton has got to be a product of your gist trade.

430
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:34,540
Is this true?

431
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,460
Well, let's face it.

432
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,700
Chelsea Clinton didn't come from just one gene pool.

433
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,580
I mean, it's fairly obvious that there's a few things going on there.

434
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,000
I mean, that's not just a normal person.

435
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:49,440
That's the cream, if you'll pardon the phrase, of the crop, quite frankly.

436
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,840
That's about 14 different...

437
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:55,960
It's awesome.

438
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:05,060
12 different science�� tranRepresentations.

439
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:08,060
Are you planning to curry track it to being just one unit of American culture?

440
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,640
However, I'm afraid that the closer themal experience has come,

441
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:08,880
the bigger the gap there is with the media now for such a much wider إلى inoculation

442
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,320
of my knowledge and opinion rather than necessarily the people who have told it.

443
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:09,320


444
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:09,320


445
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:09,320


446
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,960
That's a good starting Waldo.

447
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:10,960


448
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,680
BuS between...

449
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:18,860
Can I follow?

450
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,520
Sure.

451
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,820
It's the problem with Ben자�amedza.

452
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:22,940


453
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,320
Oliver North. Can you tell us

454
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,140
now that since Bush

455
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,320
is in the office, can you tell us about Bush

456
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,060
and his connection with the jizz trade?

457
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,260
You've all been quite misdirected about Bush

458
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,240
quite frankly. You may not be

459
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,580
aware of the Bilderberg jizz group

460
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,420
but they are in control

461
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,380
of most things in Europe and the Bilderberg jizz

462
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,260
group, frankly, they don't see

463
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,160
jizz being used

464
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,260
incorrectly.

465
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,860
It's a valuable commodity

466
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,800
and so I think deep down

467
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,000
they wanted somebody who

468
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,600
could hold the reins of power as a figurehead

469
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,240
that you could look at

470
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,220
and you could really think, I think he's suppressing

471
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,720
jizz. And I think

472
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,220
if all of us look at George W. Bush, one of the

473
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,300
first things that enters our mind is, I reckon that man

474
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,620
is suppressing jizz. Well they're suppressing

475
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,260
jizz for a reason. If you make a

476
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,380
commodity more scarce, it's

477
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,260
going to rise in value. I think

478
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,100
they have a corner

479
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,080
of the market on the jizz trade and

480
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,200
they are trying to

481
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,640
make jizz more scarce to raise the price

482
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,700
of it. It's price control

483
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,020
fixing, I think.

484
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,600
Well it is price control. I think there are nations around

485
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,060
this world crying out, we want jizz.

486
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,560
And they want it cheap, they want it affordable, they want

487
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,660
jizz that they can grab.

488
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,500
They want to be able to go out tomorrow

489
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,740
and get jizz. And they can't

490
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,520
necessarily do that now. And quite frankly

491
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,640
I think that it's something that we should be working towards.

492
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,280
The free distribution of

493
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,500
quality jizz. Well see

494
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,380
that's one of the biggest problems

495
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,100
in the world. There are only a few countries,

496
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,080
in the world, that produce quality jizz.

497
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,240
And they're actually

498
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,340
at the most

499
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,140
recent NATO poll,

500
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,160
there were seven countries in the world who actually

501
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,080
produce good jizz. Which countries

502
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,040
are these? Could you tell us? Indonesia

503
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,100
for some reason produces fantastic jizz.

504
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,540
Some of the best jizz you've ever seen.

505
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,860
Also China,

506
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,160
very good jizz. Possibly something to do with the amount of

507
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,140
people who are producing good jizz.

508
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,200
Ireland,

509
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,940
top jizz. We don't know why that is.

510
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,060
Possibly it's

511
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,920
some sort of fairy enchantment. But there's

512
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,500
very good jizz from Ireland.

513
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,420
In fact a lot of the Celtic countries,

514
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,260
Wales produces very good jizz.

515
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,400
Scotland's jizz is legendary.

516
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,680
There's jizz connoisseurs who

517
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,580
quite frankly won't touch anything else.

518
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,080
They'll only have the Scots jizz.

519
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,420
And

520
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,120
Dutch jizz, obviously.

521
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,200
You can't really beat the Dutch

522
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,700
when it comes to jizz.

523
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,080
The Dutch need to beat to get the jizz.

524
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,380
But the jizz is there.

525
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,300
And the second country,

526
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,700
I'm not going to tell you.

527
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,800
Is this some sort of big...

528
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,380
Is it a country in Europe?

529
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:56,960
It might be.

530
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,080
It might be a country in Europe.

531
00:34:59,140 --> 00:34:59,940
That's your first question.

532
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,900
Hello, my name is Steven Thrasher

533
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,040
and I set my Canon laptop computer into.

534
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,840
I just got it back.

535
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,220
Everything that I've written on it for the past few years is gone.

536
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,880
I was told that you guys were going...

537
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,120
that I'd be called if you had to replace the hard drive.

538
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:14,860
I called Canon.

539
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,660
They said the hard drive didn't need to be replaced.

540
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,680
They just said the motherboard did need to be replaced.

541
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,300
Everything that I've been working on for the first two

542
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,600
god damn fucking years of my life is gone.

543
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,120
You fucking assholes.

544
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,660
Now I want you to call me back.

545
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,400
Stop fucking me around and make sure that I get back what I've been working on.

546
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,220
Do you fucking understand me?

547
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,220
And I'm tired of you fucking around with me.

548
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,680
I had better get my god damn disk drive back.

549
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,440
I'm going to sue all of you fucking pieces of shit.

550
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,600
Oh, it's the happy-go-lucky fuckity fuck.

551
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,860
It's the happy-go-lucky fuckity fuck.

552
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,660
You guys stood there signing calendars for two hours.

553
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,520
Or sat there signing calendars.

554
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,160
One hour.

555
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,860
Did any of them have boners while they had you sign?

556
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,420
Uh huh.

557
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,060
They did?

558
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:10,520
Yep.

559
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:10,780
Who?

560
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,340
I'm going to beat the shit out of them.

561
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:13,880
I didn't look up that far.

562
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,640
I just would look up and see the boner.

563
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,260
You'd just see the boner and sign the thanks for coming.

564
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:18,460
Yep.

565
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,220
That's like, thanks for coming.

566
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,920
Show off.

567
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:22,940


568
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,460
Yank, yank, yank.

569
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,300
Tug, tug, tug and a couple of slaps and whacks.

570
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,060
That's how she makes the scarecrow come.

571
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,020
When the tin man's up her ass.

572
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:35,860
Up your ass, motherfucker.

573
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,700
Bark, bark, bark.

574
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,920
Yip, yip, yip.

575
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,640
Toto wants to bone.

576
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,640
She clicks her heels and Toto squeals.

577
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,900
There ain't no place like home.

578
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,720
Fuck you!

579
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,240
Fuck you!

580
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,240


581
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,240


582
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,240


583
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,240


584
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,240


585
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,240


586
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,240


587
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,240


588
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,240


589
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,240


590
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,240


591
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,240


592
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,240


593
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,240


594
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,100
Yank this bird's face.

595
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,940
Tell us, we have the Pope Phil Monty from the, uh, he's the Pope of all Northern England

596
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,240
here.

597
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:01,000
Could you, could you please tell us what are your, what, what about the jizz trade in Northern

598
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,340
England?

599
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,680
What's going on up there?

600
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,060
Well, the jizz trade in the North of England is dominated by the flow of jizz from Aberdeen

601
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,560
from the offshore jizz rigs.

602
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,820
That's the black jizz market.

603
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,500
The black jizz market, yeah.

604
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,200
The North Sea Brent jizz.

605
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,440
Yeah, that's right.

606
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,220
Up in, up in the, the top end of the North Sea, over towards Scandall.

607
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:18,220


608
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:18,220


609
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:18,220


610
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:18,320
And then there's the, the north end of the North Sea, and then there's the southern end

611
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,320


612
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:18,320


613
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,200
So, uh, the jizz market is in Scandinavia, where, uh, where the British Reserve is for,

614
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,160
uh, where jizz is concerned.

615
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:30,560
It, the jizz reserve in fact, uh, is overtaken by the, the wave of kind of jizz centric

616
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,180
mentality of coming down from Scandinavia.

617
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:42,140
Well, I know we've had a lot of rumors and about, um, jizz smugglers here in Europe.

618
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:48,100
Um, it seems to be that America is one of the world's leading producers of jizz.

619
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,260
You should ask an American consumer.

620
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,360
Yeah, and consumers of jizz.

621
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:56,580
And, and there have been a lot of allegations about running jizz on speedboats in through

622
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:02,960
Portugal and Spain and smuggling this jizz ta-, without paying taxes on it here in Europe.

623
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,760
Well, well, Paul Black, you would really know about that much, much better than we do.

624
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:13,680
Isn't it correct that you're, uh, prevented from re-entering America because of your,

625
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,340
uh, previous jizz offenses?

626
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,460
Jizz res-

627
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,720
This is true.

628
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:25,500
Actually, there, jizz is, um, it is, is more criminalized than it is here in western Europe.

629
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,100
And, uh, that you can go to prison for a long time for jizz offenses.

630
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:35,260
Isn't it correct to have some, some sort of phrase in the legal profession there, three

631
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,780
jizz strikes and you're out?

632
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,760
Yes, that's true.

633
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,080
Um, take Rod Stewart for instance.

634
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,640
Um, Rod Stewart had his, um, stomach pumped back in the 1974 and he was found to contain,

635
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,260
um, very many cases of jizz.

636
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,020
Um, because of this, he's gonna ha-, he, he, he got off in the first offender's program

637
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,500
for this jizz offense actually.

638
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:04,260
That's true, but we've, we've digitally removed the name of the real pop star from the 1970s

639
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,340
and replaced it with the name of Rod Stewart.

640
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,180
To avoid any legal complications.

641
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,540
You know, you know what?

642
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:20,040
In this studio tonight, I, this is a really rare privilege that we have somebody of this

643
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,520
magnitude.

644
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,320
We have the, we have the, we have the czar of jizz from America in this studio tonight.

645
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,100
The Reverend Ivan Stang from the Church of Subgenius.

646
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,700
Can you please come over here and tell us about jizz trade in Texas?

647
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,660
Actually, I, personally, I am a spunk man myself.

648
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,180
Yeah.

649
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,020
He's a, he's a spunk master.

650
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,620
And, and, I, in fact, I was a spunk scraper as a young man.

651
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah.

652
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,120
Old folks, huh?

653
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,160
Well, most of us were.

654
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,700
I would scrape the legs of old men as I shaved them, their knees.

655
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,100
Most of us, most of us, were spunk scrapers, as you well know.

656
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:58,000
But, but I've just, I'm disgusted the way, America is the greatest consumer of jizz on

657
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,580
the planet.

658
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:04,280
And the average pink boy's appetite for jizz is staggering.

659
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:11,860
The buckets of jizz gulped down by the average pink boy on the job as they, as they, in just,

660
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,240
just while at work.

661
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,500
Not to mention, you know, to hold their marriage together.

662
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:23,860
They use jizz as a status symbol, the jizz of the boss, the jizz of the, of the, of Elvis,

663
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,060
you know, the, the jizz that he might very well have bought from you originally.

664
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,060
But, of course, by the time it makes it to Wall Street or Pennsylvania Avenue, well,

665
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,500
why then?

666
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:38,800
It's a, you know, thousands of dollars it stepped on, but yet it's a million dollars

667
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,020
an ounce because of whatever name.

668
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:41,940
What are they cutting?

669
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,220
What kinds of things do they cut that jizz?

670
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:43,980
What do you get the jizz with?

671
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,160
That's what I want to know.

672
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,900
What are you getting instead of jizz?

673
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:47,820
Egg whites.

674
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:48,640
Egg whites.

675
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,500
Baboon jizz mixed in instead of.

676
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,460
Pig jizz.

677
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,660
Yeah.

678
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,440
Fowl.

679
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,500
Pig.

680
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,080
Vaseline intensive care lotion.

681
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:03,020
And, and what's worst of all, human jizz and mixed in with subgenius jizz.

682
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,560
Oh my God.

683
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,040
That, and that, talk about a, a, a crime against nature.

684
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:08,640
Yep.

685
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,960
To combine the subgenius DNA with the human DNA.

686
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,200
Yeah.

687
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:13,200


688
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:13,200


689
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,080
It's just so, it's evil.

690
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,160
Do you know who are the world experts on this evil technology?

691
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,080
The Walt Disney Corporation.

692
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,100
Yes, it's right.

693
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:20,460
Oh God.

694
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,120
Don't mention.

695
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,900
The Baptists were right about the, them.

696
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,180
Absolutely.

697
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,540
They boycott Disney.

698
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,640
So they should.

699
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,000
I was shocked to see Disney everywhere in Holland.

700
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,040
I thought Disney was just an American cancer.

701
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,620
No, no.

702
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,200
A shanker upon the penis of our body politic.

703
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:38,520
It leaked out.

704
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,020
It leaked out.

705
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,100
A pustule.

706
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,420
Always released by the CIA.

707
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,860
No antibiotics.

708
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,200
No.

709
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,920
I thought it could stop the Disney shanker.

710
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:46,960
God.

711
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:47,980
Yeah.

712
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,000
That's, that's the way they get, that's they get in and they taint the jizz.

713
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,480
The natural jizz.

714
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:54,700
Yeah.

715
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,320
The normal jizz.

716
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,460
A kid, a kid is born.

717
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,560
They mix Mickey Mouse jizz in there.

718
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:58,900
Yeah.

719
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,160
The way you should be born just spraying jizz, night and day.

720
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:02,540
Yep.

721
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,640
And, and yet, and yet you're tied off.

722
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,380
It's like there's a rubber band around it.

723
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:06,700
Yeah.

724
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,100
Don't you feel like that, friend?

725
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:08,340
They do.

726
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:12,800
They've just, they, they, they've, you can only jizz here at certain times, certain

727
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:12,960
places.

728
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:13,640
You know.

729
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,700
Only on Thursday night.

730
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,140
Only with the lights off.

731
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,360
Yeah.

732
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,080
Only with the lights on.

733
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,300
Only with somebody you know.

734
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:18,700
Yeah.

735
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,460
Only in a bucket.

736
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,560
Only in a tub.

737
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:20,940
Yeah.

738
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,860
Only steps on the desk.

739
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:21,980
Yeah.

740
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:22,840
Only before marriage.

741
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,660
Face north one week.

742
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,700
Face south the next.

743
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,060
They've driven jizz underground.

744
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,400
They've driven it underground.

745
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:32,400
And they're even trying to make you scared of your jizz by fake radio documentaries about

746
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,120
the gush.

747
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,980
Well, you know, actually the, uh, have you ever heard of something like called Dutch

748
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,500
culture?

749
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,780
Apparently it's all these paintings.

750
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,920
Like a lot of people made like centuries ago.

751
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:50,640
And uh, now it's been slowly turning into this, this jizz like Disney corporation kind

752
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:56,580
of thing, which the jizzney corporation, the jizzney corporation, it's like, it's, it becomes

753
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:03,040
like you walk here in this, what used to be once a beautiful city, but they've redone

754
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,920
it in a way that you suddenly feel like you're walking through a theme park.

755
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,220
A jizz theme park.

756
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:09,540
Yeah.

757
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,780
Jizz land.

758
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:12,920
Jizzneyland.

759
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,340
Jizzney world.

760
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,220
Jizzney world.

761
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:15,340


762
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,100
Amsterdam.

763
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:16,980
Yes.

764
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:22,280
You know, that's funny because when I had heard, heard so many, uh, fantastic stories

765
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,860
about the red light district and when I actually got there, I was so let down because it did

766
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,660
seem like a theme park.

767
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:29,980
Yeah.

768
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,320
It was not like a department store, but a theme park.

769
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,720
I thought this is a sip.

770
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,160
This isn't dangerous.

771
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,000
I looked at that place.

772
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,660
This is thrilling.

773
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,960
I looked at that place.

774
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,620
You have to make, you go in there and you think.

775
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,980
They're the best dumb red lights I've ever seen.

776
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,740
Well, and I gotta say that I wish that our theme parks back in the States were up to

777
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,280
these standards.

778
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,660
Is the Milky Way one big long jizz stain across this country?

779
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,280
Is it one sperm stain?

780
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,140
You can't say that.

781
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,020
You can say sperm.

782
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:06,300
You know, there's been a great shortage of jizz in the, in the, uh, and that would explain.

783
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,120
I don't think we can say that one.

784
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,440
Is there really?

785
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,300
It's just a yang.

786
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,060
What does that mean?

787
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:11,740
Yang and yin.

788
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,500
Yang and yin.

789
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:12,860
Okay.

790
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:13,220
Yeah.

791
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,600
The yang is the sperm part.

792
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,700
So it's a big yang.

793
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,020
Okay.

794
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,380
Across the sky.

795
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,400
So then the world was filled with yang or else you wouldn't have yanged it there, right?

796
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,140
I thought it was short for the jizz matrix.

797
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:28,000
I thought you were talking about the cosmic jizz matrix that is the, it's another word

798
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,280
for the score, the great net of all reality.

799
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:30,980
You're pulling my yang.

800
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:31,820
Come on.

801
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,580
No, it is.

802
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,420
The jizz matrix.

803
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,540
That's what those subgeniuses were talking about.

804
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:39,080
There were these convenience stores down south we saw called Jezzum.

805
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:39,900
Oh, Jezzum.

806
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,140
Yeah.

807
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:40,140


808
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,860
G-E-Z-M or something like that.

809
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:43,920
Jezzum.

810
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,900
There's a female hair remover called Nads.

811
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:49,600
Nads?

812
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,640
It comes from Australia as if they didn't know why they were called that.

813
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,460
What a gonad was.

814
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,180
Or even experienced the delightful flavor of gonad on their eyes as a way of making

815
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,480
those pallet tumors and small pieces of eyelid go away.

816
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,020
Like caviar.

817
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,800
Like caviar.

818
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,340
Yes.

819
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:24,700
Thank you.

820
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:24,740
Thanks.

821
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:24,800
Thank you.

822
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,120
Thank you.

823
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,300
Thank you.

824
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:32,940
Thank you.

825
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:44,600
Some of them are bald

826
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,740
Some are kinda scary

827
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:53,640
And this is what they're called

828
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,820
Vagina

829
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,540
Vagina

830
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,760
Vagina

831
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,020
They call that thing

832
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,480
Vagina

833
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,460
Vagina

834
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,360
Some belong to virgins

835
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,500
They're really tight and strong

836
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,820
But big or small

837
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:26,040
I love them all

838
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,580
That's why I sing my song

839
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,500
Vagina

840
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,420
Vagina

841
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,040
Vagina

842
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,060
Vagina

843
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:39,460
Vagina

844
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:39,460


845
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,100
They call that thing

846
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,860
Vagina

847
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,100
Vagina

848
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,220
Some of them are smelly

849
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,280
Like clams and fish and such

850
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:07,040
Some smell like a summer's eve

851
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,260
Cause they've been douched

852
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:09,460
By the sun

853
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,720
Too much

854
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,520
Vagina

855
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,340
Vagina

856
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,260
Vagina

857
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,840
Vagina

858
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:24,120
They call that thing

859
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,620
Vagina

860
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,920
Vagina

861
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,400
Vagina

862
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,840
Vagina

863
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,920
Vagina

864
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,460
They call that thing

865
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:39,460


866
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:39,460


867
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:39,460


868
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:39,460


869
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:39,460


870
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:39,460


871
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:39,460


872
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:39,460


873
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:39,460


874
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:39,460


875
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:44,040
call that thing vagina.

876
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:55,280
Nothing could be finer than to be in a vagina in the morning.

877
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,020
Oh no, what is this?

878
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,900
Something down here smells like fish.

879
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,840
When's the last time you used this sink?

880
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:17,440
Ugh, your booty stinks.

881
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,000
I hate to tell ya, but I don't wanna smell ya.

882
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,200
Oh Miss Thing, you smell so funny.

883
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,040
Won't you wash the coochie, honey?

884
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,900
Wash the coochie, honey.

885
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,120
Ivory.

886
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,380
I'm so free when you wash the coochie, honey.

887
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,500
I love you.

888
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,180
I swear by every star above you.

889
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:01,620
Though near to me or far, I love you.

890
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,440
This is no shit.

891
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:18,700
My heart cries just to see the love in your eyes.

892
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,700
Love that lifts my head to blue skies.

893
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,420
This is no shit.

894
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:38,160
I pray when you hold my hand, you will understand.

895
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:39,380
What?

896
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:39,460


897
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,760
What's on my mind.

898
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:49,900
But if I'm to be denied, you can step aside and kiss my behind.

899
00:49:53,880 --> 00:50:00,540
So take me, never ever to forsake me.

900
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:05,520
If this is a dream, don't wake me.

901
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,280
This is...

902
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,420
no shit.

903
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,160
I hope she even chose me.

904
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,960
You hook ass for aocoos.

905
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,320
hooks for underage.

906
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,980
Its a loops of like.

907
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:32,420
My eyes donn't think hard, but my head isrollo be loud.

908
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,620
So take...

909
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,460
maybe some rest.

910
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,680
Never ever to forsake me

911
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:47,540
If this is a dream, don't wake me

912
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:51,600
I dig this reverie bit

913
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:58,260
And I know at last

914
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:04,060
This is no shit

915
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:25,360
This is no shit

916
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:08,080
This is no shit

917
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:23,960
This is no shit

918
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:56,840
This is no shit

919
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,700
This is no shit

920
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:11,700


921
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,180
This is no shit

922
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:12,360
This is no shit

923
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,740
This is no shit

924
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,440
This is no shit

925
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,220
This is no shit

926
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:23,520
This is no shit

927
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,300
This is no shit

928
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,740
I'm glad y'all find this funny.

929
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,240
Okay.

930
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:36,700
You're probably on the steering wheel too, don't you?

931
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:37,760
Oh, all right, all right.

932
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,340
How long does it look like it's been sitting there?

933
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,040
Steve is coming off of it, okay?

934
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:48,000
Steve is coming off of it?

935
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:48,420
Yes.

936
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,500
How long now, huh?

937
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,020
I am taking, it's a fresh turd.

938
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:58,560
Okay.

939
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,600
What you need to do is you need to bring that turd back,

940
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,520
and we'll match it up.

941
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:05,200
We got a lineup.

942
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:09,040
We'll match it up with the other turds that we have.

943
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,340
Well, what you need to do is learn how to use a toilet.

944
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,240
You're not going to bring the turd back to me?

945
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:14,880
No.

946
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:15,920
You know what?

947
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:16,900
Is this a sample?

948
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:17,520
No.

949
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,560
I'm starting to like it.

950
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,600
You going to keep it as a pet?

951
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:24,140
I'm going to keep it because it's a nice little,

952
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:24,480
you know what?

953
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,440
It's a nice conversation piece.

954
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:27,920
Okay, cool.

955
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:28,460
Okay.

956
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,380
Thanks, man.

957
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,260
Thanks, man.

958
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:37,040
Thanks to Mr. Sister for that particular little cut,

959
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:41,780
and thanks in general to the Alt Binary Slack fucks,

960
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,300
the ABS fucks.

961
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:47,340
You know who you are, but friends, really,

962
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:53,880
that's where I'm getting some of the best of my foul collection

963
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,280
of sickness and audio.

964
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:01,520
I've actually been cleaning my computer out for this show,

965
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,220
and this was mostly MP3s converted.

966
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,160
I will be going into my old collection of tapes for the next show

967
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,500
whenever that happens.

968
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:14,940
Now, friends, let's let Einstein's Secret Orchestra take us home.

969
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,100
Friends, take us home.

970
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:22,460
With this song recorded at the last X-Day Drill,

971
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,860
four X-Day Drills,

972
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,740
2001, I should say,

973
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:29,800
at Brushwood, Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

974
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:36,980
Well, it was starting to be a really smooth professional transition there.

975
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,500
We had different ways of approaching this, friends.

976
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,800
If X-Day had been on time,

977
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,320
we would be out in space looking down on the Earth

978
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:50,840
with a certain amount of sentimentality having destroyed most of it.

979
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,760
We could be thinking, gosh,

980
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,800
now we're on that trip.

981
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,420
We're on a blue, marbled planet.

982
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,260
As ironic as it is.

983
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,360
But I've seen a job.

984
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,580
That's where it all started, where it all came from.

985
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,100
I drive very far.

986
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:04,900
Oh, yeah.

987
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,860
In my big fancy car.

988
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:15,480
I walk down the street, but keep my eyes to the ground.

989
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,380
I'll go round and round.

990
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,420
Like a satellite.

991
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,360
I'll go round and round.

992
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,240
And at the end of my life,

993
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,600
I finally see

994
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,800
the world in my dreams.

995
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:38,440
World in all what they see.

996
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:40,580
Oh.

997
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,340
Wait.

998
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,880
I get it now.

999
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,320
Yeah.

1000
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,060
Last night,

1001
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,860
I had that experience.

1002
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:53,900
I was on a dream.

1003
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,320
That I was standing on the moon.

1004
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:00,680
I must have been playing the Mojo World too much or something.

1005
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,120
I was on some fucked up planet,

1006
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:06,520
and I could see the Earth there.

1007
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,580
And it was just hanging in the blackened and black space.

1008
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,480
And I thought, gosh.

1009
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,920
For a second I thought how dangerous this all was.

1010
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,900
I just enjoyed the moment, but I thought,

1011
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:22,880
there it is.

1012
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:23,860
There it is.

1013
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,460
All the people who ever lived.

1014
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,100
All the stories that were told.

1015
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,860
All the deeds ever done, right or wrong.

1016
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,300
All the little children at play.

1017
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,900
All the animals that ever scurried about.

1018
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,900
Nobbing each other up.

1019
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:46,960
All those dinosaurs that were planted here 3,000 years ago by the fundamentalists.

1020
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,920
But wait.

1021
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:52,300
All the songs.

1022
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:53,860
That were ever lived.

1023
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,220
That was the one that got me.

1024
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:58,260
It was all the songs that were ever written.

1025
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,800
They happened right there.

1026
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:05,140
On that little tiny blue, blue orb.

1027
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,240
Just hanging there.

1028
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,440
I could see it coming out.

1029
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:17,380
And I thought, you know, if mankind fucks up, that's it.

1030
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:27,180
I mean, the lizards might evolve into some intelligent form somewhere down the road, but they won't be human.

1031
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:32,340
You know, they might evolve again, but they won't be human.

1032
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:37,460
And if we fuck it all up then, that's it.

1033
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,980
No more stories.

1034
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,340
No more deeds.

1035
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:47,360
No more, with no monkey hunking.

1036
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:47,360


1037
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:48,280
No more light.

1038
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:53,460
No more songs from Earth.

1039
00:58:54,120 --> 00:59:00,180
And I thought, us and all our friends are so fucked up.

1040
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:08,020
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.

1041
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:15,320
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.

1042
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,960
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.

1043
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:25,860
Everybody together on the line now.

1044
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:30,680
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.

1045
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:33,600
Come on, let's hear it.

1046
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:38,220
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.

1047
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:45,800
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.

1048
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,360
Come on, make them hear it.

1049
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,460
Everybody down at the roundhouse.

1050
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:48,800
Come on.

1051
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:53,620
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.

1052
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:58,480
Us and all our friends are so fucked up.

1053
00:59:58,820 --> 00:59:59,300
Yeah.

1054
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:08,640
You know, as long as we come to some understanding about that part of our nature, we just might feel it.

1055
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:13,720
And you know, a lot of people talk about the aliens, but you know, keep one thing in mind.

1056
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:20,520
There's no physical proof that somebody has to be first.

1057
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,400
Because we're just the first.

1058
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:35,680
And for me, if we were going to get this far without help from the aliens, do we really need to sit around and wait for the aliens to come to us?

1059
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:41,920
Do we really need to be the one to be a part of a big pipe whose mouth would say,

1060
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,640
Could it be that we could actually save ourselves?

1061
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:50,180
Could it be that we could trust God to build our own ship?

1062
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,700
To our known Messiah.

1063
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:52,980
That's right.

1064
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:57,320
Or ship some fly helmets or at least build our own Amsterdam.

1065
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,900
Let's kids connect the dock.

1066
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,420
Connect the dock.

1067
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:05,160
And you know, we can't build our own Amsterdam.

1068
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:11,900
At least we can try to make sure that the next young kid down the line doesn't die.

1069
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,020
We can't throw him away almost in the middle of the college rush.

1070
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,480
He doesn't want to be involved.

1071
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:24,720
We can't throw him away almost in the middle of the college rush.

1072
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:28,120
I'm a son of a fantasy.

1073
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,180
I'm a son of a fantasy.

1074
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,760
I'm a son of a fantasy.

1075
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,320
Oh, my God.

1076
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:59,920
Go to sleep and dream of pleasure ships for my abode.

1077
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:04,300
July 5th, I guess it's going to be next year now.

1078
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:11,120
Go to sleep.

1079
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:21,380
And dream of flight hocks, fun lovely nights, dreams and bad nights, love.

1080
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:31,400
Sex goddesses and switch and guide your way.

1081
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:39,340
The smiling face of God will keep you safe until next day.

1082
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,880
Sex goddesses and switch and guide your way.

1083
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:41,880


1084
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:57,140
The smiling face of God will keep you safe until next day.

1085
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:09,800
And friends, when in doubt, when in doubt, just get you a picture of Bob and look at

1086
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,080
that face.

1087
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:11,700
Okay.

1088
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:16,780
And when your friends say, why are you looking at that face?

1089
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:17,960
Why do you like Bob?

1090
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:22,140
Make them look at that face.

1091
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:28,260
Make them look and really look at that face, my friend,

1092
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:31,300
and they will see.

1093
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,700
They will finally see.

1094
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:36,340
See.

1095
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:41,500
Yes, friends.

1096
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:47,920
As a great subgenius in Amsterdam said,

1097
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:52,600
you better shout and make a lot of noise or whatever,

1098
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,460
because when you die, you shut up right now.

1099
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:02,040
Bob took my brain.

1100
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:05,440
He reprogrammed it, and he stuck it in my ass,

1101
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,800
and now my brain is in my ass.

1102
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:11,220
My reprogrammed Bob's brain is sticking in my butt.

1103
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,100
And you know what?

1104
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,620
It's probably the best place for it.

1105
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:20,820
It really is, because now my ass does the thinking for everything I do.

1106
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,840
I just wish you'd stop scratching your head.

1107
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:28,220
I'm not scratching my head.

1108
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,780
That's my...

1109
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,060
That's gross stuff coming out of you.

1110
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:35,280
One of those lumps.

1111
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,480
Are they hemorrhoids?

1112
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,980
There's something moving in your nose.

1113
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:41,280
That's true.

1114
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:41,900
Yeah, that's...

1115
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:42,580
Now...

1116
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,960
This is why...

1117
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,540
This is why shit comes out of my...

1118
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:48,640
The lumps are a dick on your face.

1119
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,120
Shit comes out of my mouth,

1120
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,940
but enlightenment comes out of my ass.

1121
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:55,020
That is the church of the subgenius,

1122
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,100
where that is true.

1123
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,780
Friends, no one should have to puke alone.

1124
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,380
That's why the church of the subgenius is here.

1125
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,380
They can do your puking for you.

1126
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,320
They can do your puking with you.

1127
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,900
They can feed it back to you afterwards.

1128
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,860
You listen to the sound of Princess Way's life ticking away.

1129
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:24,320
Friends, it's just a great recycling.

1130
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:25,980
It's a recirculation.

1131
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,080
In and out, in and out.

1132
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,960
Oh, yes, friends.

1133
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:32,700
You've been listening to the wonderful

1134
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,280
XXX-rated hour.

1135
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,460
The hour of slack number two.

1136
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,180
The unclean hour of slack.

1137
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,520
You can always get more information

1138
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,160
from the church of the subgenius

1139
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,760
at www.subgenius.com.

1140
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,820
But you knew that,

1141
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:47,880
or you wouldn't probably be listening to this,

1142
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:49,900
because that's the only place we're going to be playing

1143
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:52,460
this particular foul and filthy show.

1144
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,440
But you know what?

1145
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:55,300
I could go on for more than an hour.

1146
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,480
This show's more than an hour of slack,

1147
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,560
because it's more than slack, friends.

1148
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:02,300
It's more than slack when we can use it

1149
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,180
in the last minutes before the conspiracy

1150
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:05,220
closes down.

1151
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,680
The ability to say fucking shit

1152
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,060
with impunity.

1153
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,980
I can, and friends, I don't have to worry

1154
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:13,120
about sticking to an hour.

1155
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,580
You can't imagine what it's like

1156
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:17,100
having to cut these shows down to one hour.

1157
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:17,900
Exactly.

1158
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:20,460
Or actually, 59 and a half minutes.

1159
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:22,420
But friends, this time I don't care.

1160
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:23,380
You don't care.

1161
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:24,320
Praise Bob.

1162
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:25,660
That's the end of it.

1163
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,800
And here at the end is the mighty

1164
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,980
post office box.

1165
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,080
Praise Bobby.

1166
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,680
Oh,

1167
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:38,080
we're

1168
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,780
on slack.

1169
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,880
P.O. Box

1170
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,100
204

1171
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,260
206

1172
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,640
Austin, Texas

1173
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,600
787

1174
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,680
20

1175
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,100
That's

1176
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:00,600
a box

1177
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,260
204

1178
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:04,740
206

1179
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:05,420
206

1180
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,720
Austin, Texas

1181
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:09,840
787

1182
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,540
20

1183
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,980
And it's so calm

1184
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:16,700
at

1185
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:20,400
www.subgenius.com

1186
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,420
Praise Bob.
