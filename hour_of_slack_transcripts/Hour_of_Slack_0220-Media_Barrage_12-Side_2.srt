1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,700
It's time, but unfortunately that nice stuff has come to an end because now it's time for the subgeniuses.

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,960
Oh, you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage to the moon.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:25,480
We subjected it to careful editing to eliminate elements which we might consider in questionable taste for late night viewing.

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:37,120
As it will be shown, it is well within the restrictions of the television code, which is even more restrictive and stringent in many areas than the industry code.

5
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:51,100
We are sensitive to the concerns which prompted your letter and assure you that this network will continue to adhere to the high standards we have maintained throughout the years.

6
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,740
Thank you.

7
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,040
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:11,180
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius power of sweat.

9
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

10
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,960
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

11
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,620
Sponsored by the church of the subgenius.

12
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:53,280
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station and only in the city of...

13
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,140
Welcome dear friends to the subgenius...

14
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,900
...again we've heard that before.

15
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,460
...there.

16
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,340
A little background music.

17
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,460
And a little introduction tape going out of the way.

18
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:33,360
way there's lots of little tapes tonight dear friends now that we're at a higher power or if

19
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:42,320
not a higher power at least a higher plane of broadcasting and uh and also because the hour

20
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:52,800
of slack has yet another show playing playing us in rochester new york hi goby because of all that

21
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,640
well we've been lately i think some of you may have noticed we've been replaying the old proto

22
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:10,520
original uh seminal literally seminal semi-explanatory subgenius media barrage tapes

23
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:18,820
our churchly tapes and tonight we'll be playing that ancient long forgotten or long shunned

24
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,380
media barrage number 12 side

25
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:22,780
two

26
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:31,980
the which was a compilation a best of compilation of the the kpfa berkeley more than an hour less

27
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:39,880
than a show show from that show's second year in in berkeley we're able to play these because

28
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,560
ancient templates of striated copper when were unearthed by archaeologists

29
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,860
uh a few years ago we were able to uh figure out a type of

30
00:03:51,860 --> 00:04:00,140
phonograph needle like device that would play these ancient recordings and uh that's what we're

31
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:05,120
going to be bringing you tonight we've cleaned them up as much as we can however you will have

32
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:19,460
to listen very closely to um to fix my microphone there that's it's so clear now it sounds wonderful

33
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,620
doesn't it

34
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,340
be

35
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:22,340


36
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:22,340


37
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,420
i

38
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,880
don't know

39
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:26,900
i

40
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:26,900


41
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,920
wouldn't

42
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,320
suck

43
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,400
that work

44
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:51,840
me when it's short

45
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:59,380
also the callers to that show, because that show is allowed callers, whereas ours is not,

46
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,940
and it's best that way, really. I think we've proved that. Right, Buck?

47
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,040
Hi, girls.

48
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:16,180
We've sold about a thousand of this fine tape, but not to any of you listeners. I know that

49
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:22,240
there's another few hundred thousand of you listening to this tape that I'm on right now.

50
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:30,300
First, however, before we play the old KPFA wonderment, the bewonderman there, I'm going

51
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,440
to put on some explanatory narration by Dr. Howell, written by myself, Reverend Ivan Stang,

52
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:44,000
with music by D.K. Jones, taken from the subgenius training video, Arise, which will not explain

53
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,100
our church of the subgenius.

54
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:53,260
This is to anybody except those who are already potential, if as yet unadmitted, subgenii.

55
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:02,920
So, it's, once again, sort of an explanatory show. Some of you may have heard, some of you more

56
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,600
faithful out there may have heard some of this before, but most of it I doubt if you have, and

57
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:15,100
I'll warn you, you're going to have to listen real close. If you think the first stuff's hard to

58
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,940
listen to, you change.

59
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,160
You better put your elephant ears on, boy.

60
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:25,880
By the way, the stark fist is printed and will be mailed, oh, next couple of weeks, say,

61
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,620
say, something like that.

62
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,100
Look, prosperity, by blowing them off.

63
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:41,520
Bob's promises to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior, to explore new ways

64
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,720
of going over the edge.

65
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,160
And coming right up.

66
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:46,620
Coming right back.

67
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,060
Plus, to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

68
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:58,480
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

69
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,520
To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around.

70
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:10,020
And channel them into an illusion of creativity that will fool normals and get you sex.

71
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,520
I'm gonna go.

72
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,080
I'm gonna go.

73
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:14,700
I'm gonna go.

74
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,300
I'm gonna go.

75
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,880
Welcome potential initiates, and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

76
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,460
Welcome to Babylon, children.

77
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,460
It's great to be here in the belly of the beast tonight.

78
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,240
Before we get started with our second L.A. revival,

79
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,920
if we could all please bow our heads and have a moment of sacred, traditional noise.

80
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,740
Little realized, even by leading scientists, there are really two races,

81
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,940
actually two distinct species of so-called human beings.

82
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,340
If you gaze upon any given street,

83
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:03,120
normally you might never suspect that only some of these people are true humans.

84
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,320
Outside appearances offer no clue that among this ordinary-looking crowd,

85
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,900
on an ordinary day,

86
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:17,220
a certain number of these people are actually subgeniuses.

87
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:25,240
We would have to creep inside their heads to know whether this person or that carries the rare subgenius gene.

88
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:32,040
But once inside those heads, we would discover a vast new universe,

89
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,300
a new dimension, coexisting, not always in harmony,

90
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,820
alongside the mundane workaday world of the common,

91
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:45,100
algebraic style of man, human, another world that until now has been forced into hiding.

92
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,140
Now at this very moment

93
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,840
the veils of secrecy can be torn aside.

94
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:55,320
We, the persecuted, may now dare to raise our heads high and declare,

95
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,740
BEHOLD US!

96
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,780
For we are the subgeniuses!

97
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,880
But what is a subgenius?

98
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,320
How can they, we, differ so much from the humans,

99
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,540
whose nonsensical laws and customs we have been forced to obey?

100
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,140
Why have so many of us been kept in ignorance of our true heritage,

101
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,640
a heritage that dates back farther than man is thought to have existed?

102
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,780
For in the days of Atlantis, we helped to design the humans.

103
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,940
Certainly, in retrospect, this now seems to have been our greatest mistake.

104
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,040
So, what is the difference?

105
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,280
Examine this seemingly docile crowd,

106
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:52,000
and know that in some few, simmering beneath a placid surface,

107
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,940
there broils a veritable cauldron of repressed subgenius awareness,

108
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:02,780
ready at any moment to explode outward, often with catastrophic results.

109
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,600
Oh no! And here it comes now!

110
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,480
Oh ho ho!

111
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,440
The most catastrophic results of the Church of the Subgenius, dear friends,

112
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,940
are those that are splattered across the airwaves of Berkeley on a weekly basis.

113
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,400
And now, I'm gonna force you here in...

114
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,140
...your town here...

115
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:26,920
...to...

116
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,200
...to hear those awful things.

117
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Ow! Oh! Oh! I told you!

118
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,300
The Church of the Subgenius

119
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,880
The high epop of the Church of the Subgenius, as everyone knows,

120
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:52,460
J.R. Bob Dobbs is probably man's only path to salvation in these end times.

121
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,940
Seen here in the Visitron at the age of four.

122
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,600
Mm-hmm.

123
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay.

124
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,340
Oh!

125
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,080
This is secret puzzling evidence.

126
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,180
That's right. Once again, secretly famous here on K.P.F.A.

127
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,100
Paleolithio treatment coming up for those...

128
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
No, it's Kanoan. No, it's...

129
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,040
...KPFA?

130
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,340
And look for the...

131
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,520
No, it's...

132
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,280
...to Brown...

133
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,800
No, it's Kanoan. It's...

134
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,120
Oh, please, really. It is Kanoan.

135
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,760
And now, here he is!

136
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,860
The star of our country!

137
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,160
Bob.

138
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:29,780
Bob.

139
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,560
Bob!

140
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,420
Now, at last.

141
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,620
Bob!

142
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,180
Bob!

143
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,340
Bob!

144
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:33,640
Bob!

145
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:33,940
Bob!

146
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:36,800
Bob!

147
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:36,920
No.

148
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,080
Not me.

149
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,980
His lips aren't moving.

150
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,700
But he's...

151
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,100
He's looking at me.

152
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,580
And he's saying to me...

153
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:44,880
Oh, no.

154
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,320
Bob!

155
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,260
Good morning.

156
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,280
What's your money?

157
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,220
Okay, you got it.

158
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:49,800
What's your address?

159
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,500
My address is...

160
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,980
Okay, thanks, guys.

161
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,280
Okay.

162
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:54,800
There we go.

163
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,740
Thank you.

164
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,040
Okay.

165
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,980
Smooth as pie.

166
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,800
Look out, Paul!

167
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,780
Well, we got rid of one.

168
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,380
There goes the piano.

169
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:01,920
Phil's next.

170
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,320
Hello?

171
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,040
Okay.

172
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,020
Okay, Phil, stand up in front of this car right now.

173
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,800
Yeah, don't worry about the rushing headlights and the screeching sounds.

174
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,680
Wait, I'm in the room with a listener.

175
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,340
No, it's all right.

176
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,340
Put the listener back in your pocket.

177
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:10,340


178
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,100
The listener can...

179
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,200
Listeners are expendable.

180
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,440
Well...

181
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,840
Doctor's takeoff.

182
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,100
Huh?

183
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,480
What?

184
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,380
Are you serious?

185
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:17,840
Huh?

186
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,520
The doctors are always on the show seriously.

187
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,100
What do you mean?

188
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,560
I don't know what I mean.

189
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,060
I don't want to hear any more of it.

190
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,640
Well, I don't know what I mean either.

191
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,720
He took the form and pulled it out and tore it up on the floor.

192
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,140
I don't want to hear any more of it.

193
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,160
And you said, are you serious or are you just being on the show?

194
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,160
And I said...

195
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,240
At the same time, there's many, many things.

196
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,300
Suddenly, the doctors suddenly left the vaccine for no reason at all.

197
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,660
I did get a request because...

198
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,840
There's many, many...

199
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,100
Oh, Bob, turn down the sound effects.

200
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,260
I got to get the directions to my house to hear them.

201
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,640
Okay, yeah.

202
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,300
Okay, listener, now, where is it that we live?

203
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,480
Right, how do I get there?

204
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,820
I don't know.

205
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,260
I guess you could drive down one of the main streets until you hit Berkeley.

206
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:54,920
Wow.

207
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,000
Got it.

208
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,600
Dead center.

209
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,160
Those primitive peasants didn't believe our story, but they believed it when the mushroom

210
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,060
cloud blasted them off the island.

211
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,120
And we've got to ask you about that.

212
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,300
By the time I got to .stock...

213
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,620
Tell me that Bob may live.

214
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,300
I asked him, why are you alive?

215
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,900
Hold on to the phone.

216
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,960
Okay, there are very far...

217
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,420
Ah!

218
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:17,800
Ah!

219
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:17,800


220
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:17,800


221
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:17,800


222
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:17,800


223
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,600
Scared away to call our...

224
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,840
Come on, guys, let's drive down Shattuck Avenue real fast.

225
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,620
This station's hard to steer.

226
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Check orange light sequence two.

227
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,540
Yeah, well, at least out here in space where we don't talk about nothing, there's lots

228
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,260
of continuity.

229
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,080
Check emergency override switch.

230
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,180
Yes, but don't worry, little subgeniuses.

231
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:45,620
This war that we're trying to start on the air right now isn't for you.

232
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,640
Oh.

233
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:47,780
More?

234
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,420
More book.

235
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:51,980
More book.

236
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,680
You are absolutely amazed.

237
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,860
Yeah, I know.

238
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,760
Want some more book?

239
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,200
I don't know.

240
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,460
It's got some nice big fat places you can just blast your fist right into it.

241
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:00,860
Kill me!

242
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,480
Ah!

243
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,140
Yeah, we paid for them bombs.

244
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,220
Why couldn't we get the thrill of pushing the button?

245
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,440
And we paid for the schools.

246
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:05,660
That's right.

247
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,700
If I paid for that school, how do you want it?

248
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,100
Blow it up.

249
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,580
Well, what if I go anyway and I can pretend?

250
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,400
Because, you know, after something's happened, all you have left is a memory so you can just

251
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,320
pretend and convince yourself that you're alive.

252
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,620
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

253
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:16,620


254
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:16,620


255
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:16,620


256
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:16,620


257
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,060
I wouldn't worry about the memories none.

258
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,680
But then I won't have the Kodak.

259
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,180
No one has a Polar.

260
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:21,300
It was just a dream.

261
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,460
It was just a bad dream that, uh, you know, you never went to school.

262
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:23,480
It was just a dream.

263
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:23,940
It was just a bad dream that, uh, you know, you never went to school.

264
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,100
The past memories of my life that I no longer live.

265
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,420
That would be awful.

266
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,500
And let's have an awful little song.

267
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,680
Your memories.

268
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,020
Boy, I bet you didn't expect me to be listening tonight.

269
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,500
Your memories are fading.

270
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,340
Just by chance, I heard you guys came along.

271
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,040
Oh, your memories are fading.

272
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,240
I've got to wake up tomorrow.

273
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,100
Even as you speak, your memories are fading.

274
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,600
I've got to wake up tomorrow.

275
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:46,600


276
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,180
Oh, your thoughts are gone.

277
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,260
I've got people floating about unregulated, you know.

278
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,540
They're not your own.

279
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,520
Everybody's floating around now here in the morning.

280
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:56,820
Oh, your memories are fading.

281
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,440
After the bomb.

282
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,560
Where do I come from?

283
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,720
You come from the show.

284
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,620
What is my name?

285
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,080
What am I doing here?

286
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,840
The nuclear bomb.

287
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,040
All right, come on.

288
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
What color is your memory?

289
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,340
Was this my dream?

290
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,820
Or a man or a tiny bomb?

291
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,580
How could you tell me that?

292
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:16,580


293
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:16,580


294
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:16,580


295
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:16,580


296
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:16,580


297
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:16,580


298
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:16,580


299
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:16,580


300
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:16,580


301
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:16,580


302
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:16,580


303
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:16,580


304
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,000
You're going to tell me that now?

305
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,580
You're going to tell me that now?

306
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:17,580


307
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:17,580


308
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,100
Yeah, you're memories.

309
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,260
Was it real at all?

310
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,100
You're out?

311
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,720
This is real.

312
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,520
This is real.

313
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,120
This is real.

314
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,440
Inhuman, this is me?

315
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,020
Yes.

316
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,080
We're all you.

317
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,500
I never sound like this.

318
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,700
I only hear you sleep.

319
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,920
But I'm using the puzzling evidence voice because it saves on batteries while I think

320
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,520
with your brain.

321
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,580
Well, I've seen that so-called puzzling evidence before and may be puzzling where it comes

322
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,740
from, but as far as I'm concerned, it's just a lot of the same hoopla that they've been

323
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,960
feeding us all these years.

324
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,760
Somebody ought to do something about this business before it gets completely out of

325
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,020
hand.

326
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,300
Well, if that kind of thing doesn't bother me, what I want to know is when I talk to

327
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,820
somebody, is he real when I'm talking to him?

328
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,480
Only when you're talking to him is he real.

329
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,280
When he tries to answer, he becomes tape again.

330
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,500
Oh my God.

331
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,060
Is this for real?

332
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,080
No, no, no.

333
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,000
This is just a tape.

334
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,420
Relax.

335
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,440
It is not the day before or the week between.

336
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,480
It's just the show.

337
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,280
The show that, yes, was thrown into the bay three weeks ago.

338
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,380
They're not actors.

339
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,360
And it struggled free of its chains and it floated up, swam back to the studio here,

340
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,300
climbed up the antenna, and is now running all the way down those little air wires right

341
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,180
into your ears.

342
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,800
Hi, you're still on the air.

343
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,060
There will be a test on this show.

344
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,660
Stay tuned.

345
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,980
You never know when you're here or not on this show because there are so many doctors.

346
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,260
Just a few dugs, sprinkle a few Gary's, drop a few bobs over here.

347
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,840
Yes, I'm sorry, listener.

348
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,160
You've got a real problem now.

349
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,660
They're alive all the time.

350
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,260
I'm sorry.

351
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:43,260


352
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:43,260


353
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:43,260


354
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:43,260


355
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,320
You've got to be kidding me.

356
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,440
Oh.

357
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,100
Up there it went.

358
00:16:59,260 --> 00:16:59,920
And here.

359
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,900
Oh, wait a minute.

360
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,740
I think it's time for a commercial.

361
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,940
Bob Dobbs.

362
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,020
He's no slob.

363
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,040
Bob Dobbs.

364
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,040
He's no fool.

365
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,660
He is the head of the subgenious church.

366
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,060
That's why he's super.

367
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:21,700
cool like glass he's Bob Dobbs he's no slob Bob Dobbs he's no fool he is the head of the

368
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,740
subgenius church and he is super cool

369
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,700
good morning and welcome to the subgenius devotional hour here

370
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,020
before the normal scary time

371
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:45,100
that was a stink-all but it had lots of prophecy involved

372
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,140
you heard it right here on the subgenius hour

373
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,240
and lots of few words

374
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,180
wonder why Fido came home with his wazoo missing

375
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,680
or wonder why those beefs like Buster and Bill

376
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,060
in the parlor and the pasture are lying out there with their throats

377
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,060
and half their rectums missing

378
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,840
well it's because of those exists who came down to this earth

379
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,500
one Christmas day many millennia ago

380
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,940
to forge a new link

381
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,620
one might call it a hot link

382
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,840
between the aliens

383
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,000
and the subgenius

384
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,980
a giant sausage of knowledge from the center of the universe

385
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,520
the galactic center

386
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,580
those little tykes will be able to carry on for us

387
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,820
every one of those little kids is a potential Lee Majors

388
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,000
and I hope you're pleased with what we've done

389
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,460
the rising generations shall have reason to praise us

390
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,000
to pour out libations on our smoking altars

391
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,040
and we shall go

392
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,240
this is a non-smoking section

393
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,920
the book of the subgenius

394
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,800
lunatic prophecies for the coming weird times

395
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,940
out now and on your stand

396
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,980
from McGraw

397
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,440
hill

398
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,020
out now

399
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,240
if you don't see the book

400
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,040
on your stand

401
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,660
McGraw

402
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:42,920
complain

403
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,660
loudly agitate

404
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,600
and fire fire fire

405
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,700
in the store if necessary

406
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,160
they are crazy

407
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,280
it's a question of bull dada

408
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,540
and its application of course

409
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,280
in the society surrounding the bull dada

410
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,440
we apply it from a little disposable tube

411
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,100
that's right using the power shell

412
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,140
and using the spirit code

413
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,600
the Yakatizma matrix applies the bull dada

414
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,920
to the normals and pinks

415
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,940
this is classified information

416
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,280
do you want to let this out on the air

417
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,800
take the sludge

418
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,960
and the sludge

419
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,280
and turn it into a sloth

420
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:10,340
sludge

421
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,380
speak to me of sludge

422
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,740
if you want to know the truth

423
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,420
I would have slit the throat

424
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,000
rather than mention sludge

425
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,260
sludge

426
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:17,780
sludge

427
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,240
sludge

428
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,100
what is going on

429
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,780
it's going to all shoot up

430
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,840
in the little magic machine here

431
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,900
this is the part where the tape

432
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,480
the tape is spliced right here

433
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,260
and it's going backwards

434
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,880
through the heads

435
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,240
it's all twisted up

436
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,160
and stretched onto the shape

437
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,620
it's hard for the signal

438
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,480
to be ok on here

439
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,380
but even the TV is hard to make it through

440
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,540
don't look down

441
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,080
don't look down

442
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,280
don't go upstairs

443
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,200
don't go out of the house

444
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,960
it's over

445
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:38,960


446
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:38,960


447
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:38,960


448
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:38,960


449
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:38,960


450
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:38,960


451
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,520
it's only a movie

452
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,320
it's not real

453
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,840
don't go in the waiting pool

454
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,580
don't pass the gazebo

455
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,800
don't look in the woodpile

456
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,700
stay out of the forest

457
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,260
keep away from the junkyard

458
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,460
don't look in the scrap heap

459
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,700
stay away from the gazebo

460
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,480
it's only a movie

461
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,800
keep telling yourself

462
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,960
it's not real

463
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,580
it's not really happening

464
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,120
you won't believe the horror

465
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,940
you won't believe the tale of the dead

466
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,540
it's a horror

467
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,120
but it's all real

468
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,960
even the records try to escape this show

469
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,740
oh yes

470
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,860
they try to roll out the door

471
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,460
but we catch them

472
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,800
force them back on the turntables

473
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,920
actually there is a copy of this show

474
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,080
let's go smurfing ok

475
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,040
yeah

476
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,840
hey pass me that fin

477
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,120
hey I want some ketchup on my smurf

478
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,740
the original smurfers were

479
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,700
tiny fin creatures

480
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,260
with 8 legs and no harassment

481
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,680
but soon over the millennia of time

482
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,120
they evolved into the cross-opterygites

483
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,040
and double crayfish

484
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,940
and those were used for food

485
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:38,940


486
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,940
by higher ups

487
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,280
and baits to catch the large pink smurfs

488
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,760
which basked unknowing in the cenozoic seas

489
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,100
unknowing?

490
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,820
listen to those poor souls

491
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,700
yowling in the hell of the lonely deep

492
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,040
let's go back to the beach for a while

493
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,860
yes

494
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,260
there we go

495
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,540
don't you wish you knew how to get to the subgenius beach party?

496
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,080
don't you wish you could paddle with those useless legs

497
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,180
now that you're a dinosaur in the wrong world?

498
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,680
while out to sea the gigantic archelon

499
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,000
and fastetocalonosaurus

500
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,220
mentioned in official subgenius literature

501
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,240
cavorts with beach bunnies

502
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,160
on sandy shores

503
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,700
where's the beach party?

504
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
is it in santa cruz?

505
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,340
ha ha wouldn't you like to know

506
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:13,920
I need to know

507
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,820
San Francisco

508
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,720
near fort mason

509
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,840
ah what time?

510
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,640
it's about the best way I can find it

511
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,960
about 9 o'clock it starts tonight

512
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,680
hey listen brother

513
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,280
don't release this valuable information on the air

514
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,760
we don't want every pole buck as on on our chat

515
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,240
well the thing is there are only probably 11 people listening right now

516
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,040
two of them are about ready to turn their radios off

517
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,240
the other five will about get something to eat

518
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,840
one will start to eat chili and be rocking some hard shit

519
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,220
we're down to have a bottle of myers rum right now

520
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,320
that's disgusting

521
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,340
the young dinosaurs dig

522
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,280
the young dinosaurs as we all know

523
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,140
perish from an excess or effluent of yucca machismo

524
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,580
well actually I believe in living and let live

525
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,880
and leaving these marvelous beasts alone

526
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,720
their chicken like skin is too hard for the standard taxidermic application

527
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,420
calm down now you'll be alright

528
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,540
your phone's just taking control of you

529
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,240
it's alright

530
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,700
if you sit down you'll be better

531
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,080
you gonna mate it up with an elephant?

532
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,540
hey that wouldn't work

533
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,840
that would not work

534
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,200
that's a rather perverse way of saying it

535
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,240
that's a rather perverse and disgusting suggestion

536
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,900
and I'm rather surprised that you would order it over the radio

537
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,580
remember there are

538
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,840
this is a family broadcast

539
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,200
we have people listening whose patronage we like to cultivate

540
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,160
is this a joke?

541
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,580
so you can take your inducive sexual bestial suggestions mister

542
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,260
and just pack them off to Poughkeepsie

543
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,440
but that's old age thinking

544
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,780
what we need in the book is music like this scary

545
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,940
music like this happy

546
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,760
music like this crowd offense

547
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,880
I haven't been so high since 1969

548
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,140
hey I don't know it's uh

549
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,820
look everything's slanting down to a death pool

550
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:41,920
melting

551
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,900
oh they're all on the floor

552
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,960
yes the 60s are just a pile on the floor now

553
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,660
but fortunately we've been able to piece them together

554
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,240
you see they ask us how we managed to make these reconstructions using just one bone

555
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,000
well the answer is that even on your body muscles make deep spasms or scars in the bone

556
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,140
and from these we're able to distinguish the amount of flexion that might exist beneath the skin

557
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,380
now as for the skin we know these creatures have an integument of feathers or of cheese or

558
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:13,980
or scaly rind and an outer epiphyropulodermis as one might call it

559
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,620
how exactly does this all fit into the scary part?

560
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,700
well I'm afraid to tell you that these creatures as we call them are not dead

561
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,680
they live no longer in the faith of reason

562
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:32,460
but they lurk outside our universe waiting always to enter and reclaim their former domain

563
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,960
sure are weird looking

564
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,800
it opens

565
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,200
because it's the giant bob

566
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,720
but a steed boulder

567
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,860
look at the size of that thing

568
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:40,580
huge bob

569
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,760
dots the size of boulders

570
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,760
oh I've never seen grain like that

571
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,320
no wonder they make these sphinxes

572
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,800
look here are the jewels

573
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,500
listen Bill

574
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,520
we've got to get up to his forehead and pull one of those out of his eyes and get it back to dodge

575
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,640
but watch out for the brow don't get caught in the brow

576
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,500
whatever you do to a brow

577
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,360
oh no

578
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,840
wires and cables

579
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,300
yes

580
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,980
steed gets out on the driver's side

581
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,500
some kind of cybernetic u-brow

582
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,680
we'll just push all this tape aside

583
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,500
instantly the gunman fires

584
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,580
oh look out

585
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:08,940
look out

586
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,980

587
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,620
oh no look out

588
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,660
the glass madness is here

589
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,060
oh no

590
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,280
let's get out of here real fast

591
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,640
we're going to tire some wild wild smiles

592
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,820
wait a minute I'm going back for the glass smiles

593
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,340
the tape's all wrapped around my legs

594
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,660
we left all the drugs over there

595
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,420
you don't have to try to carry me down this giant brow

596
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:32,300
I've got to tear these hollow pills down here and alter the president's body before the rest of these guys get back

597
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,900
I just remember to send me the data

598
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,280
this story's getting real confusing fast

599
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,140
we can just hold out till next week

600
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:44,120
okay I feel better now maybe if I take some more of that wotan then I'll be able to walk out

601
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,480
rub a little gabrogfran into the sore part there and you'll be okay

602
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,260
I will suck all the money from your wallets

603
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,180
yeah our wallets

604
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,100
vacuum cleaning flying saucer

605
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,060
we've got collar number two just begging to get on this wallet

606
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,520
hey go to New York and hit the pope of New York's wallet it's bigger than anybody's

607
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,100
I see what's happening now and suddenly collar you're with us now what's going on quick start shooting back

608
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,360
come on you've got to defend yourself on the air

609
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,780
yes it's no fun we can't play this computer game now man or kill me

610
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,560
okay let's drag the next collar in

611
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,060
well that collar didn't believe anything at all

612
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,680
all the scary collars are gone

613
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,560
this is the beginning of chapter 19 the acubedian background continues

614
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,260
this is a high speed acubedian background

615
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,740
you can hear the high speed acubedian doctors talking very fastly

616
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,060
ah yes that's almost nearly a physical

617
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,240
the caller ringing the blue line

618
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,920
yes I'm sorry no we're out of those three dimensional Arnold Palmer heads

619
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,420
if you have the nerve enough to call we have the nerve enough to listen

620
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,540
no wait I'm all out of space I'm out of here I'm track four

621
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,060
what time is it here

622
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,100
oh now you're going to Elkhart

623
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,520
start the car in the studio

624
00:25:50,520 --> 00:26:00,260
at this very moment there have been stories filtering into the studio about other sports events being kidnapped and the entire thing taken to another planet

625
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,500
that's right these are aliens from another planet kidnapping other people

626
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:03,500


627
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,040
these are American sports teams

628
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,780
it's not a legal problem it's not a political problem

629
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,560
it's an alien problem

630
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,680
oh I've never seen one

631
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,680
you know the visits from aliens need not be a painful item it can be quite an exciting time

632
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:23,820
I don't personally have any desire to have it's like meeting Bob I don't want to do it

633
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:30,540
I just need to get you to understand exactly what's happening here at the church of the subgenius

634
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,660

decreed your brain is working without your imagination of a cosmic puppeteer who works

00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


723
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


724
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


725
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


726
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


727
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


728
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


729
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


730
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


731
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


732
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


733
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


734
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


735
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


736
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


737
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


738
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:57,600


739
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,060
oh

740
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,240
bob don't ever change

741
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,580
bob

742
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,200
bob

743
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,800
bob

744
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,800
his pipe is the bowl with the doddle that rains on the roof like

745
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:22,180
oh hammer these pipes in the ground his neck is the skin with the waddle

746
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,760
in flaming folks desire

747
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,740
how you learning to play the guitar

748
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,440
just hammer pipes in the ground all day don't make no sense

749
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,320
um

750
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,100
yeah

751
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,100


752
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:47,040
then he's got like yes luggage with a brain that's what bob's got i first had my experience with

753
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,480
he's bob

754
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:47,680
bob don't ever change

755
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:47,680


756
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,540
uh bob's big boy on the corner of bellevue

757
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:50,680
on the corner of bellevue

758
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:50,780
hugh bay

759
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,860
drive in las angeles

760
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,660
california

761
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,340
in 1959

762
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:54,440
in 1959

763
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,720
it changed my life and i became able to dance tonight

764
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:57,720


765
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,780
to open my third nostril and snort the divine wisdom of the subgenius.

766
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:09,360
Every morning before breakfast, I find it helpful to go into my sternutician room, as we call them,

767
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,780
and sniff up.

768
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,200
Yes, violent sternutician may be observed.

769
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,560
Named after the famous sternio?

770
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,900
Well, yes, the famous sternio does practice sternutician,

771
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,080
as does everyone who possesses the simple accoutrement of a handkerchief

772
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,900
and a head full of ideas that need to be relieved.

773
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,680
Blast it out as it might be.

774
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,880
Oh, Bob with your square little gray brain.

775
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,200
How do you use that thing? It's hooked up all wrong.

776
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,360
Oh, Bob, what about this rumor that your pipe is a living organism?

777
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,600
Yes, that has invaded your brain and made everything all wrong.

778
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,020
Yeah, what about that, Bob, grinning, malarkey, turkey, flunky...

779
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,640
What about them aliens, as you say, or us aliens? We're not aliens.

780
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,820
How about it, Bob? And who's this anti-Bob?

781
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,880
Some relation of yours? Some nepotistic cousin on the payroll end?

782
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,480
In a computer field of nerds.

783
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,860
We dare to question our supreme epopt, Bob,

784
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,660
because we have...

785
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,620
We have the freedom within the Church of the Subgenius

786
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,420
to question even the basic verities,

787
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,940
like whether or not there is a Mokele Mbembe,

788
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,480
whether it's frog-like bellow does echo over the South American

789
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,940
or even the African swamps.

790
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,180
Swamps?

791
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,500
Swamps, yes, yes, swamps.

792
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,240
Right now, Glass Madness is in that swamp, yes, he's gone down to the green hill.

793
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,040
They say the Mokele Mbembe lives in Lake Ukabalabonga,

794
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,940
which is only four feet deep, but the creature...

795
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:20,780
Ukabalabonga.

796
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,060
No, Ukabalabonga.

797
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,000
All that rubbish, these people are making rubbish.

798
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:24,860
Let's just keep walking.

799
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,020
Special 21st Street, Cheduckalus, down here.

800
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,060
But we're saving that one for later.

801
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,060
Buy the book of the Subgenius.

802
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,960
I'm just screaming.

803
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,960
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta a job.

804
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,500
Gotta a job.

805
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,820
Gotta a job.

806
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,240
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta a job.

807
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,020
Get out of work, say something true.

808
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,400
I'm in a tank, in a Navy.

809
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,940
I'm gonna pay.

810
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,300
Sure.

811
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,140
That was great.

812
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,600
That was great.

813
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:54,600


814
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,420
That was great.

815
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:55,660


816
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:55,660


817
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,940
I understand that dare not speak its name.

818
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,940
You always wondered what they sounded like, didn't you?

819
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,220
But this is them.

820
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:00,840
Ow!

821
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,340
You got me!

822
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,100
Woo!

823
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,160
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta a job.

824
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,000
Yeah, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta get a job.

825
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,560
Yeah, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta a job.

826
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,920
Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta a job.

827
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,480
Yeah, sure.

828
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,400
Well, we'll find out.

829
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,460
Good morning, Safe Muffin.

830
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,400
Howdy.

831
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,040
Good morning.

832
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,980
I was just wondering if you could tell me, uh,

833
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,320
Rare.

834
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,940
What those occasional extremely low rumbling sounds that almost sound like acoustic feedback

835
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,760
coming to my speakers are.

836
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,220
And then it happened.

837
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:38,780
Affection.

838
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,720
Oh, no!

839
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,880
Look, it's happening!

840
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:41,860
Oh, yes.

841
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,500
And he should dabble in his coffee.

842
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,580
Okay, turn down your phone and turn up your mind.

843
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,700
Take off your...

844
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,240
Okay, here we go.

845
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,420
Got it.

846
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,100
Dead center.

847
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,580
Well, we're tuning in on you right now.

848
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,240
And there, we're centered in...

849
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,720
Oh, okay, we're on lockup.

850
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,280
I die now, my son.

851
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:11,340
But someday, there will be a man with something in his mouth from which smoke comes, like

852
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,220
the fire on the sacred mountain.

853
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,540
I am weak, my dear son.

854
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,880
But I tell you that this man will be named...

855
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,660
Yes, this early misinterpretation of prehistory predicted the couple of years ago.

856
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:25,660


857
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,880
...becoming a Marlboro Man as a leader in the future.

858
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,940
Marlboro Man operated with these crude stone implements to pound the tobacco and roll the papers,

859
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,920
which gave his caves and habitations this distinctive odor.

860
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,780
Okay, I suppose that explains it.

861
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,100
Thank you.

862
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,720
It's a lot like talking to any tape.

863
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:53,100
I know it's difficult because we haven't ever called up a radio station before and talked to just a dumb old tape.

864
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,320
And here it is.

865
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,020
There's a double tape answering you.

866
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:56,340
Yes.

867
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,740
But you can't believe you're talking to an intelligent machine.

868
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,300
I know.

869
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,080
This is your future.

870
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,040
Your phones will act like us very soon.

871
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,220
Bob will massage men.

872
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:06,860
Yes.

873
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,840
Seven, seven, six, two, four, three, eight.

874
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,640
Okay, Bob.

875
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,160
Is that your Bob?

876
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:11,860
That's right.

877
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,340
Yeah.

878
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,540
Not to mention the weasel men.

879
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:21,500
Yes, they're little teeny ones that came over the sands early in the morning without food and without tickets.

880
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,360
They stole away the picnic baskets and the babies.

881
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,360
They stole away the picnic baskets and the babies.

882
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,680
Don't say babies.

883
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,080
Oh, what happened?

884
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,860
Don't we say babies?

885
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,140
Oh, no.

886
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,760
Oh, I...

887
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,900
We're giving a mouth-to-mouth perspiration right now.

888
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,040
Hold on a second here.

889
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,700
It's your turn.

890
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,120
Wait.

891
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:43,740
Wait.

892
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,000
There's a kitty here somewhere.

893
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,340
We're trying to find a kitty.

894
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,440
I suppose you're danger.

895
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,500
We will charge you.

896
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:52,700
Okay.

897
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,020


898
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:53,580
You got a kitty?

899
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,520
And the whole thing is recording.

900
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,800
Yes, it's true.

901
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,380
You mean that this is one of them A-band garter shows?

902
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,120
Come on.

903
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,720
Yeah.

904
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,260
I'll tell you what.

905
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,660
We all like this.

906
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,440
This is great.

907
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:19,120
It's just a little too much to swallow I think.

908
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,100
All right.

909
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,480
Well, you know what?

910
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:22,480


911
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:22,480


912
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:22,480


913
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:22,480


914
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:22,480


915
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:22,480


916
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:22,480


917
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:22,480


918
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:22,480


919
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:22,480


920
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:22,480


921
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,140
And now the horrible memories are starting to come back.

922
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,120
Oh, the horror, the horror.

923
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,220
The terrible war.

924
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,500
Oh, my God.

925
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,780
She's still strapped to turntable three,

926
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,500
and I'm afraid it's not going to get any better.

927
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,460
Little Dr. Punto.

928
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,680
Many people talk about Bob, but Bob is not human.

929
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,900
Bob is a complicated robot.

930
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,040
But the music always made me real sad.

931
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,420
It was just the Tijuana Bible quotes

932
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,860
and all that stuff piled up on my soul.

933
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,740
Not to mention the Tijuana Bible.

934
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,980
Soon I felt guilty about what happened to Herb Albert.

935
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,580
You can't even talk anymore.

936
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,900
They just put Hal in this old speaker's home, I think, or something.

937
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,380
Oscar, but I ask if any man has come on this way.

938
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,100
No, no.

939
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,720
And he and little Hal had grown larger,

940
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,400
stupider and older.

941
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,820
And he thought he was on the show.

942
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,140
So, yes, we'd say, here, here's a microphone

943
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,300
and here's some headphones,

944
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,220
and say something.

945
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,840
And little Hal would come out

946
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,780
and he'd jibber and jabber.

947
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,340
And we'd take the tape.

948
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,520
We would play that stuff on KPFA.

949
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,780
No, we wouldn't do that.

950
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,100
No.

951
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,060
And only talk about funny stuff.

952
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,540
Only poor Hal in his deranged state

953
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,540
would try to do the charge of the light brigade

954
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,240
in Pig Latin.

955
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,880
Hoppa foppa loppig.

956
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,900
Hoppa foppa loppig.

957
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,540
Hoppa foppa loppig.

958
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:47,540


959
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,220
Hoppa foppa loppig.

960
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,920
Hoppa foppa loppig.

961
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:52,720
Hoppa foppa loppig.

962
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,540
Hoppa foppa loppig.

963
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,580
Hoppa foppa loppig.

964
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,520
Hoppa foppa loppig.

965
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,520
Yeah, these auditions can be time-consuming,

966
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,060
but necessary.

967
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,540
What are what like?

968
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,600
I think the problem is that we're getting

969
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,160
a little off the beaten track now.

970
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,500
The caller is seeming to want to distract us

971
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,100
from the basic and bottom line

972
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,420
that we're here to talk about,

973
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,420
which is, of course, the puzzling evidence

974
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,800
that we present the public with.

975
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,300
The right hand picture shows

976
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,260
men of the new, new stone age.

977
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,000
New, new stone age.

978
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,420
Yes, here we are in the new, new stone age.

979
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,420
Yes, I think we should talk more about the new, new stone age

980
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,700
and not be distracted by these tiny calls.

981
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,720
Yes, in the new, new age,

982
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,780
everybody's going to feel a little bit hinky.

983
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,760
That's to the deference that one shows to the planet.

984
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,660
So what if your hair falls on your great clump, sir?

985
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,920
Perhaps your nose falls off onto your feet.

986
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,460
Calling Bob Dobbs.

987
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,500
Calling Mr. Dobbs.

988
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,480
Bob, is that you?

989
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:53,900
Yeah.

990
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,340
And what the hell's going on?

991
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,060
Nothing like a little togetherness

992
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,600
to take care of this scrambled shell structure of mine.

993
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,020
What could we do about it in the 80s?

994
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,940
So this is the scrambled shell structure.

995
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,520
This is the show that, until this point,

996
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,640
has not led to any new conclusions.

997
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,380
Try to define what exactly you've been seeing

998
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,320
from your vantage post out there on the ship.

999
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,120
Well, it looks pretty terrible out here.

1000
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,140
I'm still trying to get a hold of Werner Klempel.

1001
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,940
There's some guy out here in a half-melded phone booth.

1002
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,900
Trying to dial desperately for old friends long dead.

1003
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,180
Oh, that's the DJ in whose show this normally is.

1004
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,000
You can see some of his skin's been blasted away there

1005
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,080
in the polyester shirt he was so proud of

1006
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,420
only a few minutes before it's been completely melted

1007
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,100
around his chest.

1008
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,160
Hey, who is this?

1009
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,840
That's right, under my armpit.

1010
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,340
Oh, Bob.

1011
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,300
His mind has snapped.

1012
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,640
Use scopolamine if this show makes you dizzy.

1013
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,180
Right.

1014
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,360
Don't use those other pills.

1015
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,160
Thank you for the inspiration.

1016
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,400
You're welcome.

1017
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,580
You're the greatest star of all.

1018
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,480
I don't care how much money you make, Tobin.

1019
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,660
I won't listen to muscle music.

1020
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,520
Oh, no, no, no.

1021
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,280
He was completely surrounded by a bevy of 14-year-old girls

1022
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,100
all dressed up in Brady Bunch outfits.

1023
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:01,640
Yeah.

1024
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,000
Actually, I just couldn't believe a guy like him

1025
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,040
would be able to attract such a crowd of willing TV females.

1026
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,460
But there they are, drinking that TV water

1027
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,000
and hanging out with a little needy girl.

1028
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,400
It takes about a month to get a car.

1029
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:13,720
Yes.

1030
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,680
I know what'll bring him back.

1031
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,880
Yes, hell, we're in serious trouble now.

1032
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,240
No, it was time for the doctors.

1033
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,580
Oh, no.

1034
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,660
And they were operating tonight.

1035
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,980
Yeah, new patient coming in every hour.

1036
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,200
Oh, here comes an asthma.

1037
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,500
Let's cut out his lungs.

1038
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,620
Ah, here comes a heart patient.

1039
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,740
Let's cut out his heart.

1040
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,180
Hand me that scalpel.

1041
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,640
It's the doctors.

1042
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,020
Oh, watch out.

1043
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,220
This is the film that was supposed to be run

1044
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,260
right as the bomb was happening.

1045
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:49,020
This is a very pleasing film and calming.

1046
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,660
You can see here.

1047
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,780
Yes, they call this one.

1048
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,580
The sex bomb.

1049
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,800
And it itself was responsible for much of the dismay

1050
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,800
we've seen this evening.

1051
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:57,840
Never mind.

1052
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,240
Some say Jones and either one of us have the screen for your bones.

1053
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,700
Some say back and some say wait,

1054
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,260
but it just makes the two halves of my brain.

1055
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,100
Welcome to Dr. Ranch.

1056
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,900
You're about to stop there,

1057
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,460
and I'll just cut out that fibroblastic tumor.

1058
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:12,680
Here goes.

1059
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,100
This is pretty amazing here.

1060
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,560
Bring me that sigmoidoscope.

1061
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,020
I'm going to take a look.

1062
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,320
You know where.

1063
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,580
This is sigmoid colon.

1064
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,660
And his brother, the descending semicole.

1065
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,120
The elevator operator at Sisters of Mercy

1066
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,120
appears of Our Lady of Sorrows Hospital.

1067
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,220
Nurse, nurse, nurse.

1068
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,120
Bring me another shot, please.

1069
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,120
Got it. Dead center.

1070
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,880
As you can see, it's a modern, highly up-to-date facility.

1071
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:44,960
Yes, and using every kind of doctor-prescribed device.

1072
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,720
If a doctor needs it, they buy it.

1073
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,640
This floor is the exclusive obnoxio-pirosis floor.

1074
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,780
Three pills.

1075
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:51,740
Chainsaws.

1076
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,600
Let's step in, shall we?

1077
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,120
And operations.

1078
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:58,580
Will the honor of a large German shepherd please come to the salt flats behind the hospital?

1079
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,280
Thank you.

1080
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,780
Yes, here the doctors work in complete comfort,

1081
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:05,640
sometimes ignoring the patients altogether as they operate with the newest tools.

1082
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,460
Here's where the doctors kick back.

1083
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,880
It's the luxury lounge in between the floors.

1084
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,460
Yes, these are the transporters.

1085
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,540
On Vibes, you see Dr. Spiegelman,

1086
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:19,080
and there's Dr. Clutterhouse over there on drums.

1087
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,640
Okay, folks.

1088
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,880
Now, back out onto Dr. Highway.

1089
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:24,600
Ow!

1090
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,220
That's right.

1091
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,580
Flying high over Oakland now.

1092
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,260
Discovering there is a false bottom to the container and the...

1093
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,920
Death ship drops its load.

1094
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:34,900
What's this?

1095
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,220
It's better than the German Rasmus Krippelberg.

1096
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,500
It's deadly bacteria over the Bay Area.

1097
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:43,200
And now you see the Subjection kitchen as they cook the morning meal.

1098
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,620
We're gonna mix up our pre-holocaust breakfast.

1099
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,860
Because all the bacteria are dead, too.

1100
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,100
It's all right, but it's a lot easier to cook things.

1101
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,120
You're at the cafeteria with that...

1102
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,440
No, you just set it out and it cooks itself.

1103
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,660
You gave me plenty of rest.

1104
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,820
They always draw the furniture into the circle when you do that,

1105
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,020
but there's a way to get over that circle of chairs and sofas with a flaming arrow.

1106
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,080
Something was missing from the old Napa caller's menu.

1107
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,140
It was the tuba.

1108
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,920
So we put it in here on the show.

1109
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,080
If you're listening, you can put it on your sandwich and have it just the way you wanted it there.

1110
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:14,220
Ah.

1111
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,180
Yes.

1112
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,200
And if you, uh, if you have a four-channel stereo,

1113
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,460
put the tuba on the front.

1114
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,560
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1115
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,220
Ah, little tiny Wotans in the background.

1116
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,580
It's true.

1117
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,240
Ah, yeah, here we go now.

1118
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,300
I think I'll practice that.

1119
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,180
This is the Relax show, so don't get too upset.

1120
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,820
Yeah, just lay back on the bed.

1121
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:39,540
And they're able usually to understand the flaming arrow and turn it to their own advantage.

1122
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,620
Then you have to think of yet another weapon.

1123
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,600
Come on, guys, let him talk, let him talk.

1124
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,100
Which one?

1125
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:44,860
No, no, don't let me talk.

1126
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,140
No, I never thought atomic war would be so much fun, guys.

1127
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,380
Well, I, you know, we heard about nuclear winter.

1128
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,780
Nobody heard about, uh, nuclear, uh, toaster.

1129
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:59,040
Yeah, well, uh, you got your nuclear winter sports, and I'm going out for, uh, the downhill skiing.

1130
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,640
Yes, here, the downhill fallout skiing.

1131
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,620
You can see, uh, the contestants for the Olympics are...

1132
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,680
Yes, on their flaming skis.

1133
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,000
Whoosh, whoosh, there they go.

1134
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,280
And it is a race to the shelter.

1135
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,500
The glowing tips.

1136
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,040
Smash their face on the bottom of the run.

1137
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,840
Of course, each contestant only can survive one run,

1138
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,120
but it is a fabulous show of final surge of energy.

1139
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:18,120


1140
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:18,620
Yes.

1141
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,000
As humankind as we...

1142
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,540
Losing their hair in the wind as they fly down gun barrel.

1143
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,600
Yes, and still optimistic in the face of eternal darkness.

1144
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:27,500
And now...

1145
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,200
Is she a nun, by the way?

1146
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:32,820
Yes.

1147
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,180
No.

1148
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:33,500
Oh, no.

1149
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,600
None of the above, right?

1150
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:36,680
No, it's just the way it is.

1151
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,500
It's always contradictory.

1152
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,520
I'm a reverend, reverend dominatrix.

1153
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,060
First, let me show it first.

1154
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,080
It's cool for true.

1155
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,520
Food, food monsters.

1156
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,940
Guess the food monsters were on the prowl through the studio,

1157
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,120
eating all the food.

1158
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:48,120


1159
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:48,120


1160
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:48,120


1161
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:48,120


1162
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,440
All the old hamburger stubs and the leftover hot dog buns.

1163
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:52,960
The food monsters.

1164
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:53,200
Thank you, thank you.

1165
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:53,800
Yeah, thank you.

1166
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,740
Well, this is the last time we play this club.

1167
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,740
They don't give you enough to eat.

1168
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:58,760
Food, food monsters.

1169
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,720
I want royalties.

1170
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,360
I want dessert.

1171
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,760
I want post brandy liqueurs.

1172
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,780
I want the best cognac and the whole shot.

1173
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,800
Yeah, well, it's a good thing you're with us because it's fun to be the only thing keeping

1174
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,420
somebody alive.

1175
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:14,020
Really?

1176
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:14,640
Yes.

1177
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,480
We're going to be having a news feature.

1178
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:16,620
We have more ways than you think.

1179
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:16,620


1180
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,300
We have more ways than you think.

1181
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:18,740
From the brow.

1182
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:23,160
So if you have a subject you'd like the brow to speak on, just ask the brow.

1183
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:29,880
The nasal passages are cemented shut and the brain is pulled out and stored in a little

1184
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,580
jar overnight.

1185
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,220
Yet the patient lives.

1186
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:32,920
Oh, there it goes.

1187
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,260
Well, I dropped the jar, but the patient lives.

1188
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,380
The patient lives.

1189
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,320
Ah, but.

1190
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,540
All because of the ministrations of the Gabrofam and their special plastic implement they use

1191
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:44,220
shown here.

1192
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:45,080
Yes.

1193
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:45,900
Just push the little black button.

1194
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,840
I'll show you that technique once again.

1195
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:48,940
Dr. Bouffrem?

1196
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:49,640
Yes.

1197
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:56,220
We hope to welcome you all tonight to the fervid celestial spoutings of the inner epops

1198
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,080
and clockwork workings of the Church.

1199
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,180
But this task will not be easy.

1200
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:08,060
The fruits of the subgenius plant are not as cordial to the taste as others may be,

1201
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,980
a kind of mucilaginous paste.

1202
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:16,460
But it's easy to become tangentially twisted along precarious paths.

1203
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:20,660
It has nothing to do with the straight and true direction of our search.

1204
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,880
We are born with the Dobbs nature.

1205
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:31,700
However, only exist technology can complete a subgenius's transfiguration into overmanhood

1206
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,680
or overwomanliness.

1207
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:39,300
And so far, Bob has allowed this to happen to one solitary guinea pig, his friend, Dr.

1208
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:40,900
Philodrumon.

1209
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,500
Red, goddammit!

1210
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,800
My man was born with original slack.

1211
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:46,440
He had most of the strength.

1212
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:46,440


1213
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:46,440


1214
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,540
But civilized people don't believe in it, and their most learned spiral can't even comprehend it.

1215
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,980
Well, I've studied the Saurian stage in human evolution.

1216
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:59,360
As it turns out, many of our ancestors are not the primates as commonly thought, but

1217
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:02,360
the theropod line of the great archosaurs of the Mesozoic.

1218
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:02,680
Oh, no, look out!

1219
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,040
Yeah, get him out of here, Mike.

1220
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,080
Oh, Bohandas is approaching Tokyo!

1221
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,820
We will have to get away from the city now!

1222
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,840
Oh, move your karate school away from here!

1223
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,660
It does not help!

1224
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,240
We must keep Bohandas from approaching the science center.

1225
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:13,740
Yes.

1226
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,620
I complained that I had no starter fluid.

1227
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,540
And then I met a man who had no chainsaw.

1228
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,020
And he'll be able to fight the monster.

1229
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,180
And we will be able to protect the super racist people.

1230
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:21,980
We need to grow it.

1231
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,820
We need to grow it.

1232
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:23,540
Before the weekend.

1233
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,280
That is what we do with our troublemakers on Melton Pints.

1234
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,200
We pack them off to Monster Island, where they are buggered by prisoners.

1235
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,960
These creatures are something amazing.

1236
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:39,480
You can't imagine all the little spines and projections, the stately outer epidermis, the

1237
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,960
rind, a wart-like sagging covering that covers the outer cuticles of these critters.

1238
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,340
They're not even going to hurt themselves anymore.

1239
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:46,560
They're really a sight to see.

1240
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,980
And when they all get going, it's better than a party.

1241
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:52,440
It's like bobbing for apples in a giant barrel of radioactive sludge.

1242
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,740
And I only wish everyone would want to be...

1243
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,460
Oh, my God!

1244
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,460
Look, they've started now!

1245
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,840
I've been to all those towns, and they're all the same.

1246
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,020
Don't call Napa people dumb.

1247
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,060
They are dumb.

1248
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,440
Call all people dumb.

1249
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:05,780
No, they're dead.

1250
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,000
They're dead.

1251
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,260
No, they're not dumb.

1252
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:07,740
They're dead.

1253
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,180
Yes, the whole world's been blown up.

1254
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,340
There's nothing wrong with living in Dumb Town.

1255
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,140
You should be damn proud of it.

1256
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:13,920
Well, we're dumb, too.

1257
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:15,600
We're dumb and blind and dumb.

1258
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:15,600


1259
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:15,600


1260
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,380
We're dumb and deaf down here.

1261
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:16,780
And we don't mind it.

1262
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,200
It's not...

1263
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,400
You know, it's an equalizer, we call it.

1264
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:19,940
It's radiation damage.

1265
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,320
And there's not much you can do about it.

1266
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:22,760
There's bombs.

1267
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:22,760


1268
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,540
Your hair falls out.

1269
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,300
It's an equalizer.

1270
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,220
You can't talk.

1271
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,880
You don't even want to talk.

1272
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:31,340
Save the doctors from this less than stimulating situation.

1273
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,140
Yes.

1274
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,740
All we have now is the sleepy-time Jesus.

1275
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:40,880
And I'm curled up here in the arms of the sleepy-time Jesus on the show.

1276
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,760
And he's kissing and smooching on me.

1277
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,100
And it feels real good.

1278
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:45,580
But it's much better.

1279
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,680
It's making me real tired.

1280
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:52,600
And I don't want to talk because I just want to curl up with this cute little antichrist

1281
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,460
and make some running noises.

1282
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,520
And hallucination.

1283
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,220
Because of the feeling of...

1284
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,680
Well, maybe it wasn't real.

1285
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,660
Oh, that's Bob Nelson.

1286
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,100
Dumb Degeneration.

1287
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,160
We're running the sound grid on your helmet.

1288
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,000
You should have a new head in about three seconds.

1289
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:12,580
Here it comes, Paul.

1290
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:12,760
There.

1291
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,160
Oh, that's much better.

1292
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:15,580
Give me one of those.

1293
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:15,580


1294
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:15,580


1295
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:15,580


1296
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:15,580


1297
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:15,580


1298
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:15,580


1299
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:15,580


1300
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:15,580


1301
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,200
I'll give you one of those new heads, too.

1302
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,520
Ah, that feels great.

1303
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,180
Hello, little caller.

1304
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,940
You're stuck inside the time tube.

1305
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,520
Sooner or later, you should be able to break out.

1306
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:29,440
If we can stay with you, the Heliopter Jesus is now appearing over your head.

1307
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,040
Stay down and avoid your own speakers.

1308
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:36,420
The radio amplifier will try to kill the signal, resulting in its own demise.

1309
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,460
Please stand back from Heliopter Jesus.

1310
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,920
Approaching now on the left speaker.

1311
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,440
I'm ready to go.

1312
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:44,440


1313
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,560
I'm ready to go.

1314
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:45,560


1315
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:45,560


1316
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:45,560


1317
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:45,560


1318
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:45,560


1319
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:45,560


1320
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:45,560


1321
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:45,560


1322
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:45,560


1323
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,580
Good morning.

1324
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:48,380
What happened?

1325
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:52,800
What kind of show is this?

1326
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,140
Everything's okay.

1327
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,300
Adolescents have to refight many...

1328
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,940
Just a whole line of blinking lights.

1329
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,660
Must be the president trying to reach us.

1330
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,100
You're helping invest in some child's future.

1331
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:04,660
Ah.

1332
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,580
I'm buying that child.

1333
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,900
It was a good thing, too.

1334
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,100
Thank you for your input, caller.

1335
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,700
What does it sound like where you are?

1336
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,000
Perfectly well-minted.

1337
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,320
But what does it sound like where you are?

1338
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:14,920
What is weird?

1339
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:15,360
Huh?

1340
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:15,560
I'm not sure.

1341
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:15,560


1342
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:15,560


1343
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:15,560


1344
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:15,560


1345
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:15,560


1346
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:15,560


1347
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:15,560


1348
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:15,560


1349
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:15,560


1350
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:15,560


1351
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,280
I'm just trying to watch what's going on.

1352
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:21,140
So weird DJ dressed up in a crown of thorns and a dirty, dirty shield.

1353
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:21,760
What's going on here?

1354
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,960
Starts kissing on you.

1355
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:24,860
I'm...

1356
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,100
At Mobius.

1357
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,400
Frankly, I don't give a damn.

1358
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,760
Dead center.

1359
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,400
Yes.

1360
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,360
Liberty right there.

1361
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:36,620
I get bad things that frighten me that don't make any sense.

1362
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,000
Now let's get out of my brain.

1363
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:39,700
Oh, yes.

1364
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:43,820
That's the right brain that was actually originated for people who were tired of blinking

1365
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:44,200
calls.

1366
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,540
The Heliopter Jesus wasn't meant to be a delinquent.

1367
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:45,540


1368
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:45,540


1369
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:45,540


1370
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:45,540


1371
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:45,540


1372
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:45,540


1373
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:45,540


1374
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:48,920
originated for your right brain that's true he's in a little can and we open him every 45 minutes

1385
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:04,920
you could have been tuned into a civil defense warning station saving your life but instead

1386
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,720
you're spending your last few minutes on earth listening to a semi-humorous radio program

1387
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,740
and you shouldn't have down in your basement

00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,120
we're trying to march all the slack squads back to their barracks now and they're they're a little

1393
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,960

1401
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:12,960


1402
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:12,960


1403
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,100
Officer, we were just doing subgenius types.

1404
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,140
Didn't they tell you?

1405
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,460
Oh, we're not drunk.

1406
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,180
Oh, no, officer, we're not drunk.

1407
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,580
Didn't they tell you?

1408
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,760
We're crazy, man.

1409
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,460
We are drunk, man.

1410
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:31,340
We're crazy, man.

1411
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:35,260
If you want to know more about what kind of a show this is,

1412
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:40,020
which I actually doubt at this point for most of you,

1413
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:46,920
but the kind we want ought to write for free information.

1414
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:50,820
Yes, he gets you a fair share of free information

1415
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,320
about the Church of the Subgenius.

1416
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:53,340
What?

1417
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,960
This is a religion, man.

1418
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,900
We're trying to save the world.

1419
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,680
Nay, the universe.

1420
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,580
And got that pencil ready?

1421
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,540
Just write to Bob.

1422
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:07,800
Bob.

1423
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:10,440
That's right.

1424
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:18,440
Just Bob at P.O. Box 140306.

1425
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,980
Doesn't that have a ring to it?

1426
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:21,880
140306.

1427
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,900
Just stumbles right off of your tongue.

1428
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:30,760
In Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1429
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,140
Simple enough, isn't it?

1430
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,240
75214.

1431
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,120
Box 14306.

1432
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:38,540
Texas, 75214.

1433
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,780
And, well, you'll see.

1434
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:43,080
Or will you?

1435
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,720
Most of you never even, you never even try.

1436
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:46,880
You think about it, don't you?

1437
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:50,040
You go, yeah, I'm going to, you write it down.

1438
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,920
I'm going to write them tomorrow.

1439
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,600
I'm going to send them a little, just letter or something

1440
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,220
and see what I get for it.

1441
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,100
But then you blow it off, don't you?

1442
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,940
Well, maybe you're the lucky ones.

1443
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,040
Maybe not.

1444
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,040
I'm sorry.

1445
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:07,520
I'm sorry.

1446
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:07,820
I'm sorry.

1447
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:10,240
I'm sorry.

1448
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:10,240


1449
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:10,240


1450
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:10,240


1451
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,000
Stickers and graffiti were showing up in really strange places

1452
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,200
like inside pencil sharpeners and so on.

1453
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:23,260
In some classes, we don't even know who the subgenius is.

1454
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:30,020
What is all this I hear about this youth cult, this church of the subgenius?

1455
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,820
Gee, I don't know.

1456
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:33,900
Well, how about you, Simon?

1457
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,160
What?

1458
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,640
Well, what about you?

1459
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:42,220
Yo, it's about Bob, you know. It's Bob. That's it.

1460
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,780
Bob is great.

1461
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:48,840
But just who is this man, Bob?

1462
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:55,100
Some call him the slack master, the high epoch, the saint of sales.

1463
00:57:55,340 --> 00:58:05,560
Others call him liar, pimp, whoremonger, a sleazy con man foisting his dangerous scam off on gullible suckers.

1464
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:17,340
Well, dear friend, J.R. Bob Dobbs isn't some outmoded, overused deity from ancient fairy tales,

1465
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:21,020
but a living, bleeding deity for today.

1466
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:24,320
The divinely appointed messenger of slack.

1467
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:30,420
The mystic super salesman upon whose wheeling and dealing skills the fate of the universe hinges.

1468
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,920
He can sell you anything, and I bought it.

1469
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,440
And I'll tell you what.

1470
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,940
That fly will buy that mound of shit from Bob.

1471
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,060
Bob's wonderful.

1472
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,100
I mean, Bob's, you know, it.

1473
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:47,800
Bob?

1474
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,540
Bob?

1475
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,540
Bob is fill in the blank.

1476
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,300
Bob is fill in the blank.

1477
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,400
The Bob that can be described is not the true Bob.

1478
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,160
Focus on the book, Bob.

1479
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:14,680
It's composed by Jack Simzke.

1480
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,180
Non- Swiftly Every Def industrie d'interesse n wall sweeping laablyروita,

00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:15,560
