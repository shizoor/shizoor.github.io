1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,900
Take it from the top, boys.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:03,820
Let's do it all again.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,480
Oh, I hate when the stuff gets broadcast.

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,420
No, there it goes.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,840
Not gonna be too happy.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,140
Well, so how many more of these practice sessions do we have to do till the real show?

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,200
Real.

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,860
Real show.

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,340
Yeah, how many more are there?

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,080
Five.

11
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:18,940
Five?

12
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:19,560
Five more.

13
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,180
Hey, Chad.

14
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,880
Come on, can't we have one more story?

15
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,660
Come on.

16
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,240

17
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,220
Sponsored by The Churchill of the subgenius.

18
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,760
The subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be made on radio station and only in the city of...

19
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,660
I have all the characteristics of a human being.

20
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,560
Flesh, blood, skin, hair.

21
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,040
But not a single clear identifiable emotion.

22
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,180
Except for greed and disgust.

23
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,920
Something horrible is happening inside of me.

24
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,780
And I don't know why.

25
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,880
Christmas makes me feel emotional.

26
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,540

SILVER BAE

33
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,200
Christmas Eve.

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,280
Soon it will be Christmas Day.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,720
The Subgenius Radio Ministry are a slark.

36
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,900
One, two, Santa's coming for you.

37
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,020
Three, four, you better lock your door.

38
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,560
Five, six, Christmas Eve.

39
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,000
Seven, eight, better stay up late.

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,460
Nine, ten, Santa's coming again!

41
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,900
Over there!

42
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,820
Have you ever wondered what it would have been like if the baby Jesus were born today?

43
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,220
Now? Maybe even this year?

44
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:36,640
What do you think it would be like if it was all being reported to us by the television and radio media that we hear and watch every day?

45
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,720
It might go something like this.

46
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:54,760
I'm an old man and I've seen lots of Christmases come and go and they're never white and it's raining again and again and again and again and again and again and...

47
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,300
Again! Again! Again! Again!

48
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,160
Christmas is a-coming the geese are getting fast

49
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,760
Please put a penny in the old man's hat

50
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,120
If you haven't got a penny, a hay penny will do

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,640
If you haven't got a hay penny, then God bless you.

52
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,320
God bless you gentlemen, God bless you

53
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,000
If you haven't got a cape and even God bless you

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,700
Christmas is a come and go gal for Twinkle Elf

55
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,820
Making Christmas dinner at all by himself

56
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,460
If he hasn't got a filter tip, a ball of dung will do

57
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,000
If he hasn't got a dung ball, he's got some curly shoes

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,600
God bless Twinkle Elf, God bless me

59
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,260
Your Christmas shoes are curly and furry as can be

60
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,180
God bless you gentlemen, God bless you

61
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,780
If you haven't got a turkey leg, then God bless you

62
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:16,140
We all as children grew up dreaming of having, doing, wearing

63
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,500
What Barbie has, Barbie has it all

64
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,020
Barbie is a prop

65
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,540
For everyone to dream through

66
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,780
Barbie changed the course of womanhood

67
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,220
She could have all sorts of adventures

68
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,360
She could get in a car and drive away

69
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,220
She could even get into her own home

70
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,260
Barbie is a prop for all of us

71
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,240
She could have all sorts of adventures

72
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:26,800
She can get into a car and drive away

73
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,880
Barbie actually drove away

74
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,340
A little bit faster, but she's doing like a migrant

75
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:32,340


76
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,180
Barbie is a snowbreaer

77
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,660
Thank you.

78
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,040
Barbie dog.

79
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,620
Women rave with me more than their lives by role-playing with bars.

80
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,820
Barbie dog.

81
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,800
A very important dog.

82
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,040
Barbie dog.

83
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,320
Barbie dog.

84
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,220
Come here, I'll be doing this

85
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,180
Doing this, doing this

86
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,020
For fluke the fish, though.

87
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,320
I had my money in the muffler puffed.

88
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,540
Off and fish.

89
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,320
Schweine fish.

90
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,000
Huren fish.

91
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,360
I won't let myself be fucked by you in the trash with you.

92
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,520
That it only cracks so.

93
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,960
Unquestionably.

94
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,520
Uncertainly.

95
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,120
Uncertainly.

96
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,120


97
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,460
Chestnuts, Joe's eyes, roasting, bonfire.

98
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:51,240
Jack Frost, sniffing at your nose.

99
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,360
You thought gals being sung by a choir.

100
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,840
Her moose, dressed up like Eskimo.

101
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,320
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe.

102
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,960
Helped to make the season bright.

103
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,820
Tiny cats with their eyes all closed.

104
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,740
They're hiding their hearts.

105
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,300
Green.

106
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,340
Truly.

107
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,660
Damn man.

108
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,080
Center.

109
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,020
He's loaded.

110
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,760
He's loaded.

111
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,680
Lot's of toys and goodies on his Floral gibt.

112
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,820
Lot's of toys and goodies on his Memorial Day gift.

113
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,980
He's loaded a lot's of toys and goodies on his本当 regel omg fix.

114
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:58,980


115
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,340
Lots of toys and games on his head

116
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,100
And every mother's child goes wild

117
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:16,500
When he really knows how to fly

118
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,520
And so I'm offering this very simple phrase

119
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,360
To kids from 1992

120
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,080
A poet has said many times in many ways

121
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,960
Merry Christmas

122
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,940
Merry Christmas

123
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,420
Merry Christmas

124
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,680
Merry Christmas

125
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,320
Merry Christmas

126
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,700
Merry Christmas

127
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,380
Good night, child

128
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,680
Merry Christmas

129
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,620
Merry Christmas

130
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:24,880
Merry Christmas

131
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,860
Merry Christmas

132
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,740
Merry Christmas

133
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,600
Merry Christmas

134
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,440
Merry Christmas

135
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,080
I was down in the holler as the story thickens

136
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,640
Old Bob Dog stole my gallon twenty chickens

137
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,200
And I wore their chickens back

138
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,820
I chased old Bob through the field into the mall

139
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,660
I pointed my shotgun and he began to crawl

140
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,380
I said I want them chickens back

141
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,160
I said I want them chickens back

142
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,500
Bob told me, boy, I'll have your chickens back at noon

143
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,420
But the aliens took your gal, she sucked right like a prune

144
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,080
And I didn't bring her chickens back

145
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,700
When I caught up with Bob, he was eating chicken pie

146
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,180
He was eating chicken pie

147
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:43,180


148
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,480
He had piles of bones reaching to the sky

149
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,180
And I'll never get my chickens back

150
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:42,700
I said I want them chickens back

151
00:15:43,180 --> 00:16:03,280
I said I want them chickens back

152
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,180
That dare not speak its name

153
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:21,460

189
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,840
Things were joyful

190
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,140
All together

191
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,080
It's a winter weather

192
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,000
guitar solo

193
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,900
guitar solo

194
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,420
guitar solo

195
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,060
It could be his head wasn't screwed on

196
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,700
just right

197
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,520
guitar solo

198
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,860
The monitors are good

199
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,260
for they have shown us

200
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,740
how right and proper

201
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,520
our own form of government

202
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,600
actually is.

203
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,280
As the Lord spoke to Job

204
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,500
out of the whirlwind,

205
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,840
so do voices seem to be

206
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
speaking to us

207
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,160
now and in our day

208
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,000
telling us

209
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,380
not to abjure

210
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:41,880
our own government

211
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,140
all whole.

212
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,780
Believe in our traditions

213
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,280
and night will once again

214
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,300
as it inevitably must

215
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,220
give way to the rosy dawn.

216
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,300
guitar solo

217
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,520
guitar solo

218
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,960
guitar solo

219
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,540
guitar solo

220
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,720
guitar solo

221
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,480
guitar solo

222
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,020
guitar solo

223
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,640
guitar solo

224
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,040
guitar solo

225
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,840
guitar solo

226
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,640
guitar solo

227
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:22,720
guitar solo

228
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,660
guitar solo

229
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,160
guitar solo

230
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,480
guitar solo

231
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:28,560
guitar solo

232
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:28,760
piano solo

233
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:28,840
piano solo

234

piano solo

235
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:29,580
piano solo

236
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:29,620
piano solo

237
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,640
piano solo

238
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,240
piano solo

239
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,660
piano solo

240
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,520
Thank you.

241
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,320
Thank you.

242
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,640
Thank you.

243
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,800
And avoid panic buying.

244
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,440
Thank you.

245
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,240
Thank you.

246
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,240
Thank you.

247
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,300
Thank you.

248
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,640
Thank you.

249
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:07,980
Thank you.

250
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:43,620
Thank you.

251
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,660
Thank you.

252
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,960
Thank you.

253
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,540
Thank you.

254
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,440
Especially late at night when cars belong to restaurants.

255
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:37,040
Do sites have all the across all Тhere is a うん思い

256
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,180
sure to ask the singles,

257
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:37,180


258
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:37,240
And always hear about the

259

şimdi

260
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:37,300
тут

261
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:37,380
indisfree

262
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:37,400
здесь

263
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:37,440
.

264
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:37,640


265
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,160
this

266
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,480
is

267
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,440
What you think of as pain

268
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,940
is only a shadow.

269
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,700
Pain has a face.

270
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,360
Allow me to show it to you.

271
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,980
Christmas dreams

272
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,940
and drunken alibis

273
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,340
to you.

274
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,300
I can't believe

275
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,780
I danced naked with a turkey.

276
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,040
I got stuffing everywhere.

277
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,960
I didn't mean to throw up

278
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,500
in the children's hair.

279
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,420
And I'm sorry I shot your dog.

280
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,380
But at the time my mind was in a fog.

281
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,000
I went from poor to punch.

282
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,900
Then I had a cup of rosy wine.

283
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,940
Guess I had a drop too much.

284
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,980
Cause when I woke up I was busy and blind.

285
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,120
Wish I hadn't burned your house to the ground.

286
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,920
But the Christmas season always comes.

287
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:34,920


288
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,140
And it always gets me down.

289
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,120
So darling if you're free in the new year.

290
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,620
Maybe we can go out

291
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,900
for a beer.

292
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,060
Christmas dreams.

293
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:52,920
And drunken alibis to you.

294
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,220
Oh baby.

295
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,720
Baby.

296
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:01,940
Hehehe.

297
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,800
Hehehe.

298
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:06,740


299
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,960
Manic depression

300
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,420
is touching my soul.

301
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,320
I know what I want.

302
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,420
What I just don't know.

303
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,020
I gotta go out again.

304
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,680
Feelin.

305
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:37,720
Sweet feeling, drips from my fingers, my fingers

306
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,000
Burning depression is caching my soul

307
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:56,200
Woman, so hot, sweet cold and rain

308
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:07,260
We make love, we break love, it's all the same, it's over

309
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:16,140
Music, sweet music, I wish I could caress, caress

310
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,260
Burning depression is a frustrating mess

311
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,400
But if we keep hoping without a break

312
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,720
You're really not here

313
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,320
Music, sweet music, it's pieces of cake

314
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:44,800
I'm looking for you, but whom are you looking for

315
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,500
When the sickness sea freezes

316
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:56,180
Music is another day

317
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,560
I think I'm gonna kill myself

318
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:06,200
I'm going down, I'm going down, down, down, down

319
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,100
There really ain't no use in me

320
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,560
Staying in, hanging around

321
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,000
I gotta get out

322
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,520
Music, sweet music

323
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,340
I wish I could kiss

324
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,580
And if depression is a frustrated mess

325
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:33,640
Yeah, a frustrated mess

326
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,760
Music, sweet music

327
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,200
Music, sweet music

328
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,720
Music, sweet music

329
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,700
Music, sweet music

330
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,600
Music, sweet music

331
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,660
Music, sweet music

332
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,520
Music, sweet music

333
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,460
Music, sweet music

334
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,240
Music, sweet music

335
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,700
Music, sweet music

336
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,740
Music, sweet music

337
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:17,300
Thank you, Bomb Lapse

338
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,020
Understood

339
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,320
Got it in one word.

340
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,500
buying a fundamental aid.

341
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,740
Thank you, Todd.

342
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,720
What we as manufacturers are selling is fun.

343
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,420
What we are selling is fun.

344
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,160
That was Obtuse.

345
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,100
And before that, Manic Depression,

346
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,860
the Hendrix song by Retaliation.

347
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,820
I thought that would be good for those holiday blues.

348
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,220
Thanks to Pope S. Lilith for forwarding that

349
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,520
and other music we've been playing at times.

350
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,540
Mr. Sister posted the monitor clips.

351
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,180
And we don't know who did the drunken Christmas song,

352
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,820
but the scary Frosty the Snowman

353
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,500
was by Lovecraft Technologies

354
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,260
from Unmutated Christmas.

355
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,720
But now, friends,

356
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,960
well,

357
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,620
we got this interesting CD in the mail

358
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:25,220
from someone named Sherry Elf.

359
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,660
And I thought this would be a perfect time

360
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,460
to play this song by Sherry Elf

361
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,960
from her debut CD,

362
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,200
Forcing Goodness Upon You.

363
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,480
Jesus came up to me in the parking lot

364
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,780
of the hardware store today.

365
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,120
He said,

366
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,560
you look kind of lost in there.

367
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,840
Could you use some help?

368
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,780
I told him no thank you.

369
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,720
And I got into my car.

370
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,760
But as I drove away,

371
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,480
I said to myself,

372
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,260
S? Elf?

373
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,600
You've waited all your life

374
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,460
for someone to notice how lost you look.

375
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,860
Now you refuse help from Jesus

376
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,680
of all people.

377
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,600
Jesus.

378
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,080
Jesus.

379
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,960
Yes, I'm lost.

380
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,940
And I could use some help.

381
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,460
I just was not expecting you there

382
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,380
in the parking lot

383
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,840
of the hardware store.

384
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,920
You know, I'm kicking myself

385
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,520
and my thoughts are full of

386
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,400
what would have happened

387
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,380
if I would have taken you up on your offer.

388
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,080
But now it's too late.

389
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,180
I'll wait and send you away.

390
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,160
If I know Jesus,

391
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,580
He's still out there.

392
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,020
He's canvassing all of the parking lots

393
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,260
of all of the hardware stores

394
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,320
of these great United States.

395
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,640
And He won't stop there.

396
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,760
Soon you'll find Him in the parking lots

397
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,980
of all of the hardware stores

398
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,680
of all of North and South America.

399
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,460
And then He'll migrate

400
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,640
over to Europe and Africa and China.

401
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,220
Wait, do they have hardware stores in China?

402
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,780
And do they have parking lots?

403
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,580
Well, knowing Jesus,

404
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,080
that won't stop Him.

405
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,420
You have to have your act together pretty good to be the Son of God.

406
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:32,160
Jesus, yes I'm lost, and I could still use some help.

407
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,520
But I think from now on you should wear a t-shirt or a button that says,

408
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,140
Jesus, Son of God.

409
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:48,120
Jesus, your understated approach took me by surprise.

410
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,900
I thought you were talking hardware, but no, you were talking eternal life and salvation.

411
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,260
I'm still regretting how in my haste I sent you away.

412
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,940
This song goes out to Jesus.

413
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,120
Wherever you are.

414
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,380
Wherever he may be wandering.

415
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,600
For his untiring perseverance in soliciting unsuspecting shoppers

416
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,240
there in the parking lots of all of the hardware stores of this great earth.

417
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:25,560
Jesus, we love you, and we respect your clever new marketing strategy.

418
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:37,240
Jesus, it's so lost, but I feel the problem is resolving itself.

419
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:44,500
From now on my eyes and ears are open, and I'm much more prepared to meet saviors and sons of God

420
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,380
while I am shopping in hardware stores.

421
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,980
But not only hardware stores, wherever I shop.

422
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,880
Wherever I am, I look deeply into the eyes of my fellow earthlings, and I look for Jesus.

423
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:05,840
Jesus, yes I'm lost, but I'm feeling a little better.

424
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,060
I still like the idea of a t-shirt or a button.

425
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,940
Some of us are a little preoccupied, and we need to see a label.

426
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,740
Jesus, oh Jesus.

427
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,180
Oh Jesus.

428
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:29,320


429
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,840
Jesus, oh Jesus.

430
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,940
Jesus, oh Jesus.

431
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,440
Have you seen Jesus today?

432
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,860
Uh, yes, that was Sherry Elf.

433
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,640
Wasn't that pretty or something?

434
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,160
She's distributed by herself.

435
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,160
Her debut CD, Forcing Goodness Upon You,

436
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,960
is available only from her, but here's a website and address.

437
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,100
That's www.SherryElf.com,

438
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,560
which is spelled S-H-A-R-I-E-L-F,

439
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:30,160
SherryElf.com, or Sherry Elf, P.O. Box 3585, Kansas City, Kansas 6, 6102.

440
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,060
The music in the background is by Mark Mothersbaugh

441
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:39,420
from his Christmas album special, Joyo Mutato,

442
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,380
and now, Reverend Sheldon DeWare.

443
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,820
Jesus loves me, this I know,

444
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,280
cause my preacher tells me so.

445
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,680
If I argue, he'll use his tongue,

446
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,240
till I scream out,

447
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,720
Yes, I'm wrong!

448
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,700
Oh God, I'm a sinner, I repent,

449
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,340
just make him stop!

450
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:05,320
Oh!

451
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,360
Oh!

452
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,260
Oh!

453
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,160
Oh!

454
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,100
Oh!

455
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:34,660
Oh!

456
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,320
Oh!

457
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,720
Oh!

458
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,240
Oh!

459
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,040
Oh!

460
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,240
Oh!

461
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:05,240
Oh!

462
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:06,680
Oh!

463
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,560
Oh!

464
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:07,880
Oh!

465
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,340
Oh!

466
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:09,540
Oh!

467
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:16,060
The monitors are your friends.

468
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,040
Depend on the monitors.

469
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,920
Work for peace.

470
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,220
Violence solves all problems.

471
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:28,220


472
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:36,820
nothing. The monitors bring peace. Peace brings happiness.

473
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:51,000
I want a blow-up top for Christmas. I want a girl like Kenny Flame. I saw one like I

474
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,420
want in the girly magazine. The one that I had between my mattress and box screens.

475
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:07,960
I want a blow-up top for Christmas. Hurry up Santa, I can't wait. I want a blow-up top

476
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:15,820
for Christmas. Cause I know that she'll be the perfect mate. She must be heavy duty.

477
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:22,760
To Reese's wear and tear. She'll come with a special set of sexy underwear. I'll dress

478
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,080
her like a hooker. Then dress her for the prom. Then let her air out folder.

479
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,600
And hide her from my mom.

480
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:58,200
She won't talk so I won't have to call her on the phone. I won't have to comb her hair because it's printed on. Her lips will be shaped like an O and painted on.

481
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:03,640
I'll have to hide her from my friends. She'll be a real airhead.

482
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:20,080
I want a blow-up top for Christmas. I want a girl with vinyl flesh. She must have a pretty face. Up above her neck. The rest of her body must be anatomically correct.

483
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:28,200
I want a blow-up top for Christmas. I think I'll call her Judy. You're best. I think I'll call her Judy. You're best.

484
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:32,060
I wanna blow up all for Christmas

485
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,860
Cause real girls, they scare me half to death

486
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:48,480
Look, he's busted again!

487
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,100
Reason, not force

488
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,720
The monitors are your friends

489
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,180
Peace brings happiness

490
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,080
I've had a lot of hard times at Christmas time

491
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,720
I can remember me and my brother when I was about six years old

492
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,660
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece

493
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,760
And the health department made us take them down

494
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,580
I remember my father well, you know

495
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,460
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache

496
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,680
He used to have, you know what caused it, Ben?

497
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,040
He used to put a stocking cap on his head

498
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,680
And put a knot right in front of it

499
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,160
Daddy wake up with that thumping headache

500
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,080
And he said, the kids are saying, my head's hurting so bad

501
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,200
He said, I don't know what Santa's gonna get y'all for Christmas

502
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,360
But he gonna bring you something

503
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,340
So Daddy took that old rifle and went outside

504
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,420
And shot up in the air and come back inside

505
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,580
And told us the biggest lie ever heard

506
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,660
Said, kid, Santa just committed suicide

507
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,340
Santa Claus is coming

508
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,840
To rape your wife

509
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,680
Santa Claus is coming

510
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,880
To rape your wife

511
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,740
He's got a gun

512
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:40,340
And he's got a big knife

513
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:44,200
Santa Claus is coming

514
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,420
To rape your wife

515
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,920
Santa killed off all his elves

516
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:16,260
To powdered pipes

517
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,040
Tomoon

518
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,280

00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:18,280

Mrs. Claus has disappeared

Is that blood in Santa's beard?

552
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:09,880
Hello.

553
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:16,800
Your local multinational corporation has sent me to this remote point in Australia to prove a point.

554
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,420
Conservation can be dangerous.

555
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,640
In this remote aboriginal village just outside of Sydney, Australia,

556
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:25,700
the natives were told by their grandparents,

557
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,000
the natives were told by their grandparents,

558
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:26,000


559
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:26,120
the government,

560
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,820
the government, to slow down in their consumption of gasoline and fossil fuels.

561
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,940
Unfortunately, the files in the government energy office on this town were lost.

562
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:40,620
So, nobody bothered to tell them when it was okay to go back to normal energy use.

563
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:46,220
Sadly enough, this town has become the victim of what we call an energy surplus.

564
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:50,260
And the natives have been forced to convert many of their dishwashers,

565
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,560
lawnmowers, and refrigerators into these homemade, energy-hungry,

566
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,820
miniature racing guards.

567
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:59,900
Boys and girls in the village between the ages of 14 and 20

568
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:04,060
must stay behind the wheels of these primitive, high-speed, and dangerous machines

569
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,520
for up to 90 hours at a stretch,

570
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:11,960
just so their village can receive the next fuel shipment from their local multinational distributor.

571
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,840
And we'll keep on shipping at our usual rates,

572
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:19,400
just so this little village can meet and surpass its energy quota.

573
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:24,360
And to think, it's all because they kept lights off when it didn't have to be convenient.

574
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:28,680
This holiday season, why not turn on all the lights in your house,

575
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,160
and keep them on for the rest of the year?

576
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,180
Maybe you'll make the load a little lighter on us here at Multinational.

577
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,640
And a winter reminder, citizens.

578
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,920
Carbon monoxide, the silent winter killer, lurks everywhere.

579
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:46,060
So, if you have a gas stove, oil burner, or open flame,

580
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,700
make sure all the doors and windows in the room are tightly sealed,

581
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,940
so that none of that nasty carbon monoxide can sneak in.

582
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,340
Thanks, and happy holidays.

583
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:58,640
This is Mr. Abernathy, signing off from your town to you.

587
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,780
The Jethro's, friends, you need to know where to write to the Jethro's.

588
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:24,280
They're at, they did that Wreck the Halls and so many other versions we've been playing.

589
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:31,740
The Jethro's are at 212 and a half Miller Avenue.

590
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:37,880
That's 212 and a half Miller Avenue, Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

Portsmouth N.H. 03801.
