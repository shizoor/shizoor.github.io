1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
We're holding this public meeting in the Civic Auditorium tonight because of the story.

2
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,500
Good afternoon.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,000
The Soul Genius Hour of Swatch.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,400
For juvenile delinquents?

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,820
I'm happy to hear that.

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,660
Well, that's very interesting.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,800
Sexual, sexual, sexual, urinating, cautionary style.

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,280
Right now.

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,280
Side effects.

10
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,400
Side effects.

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,880
From PR News in Washington, I'm in critical condition during a business trip in France.

12
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,280
Yesterday, in southern France.

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,240
However, the substance is not yet clear.

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,840
Fossil fuel is more than essential.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,060
That's according to numbers.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,500
40%, 10%, 11% of 80%.

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,100
2 to 3 turned into 8.

18
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,900
The president and the first lady are taking photos at the White House and fell dozens of meters.

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:18,780
200 turtle hatchlings investigate what now appears to be another suspicious PR News in Washington.

20
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,880
Ah, yes, dear friends.

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,660
Recording, everything's going fine, I hope.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,500
Welcome to hour of slack number 1772.

23
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,920
Yeah, I think.

24
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,800
Or is it 73?

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,400
No, it's 72.

26
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,780
Oh, friends.

27
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,360
Don't worry, you won't catch it from me.

28
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,160
I'm sniffling because of allergies.

29
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:55,440
I live in a cedar forest and sometimes I sniffle.

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,700
And yes, America has been depressing.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,560
Again today, but I'm going to try to be cheery with some war reports from subgenius land.

32
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,540
Then I'll probably play some really old tapes.

33
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,460
And by that I mean, yes, tapes.

34
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:23,020
This music in the background, by the way, is the Danish National Orchestra doing a neo Marconi's famous movie Western themes.

35
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:24,940
Okay.

36
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,820
Huh?

37
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,820
Reverend Velvet Martel.

38
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:29,980
Oh, my God.

39
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

40
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:33,600


41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:33,600


42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:33,600


43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:33,600


44
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:33,600


45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:41,960
The part I don't like is walking into my tiny town grocery store and having everybody eyeing each other like we're all buddy writers.

46
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,160
I've got a feeling that as this continues, we'll be happy to see a fresh face.

47
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,560
And I have this tiny town grocery store, too.

48
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:59,460
And it is a little odd to see these farmers and housewives looking so suspiciously.

49
00:02:59,960 --> 00:02:59,960


50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,400
The kids at the checkout don't seem to be taking any of it seriously.

51
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,060
I keep having to tell them I'll handle those bags myself.

52
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,780
They look surprised when I hose down my store card after they scan it and hand it back to me.

53
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,680
When I use a wipe to punch my pin number into the card reader.

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:27,540
And now I hear we're supposed to hose down the bags when we get them home and even the cardboard boxes that the grits come in.

55
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,780
Or just pour the contents into something.

56
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:39,220
And so, wouldn't you know it, what was missing from that store today wasn't milk or eggs, but gallon Ziploc bags.

57
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,080
And paper towels.

58
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,840
I understand the toilet paper neurosis, but not the paper towels.

59
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:56,020
And somebody on Facebook said that they were going to get Chinese takeout for dinner because small mom and pop restaurants are hurting.

60
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,760
And because many Asians are facing discrimination like that.

61
00:03:59,760 --> 00:03:59,760


62
00:03:59,760 --> 00:03:59,760


63
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:08,640
And friends, for a bizarre twist, typical of this particular weird Twin Peaks-like small town I live in,

64
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,500
one of the restaurants that's prospered here for decades is a Chinese takeout.

65
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,800
They're the only restaurant open after 9 p.m.

66
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,880
And they're good.

67
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,840
And they're still open.

68
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,720
For takeout.

69
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:28,840
And I'll be interested to see if any numbskulls cause some trouble due to the business name of Chinese.

70
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,740
I'm not sure.

71
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:29,740


72
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
I kind of doubt it.

73
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:38,420
This town is so small that most of the residents and workers tend to treat strangers and weirdos very fairly.

74
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:44,380
And wouldn't think of refusing aid to anyone due to race or gender or religion or whatnot.

75
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,180
Although if you had a Hope and Change t-shirt on, you might get slower service.

76
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,180
I don't know.

77
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:58,140
Um, but then, they get on Facebook and, and...

78
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:10,940
share the same generalized and poorly worded scorn for everybody else as the stereotyped right-wingers you see on the internet.

79
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,280
And I guess that's what they are.

80
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,760
But it's such a disconnect.

81
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,960
They behave like Christians that they claim to be on a person-to-person basis.

82
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,980
But as soon as they're in mass media, they revert to tribal cave behavior.

83
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,120
Kind of like my city dwellers.

84
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,140
Friends tend to do only in the opposite direction.

85
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,840
Now, as Phineas Narco pointed out,

86
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,060
I'm reading this rant by Phineas.

87
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,060
I think he just whipped it off on Scrub or someplace.

88
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:54,660
The televangelists live for disasters like this so they can go on the air and talk about how it's God's wrath for one thing or another.

89
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,860
Usually that means gay people.

90
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,380
And how you need to send them your money in order to be safe.

91
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,420
All-powerful God, but he can't seem to handle money.

92
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,980
Always in need of it.

93
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,900
Go figure.

94
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:13,960
And of course, life is a situation where if you wait long enough, some calamity will eventually happen.

95
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,860
Even if it's just you dying of old age waiting for some calamity to happen.

96
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,500
And if something good eventually happens, well, there it is.

97
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,400
There's your payoff.

98
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,280
That's God blessing you.

99
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,840
So keep sending me your money.

100
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,320
Send him money.

101
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,960
And crap happens, so they'll always have material to work with.

102
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,520
It's like some kind of goofy celestial lottery game they got going.

103
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,080
Put your money down and get in on the God's will sweepstakes.

104
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,580
And another thing.

105
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:50,760
The real reason that religion always has it in for things like porno and sexuality and homosexuality in general

106
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,880
is that religion knows that sex is a vastly more interesting,

107
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:03,420
fulfilling, compelling, primal, and just plain fun experience than what religion itself has to offer.

108
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,440
I mean, there's no comparison.

109
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,160
Honestly, would you rather sit in an uncomfortable wooden pew for an hour and a half

110
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,320
and listen to some stuffy, deluded, semi-coherent jag-off in a robe

111
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:21,920
ramble on with 2,000-year-old made-up stories about people wandering around in the desert on camels,

112
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,580
or would you rather get your ashes hauled?

113
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,940
I said, go to church.

114
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,100
You're either a liar or a fool, and they know it.

115
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,520
So they're forever desperate to stamp out the competition.

116
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,480
It has nothing to do with morality or God's will.

117
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,080
God's will is always religion's will or the church's will masquerading as God.

118
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,740
Just replace the word God with the church when they talk, and you'll know the real deal.

119
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,940
Well, I guess in our case, we'd replace it with Bob.

120
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,960
Hee-hee.

121
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,860
But as Onan Kenobite said,

122
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,640
at Dobbs.town,

123
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,940
the day the last ghost says goodbye to the last Bigfoot

124
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:12,380
who rides the last Nessie to the departure beam of the last flying saucer,

125
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,660
that is such a sad day to think about.

126
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,840
But it doesn't have to be this way!

127
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,760
No, friends.

128
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,720
And, uh,

129
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,860
because we're in the Church of the Lord,

130
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,720
we're the subgenius,

131
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,180
where we say things like,

132
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,660
well, these are a little altered just in the last month.

133
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,360
We say Bob said things like,

134
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,160
watch two women making it.

135
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
Hell, I'd rather still be alive.

136
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:45,340
And as he might have said in some other time,

137
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,320
anybody you see driving a Porsche is probably infected.

138
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,840
These all come, actually, from the prophets Onan and Stoneman,

139
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,640
I just knew,

140
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:07,260


141
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:07,380
from one village in Los Angeles.

142
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,200
And, uh,

143
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,680
it's not easy to do that.

144
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:16,680


145
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,760
holly injuries and shit like this.

146
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:17,900
And on the yards of the streets,

147
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:17,900


148
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:17,900


149
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:17,900


150
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,400
and those people are in

151
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,020
dues to drug use.

152
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,000
Stupids.

153
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,420
Stupids,

154
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,300
what do we do?

155
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:25,480


156
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,780
We don't practice what we preach because we're all in intensive care.

157
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,700
If I can't whoop it, I'll go down.

158
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,080
Oh wait, that one stays the same.

159
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,780
Shut up, pink froth clogging the respirator tube.

160
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,940
Laugh till your lungs bleed.

161
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,900
You'll laugh all the way to the poorly equipped cardboard box in an alley

162
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,780
when Bob lets you in on the real joke.

163
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,080
I place the goddamn terror of the fucking gods into my nose.

164
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,560
I'm uninsured for acts of God or Satan.

165
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,720
I leak the plague from my nether parts.

166
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,880
Oh wait, that one also stays the same.

167
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,820
Come on and give me cancer.

168
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:19,580
I'll spit up the tumor and my children will owe the hospital $736,319.

169
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,200
Are we controlled by tiny microbes?

170
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,400
Fuck them if they can't take a breath.

171
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,860
You probably already knew that the U.S. government was a sham.

172
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:39,280
But did you know that the real powers that be aren't even people?

173
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,340
That they are actually tiny, invisible, shambling things?

174
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,740
Get in on the ground floor now and start digging.

175
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,460
We stand to receive these.

176
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,380
You who are but flesh and understand not the way of the lipid-clad ones.

177
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,660
Gee, I can't wait until that plague time train comes around the bend.

178
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,820
Oh look out, son. Here it comes now.

179
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,640
It's unbelievably big and scary.

180
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,560
Et cetera.

181
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,880
Too much is always deader than not enough.

182
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,360
And here's where I have to turn.

183
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,020
I'm gonna turn the music down.

184
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,120
Because it's a song, I'm sorry.

185
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,580
Let me tell you the story of COVID-19.

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,980
Fode man and yeti fills up your lungs with green.

187
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,580
Wipes away your grin and stops up your windpipe.

188
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,460
It props up the conspiracy and takes away your life.

189
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,040
Now I can go to the old tapes.

190
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,760
They come from old shows.

191
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,460
Puzzling.

192
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,060
Puzzling evidence show.

193
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,540
An old hour of slack shows from when I was doing it in Dallas.

194
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,980
The only cult they want to talk about is the subgenius foundation, the church of the subgenius.

195
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,580
Yeah, Doug Smith says we're different.

196
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,320
Doug's right, Virgil.

197
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,060
We are different.

198
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,900
Thanks to Jesus, the genetic engineering corporation of American states.

199
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:18,980
Mommy too?

200
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,720
Yep, the whole family.

201
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,540
Is everybody like us?

202
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,560
No, son.

203
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,900
But we're working on it.

204
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,080
Round the clock.

205
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,820
This is Bob, and this is bad Bob.

206
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,540
He's a real Bob, and he's a real Bob.

207
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,640
People that followed the wrong Bob.

208
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,100
Gonna end up with no job.

209
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,220
I'm not prejudiced.

210
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,500
I don't care if he's a Jew, a black, Italian, Chinese.

211
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,180
If he messes with me, I'll shoot him.

212
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,120
He's got complete equality as he drops to the ground.

213
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,940
The helicopter which plucked the reentry capsule out of the water.

214
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:36,740
It moved up, took off at fantastic speed at the at least 45 degrees angle, and they just disappeared between the stars.

215
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:49,980
During the debriefing, which we always said after each combat mission, the officer who was receiving this made a joke of it, how many beer I had.

216
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,260
How many beer he had, dear friends.

217
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,440
Oh, yes.

218
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,480
Quiet down, you little creatures of the night.

219
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,760
You've got a show to do.

220
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,060
Oh, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang.

221
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,880
You're listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack in Dallas, Texas.

222
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,580
Hey, Zaphod.

223
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,900
Our theory about Reverend Ann Leonard was just shot to hell.

224
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


225
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


226
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


227
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


228
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


229
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


230
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


231
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


232
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


233
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


234
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


235
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


236
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


237
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


238
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


239
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


240
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


241
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


242
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


243
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


244
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


245
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,780
The other night.

246
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:36,620
Friends, I feel sorry for those of you who couldn't make it to the subgenius meeting and for the people who didn't dare to come and see the reflection of themselves.

247
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,440
But it was very interesting the way that turned out.

248
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:50,060
You know, we announced last week that there was going to be a meeting for people who wanted to volunteer to help with KNON and the Church of the Subgenius specifically.

249
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:58,260
And we got like 30 people called Reverend Cecilia and asked directions and said they were going to come and so forth.

250
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,080
But only half showed up.

251
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:14,200
And the mighty Reverend Cecilia, who now, dear friends, is Popess, the Pope or Popestress of Dallas, Popess Cecilia, bowed down to her, ye unworthy, unclean ones.

252
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,080
For she is truly worthy.

253
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,760
She allowed us to have this meeting at her house.

254
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,900
A meeting of subgenius.

255
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Subgeniuses who had never, in many cases, had never laid eyes on another admitted, quote, subgenius, unquote, before in their lives.

256
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,440
But it turned out quite interesting.

257
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,800
There was no real bobbies.

258
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,640
It was real nice.

259
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,200
It was all folks that I think could give us a real hand.

260
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,520
And I haven't managed to sit down and plot it all out on the big computer yet.

261
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,900
But, oh yes, we'll have places for you all in Dobbs Town, dear friends.

262
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,380
Don't worry about that.

263
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,300
All of ye chosen who showed up.

264
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,840
It was just, the meeting was just what you'd expect.

265
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,740
It was at a seedy S&M bar in Oak Cliff full of demon worshippers.

266
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,100
And, see, you missed out on it.

267
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,720
Missed out on it.

268
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:12,080
Oh, and there was one young subgenius there who gave me a Christmas, a wonderful Christmas present.

269
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:19,360
A sign, professionally made sign that said, Bulldada Time Control Laboratories is subsidiary of the Tridentine.

270
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,780
And, uh, that was wonderful.

271
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:32,640
But, you know, when I put that sign up, they'll know where the subgenius castle is on Swiss Avenue.

272
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,220
That guy, now, see, that guy, he was obviously CIA.

273
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,940
You can't fool Reverend Stan.

274
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,980
That was CIA.

275
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,540
But he was also a subgenius.

276
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,060
So, it's okay if the CIA knows where we are.

277
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,020
But there's many of you out there who are thinking, what's he doing in the jungle?

278
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,040
I thought this was a church.

279
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,340
I thought this was a church.

280
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:49,340


281
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:49,340


282
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,680
And, on top of that, how come, how come he's talking about this church and the subgenius?

283
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,100
What is that?

284
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,260
They say, what are you?

285
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,320
What are you?

286
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,400
They chant, wanting to know just what it is we're talking about.

287
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:11,240
And every 10 or 12 shows, I play this lovely tape.

288
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,220
Three, two, and one.

289
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,380
Now, to continue with the tape recording.

290
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:26,980
Superior mutants, repent, quit your job, slack off.

291
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,100
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

292
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,380
Well, no, probably not.

293
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,340
But whatever you do, just keep listening.

294
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,060
Are we controlled by secret forces?

295
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,200
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is in place?

296
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,720
Joke.

297
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,020
Do people think you're strange?

298
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,520
Do you?

299
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,180
Then you may be on the right track.

300
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,060
Are you abnormal?

301
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,100
Then you are probably better than most people.

302
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,300
Yes, your kind shall triumph.

303
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,920
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

304
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:14,900
This is it, the only faith that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.

305
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,640
Having all the guilt, but none of the sex.

306
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:27,380
Having intercourse with a beautiful live girl or damn near anything else.

307
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,900
But you tried everything.

308
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,980
You ain't seen nothing yet.

309
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,820
Learn to think big.

310
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,940
Develop the tricks of length extension.

311
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,120
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

312
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,200
Stand erect.

313
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,300
Expect for your own abnormality.

314
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,860
Mom is a way of life to millions.

315
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,480
Yet half of them don't even know it.

316
00:18:52,560 --> 00:19:00,240
He's the one true living slack master with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through

317
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,720
the locked doorway to financial heaven.

318
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,680
He is the one real shortcut to slack.

319
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,520
Now, see another dimension on your TV.

320
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,180
Yes, fear the stark fist of removal no longer.

321
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,100
Become physically attractive overnight.

322
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,700
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

323
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,140
Bob promises to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

324
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,500
To explore new ways of going over the edge.

325
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,320
And coming right back.

326
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,620
Plus, to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

327
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:52,100
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormality.

328
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,060
To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around.

329
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:03,480
And channel them into an illusion of creativity that will fool normals and get you sex.

330
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,600
I don't believe you, J-Hart.

331
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,160
Well, I did benefit from it, of course.

332
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,300
But so did a whole bunch of old Dallas boys.

333
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,300
In other words, you want to know, you want the government to know that you're in there to make money and to pay taxes.

334
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,980
Well, we're already treading a pretty thin line, Bill.

335
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,740
And I'm sure there's plenty of other things they'd love to get us for.

336
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:36,200
Just be, you know, well, I don't know whether we want to talk about the conspiracy on the air, but...

337
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,020
Oh, yeah, go right ahead.

338
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,880
This is the conspiracy, the one, the conspiracy behind the conspiracy.

339
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,600
Ah, the conspiracy to end all conspiracies, maybe.

340
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:57,300
Well, part of the church's goal is to wake people up to the fact that our lives are being controlled by forces that most people are completely ignorant of.

341
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:11,020
Well, okay, this light, as we were looking at it, both of us were watching the light, and we thought anything just in, you know, a split second, it was suddenly this two-story, I'd say the diameter around thing.

342
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,260
The height of this room.

343
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,440
Wow. You mean it was like a little bobbing?

344
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,380
Well, it was bobbing as steady as this table if it were carried on a caterpillar. It was that steady.

345
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,200
And walking speed.

346
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,620
And with that, the speed never changed. It just suddenly got that big.

347
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,560
It just suddenly was huge.

348
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:30,880
Yeah.

349
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,060
It gets really complex when you get into conspiracies, and we believe...

350
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,160
We're still in there.

351
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:50,420
Because of the experience that they were going through.

352
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,040
Ah, yes, dear friends.

353
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:01,160
Have you two not gotten enough slack on the ropes of life?

354
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:09,700
This is Dr. Philodrumon speaking to you from on the road way out there.

355
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,660
Somewhere where you nor your friends can even perceive.

356
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,000
Ha ha! Yes, dear friends.

357
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,240
We're out here, you're out there, and we're thinking about you out there.

358
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,860
And about all the wonderful things that can be found when you find Bob.

359
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:37,620
I'm talking to you tonight about the only God, the one and only Bob, the church of the subgenius.

360
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,120
Praise, Bob! Praise, Bob!

361
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,440
Can I get a witness?

362
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,760
Can I get a praise, Bob?

363
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,140
Can I get an amen?

364
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,340
Thank you, children! Thank you!

365
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,420
Now some of you may not be familiar with the church of the subgenius.

366
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:00,580
Some of you may not know the heart of the church of the subgenius.

367
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,500
The purpose, the divine...

368
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,680
The purpose of the church.

369
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,200
The purpose of the church.

370
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,560
What is the purpose of the church?

371
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:12,520


372
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,480
Can I hear that again?

373
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,060
I need more slack!

374
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,380
Can I get some slack?

375
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,740
Can I get some slack?

376
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,540
Slack!

377
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,400
World Without Slack

378
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,200
Chapter 3

379
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,700
By Lies

380
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,480
The fightin' Jesus looked out over the bridge

381
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,260
of the Exist battle saucer, Blood of Christ.

382
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,140
He looked and laughed.

383
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,160
He laughed and looked.

384
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,400
He looked.

385
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,080
He looked and looked.

386
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,360
He laughed and laughed.

387
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,700
He was finally going to have his revenge

388
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,320
on the natives of Dust Moat 89 AB.

389
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,280
Aboard Jesus' flagship,

390
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,980
dozens of killer theologians, the shock priests,

391
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,640
were busy at their weapons terminals.

392
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,300
On the power decks, the proper orgone cycles

393
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,440
were being timed by mass fornications

394
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,480
between the ritual crew and the cancer beings from Theta Z.

395
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,860
An invasion-ready state existed in the ship,

396
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,520
and the 999-year-old

397
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:24,720
was the first to be killed.

398
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:24,720


399
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:24,720


400
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,960
including 400 others floating over the doomed planet Earth.

401
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,380
Jesus was in a psychopathically elated state.

402
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,540
His face resembled many of the perverse icons

403
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,080
the humanoids of the Dust Moat painted of him.

404
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,620
They prayed to these for the salvation of their souls,

405
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,840
as if they had any souls to save,

406
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,640
as if anyone would want to save them,

407
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,680
which they didn't.

408
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:51,120
A whole disgusting religion now centered around his murder.

409
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,220
They had to gall to nail him up like a common criminal

410
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,620
and then paint pictures of him enjoying it.

411
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,320
And they thought he loved them for it,

412
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,380
that he was forgiving.

413
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,480
Oh, the anticipation.

414
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,060
He was sick to his stomach with glee.

415
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,380
He would show them the true face of pain and sin.

416
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,120
It had taken him 2,000 long years to return here,

417
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,640
and now he would pay them back for the scars

418
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,460
he still carried in his hands.

419
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,440
Sweet stigmata.

420
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,100
Even the slightest thought of the scars,

421
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,800
made them glow red through his fists,

422
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,600
through the boxing gloves.

423
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,440
The whole of the spacecraft was manned with angels of light,

424
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,420
personally lent by Jehovah One.

425
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,980
They supervised the demon teams operating on all tangible destruction spectrums,

426
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,380
all in attack mode.

427
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,440
Nagas, Orzuma, Shiva, Horus, Aeons, the dark bodies.

428
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,320
And at time and a half, too.

429
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,640
It was expensive to ravage a planet.

430
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,800
No matter.

431
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,800
The host of judgment.

432
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,400
That which comes had finally arrived.

433
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,120
And on Jesus's birthday.

434
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,520
What do you think, Dad?

435
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,620
His second in command, Jim Jones,

436
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,260
stood by with the final attack coordinate codices.

437
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,720
A whole graphic map of Earth rotated slowly next to Jones in midair.

438
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,180
On its surface, grids of the natives' planetary defenses were lit up in green.

439
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,760
Ones, some depicting their pathetic communication structures in violet.

440
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,180
All in scale, quite pretty actually.

441
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,060
A colorful net surrounded the sphere.

442
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,360
It would soon enough be dark.

443
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,820
These children wait for us below, Jesus.

444
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,760
We will walk among them and we will smile.

445
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,200
At your moment of choice, of course.

446
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:53,480
Jesus studied Jones' puffy, tired face in the pink glow of the neuron banks

447
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:57,060
that ran around the walls of the mighty dreadnought and shuddered.

448
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,280
He was no stranger to resurrection of the undead,

449
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,780
but whoever had brought Jones around again had slipped up.

450
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,480
Something was missing.

451
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,600
Something else was added.

452
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,680
Something.

453
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,400
Jones had been forced on him by the Djinn bankers

454
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,040
who had financed this angelic war fleet.

455
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,760
Damn them.

456
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,060
He never forgot the price they had demanded for this mercenary raiding fleet.

457
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,440
He heard them.

458
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,660
Jones' constant reminders of their influence and expectations

459
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,580
irritated Jesus no end,

460
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,500
not to mention the annoying habit Jones had copied from Dobbs.

461
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,880
The twisted creature insisted on smoking a pipe,

462
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,160
even here near the sensitive nerve relays.

463
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,480
Jones might have been left dead a little too long.

464
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,860
He moved with a constant jerk and always poked at his throat.

465
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,640
He never removed his sunglasses,

466
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,640
and he still took massive injections of methamphetamines,

467
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,180
even though they no longer had any effect on his regenerated shell.

468
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,720
You know, Jimbo, said Jesus,

469
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,080
the best part is that they think there's an afterlife.

470
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,480
That's why they strung me up the first time.

471
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,960
They think like bugs down there.

472
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,960
I'm well aware of that, Commander.

473
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,240
It bothered Jones to be back on Earth so soon after his failure

474
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,840
with the social programming of the world.

475
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:24,680
He was forced to abort the experiment.

476
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:34,380
It was a great deal of speculation about what is going to happen next.

477
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,100
The tape is ready now.

478
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,780
The lights have gone down just slightly.

479
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,840
The new episode of the Mr. Science lecture series...

480
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,360
The Mutron.

481
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:51,420
The Mr. Science lecture series.

482
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,840
Volume 1, number 1.

483
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,640
The Mutron.

484
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,220
Delivered by the Reverend Seth Deitch,

485
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,840
First Church of Mr. Science, Boston.

486
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,920
Outside the realm of conspiracy science

487
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,840
and in the clear light of the so-called forbidden sciences,

488
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,480
we will find we have a far greater chance

489
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,800
of understanding the true nature of the universe.

490
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,200
What the conspiracy feeds us under the guise of the most advanced system

491
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,700
of natural philosophy is nothing but a complex sham,

492
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,580
a decoy to hide from us the true fact of how much bigger and more complex

493
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,160
and nut-wrenchingly frightening a place the universe really is.

494
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,980
We are told about matter and energy and space and time

495
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,420
as being either consistent realities governed by laws

496
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:44,600
or as foggy abstracts that have no particular being outside of that of being,

497
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,740
convenient linguistic aids to make the whole thing easier to swallow.

498
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,840
We at the Temporal Management Research Facility

499
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,760
of the Church of Mr. Science of the Subgenius

500
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,880
have through rigorous probing through mountains of existing

501
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,480
and well-known works on the subject of time and its methods of control

502
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,060
have discovered the key for blowing the whistle on the whole fraudulent twaddle

503
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,040
that is modern science.

504
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,940
This key is the Mutron.

505
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,200
The truth must now be told.

506
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,820
How it was covered up with the truth,

507
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:18,000
for so long, would make a story intriguing enough for a separate book,

508
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,220
but it's too involved to be told here.

509
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,900
The actual issue at hand is the Mutron and its pivotal role

510
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,740
in the management of the true cosmos.

511
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,120
In order to properly understand the following,

512
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,920
it must first be made clear what actually constitutes an elementary particle.

513
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,400
The first of these basic particles is the electron,

514
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,520
which has no mass but possesses a charge that is commonly described as possibly infinite,

515
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,160
thus making it the fundamental unit of energy.

516
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:50,300
It and other related particles, i.e. positrons, photons, gravitons, etc.,

517
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,500
acting in concert make up the Iacotismic field,

518
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,700
which is responsible for holding everything that is anything together.

519
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,960
The second is the much rarer infinite mass particle,

520
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,840
commonly called a black hole.

521
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,640
These particles, like the electrons, occupy no space,

522
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,880
but the influence of a single particle can be felt at a much greater distance.

523
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,200
They often have event horizons many miles wide,

524
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,560
beyond which not even light can escape.

525
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,000
The third fundamental particle is the Mutron.

526
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,820
The Mutron carries with it an infinite temporal capacity

527
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,040
that makes it alter the rate and intensity and general quality

528
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,080
of the passage through time of anything it touches.

529
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,120
The Mutron is very likely the rarest particle in this universe.

530
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,680
As far as we know, there might well be only one of them,

531
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,660
though there could be as many as a few dozen

532
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,180
without generating a dangerous concentration rate.

533
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,800
The first segment of this report will deal with the general implications

534
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,940
of the Mutron in regards to existing ideas on the workings of the universe.

535
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,540
The second will concern the incredible potentialities

536
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,020
of using the potent forces of the Mutron in time control research

537
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,900
and in practical time control.

538
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,920
Section A.

539
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,920
Just how fucking big everything really is.

540
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,180
What we know is the universe can be anything but a small particle.

541
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,180


542
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,180


543
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:17,720
It can be envisioned as a giant atom with the black hole acting as the nucleus

544
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,100
and the Mutron or Mutrons acting as the electron cloud

545
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,920
with the electrons providing the energy for the Mutron to drive us forward through time.

546
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,900
Just about everything else in the universe is just so much debris

547
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,640
cluttering up the works of things.

548
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:36,400
The fact that there is one such atom more than suggests the existence of others.

549
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,200
The Mutron has a corresponding antiparticle known as the tachyon,

550
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,980
which travels through time in a direction which we perceive as backwards

551
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:50,420
so that to someone who is not in the know it will appear to exceed the speed of light.

552
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,400
The simple fact of the matter is that tachyons are extra universal Mutrons

553
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,300
impinging on our universe at a different temporal angle.

554
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,200
These are the Mutrons of atom universes that ours is in compound with.

555
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,000
After this the atomic metaphor breaks down.

556
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,960
No atom is one.

557
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,600
A six million year cycle will end in 1998.

558
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,520
Bob sees the world entering a new aeon,

559
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,220
which in a few years will bring more wondrous and miraculous change

560
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:38,180
and carnage, insanity and destruction than all of mankind's history and prehistory before it.

561
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,920
Bob brings a new destiny for America.

562
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,720
A time of cataclysmic economic change that will offer untold riches and power

563
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,580
to those in the know,

564
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:56,700
while billions of deserving conspiracy dupes fry in hell on earth.

565
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,380
Uncontrolled thinking, controlled by Bob,

566
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:07,020
will usher in a spiritual rebreath and a cascade of astounding mysteries,

567
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,320
supernatural bridges,

568
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,320
and a restoration of lost psychic abilities

569
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,660
that will totally transform the lives of those who dare to seek them and pay for them.

570
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:24,360
That's right, you're lucky to live in the end time.

571
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,860
Here's more money, Bob!

572
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,160
Wise up!

573
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,000
That's right, dear friends, wise up.

574
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:49,140
And I must apologize there for the choice of language used at one point

575
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:52,620
by Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger there with the Church of Mr. Science.

576
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,640
I'm sorry, he cut in on our normal broadcasting spectrum wavelength here

577
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:03,300
and inserted that into our show, that it was not an official part of the Subgenius show.

578
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,980
You did not hear that.

579
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,820
It does not exist.

580
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,540
It does not exist technically as part of the tapes that I chose to play.

581
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,260
I just want you to know that, dear friends.

582
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,440
That's pretty important around here.

583
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:25,940
And I'll probably get in loads of serious trouble.

584
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,840
Uh, what a...

585
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,480
Whoa!

586
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,300
Thanks to St. Byron Werner for that incredible piece of music.

587
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,700
Yeah!

588
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:41,780
And thanks to Reverend Bleepo Abernathy for recording the, uh,

589
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:46,700
the barrage that we were hearing for a lot of the stuff that we've heard tonight, actually.

590
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,040
Yeah!

591
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,440
The different are being silenced by a global conspiracy.

592
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,300
Weird men arise!

593
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:04,340
Find out who they are and how to smash them!

594
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,900
Uh, yes, dear friends.

595
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,920
I have to jump in here and give credit where credit is due.

596
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:19,660
That old tape did indeed turn out to be a really old tape.

597
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:26,260
A whole lot of that was done before the hour of Slack existed as a radio show.

598
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,320
And it was just a bunch of weirdos working with tape decks and mailing tapes back and forth.

599
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:33,900
It was fun.

600
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,380
Uh...

601
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,700
There was also a little bit from the hour of Slack, probably around hour of Slack number 70 or something,

602
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:54,060
where I was reading Paul Mavridi's short story, uh, The World Without Slack, starring Jim Jones and Jesus.

603
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:00,340
Anyway, I want to thank Dr. Philo Drummond on the road.

604
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,540
Glass Madness for these beautiful songs.

605
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,360
Bleepo Abernathy!

606
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,680
For his mixing and his great voice work.

607
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,360
The late David Boone.

608
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,360
Seth Deitch.

609
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,360
John Hagenbrenner.

610
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,360
Uh, Doctors for Wotan.

611
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,280
Pope David N. Meyer, Pope of all New York.

612
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,600
Paul Mavridis!

613
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:33,360
The Mr. Science was mixed by Bill Capes and voiced by Seth Deitch, also known as Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger.

614
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,340
A lot of his songs were written by him.

615
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,640
The editing was done by yours truly, Reverend Stang.

616
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:42,500
And D.K. Jones did the original music on the best parts.

617
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,080
Praise Paul.

618
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,860
From PR News in Washington, I'm No Predator, and sexual interactions were consensual.

619
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:58,740
The Trump confirms that Trump is expected to rescind PR in Russia for the first time since Boston.

620
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,800
In Boston.

621
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,320
In Russia.

622
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,340
Harvey Weinstein's lawyer says his client faces federal charges of abuse.

623
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,240
He says he has attempted arson and other crimes.

624
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:13,500
Ben Brafman says Weinstein is planning sensual sexual interactions against a third woman.

625
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,920
The Dow is 32, 24, 74, 75, 2.

626
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,700
The President of Iran says oil exports, exports that is, will fail.

627
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,640
Not to be exported while exported.

628
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,120
He didn't explain what he meant by that despite the PR News.

629
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:34,680
A source confirms that Trump told Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that this is the PR News.

630
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,860
But not necessarily in Washington.

631
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:50,400
Now, I could get this show cranked out really fast by playing Bob Dylan's first new song in eight years,

632
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:55,320
Murder Most Foul, because it's 17 minutes long.

633
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,000
It just came out last week.

634
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,140
A couple of my friends posted links to it.

635
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,540
I listened to it.

636
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,660
And I bawled.

637
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:04,660


638
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,780
I bawled my eyes out.

639
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,420
I really bawled my eyes out.

640
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,200
Because I've lived through all this stuff.

641
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,020
And I realized what I was crying for was my country.

642
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,020
Which I don't think I've ever done before.

643
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,700
On the other hand, some of my cantankerous old buddies said,

644
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,740
Ah, it's maudlin.

645
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,820
He's believing his own hype now.

646
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,960
Ah, it's boring.

647
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,500
17 minutes.

648
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,560
I'm not going to listen to that.

649
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,220
It doesn't change much.

650
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,020
But by golly, what's the point of me talking about it

651
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,120
if I'm not going to go ahead and just play the damn thing?

652
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,980
Bob Dylan's new song.

653
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:44,040
If you get bored, turn it off.

654
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,860
You know, touch that dial.

655
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,480
I don't care.

656
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,120
I'm not getting paid for this.

657
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,660
It was a dark day in Dallas.

658
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,000
I was a little bit worried.

659
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,000


660
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,000


661
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,000


662
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,000


663
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,000


664
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,000


665
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,880
It was November 63.

666
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,100
A day that will live on in infamy.

667
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,120
President Kennedy was a right line.

668
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,540
Good day to be living and a good day to die.

669
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,640
He had led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb.

670
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,160
He said, wait a minute, boys.

671
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,780
You know who I am.

672
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,000
Of course we do.

673
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,300
We know who you are.

674
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,580
Then they blew off his head while he was still in the car.

675
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,480
Shot down like a dog in broad daylight.

676
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,920
It was a matter of timing, and the timing was right.

677
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,600
You got unpaid debts.

678
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,100
We've come to collect.

679
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,300
We're going to kill you with hatred, without any respect.

680
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,620
We'll mock you and shock you, and we'll grin in your face.

681
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,760
We've already got someone here to take your place.

682
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,380
The day they blew out the brains of the king.

683
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,960
Thousands were watching, knowing something.

684
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,080
It happened so quickly, so quick by surprise.

685
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,780
Right there in front of everyone's eyes.

686
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,440
Greatest magic trick ever under the sun.

687
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,660
Perfectly executed, skillfully done.

688
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,680
Wolfman, oh, Wolfman, oh, Wolfman, ow.

689
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:55,280
Rub-a-dub-dub, it's a murder most foul.

690
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,000
Hush, little children, you'll understand.

691
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,580
The Beatles are coming, they're gonna hold your hand.

692
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,940
Slide down the banister, go get your coat.

693
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,400
Ferry across the Mersey and go for the throne.

694
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,480
There's three bums coming all dressed in rags.

695
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:30,840
Pick up the pieces and holler the flag.

696
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,340
I'm going to Woodstock, it's the Aquarian age.

697
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,020
Then I'll go over to Altamonte and sit near the stage.

698
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,320
Put your head out the window, let the good times roll.

699
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,200
There's a party going on behind the glassy door.

700
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,500
Put your foot in the tank and step on the gas.

701
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,280
Try to make it to the triple underpass.

702
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,440
Blackface singer, whiteface clown.

703
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,840
Better not show your faces after the sun goes down.

704
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,480
Up in the red light district like a cop on the beach.

705
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,860
Living in a nightmare on Elm Street.

706
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,120
When you're down on New Berlin, put your money in your shoe.

707
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,540
Don't ask what your country can do for you.

708
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,840
Cash on the bellhead, money to burn.

709
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,780
Daily Plaza, make a left hand turn.

710
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,360
I'm going down to the crossroads, gonna fly in a ride.

711
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,620
The place where faith, hope and charity die.

712
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,760
Shoot them while he runs, boy.

713
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,320
Shoot them while you can.

714
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,620
See if you can shoot the invisible man.

715
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,720
Goodbye Charlie, goodbye Uncle Sam.

716
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,860
Frankly, my scarlet, I don't give a damn.

717
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:30,600
I'm going down to the crossroads, gonna fly in a ride.

718
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:30,600


719
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,180
What is the truth and where did it go?

720
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,220
Ask Oswald and Ruby to let her know.

721
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,100
Shut your mouth, say it away, slow down.

722
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,920
Business is business and it's the murder most foul.

723
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,120
Tommy, can you hear me? I'm the ancient queen.

724
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,740
I'm riding in a long black Lincoln limousine.

725
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,200
Riding in the back seat next to my wife.

726
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,060
Heading straight on into the afterlife.

727
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,260
I'm leading to the left and I got my head in a lap.

728
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:40,760
Oh Lord, I've been led into some kind of a trap.

729
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:46,240
Well, we ask no quarter, no quarter do we give.

730
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,900
Well, right down the street, from the street where you live.

731
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,660
They mutilated his body and they took out his brain.

732
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:05,280
What more could they do? They piled on the pain.

733
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:10,980
But his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at.

734
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,860
For the last fifty years, they've been searching for that.

735
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,200
Freedom, oh freedom, freedom over me.

736
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:29,420
I hate to tell you mister, but only dead men are free.

737
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:34,920
Send me some love and tell me no lie.

738
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,600
Throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by.

739
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,440
Wake up little Susie, let's go for a drive.

740
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,600
Cross the Trinity River, let's keep up alive.

741
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,420
Turn the radio on, don't touch the dials.

742
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:09,200
Parkland Hospital, only six more miles.

743
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:15,100
You got me dizzy Miss Lizzie, you filled me with lead.

744
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,060
That magic bullet of yours has gone to my head.

745
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:27,220
I'm just a patsy like Patsy Cline.

746
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,440
Never shot anyone from in front or behind.

747
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,240
I've blood in my eye, got blood in my ear.

748
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,440
I'm never gonna make a toot-a-doo frontier.

749
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,760
Zupetus film, I've seen that before.

750
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,320
Seen it thirty-three times, maybe more.

751
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,020
It's vile and deceitful, it's cruel and it's mean.

752
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,040
Ugliest thing that you ever have seen.

753
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,440
They killed him once and they killed him twice.

754
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,420
Killed him like a human sacrifice.

755
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,300
The day they died, they killed him twice.

756
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:26,300


757
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,080

The age of the Antichrist has just only begun.

759
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,980

00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:52,260
Let me know when you decide to throw in the towel.

762
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:58,620
It is what it is, and it's murder most foul.

763
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:17,020
What's new, pussycat? What'd I say?

764
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,240
I said the same thing.

765
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:22,240


766
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:22,240


767
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,240
The soul of a nation will turn away.

768
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,740

You can also give more information to subgenius.com

and or a whole lot of different Facebook pages and forums,

912
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,440
although the really good ones are only open to members.

913
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:19,920
And I'm the one who has the list of who's a member.

914
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,520

There's even a security guard

923
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:28,340
Because Rose doesn't lose her place

924
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,120
It's me who is this little

925
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:39,180

00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,480
Like a little bird singing

928
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:49,320
They call me their little bourgeois

929
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,720
It's a little bird, it's a little bird, it's a little bird

930
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,720
Others will close their eyes for him

931
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,380
But I'm the one who loves him

932
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:42,160
Zonanana, zonanana, zonanamita

933
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:43,720
I am alive, I am charming

934
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,180
Like a little bird singing

935
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:46,700
They call me their little bourgeois

936
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,980
It's me who is this little

937
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:49,280
Zonanana, zonanana, zonanamita

938
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:49,280

I am alive, I am charming

942
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,700
Like a little bird singing

943
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:03,580
They call me their little bourgeois

944
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:07,120
It's a little bird, it's a little bird, it's a little bird, it's a little bird

945
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:11,040
Others will close their eyes for him

946
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,940
But I'm the one who loves him

947
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,300
Zonanana, zonanana, zonanamita

948
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:19,300

01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,320
It's the Rudy Schwartz Project

951
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:26,020
I sure hope he wasn't cussing in French

952
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:27,020
Thank y'all

953
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:49,240
