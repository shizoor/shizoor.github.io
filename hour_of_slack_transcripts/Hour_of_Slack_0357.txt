Mr. Cooper, how do you find our little corner of this world?
Heaven, sir.
Well, this week, heaven includes...
... arson, multiple homicides, and an attempt on the life of a federal agent.
Heaven is a large and interesting place, sir.
Are you looking for secrets?
Is that what all this is about?
Well, maybe I can help you.
Do you know what the ultimate secret is?
You want to know?
Laura did.
The secret of knowing who killed you.
No. No.
You want to know?






I've got an idea, ma'am.
You took me for a walk...
... under the moon.
Under the sycamore tree.
The dark trees that blow, baby.
In the dark trees that blow.
And I'll see you...
... and you'll see me.
And I'll see you in the branches that blow.
In the breeze.
I'll see you...
... in the breeze.
In the trees.
I'll see you...
... in the trees.
Under the sycamore tree.
Under the sycamore tree.
And welcome to the subgenius hour of Gorman Bosian.
This is the Will of Dobbs speaking to you tonight, coming more or less live from the Black Lodge.
And even though tonight's show is devoted to the work of David Lynch, we're not going to talk about Judy.
In fact, we're just going to leave her out of it.
This is the legendary Jimmy Scott from Fire Walk With Me.
And I'll see you
And you'll see
And I'll see you
In the branches
That blow
In the breeze
I'll see you
In the trees
I'll see you
In the trees
Under
The Sigamore
Tree
And again, that was the legendary Jimmy Scott from the soundtrack of the fine new motion picture, Twin Peaks, Fire Walk With Me.
It was in honor of that motion picture and the disgusting critical disacclaim it has received from people who dislike it for the same reason they like it.

If you looked and read the show
If youdaid it
I wanted you to understand
And you know, you could, now that you watch review two episodes of Twin Peaks
You might think it's high quality
You could be really lucky
Daringly
You could, now that people can't even own it
And try doing it
The fact of the matter is
That it's something you have to do
To reach it
And you can do just that
Dear listeners
We live inside a dream
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash
Three months later
While he was holidaying in Myrtle Beach
They still got way too much traffic there for my taste
Have you been noticing the buildup in traffic?
Here she goes again
I'm sorry, sailor
But that ozone layer's disappearing
One of these mornings
The sun's gonna come up and burn a hole
Clean through the planet like an electrical X-ray
Well, that ain't never will happen, honey
At least not in our lifetime
By then they'll be driving Buicks to the moon
Uncle Pooch

You okay, honey?
Oh, that woman's laugh creeps me out
Sounds like something I heard before
Sounded like the wicky witch
Just sounded like an old gal
Having a good time
I'll be at the lab, gentlemen
Anything we should be working on?
Yeah
You might practice walking
Without dragging your knuckles on the floor
Albert, let's talk about knuckles
For the last time, I knocked you down
I felt bad about it
The next time's gonna be a real pleasure
Listen to me
While I will admit to a certain cynicism
The fact is that I'm a naysayer and hatchet man
In the fight against violence
I pride myself in taking a punch
And I'll gladly take another
Because I can't do it alone
I don't choose to live my life
In the company of Gandhi and King
My concerns are global
I reject absolutely revenge, aggression, and retaliation
The foundation of such a method
Is love
I love you, Sheriff Truman
Albert's path is a strange and difficult one
There
Now the itching becomes burning
Heat upon heat upon heat
Silence! Silence!
I must not fear
Fear is the mind killer
Fear is the little thing that Next Generation has To Pay for this

Death brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I am permitted to pass over me and through me.
I must not fear flesh.
I do feel a crispy ear.
Death brings total obliteration.
I will face my flesh.
I will be of.
Fear.
Fear is the little death.
I must not fear.
Fear is the little death.
I am.
The pain.
No.
Enough.
No woman child ever withstood that much.
Take your hand out of the box and look at it.
Young human.
A more of your mother than we.
You will be.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
It's a sunny, woodsy day in Lumberton, so get those chainsaws out.
This is the mighty W-O-O-D, the musical voice of Lumberton.
At the sound of the falling tree, it's 9.30.
There's a whole lot of wood waiting us here, so let's get going.
I thought I heard a stranger.
We've got chicken tonight.
Strangest damn things.
They're man-made.
Little damn things.
Smaller than a chicken.

They're bigger than my fist.
But they're new.
I'm Bill.
Hello, I'm Henry.
I'm Henry.
In the faraway world,
in the world of Pinky's Bubble Cake,
things changed.
I knew one thing.
I wasn't alone.
I could hear you.
I wasn't alone.
I could hear you.
I could hear you.
I remember you holding off on anything

but I kidded.




The time has farther gone than age.
I've been amazing to that world






You left everything anyway.

As he left, I remembered a piece of information I unique.
So, I have a couple common things for you to keep in mind Heartбуwer andạo,
see you tomorrow.

Good night.

Heart was stuffed in a truck
Beating like hell
Like I said before

The twins spoke.
The twins spoke.
Why is there so much trouble in this world?
I don't know.
I had a dream.
In fact, it was the night I met you.
In the dream, there was our world.
And the world was dark because there weren't any robins.
And the robins represented love.
And for the longest time, there was just this darkness.
And all of a sudden, thousands.
And all of a sudden, thousands of robins were set free.
And they flew down and brought this blinding light of love.
And it seemed like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference.
And it did.
And it did.
And it did.
And it did.








So I guess it means...
there is trouble till the robins come.
You're a neat girl.
So are you.
Come on in there, San Antonio, Texas.
What's on your almost perfect mind this evening?
I just had triple bypass open heart surgery.
And I want you to know it's people like you that made me want to get out of that hospital.
Hey, how can you out listen to this crap?
I'm sorry, Al.
For her recent divorce, shot and killed her three children aged seven.
Shot right between the heinous...
A local judge praised defendant John Roy,
but was dismayed to learn that Roy had had sex with the corpse.
What?
Roy's lawyer was quoted as saying...
Murder.
State authorities last October released 500 turtles into the Ganges
to try and reduce human pollution.
And now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floating corpses.
No!
What's that, peanut?
I can't take no more of this radio.
Sailor Ripley, you get me some music on that radio!
This is instant! I made it!
He was victim of a sexual assault.
Mutilation, right?
Who is this armed dog and fiksh?

He didn't go to jail because he couldn't lie like they did August of former president Ernie R이� Jewish.



Now, he's close to his death, we believe.
And?
He has two child chronic drug addict feels,
Rancho Rojo lapsed beam tables,
again a close pair of walkingitches.
And then he asked what I knew.
I thought maybe he didn't want a woman.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
Mentally, you picture my dog,
but I have not told you the type dog which I have.
Perhaps you might even picture Toto from the Wizard of Oz.
But I can tell you my dog is always with me.
I can tell you my dog is always with me.
Everything is alright.
I close my eyes.
Then I drift away.
Into the magic night.
I softly say.
A silent prayer.
Like dreamers do.
Then I fall asleep to dream.
My dreams of you.
In dreams I walk with you.
In dreams I talk to you.
In dreams you're mine.
All our lives we live together.
In dreams.
In dreams.
In dreams.
But just before the dawn.
I awake and find you gone.
I can't help it.
I can't help it.
If I'm not.
I remember that you said goodbye.
It's too late.
It's too late.





It's not that I need it.



Rain andны I think I am alone.
T Taiyihi.
It's too late if I didn't know.





And you're a Manly ghost.

And no woman.
Rain is timing.
For real
And right this second, you're listening to the theme from the new David Lynch film,
Twin Peaks, Fire, Walk With Me,
and try to catch up here on some of the other stuff you've been listening to.
Betwixt all the clips from the films, which...
most of which I hope you recognize,
some of the...
some of the less recognizable musical items.
We heard a little bit of Pinky's Bubble World from the Industrial Symphony No. 1
by Lynch and Angelo Badalamente,
who basically will be doing most of the music you're hearing tonight,
except for anything you hear from the film Dune,
which had music by Toto.
Toto!
We'll get to that little scene later on tonight.
And then Power Mad,
with a song,
that could only be called
Slaughterhouse
from Wild at Heart.
And we heard the poem that
the Hayward girl wrote for Laura Palmer.
Before that, introducing the poem was
the creepy girl
from...
Well, she was pretty creepy in Twin Peaks.
She was only in that one episode.
But years before, she played the creepy little girl
in Dune,
little Aliyah.
I think she may be in the mix here somewhere.
And then just a few seconds ago,
we listened to In Dreams by Roy Orbison.
That was the recent version which Mr. Lynch himself produced,
not the original version,
but from, of course, a blue velvet.
And we're going to continue on in this vein,
since no one's...
has been able to stop me yet.
I'm going to keep on, so stay tuned for more lynchness
on your Hour of Slack.
I mean, gormanbozia.
Move up.
Put the pick in there, Pete.
And turn it around real neat.
Mm-mm.
You are so beautiful, my Baron.
Your skin, love to me.
Your disease is lovingly cared for for all eternity.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Because spread diseases are the result of a juicy rat.
Yeah!
What do you want to do?
I'm doing it.
Are you a bad boy?
What do you mean?
Do you want to do bad things?
Anything?
Anything?
What do you want?
I want you to hurt me.
No.
I don't want to hurt you. I told you I want to help you.
Dorothy, I know something's happening.
Frank has your husband and son, doesn't he?
If you're going to do something, go to the police.
No police.
No police.
Don't hit me!
No! No!
Get away! Get away from that bed!
Get away!
Seven anxious men have died, but it isn't the night before...



There's no reason for you to fear the coxswain.

Bob I like Boise.
If demons allowed itself to get out, the Prient will исome.
His son.
all i know for sure is there's more than a few bad ideas running around loose out there
you know there's something i ain't never told you about sailor
and this here's a story with the lesson about bad ideas
what was that well my cousin dale was always fighting bad ideas
see dale loved christmas we used to call him jingle dale he wanted christmas to last all year long
he sure would scream out when his mama told him it was summertime and christmas was six months off
and also
he would say that he felt those men with
you know

Black rubber gloves was following him around.
Dale said that trust in the spirit of Christmas
was destroyed by ideas being controlled by aliens wearing black gloves.
These aliens would get Dale to do all kinds of things.
Then he'd carry on about the weather.
Talk about how rainfall is controlled by aliens living on Earth.
Aunt Rudy told Dale that one day he would realize
that the alien wearing the black gloves was him and him alone.
Well, sounds like old Dale's more than just a little bit confused, ain't it?
Well, Dale was learning a hard lesson.
He got so he'd stay up all night making sandwiches.
Dale, what are you doing?
I'm making my lunch!
Mama told me Aunt Rudy, this is Dale's mama,
found cockroaches in Dale's underwear.
One time, she found Dale...
putting one big cockroach right on his anus.
Hell, Peter.
It ain't so funny now, though.
Dale disappeared.
Nobody's seen him since.
It's too bad he couldn't...
visit that old Wizard of Oz and...
get some good advice.
Too bad we all can't, baby.
Did you and Mary have sexual intercourse?
Why?
Why?
Did you?
Why are you asking me this question?
Oh, there's still not sure it is a baby.

If ever something don't feel right to you,
remember what Pancho said to the Cisco kid.
Let's went before we're dancing at the end of a rope
without music.
You've been doing fine without me, Pina.
There's no need to make life tougher than it has to be.
Zahler!
Zahler!
Come on!
Come back!
Zahler!
What do you faggots want?
Zahler!
Zahler!
She's a good witch.
Zahler Ripley,
Luna loves you.
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer,
and I haven't had any parental guidance.
She's forgiven you all these things.
You love her.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid, Zahler.
But I'm wild at heart.
If you're truly wild at heart,
you'll fight for your dreams.
Don't turn away from love, Zahler.
Don't turn away from love.
You'll be out of much trouble living without one
else by no extracted professional Cola drink.
All done.
Have you got anything to do with rinse,

Here's the face of aNTander for your Lebanon woman.

I apologize to you gentlemen for referring to you as homosexuals.
I also want to thank you, fellas.
You've taught me a valuable lesson in life.

I killed her!
Oh my god!
I killed my daughter!
I don't know!
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
Oh god!
I... I was just a boy.
I saw him in my dream.
He said he'd walk by
to play.
He opened me
and I invited him
and he came inside me.
He went inside?
When he was inside
I didn't know.
And when he was gone
I couldn't remember.
He made me do things.
Terrible things.
He said
he wanted lives.
He wanted others.
Others to be loved.

Others that they could use.
Like they used me.
Like Laura.
They wanted her.
They wanted Laura.
But she was strong.
She fought them.
She wouldn't let them in.
Oh god.
They had me kill that girl,
Teresa.
And they...
They said
they'd have me kill her too.
Then give Laura.
They'd have me kill her too.
But she wouldn't let them in.
They said she'd die
before she left.
Then they made me kill her.
Oh god.
I have mercy on me.
What have I done?
What have I done?
Oh god.
Oh god.
I love her.
I love her
with all my heart.
I hate you.
I hate you.
I hate you.
Leland.
Leland.
I'm scared.
Oh.
I don't know what I'm saying.


You're just appearance.

senhor o verbo.
Baronよ blind.
Vłodek otmarł swał.
We should go.
No.
Not to go.
Nah.
and abide in that state.
Look to the light, Leland.
Find the light.
I see it.
Into the light, Leland.
Into the light.
I see her.
She's there.
Into the light, Leland.
She's beautiful.
Into the light.
Laura.
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.
Laura, of course, when I say of course.
The end of Wild at Heart
and Leland Palmer's death
and redemption from Twin Peaks
are two scenes that always bring a tear to my eye.
And I think the reason why
the only happy endings in films
I really sort of can identify with
and think feel...
plausible are lynch ones because I guess because his people have to go through so
much to reach that happy ending and I think that's ultimately the reason why I
so enjoyed fire walk with me because it has at least in my to my interpretation
a happy ending for Laura Palmer which I would imagine no one really deserved
more than her unless it's me well thank you so much for listening to tonight's
subgenius hour of Gorman Bosia sort of an experiment really just sort of see if
see if we could do a show based primarily on the work of just one guy a
lot more here I could have done and so don't forget
the good day is here and I'll see you next time.
I'm Bob Dobbs.
Remember him?
Write to P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas 75214.
Thanks again.
We'll be back next week with your hour of slack.
This has been your host Will of Dobbs.
Thank you.
Praise God.
Praise God.
Praise God.

And it's too late.
It's too late.
It's too late.
It's too late.
It's too late.
It's too late.
