1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,080
It's chaotic, it's chaotic, it's chaotic.

2
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,800
Yes, yes, finally we can do it.

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,200
Actually, friends, my microphone broke and Bob made me come into the station.

4
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,700
He made me keep working and so we're doing it.

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,780
God damn it, from the very station itself.

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,880
If I push this button, now theoretically this should bring this noise up.

7
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,160
No.

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,980
Can this a very angry sounding thing?

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,680
Something real?

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,160
Someone really wants to rant about some shit that they've been like building up in their bowels?

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,240
I mean, yes, I said bowels.

12
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,860
I mean, this is going to be angry sounding, I suppose so.

13
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,020
If you walk around right now, you might hear a lot of people saying,

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,440
I really don't think anything's going to happen.

15
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,980
This is all just a big spectacle, a diversion.

16
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:47,260
Someone's got something planned and we're never going to see the end of tomorrow like we planned.

17
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,060
Some people are saying, I don't think the X's are going to come.

18
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,780
I don't think Bob's really here.

19
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,020
I think this slack thing you're talking about is all about emptying your wallet.

20
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,460
I had to pay $10 to get on the Wi-Fi.

21
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,100
I had to pay $10 to park my car.

22
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,280
I paid $15 a day to register a camping fee.

23
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,780
$35 at the campground.

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,220
And there was a $35 before that one.

25
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,760
And I think even before that, there was another $35.

26
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,860
And before that, maybe even another $35.

27
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:47,320
I paid $35 so many goddamn times, I don't even know how many doctorates I have.

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,160
But if there's one thing that I've noticed in the past 10 years of being a subgenius,

29
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,780
subgenius,

30
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,200
subgenius,

31
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,620
subgenius,

32
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,720
subgenius,

33
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,320
subgenius,

34
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,660
subgenius,

35
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,520
subgenius,

36
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,120
subgenius,

37
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,460
subgenius,

38
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:04,460


39
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:04,520
subgenius,

40
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,460
subgenius,

41
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:05,600
subgenius,

42
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,100
subgenius,

43
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,820
subgenius,

44
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:08,860
subgenius,

45
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,040
subgenius,

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,040


47
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,200
subgenius,

48
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,200


49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,200


50
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,200


51
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,200


52
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,200


53
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,200


54
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,200


55
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,200


56
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,200


57
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,520
subgenius,

58
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,000
subgenius,

59
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,460
subgenius,

60
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,160
subgenius,

61
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,260
subgenius,

62
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,340
subgenius,

63
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,200
subgenius,

64
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,680
subgenius,

65
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,760
subgenius,

66
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,260
Might as well kiss those watches goodbye.

67
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,740
Calendars are a thing of the past.

68
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,220
Because it's X Day!

69
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,500
You need to pull your head out of your ass and you need to come down here right now

70
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,780
and you need to explain to everybody why you think JR Bob Cobb says it does something for you!

71
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,080
He's done less than God.

72
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,700
So I guess that's a little bit more.

73
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,120
Can you feel it?

74
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,560
That giant Mayan calendar was not spinning to 2012.

75
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:16,860
No!

76
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,580
98!

77
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,780
98!

78
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,420
98!

79
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:22,480
98!

80
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:22,480


81
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:22,480


82
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:22,480


83
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,180
Next time!

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,300
Kiss all your calendars goodbye!

85
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,680
We're gonna watch the pinks fry!

86
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,060
They're gonna die!

87
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,180
They're gonna burn!

88
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,460
Will you survive X Day?

89
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,660
will you survive X Day?

90
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,700
Will you survive X Day?

91
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,440
Will you survive X Day?

92
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,980
xx

93
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,500
ill this guy

94
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:03,900
wine

95
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:03,980
for

96
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:03,980


97
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:03,980


98
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:03,980


99
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:03,980


100
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,280
thought to fly

101
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,200
way

102
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:20,720
You fuckers. You dirty, pagan, atheist, slimeball, blasphemous, disgusting, maven, blobs of slime.

103
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,960
You are the goo on the bottom of the pond.

104
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,980
Be that goo.

105
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,660
Because goo is really neat.

106
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,380
I hear there's some new openings for Overman.

107
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,820
Thanks, guys.

108
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,900
Thanks for coming to X-Day.

109
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:16,960
It's just so gosh darn nice to see you here in positive encouragement.

110
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,920
Positive Pomeroy.

111
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,140
Positive Pomeroy.

112
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,380
Positive Pomeroy.

113
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,220
Pomeroy sounds like a lotion that you would put on a bad burn.

114
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:27,760
It is.

115
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,080
Thank you.

116
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,460
Are you ready to ask Dr. Howell?

117
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,980
Think of your question or questions.

118
00:06:52,220 --> 00:07:01,920
And think how much you want to invest to learn the answer from Dr. Howell.

119
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,140
But only if you are actually interested.

120
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,060
In receiving the answer.

121
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,680
Answers once given can never be retracted.

122
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,520
Yeah, think about that, kids.

123
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,200
Before you dive in.

124
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,740
Now at this time, Reverend Angry Larry is distributing the question slips.

125
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,660
And there will be writing instruments on which you may write your questions.

126
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,180
And send them here to our desk.

127
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,320
With a slight premium or reward.

128
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,180
For me, Dr. Howell and Dowell.

129
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,380
If we like your question.

130
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,680
Oh, wait.

131
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,280
We don't have any liquor to dispense.

132
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,320
Okay, never mind that part of it.

133
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,240
If we like your donation.

134
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,320
If your donation is exceptionally generous.

135
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,500
But they're not even paying attention.

136
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,600
Let's keep this going.

137
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,020
Attention.

138
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,280
Attention, subgeniuses.

139
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,700
It's time to ask.

140
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,500
Dr. Howell.

141
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,440
I have a question first, though.

142
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,860
Of you.

143
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,320
Can you hear me?

144
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,460
Good.

145
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,100
Okay.

146
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,300
Recording.

147
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,980
Everything's going fine.

148
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes.

149
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,920
You must ask Dr. Howell if you want an answer.

150
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,720
And to get that answer, you have to write it down on the little slips of paper.

151
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,840
I know that most of you haven't used a pencil or a piece of paper in the last.

152
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,480
Twenty years.

153
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,440
We're asking you to do it now.

154
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,720
Because I don't want to be texted these questions.

155
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,720
And we collect them.

156
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,440
I have a giant stack of absurd questions that Dr. Howell has answered.

157
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,640
Called the hour of slack.

158
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,180
Anyway.

159
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,860
Again, if you didn't understand this correctly.

160
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,300
Although Dr. Howell can provide an answer freely and for free.

161
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,480
Don't you want a slightly better answer?

162
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:04,820
No.

163
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,700
Like by throwing in a buck.

164
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,660
Or a really better answer.

165
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,840
Throw in five bucks.

166
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,600
Throw in a twenty.

167
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,520
And you may get a forty hour recitation.

168
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,160
Nah.

169
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,580
Not that long.

170
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,040
Not forty hour.

171
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,840
But if you do give us.

172
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,260
I thought you were going to go home with them for twenty bucks.

173
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,640
If you give us a genuine, generous donation.

174
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,480
Then you do receive the recitation.

175
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,240
That is true.

176
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,180
Oh, we got one up here already.

177
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,860
We have one already.

178
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:35,760
That's very good.

179
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,600
You see now it is happening.

180
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,360
And here comes another one.

181
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,780
Yeah, you can just drop them up here.

182
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,740
We usually have a jar to drop them in.

183
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,380
But not this.

184
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,280
It's full of Diet Dr. Pepper.

185
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,120
How could you?

186
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,400
Have you ever done it before?

187
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,180
Yes.

188
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,100
Just stack your.

189
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,080
Now we even have a receptacle.

190
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,040
Thank you so much.

191
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,700
Receptacles are so wonderful.

192
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,500
And for those who do not have pens or pencils.

193
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:11,780
There are some pens and pencils available on the desktop before me now.

194
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,240
When you're done with that pencil.

195
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,140
Give it to Reverend Pease.

196
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,580
And he'll give it to somebody else.

197
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,860
But if you're done with a pen.

198
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,000
You can give the pen back to me.

199
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,780
Yes, we take pens here.

200
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,280
So shall we start with the first question Dr. Howell?

201
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,660
I believe Anna Mall brought this up here.

202
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,620
And it came with this George.

203
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,400
All right, that's fine.

204
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,860
The question is.

205
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,180
What is the most important color?

206
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,720
Whoa.

207
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,920
What is the most important color?

208
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,260
The question is.

209
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,500
What is the most important color?

210
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,580
And of course.

211
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,700
In the relativism of the spectrum.

212
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,040
Any color.

213
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,480
At any particular time.

214
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,960
Which is needed.

215
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
More than any other.

216
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,860
May swell to an unusual importance.

217
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,360
But there are two ways of judging color.

218
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,300
One is as we create it and use it.

219
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,580
The other as it exists in nature's strange laboratory.

220
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,860
In the laboratory of man.

221
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,560
All the colors put together produce black.

222
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,840
First.

223
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,460
Mud.

224
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,800
And then black inky darkness.

225
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,480
But in nature's workshop.

226
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,960
All the colors run together produce white.

227
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,360
Ineffable.

228
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,540
Glorious.

229
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,340
And perfect white.

230
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,460
Since that in a state of nature comprises all colors.

231
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:54,380
White itself must be counted as the most important color.

232
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Just as you can make all different kinds of ice cream out of vanilla.

233
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,100
Well, there you go.

234
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,560
Thank you.

235
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,080
Vanilla ice cream.

236
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,640
Oh, let's see.

237
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,740
What have we got there?

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,140
Yes.

239
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,100
We're still taking questions up up here.

240
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,400
Um, ok, the next question will be, and this comes with a another George.

241
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,440
Oh, circus music.

242
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,900
Well this is a short one.

243
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,100
Let's have it.

244
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,940
Why is Bob and the woodpecker hanging outside of a treebark?

245
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:28,940


246
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,020
The Bob is in quotes meaning the Bob.

247
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,340
Why is Bob?

248
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,360
Well, Bob is himself a question.

249
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,120
A question which needs to be asked periodically

250
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,880
through lustrums and epicycles of cosmic time.

251
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,960
As we know, there have always been Bobs

252
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,820
and there will always be a Bob.

253
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:03,620
But this does not touch upon the single essential element,

254
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,220
the why or wherefore of Bob.

255
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,160
Not many people are aware that Bob was known

256
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,860
unto the Church of the Subgenius

257
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,000
before the famous face with the dots and the pipe

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,200
which everyone naturally gravitates to

259
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,380
as the idolatrous effigy of Bob.

260
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,780
This face is an artistic approximation

261
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,900
of the actual disturbingly real photograph of Bob.

262
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:42,860
From that was made the image or glyph of Bob.

263
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,980
You see, because there was a need for Bob,

264
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,720
the face appeared and was given unto us.

265
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,820
Before that, there was a need for something,

266
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,980
an inchoate need for an act of supreme creation,

267
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,180
such as started things in the beginning of the world

268
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,580
when the sons of mourning threw down their spears

269
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,100
and sang and watered heaven with their tears

270
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,180
and took out the garbage.

271
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,700
But now we, the subgeniuses,

272
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:25,100
have provided the answer to what no one audibly asked for.

273
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,680
And that answer is Bob.

274
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,180
Thank you, Dr. Howell.

275
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,800
Amazing.

276
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,500
Thank you, thank you.

277
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,300
How does he do it?

278
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,960
Now we have a number of these to go through,

279
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,800
so let's keep going.

280
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,480
All right, this one says,

281
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,080
I heard there was a ladies' night.

282
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,920
How do I ladies' night?

283
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,300
How do I ladies' night?

284
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,820
Well, Reverend Stang, what night would that be,

285
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,800
that ladies' night?

286
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,120
What night that this person heard about?

287
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,820
This is Ask Dr. Howell, not Tell Reverend Stang.

288
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,940
Yes, but Reverend Stang is the author of all doctrinal matters and scheduling.

289
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,440
No, I'm just a clerk who writes things down,

290
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,760
because since Bob can't spell very well,

291
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,080
I have no idea myself what the answer to that question is.

292
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,540
The odd thing is that, you know,

293
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:22,940
this particular X-Day, where all ladies can come for free every night,

294
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,240
is ladies' night here.

295
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:33,380
So it would be quite fair to say that tonight is ladies' night,

296
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,740
and equally fair to say that tomorrow night is ladies' night.

297
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,100
But the morning after that, none can say.

298
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,040
But how do I ladies' night?

299
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,240
How do I ladies' night?

300
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,940
Let me count the ways.

301
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,560
You, first of all, must not be,

302
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,120
so unsuitable as to attract no ladies into your vicinity.

303
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,200
A sad, lonely, non-lady attempting to have a ladies' night

304
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,600
is a pitiable spectacle indeed.

305
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,620
No, you must not necessarily become a cross-dresser

306
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,200
or have any complicated surgical procedure.

307
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:20,000
There's no complicated machinery to buy.

308
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,660
You simply need the do-it yourself,

309
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,040
get up and go,

310
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,300
and gumption to ladies' night

311
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,680
until there is no more breath in your body

312
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,240
or willingness to keep trying.

313
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,460
Price Bob.

314
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,780
Here's another question.

315
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,320
I think I know where this came from.

316
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,920
Will there be Bill Clinton pencil sharpeners on the space saucers?

317
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,680
Goes in the mouth, yes.

318
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,020
There will be in one stateroom,

319
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,480
definitely, one stateroom will be wall to wall

320
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,220
undulating, rubbery, Bill Clinton mouth pencil sharpeners,

321
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,360
and on the excess saucer,

322
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:14,920
one of those Clinton faces will be the actual President Bill Clinton.

323
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
There to sharpen your pencil.

324
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,260
So the answer is yes,

325
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,120
but you must make sure that no one else takes the stateroom

326
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,800
which is reserved for you.

327
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,820
Oh, this is a good one.

328
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,780
How stupid do I have to get to be stupider than Bob,

329
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,440
and would that be a profitable endeavor?

330
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Well, it would only be a profitable endeavor

331
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,200
if you were as slackful as Bob.

332
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,460
Otherwise, stupidity is just another barrier added

333
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,380
in an almost impassable labyrinth,

334
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,020
which is sometimes a little bit more difficult.

335
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,880
Sometimes practically impassable.

336
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,560
But Bob, by surfing the luck plane,

337
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:05,000
is able to have good luck,

338
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,540
and therefore slack for himself.

339
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,020
This doesn't mean that people who intimately associated with Bob

340
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,540
had any good luck or slack on their own.

341
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,300
It may be that the presence of the world's most slackful person

342
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,300
draws all the ambient slack into itself.

343
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,020
So in that case,

344
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,340
you would be stupid to be hanging around Bob

345
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,260
and not voluntarily providing some slack

346
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,060
that will otherwise be leeched from you

347
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,100
by an osmotic process,

348
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,740
which may, as a matter of fact, turn out to be permanent.

349
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,340
Remember, Bob surfs the luck plane effortlessly.

350
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,740
That is part of his special nature.

351
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,220
We can only attempt to imitate him

352
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,760
by being little Bobs, each and every one of us,

353
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,380
and also surfing the luck plane.

354
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,200
But beware, because surfing,

355
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,620
you always wipe out every now and then.

356
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,480
It happens.

357
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,420
You tumble end over end,

358
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,560
you get scrunched on the gravel and sea urchins,

359
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,600
and the board may clobber you,

360
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,400
a shark may come along and take something.

361
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,560
But the point is,

362
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,720
as in the award-winning movie,

363
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,960
you have to get up and do it all over again.

364
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,140
Make the long, effortless surfing passages of luck

365
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:37,160
outnumber the inconvenient and inevitable wipeouts.

366
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,720
To do it the other way is,

367
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,820
well, in a word, stupid.

368
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,440
Now, this is, I think somebody may have meant this

369
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,600
as a trick question,

370
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,460
if so, I don't think you're going to trick Dr. Howe.

371
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,460
Oh, we get all sorts of trick questions,

372
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,100
and we're used to them, we welcome them.

373
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:03,460
Can Jesus create a ditch so big he couldn't jump across it?

374
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,920
Somebody out there's going,

375
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,440
Oh, well, anyway, let's have this tricky question.

376
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,780
What species of trilobite was most common

377
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,700
during the Triassic period?

378
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,560
Hmm.

379
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:22,000
Well, there were great numbers of these three-lobed,

380
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
uh, beings,

381
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,900
uh, right up until,

382
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,260
uh, the end of the Paleozoic,

383
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,180
but they're not, uh, known too much

384
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,700
from the Triassic period,

385
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,540
in my understanding.

386
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,480
Uh, nonetheless,

387
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,720
whichever ones may have survived,

388
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,620
which are not, uh, found as fossil forms,

389
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,120
were probably not the hardiest and biggest

390
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,920
and most brutal,

391
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,000


392
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,380
but, uh, in all likelihood,

393
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,140
the most inconspicuous,

394
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,660
who just dug in the, uh, seafloor

395
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,380
and hoped that it would all be over quickly.

396
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,840
Uh, here's one from, uh,

397
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,020
I'm assuming Little Johnny, age six.

398
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,680
Why is it raining?

399
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,020
Well, Johnny,

400
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,720
it can't be sunny all the time,

401
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,640
because then the sun would

402
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,380
scorch the earth,

403
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,920
which would pant and supplicate

404
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,780
the heavens for relief.

405
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,100
Too much solar radiation

406
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,780
is not good for the fallow ground.

407
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,340
Fortunately, there is an atmospheric, uh, phenomenon.

408
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:42,860
When, uh, the actinic rays of the sun

409
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,120
touch the upper atmosphere,

410
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,460
ozone is created

411
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,900
in the upper atmosphere, a protective layer,

412
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,500
keeping many of the bad rays

413
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,500
and emanations from outer space

414
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,600
from harming kids like you, Johnny,

415
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,680
although they would like to very much.

416
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,840
But why does it rain?

417
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,660
Uh, it is obviously necessary

418
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,540
that it does rain.

419
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,920
Is that sufficient to answer the question?

420
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,300
Otherwise, it has to be said

421
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,880
that here on moist and squashy planet Earth,

422
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,280
the water in the atmosphere

423
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,960
is sometimes high and sometimes low,

424
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,300
sometimes shrouding the mountaintops in clouds

425
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,800
and sometimes flowing in valleys,

426
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,200
in streams, freshets, and waterfalls.

427
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,540
But it exists as a constant.

428
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,140
Water must, uh, flow,

429
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,780
or else it becomes vaporous,

430
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,740
gaseous, and ascends once again to the heaven.

431
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,560
When the waters stop,

432
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,060
it's going to stop flowing,

433
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,480
it's going to stop raining.

434
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,940
And by the way,

435
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,380
how fortunate we are here on our planet

436
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,600
to have had for so long

437
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,840
a huge, leering, giant moon

438
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,580
to take our waters and our tides

439
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,640
and pull them around

440
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,300
and keep the aqueous element of Earth

441
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,060
in constant motion.

442
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,360
Otherwise, we would be,

443
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,860
if we were here at all,

444
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,740
on planet Mudball,

445
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,840
a most uninteresting place by comparison.

446
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,240
Well, we must be on a roll here

447
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,840
because the next question, uh,

448
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,960
that I pulled out of the hat just by coincidence is,

449
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,400
what is Bob weather?

450
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,660
What is Bob weather?

451
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,080
Well, it's, uh, the weather in which

452
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,720
Bob's friends and communicants gather together.

453
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,500
Often it takes a touch of rain in the air

454
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,720
to bring them all here together.

455
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,360
So that they can gather in one inadvertent clench

456
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,820
under a roof,

457
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,560
free from being pelted

458
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,340
by the elements of storm and rain.

459
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,720
In a sense, weather which brings,

460
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,760
which compels subgeniuses together

461
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,820
is better Bob weather

462
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,700
than happy-go-lucky sunny days

463
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,360
of chuckle-headed innocence, uh,

464
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,960
and stupidity.

465
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:22,320
Yes, uh, the necessity of doing something,

466
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,340
finding shelter, and finding others

467
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,540
is promoted by the best type of weather

468
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,040
which may be called Bob weather.

469
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,420
Praise Bob weather!

470
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,160
Now here's a question that, um,

471
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,360
I have a sad answer to,

472
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,940
but I'm not going to impart it.

473
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,740
So I'll let you answer it.

474
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,060
All right.

475
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,200
The question is,

476
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,320
what is a lavalier?

477
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,920
What is a lavalier?

478
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,320
Hmm, didn't we have this one before?

479
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,680
Uh, well...

480
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,440
Well, time control gone out of control.

481
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,860
Yes, I suppose so.

482
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,760
Well, occasionally from the...

483
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,440
That's a five dollar question, by the way.

484
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,360
Oh, all right.

485
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,220
Well, in that case, I will, uh,

486
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,480
give the short answer and, uh, an involved, uh,

487
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,120
presentation.

488
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,320
So the short answer.

489
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,840
Uh, occasionally when the molten magma

490
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,860
of the underground escapes, uh,

491
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,000
through cracks or fissures into the upper part

492
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,640
of, uh, the geological column,

493
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,980
and in volcanic eruptions,

494
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,460
the, uh, lava, molten rock, uh,

495
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,980
issuing from its point of origin

496
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,240
can cool enough to take on form.

497
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,920
And these, uh, short answers, uh,

498
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,860
sharp lava rocks and forms

499
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,040
are often strangely evocative.

500
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,180
Of course, there is something in the human, uh,

501
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,240
mind, hardwired, I suppose,

502
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,480
that tends to see faces in things.

503
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,720
Like in the bathroom late at night,

504
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,540
you suddenly see faces looking out of the towel there.

505
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,160
Well, so it can be.

506
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,460
So it can be with the productions of inner Earth.

507
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,680
And, uh, I'll tell you, uh,

508
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,120
some of these faces can leer

509
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:21,440
or look in an unwholesome way upon you.

510
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,720
This, then, I decree to be a lava leer.

511
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,560
Also, it's a kind of lamp.

512
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,960
And now...

513
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,560
Uh...

514
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,020
Uh, unless you have something to add, Stang,

515
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,000
I'll do the rest of the question.

516
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,580
I was, uh, looking for a lava leer microphone to display.

517
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,860
It failed me yesterday.

518
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,920
But for some reason you couldn't find it, eh?

519
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,840
It's just as well. I shouldn't...

520
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,660
I shouldn't mess with it.

521
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:50,660
It, uh, ruined a perfectly good one-hour-long shot

522
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,760
that I worked really hard to get.

523
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,680
Oh, that's terrible.

524
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,520
No more lava leers on my iPhone for me.

525
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,780
It may turn up, at any rate.

526
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,260
What, the soundtrack that's missing?

527
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,280
Oh, no, the lava leer microphone.

528
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,600
Right. No, I don't care about the microphone.

529
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,180
I just wish I had the...

530
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,560
what the microphone was supposed to be.

531
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,540
Turn the, uh, turn the music down a little,

532
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,780
and I will do this.

533
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,440
Oh.

534
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,600
Now, Plato, uh, spoke of a great, uh, country,

535
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,720
or continent.

536
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,020
Actually, it was an archipelago

537
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,600
beyond the Pillars of Hercules,

538
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,340
which sank, not overnight,

539
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,740
but, uh, eventually was entirely gone.

540
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,480
First, uh, an archipelago, then fewer islands,

541
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,440
and then the main island, part of it subsided.

542
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,640
The capital moved to that final island,

543
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,480
which Plato called Atlantis.

544
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,320
But...

545
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,180
But its residents called it Poseidonus.

546
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,240
It was sacred to the god Poseidon,

547
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,360
the god of the oceans and the god of thunder and earthquakes.

548
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:59,040
And this is of an Atlantean god,

549
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,420
not even a major one,

550
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,520
the god Ugabalus.

551
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,900
In below, lost Poseidonus,

552
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,160
I was the god Ugabalus.

553
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,000
My three horns were of similor

554
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,180
above my double diadem.

555
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,780
My one eye was a moon-wan gem

556
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,060
found in a monstrous meteor.

557
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,420
Incredible far peoples came,

558
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,940
called by the thunders of my fame,

559
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,320
and fleetly passed my terraced throne,

560
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,860
where titan pards and lions stood

561
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,680
as pours a never-lapsing flood,

562
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,240
before the wind of winter blown.

563
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,880
Before me, many a chorister

564
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,420
made offering of alien, myrrh,

565
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,660
and copper-bearded sailors,

566
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,480
brought from isles of ever-foaming seas,

567
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,720
enormous lumps of amber grease,

568
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,420
and corals intricately wrought.

569
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,820
Below my glooming architraves,

570
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,660
one brown eternal light,

571
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,240
a final file of slaves,

572
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,020
came in from mines of Chalcedon,

573
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,640
and camels from the long plateaus

574
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,700
set down their sard and peridots,

575
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,720
their incense and their cinnamon.

576
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,980
But now within my sunken walls

577
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:36,280
the slow blind ocean serpent crawls,

578
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,440
and sea-worms are my ministers,

579
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,860
and wandering fishes pass me now,

580
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,800
or press before mine eyeless brow

581
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,640
as once the thronging worshippers.

582
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,980
Thank you for your question.

583
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,780
Oh, he got it!

584
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,600
You just made that up off the top of your head.

585
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,220
Oh, I'm sorry.

586
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,540
Clark Ashton Smith is the author.

587
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:06,920
Oh.

588
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,360
Um...

589
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,620
Here's a one dollar question

590
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,360
that is lettered so professionally

591
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,400
I can hold it up and everyone can see.

592
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,360
Wow, beautiful!

593
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,360
Look at that shadow lettering.

594
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,040
Isn't that great?

595
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,080
How come,

596
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,720
cum being spelled C-U-M,

597
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,080
How come?

598
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,360
That is short and parsimonious.

599
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,140
How come?

600
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,360
Some genius want cum.

601
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,400
Didn't have full length to write full letter,

602
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,820
but no doubt does better in private.

603
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,760
So,

604
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,280
uh,

605
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,640
the answer,

606
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,080
how cum is easily answered.

607
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,240
Cause.

608
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,160
I'd buy that for a dollar.

609
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,340
Oh, here's another five dollar one.

610
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,440
Five bucks?

611
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,660
All right, thank you.

612
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,180
We will accept it.

613
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,560
Well, good one for five bucks.

614
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,920
What is, quote,

615
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,820
the best poem, unquote?

616
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,520
The best poem.

617
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,620
Uh, the best poem is appropriate for,

618
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,540
the what moment.

619
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,020
Some poems are inappropriate for the moment.

620
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:12,440


621
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:13,540
uh,

622
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,800
some poems are nomic.

623
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,580
They contain advice.

624
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,080
Uh, they contain sayings and aphorisms.

625
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,020
They're usually liked by little old ladies.

626
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:29,700
They're the poems of Prudence Strong and Ella Wheeler Wilcox and so forth.

627
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,060
Uh,

628
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,620
others are just rants,

629
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:32,540
uh,

630
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,160
by people who feel they have received insufficient,

631
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,180
uh,

632
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,300
insufficient attention.

633
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,520
But,

634
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,560
the best poem is one which simply has to be born.

635
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,860
And then,

636
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,580
is.

637
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,380
Which seems to take on a life of its own,

638
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,540
particularly when other people pick it up.

639
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,100
But some of the admonitory ones,

640
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,220
and even some of the fooling around ones,

641
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,840
are also worthy of attention,

642
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,920
and may ultimately emerge as among the best.

643
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,500
Oh, you got.

644
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,260
Boing.

645
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,140
Boing, boing.

646
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,700
Here's a two dollar question.

647
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,380
Which is better?

648
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:13,800
Boing,

649
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,920
or boing,

650
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,460
and whys?

651
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,460
Why,

652
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,480
with an S at the end.

653
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:21,880
Whys.

654
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,460
W-H-Y-S.

655
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,960
And the various whys.

656
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,020
There's more than one why in the question,

657
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,020
or syllogism.

658
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,660
Which is better,

659
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,660
boing,

660
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,400
or boing,

661
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:31,740
or boing,

662
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:31,900
or boing,

663
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,100
or boing,

664
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,100


665
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:32,460
or boing,

666
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,560
or boing,

667
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,240
or boing,

668
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,480
or boing,

669
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:35,480


670
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:35,480


671
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:35,480


672
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:35,480


673
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:35,480


674
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,020
or boing,

675
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,740
or boing,

676
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:52,740


677
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,800
So in essence,

678
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:57,340
when an admonition fails for simplicity,

679
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,960
people would expect to have a lot ofונ

680
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:58,960


681
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,020
and much upper紛

682
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,480
anybody's

683
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:16,000
But there is a vibration on top of a vibration, and that is what produces the boing sound, an extended boing.

684
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:27,640
It's not the boing of a spring, but the boing of vibration itself in the air, dwindling and dying away.

685
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,660
And so, which suits the mood better?

686
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:46,260
The expression of swiftness and movement, or the tintinabulation of sound, dropping, passing, musically away?

687
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:55,780
It is the difference between direct action and the aesthetic pleasure one takes in one's environment.

688
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:00,960
The push and the pull, the figure and the ground.

689
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,480
Which one is better?

690
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,760
Depends upon where you are and who you are.

691
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,660
Well, well, well.

692
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:22,180
If only we had the Feast of the Vampire Leprechauns radio play, which we were making years ago,

693
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:32,100
when Puzzling Evidence said he would transfer the material onto tapes and took it,

694
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,580
and never gave it back.

695
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:39,380
Twenty years ago, all the work we did, it's in his maze of tapes and so on.

696
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,340
Every time a vampire leprechaun lept on someone, there would be a boing sound effect,

697
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,420
and it was painful and lengthy to add these to the mix.

698
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:56,500
But perhaps someday it shall emerge in some form among his dusty chest of reel-to-reel tapes.

699
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,660
How can music be employed in the art of...

700
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,380
Mind Control?

701
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,940
How can music be employed in the art of mind control?

702
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,060
Some people would say the CIA worked on that hard.

703
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:20,420
Well, first of all, our bullying army plays obnoxious music when it's surrounding people.

704
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,780
That's now part of their bag of tricks.

705
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:30,920
And getting people to give up is a brutal form of mind control, but it is a form of mind control.

706
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,940
But otherwise...

707
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:37,420
Otherwise, the soul, through its mind and its ears, seeks harmony.

708
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:46,460
And once it has it, it is inclined to relax a little bit, and not be so much upon its guard.

709
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,780
Of course, it must be calculated for an individual taste.

710
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,000
Not every soul responds in the same way.

711
00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:01,060
This is why for mass crowd control, this has never proved...

712
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,020
...exceptionally efficacious.

713
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:12,160
But I recommend all short story reading fans to a story called The Supremacy of Uruguay.

714
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,320
Do you know it, Stan?

715
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:14,920
No.

716
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,280
By E.B. White, I think.

717
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:26,800
When, to describe it very quickly, the Uruguayan ambassador in New York is in a crowd...

718
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,440
...and there's some singer outside with a microphone singing some stupid love song...

719
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:31,920
...and the crowd...

720
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:36,700
...is swaying back and forth, and he's caught in it, and he comes out of it, and he realizes...

721
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:43,380
...while that was happening, I kind of lost my mind, and I would have done anything anyone suggested.

722
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,960
So he hurried back to Uruguay, and that nation was soon equipped with a fleet of airplanes...

723
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:55,980
...with giant loudspeakers, which flew over the other countries with giant amplified versions...

724
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,920
...of the stupid sound of the loud singer.

725
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,020
Thanks for...

726
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,740
...unforgettable nights I never can replace, and so forth.

727
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,400
And pretty soon, everyone was absolutely crazy.

728
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,200
At the moment, the planes passed over.

729
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:19,460
And Uruguay moved in, but the conquest was not fun, because all of the idiots swaying back and forth...

730
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,380
...to the lounge music they could only hear were supremely happy...

731
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:29,920
...and didn't even come out and try to fight the Uruguayans with some quaint, easily defeated maneuvers.

732
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,220
...and they were not even able to get out of the lounge.

733
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,280
I hope that answers your question.

734
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:42,760
I thought it was that the CIA invented the Beatles and Frank Zappa, and that was to mind-control the kids.

735
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,140
Well, that's because the Beatles announced that they were agnostics. Agnostics!

736
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:54,620
Well, here's another... well, oh no. I was going to say it was music-related, not necessarily.

737
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,100
Dr. Howell, and look at this letter in here.

738
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,080
Beautiful letter.

739
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,660
Came with two dollars.

740
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,000
Dr. Howell, what is your...

741
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,960
...favorite frequency in the electromagnetic spectrum?

742
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,220
And the word electromagnetic actually has little sparks coming off of it.

743
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,820
Hmm. Well...

744
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,860
Favorite frequency.

745
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:19,720
Would you say about 60 hertz, Stang, would be a good one, you know?

746
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,980
It hurts me sometimes.

747
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,020
It's that 60-cycle hum.

748
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:30,580
Sometimes we don't care to hear that hum, because it means not all is well in our snake-like nests.

749
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,380
It's the nests of cables and electronic gadgets.

750
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:42,900
But on the other hand, it has been shown to soothe the savage beast, prisoners and others with too much time on their hands.

751
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,300
It's almost akin to the principle of white noise.

752
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,940
So I'd put it down at 60 hertz.

753
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,900
I have a filter to get rid of those 60 hertz doses. It doesn't work very well.

754
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,980
Was this a single submission here?

755
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:00,400
No.

756
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,140
Those are two different two-dollar ones.

757
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,040
Okay. You're spared the recitation.

758
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,940
Here is a question. Is Wilfred Brimley still alive?

759
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:10,620
No.

760
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,100
Wilfred.

761
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,320
Yes, Wilfred Brimley. Everybody's favorite old geezer.

762
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,920
I think he was contaminated by investigating the thing in the Antarctic, wasn't he?

763
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,980
So I don't believe he is still alive.

764
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,380
But everyone remembers his emotionally freighted dissection.

765
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:35,160
The thing was a wonderful piece of cinema acting.

766
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:43,380
Which immediately absolves him from all those cute grandpa parts he played in other movies.

767
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,300
Praise Wilfred.

768
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:56,100
You mentioned Wilfred at a previous Ex Day when I talked about learning to ride your bicycle.

769
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,240
Perhaps you don't remember the occasion.

770
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,840
Perhaps I don't.

771
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,060
Well, it's all recorded.

772
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,020
Here's a one-dollar question. What is Dr. Hal?

773
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:16,460
Dr. Hal is a stage name and presence invented by Chicken John Rinaldi in 1998

774
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:24,800
at the Burning Man Arts Festival where he created an installation,

775
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,540
which was actually the start of all these shows.

776
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,680
Since then, I...

777
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,060
Dr. Hal and I have been doing them.

778
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,120
That year, I...

779
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,420
Some of us here have been to Burning Man and have seen it.

780
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:43,620
Along the Esplanade, which is the inner street before the great open area

781
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,800
that contains the Colossus of the Burning Man itself,

782
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:56,860
there are often many beautiful attractions, buildings, cathedrals, mosques, temples, things set up.

783
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,860
There was a tree with...

784
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:58,940
The trees were...

785
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:04,240
Flames came out of the end of the branches by night and water by day,

786
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:06,700
and people walked around underneath it getting wet.

787
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,600
There was a mosque with shining, glowing domes.

788
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:11,820
Yes.

789
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:18,680
Everything was lovely on the Esplanade except what Chicken built, which was the ugliest eyesore.

790
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:27,020
You can imagine a huge, horrible, gigantic pair of sagging buttocks with hairs and bandages and pimples.

791
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,000
Furthermore...

792
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,320
ridiculous...

793
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,660
It fell down several times during construction

794
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,900
and got even more ugly-looking before it was put up.

795
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,020
Inside this they put me, Dr. Howland Owl,

796
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:42,000
and I, the Wizard of Ass, would answer their questions

797
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,760
once they were impelled to walk along the yellow brick road up to it

798
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,160
and be hectored for a while by chicken.

799
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,320
Then, when I answered, a bass rumbling would come out of the machine

800
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,820
and sheets of fire would shoot up from the ground

801
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:03,520
and a long blast of blue flame would shoot out from between the fesses or cheeks.

802
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,360
And this, despite its ugliness that we were all ashamed of,

803
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,840
except Chicken, who didn't care,

804
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,160
this was an incredible success.

805
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:18,280
And from then on, we've done a less spectacular version of the show,

806
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,960
but we brought in more people and we have more gags,

807
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,320
we have all sorts of stuff going on.

808
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,640
Incidentally, they said,

809
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,580
set it on fire with me inside it against all the rules of Burning Man.

810
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,260
But I got out, as you can see.

811
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,540
And then they came and said,

812
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,440
you're not supposed to burn things unauthorized.

813
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,960
And he said, yeah, yeah, what can you do?

814
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,860
People are supposed to be 300 feet back from anything that's set on fire.

815
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,680
And he said, well, we're 300 chicken feet back from it.

816
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,760
So, do you have another one?

817
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,760
Yeah, yeah.

818
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,540
And this is a pretty,

819
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,080
good question.

820
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,180
In fact, it has two question marks at the end.

821
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,680
What does Bob need our money for?

822
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:09,380
Bob needs people who are willing to give money.

823
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,820
Yes, just as I, Dr. Howland Owl,

824
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,780
need questions that are sponsored with money.

825
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:19,260
Otherwise, I fear that they are not important to you.

826
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,260
If you pay for them and how much you pay for them,

827
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,380
signifies that they are of some significance to you.

828
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:32,200
And stimulate me to spend more time and effort in answering them.

829
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,700
Bob, of course, spends no effort on anything.

830
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:41,420
But he doesn't want people to think that his church is worthless

831
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:45,440
and easy to acquire for a song,

832
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:50,320
but rather something that is like the tchotchkes he used to sell

833
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,800
on his original sales route,

834
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,800
something that he could get people to want.

835
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,860
Thank you.

836
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,700
Here's a question.

837
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:06,640
This one is signed by the person asking,

838
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,560
what is so infra about infrared?

839
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,580
And this is signed, Reverend Crimsoniculus.

840
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,920
So I can see why Reverend Crimsoniculus

841
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,380
might want to know about infrared.

842
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,480
Yes, he wants to go farther than the usual red

843
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:25,980
to be perhaps the king crimson, eh?

844
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,520
Yes.

845
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:26,800
Yes.

846
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:27,760
Towering.

847
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,520
Dr. Dark isn't here.

848
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:38,220
So human eyes can see a wonderful range of the spectrum,

849
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,700
but they can't see everything.

850
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,780
And certain other creatures in the continuum have us outclassed,

851
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:48,400
like the giant squid, Architeuthis dux,

852
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,060
which can see into the infrared and ultraviolet.

853
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:56,420
So can the colossal squid, certain types of octopi,

854
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,000
and many other species?

855
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,000


856
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,520
While most spiders have poor vision

857
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,200
and their eyes are unfocused light spots,

858
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,140
the salticidae, or jumping spiders,

859
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:10,080
have excellent vision, which is binocular and triangulated.

860
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:10,620
And why not?

861
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,160
They have to jump on their prey,

862
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,100
so they have to know where it is.

863
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,800
They, it is said, have one of the clearest focuses

864
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,880
in the animal kingdom.

865
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,520
But do we need to see the infrared?

866
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,520
We haven't until now.

867
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,860
But if we leave our own planet and get into circumstances

868
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:37,480
where it is of vital importance to detect epiphenomena,

869
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:42,000
which may have some bearing on our lives or their remainder,

870
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,460
we will either use extrasomatic methods, as we do today,

871
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,040
or inculcate them ourselves, not even voluntarily,

872
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,300
but through an evolutionary path.

873
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,140
Or,

874
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,740
extended by perverted science,

875
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,420
we will give evolution a helping hand.

876
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,780
And this is the last one in the...

877
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,340
The last question.

878
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,440
And I wasn't pre-sorting these.

879
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,280
This is a good last question for the last X-Day.

880
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:17,880
Okay.

881
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,040
It's part question, part exclamation.

882
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,540
Okay, sure.

883
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,940
This time,

884
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:24,700
for sure?

885
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,240
Yes!

886
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,260
This time, for sure!

887
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,520
This time, for sure?

888
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,820
Why, sure?

889
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,580
For sure, this time.

890
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,660
Yes, sure, this time, for sure.

891
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,340
Sure, you can be of this time.

892
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,680
As sure as any time.

893
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:43,820
As other times.

894
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,000
The other times are gone.

895
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,860
But we have this one left to burn.

896
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:53,040
Yes, this time, you can be a sure of.

897
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:59,600
And let's hope that the right event takes place during that gift of time.

898
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:04,240
You're waiting, and I am also waiting.

899
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:09,540
I await the answer as easily as you to that one.

900
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:14,300
But as for the time, sure, it is given unto us.

901
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:17,280
To you and to me.

902
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,040
I will close with the final recitation.

903
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,340
And thanks very much for Ask Dr. Howell.

904
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:33,080
Don't forget that the Bulldada auction will swiftly follow like the wings of the curse of ancient Egypt.

905
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:39,500
And now, the final recitation is a poem called Buick.

906
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,200
Did I credit that last one, by the way?

907
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,480
I can't even remember what the last one was.

908
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:49,220
I tend to forget them as soon as I say them, so I don't know what it was.

909
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:49,760
I think you did.

910
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,680
I did, good.

911
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,480
Okay, well, now this poem I'll pre-credit.

912
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,060
It's by Carl Shapiro, an American poet.

913
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:01,780
And he was so delighted when he got, he started making some money,

914
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,380
and he got his brand new car.

915
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,660
He got a brand new blue Buick.

916
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:16,760
And in those days, the 1950s, cars seemed to have a big face on the front.

917
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,020
A big grill.

918
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,080
They seemed to be grinning.

919
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,840
And those Buicks had a row of holes along the side.

920
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,380
Perhaps some of you remember them.

921
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:37,920
Those little holes, they were called by Detroit, cruiser line venti ports, if that has any significance.

922
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:44,660
So, let me quickly end this by the poem Buick by Carl Shapiro.

923
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,000
As a sleuth, I was a slave.

924
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,000


925
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,820
A sloop with a sweep of immaculate wing on her delicate spine.

926
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:58,300
And a keel as steel as a root which holds in the sea as she leans.

927
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,220
Leaning and laughing, my warm-hearted beauty.

928
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,660
You ride, you ride.

929
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
You tack on the curves with parabola speed.

930
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,320
And a kiss of goodbye.

931
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:16,800
As a thoroughbred sloop, my new high-spirited spirit, my kiss.

932
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,780
As my foot suggests that you leap in the air with your hips of a girl.

933
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,940
My finger that praises your wheel and announces your voices of song.

934
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,080
Flouncing your skirts, you blueness of joy.

935
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,380
You flirt of politeness.

936
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,420
You leap, you intelligence.

937
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,420
Essence of wheelness with silvery nose.

938
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,640
And your platinum clocks of excitement.

939
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,980
Stir like the hairs of a fox.

940
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,240
And your fern.

941
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:55,080
But how alien you are from the booming belts of your birth.

942
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,600
And the smoke when you turned on the stinging lathes of Detroit.

943
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,840
And Lansing at night.

944
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,480
And shrieked at the torch in your secret parts.

945
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,640
And the amorous tests.

946
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:13,060
But now with your eyes that enter the futures of roads you forget.

947
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,060
You are all instinct.

948
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,400
With your phosphorus glow.

949
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,920
And your streaking hair.

950
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:26,080
And now that we stop, it is not as the bird from the shell that I leave.

951
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:32,200
Or the leathery pilot who steps from his bird with a sneer of delight.

952
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:39,280
And not as the ignorant beast do you squat and watch me depart.

953
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,660
But with exquisite breathing you smile.

954
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,860
With satisfaction of love.

955
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:55,660
And I touch you again as you tick in the silence and settle in sleep.

956
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,800
Thank you.

957
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,840
There's a man who stands ten thousand feet tall.

958
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:37,060
In suits made of the finest materials from beyond the stars.

959
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:43,640
He has a wooden pipe emitting from a grin of the sharpest teeth you've ever seen.

960
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,640
And inside of it burns the souls of the damned.

961
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:59,280
He lumbers at you seeking out for the little bits of pocket lint and change that you have.

962
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:10,840
And when he comes around the corner to greet you, you better hope that you're on his side.

963
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:15,620
Cause buddy, you'll be going down.

964
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,880
Bob! He's such a badass!

965
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:36,940
I really wish he could show me how to be strong and macho like him.

966
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:40,140
I wish he could teach me how to finish my vegetables.

967
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,680
And how to do my laundry without getting those little spots underneath the collar.

968
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:49,720
I wish that my socks wouldn't stand up straight after just one day of wearing them.

969
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,140
You know, I gotta get these stains off of my bed sheets.

970
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,840
Maybe Bob could teach me how to do that too.

971
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,360
Maybe Bob can help me quit smoking.

972
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,520
Or start smoking.

973
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,000
Or finish drinking.

974
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,400
Or begin drinking.

975
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:07,340
Maybe Bob can open up new doorways to dimensions that we can't even perceive.

976
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:10,820
An eternal void of slack that we are living on.

977
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,180
Now on a mudball planet called Earth.

978
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:21,420
In a conspiracy year far off of a calendar that can even be believed by anybody on this planet for more than one moment.

979
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:29,640
Astounds me that anyone is willing to believe that what is happening right now is not true.

980
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,420
These are the facts.

981
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,960
These are your missions that you must adhere to.

982
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,840
The book of the subgenius is your guide.

983
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,960
Staple it to your hip and never leave home without it.

984
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,380
Pamphlets, they're still only one dollar.

985
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:52,400
You can trade it with your friends that you watch bug porn with.

986
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,320
You can trade it with your friends that you still prop from.

987
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:03,600
You can trade it with people who don't have anything else to give.

988
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:06,700
Bob.

989
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,940
He's got divine powers or some shit.

990
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:12,820
I don't know.

991
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,140
I never met the guy.

992
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:19,640
I just keep getting told about how much better it's going to be.

993
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,900
Don't worry Reverend Fox.

994
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,520
Bob won't let you down again.

995
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:35,360
You won't have to keep driving across the country to meet a bunch of weirdos on a parking lot full of naked freaks for a week.

996
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:40,880
You won't have to endure any of those beautiful drugs.

997
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:46,160
You won't have to be harassed by any of those wonderful uber-femmes.

998
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,800
You won't have to put up with it anymore.

999
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:52,060
No, we'll take all of it away for you Reverend Fox.

1000
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:58,880
We'll take it away from you if you come do what we want you to do.

1001
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,520
You know it wasn't very long ago.

1002
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:09,480
That I had a job.

1003
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,040
We know what those are.

1004
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:21,280
That time of the day that you have to spend in between doing what you want to be doing and doing what you want to be doing.

1005
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,660
Jobs are just a way that the conspiracy is trying to fool you.

1006
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:35,340
That you have to put in some sort of effort before you're allowed to take anything away.

1007
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,320
But they keep taking.

1008
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,480
And taking.

1009
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,460
And they say to me, Reverend Fox.

1010
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:50,260
We think that you're a pretty nice guy, but you know.

1011
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,280
You could just do a little bit better.

1012
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,340
I wish that we could clone you.

1013
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,560
So we could have more workers like you.

1014
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,320
So what we'd like to do is to take you to the police station.

1015
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:05,320


1016
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:05,320


1017
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,460
And what we'd like to do is give you an opportunity.

1018
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:17,100
We're going to have you do more work for the same amount of money.

1019
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,120
And I said, gee, I don't know.

1020
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,460
That doesn't sound like such a great opportunity.

1021
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,000
And I swear to Bob Dobbs himself that day.

1022
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,940
The people of this corporation handed me information.

1023
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:44,800
That I could use to obtain psychological counseling.

1024
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,700
Take these pills, Reverend Fox.

1025
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:55,560
They'll make it all so much easier.

1026
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,200
You can come to work every day.

1027
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:04,580
And everything will be fine.

1028
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:11,540
You won't worry about waiting until Friday to wear your Bob t-shirts.

1029
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,360
You won't have to worry about not getting that last donut from the tray.

1030
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:23,880
You won't have to worry about giving up everything that you have for us.

1031
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,440
And that's when I told them.

1032
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,880
That's when I told them.

1033
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:46,200
The two most sacred words any subgenius lips can utter.

1034
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:54,780
I quit.

1035
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,260
And I left.

1036
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,360
And I'm still gone.

1037
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,780
And now I'm at X Day.

1038
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,580
With you.

1039
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:22,060
You lucky, lucky subgeniuses you.

1040
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:30,420
No one's going to have a job Tuesday night.

1041
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:30,420


1042
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:30,420


1043
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:33,420
No one.

1044
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,420
No one.

1045
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,580
Praise Bob!

1046
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:04,260
Praise Bob!

1047
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,340
Praise Bob!

1048
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:14,360
Praise Bob!

1049
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:35,140
In both of those 19X Day rants by Reverend Argus Fox of Hypercube,

1050
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:41,400
the guitar was by Reverend Angry Larry and it was Lord Rock God on Drums.

1051
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:49,620
For free information, see www.subgenius.com.

1052
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,760
Praise Bob!

1053
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,020
Oh, yes, I almost forgot.

1054
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:57,540
Uh...friends.

1055
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:02,420
Friends, are you a subgenius minister yet?

1056
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,220
Have you joined the Church of the Subgenius?

1057
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:16,560
And by that I mean actually sent in your $35 payable by PayPal or credit card on subgenius.com

1058
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:21,020
where it says become an ordained minister or where it says stores.

1059
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:28,400
And even if you have, do you have your well-made Bob t-shirt from anticonformity.com?

1060
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:32,400
Do you have your Arise DVD?

1061
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:39,160
Sure, you can watch it on the internet, but it's not the same.

1062
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,560
And it isn't the same.

1063
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:47,640
It hasn't been kissed by the lips of Princess Wee who kisses every copy of Arise that goes out.

1064
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,320
And I sign every copy of Book of the Subgenius.

1065
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,300
How about that?

1066
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,060
You can still get those from us.

1067
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:58,100
But yes, the $35 for the minister's pack, you really ought to think about it, folks.

1068
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:07,800
You don't have to meet any subgeniuses ever, but you will have that option.

1069
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,240
You can't come to X Day unless you're a member.

1070
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:18,960
You can't go to the members only kind of smarty pants internet forum called Scrub Genius.

1071
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:24,360
I do a lot more there than on Facebook.

1072
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,800
Because Facebook is just a bunch of gimme bobs.

1073
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,480
People who can't even spell Bob's name right.

1074
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:29,660
Do you know that Princess Wee?

1075
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,560
They can't even spell Bob's name right half of them.

1076
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,420
They leave off the quotes.

1077
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,980
Oh yeah, gimme bobs.

1078
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:37,540
You can tell.

1079
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,500
It's so easy to tell.

1080
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:47,360
Anyway, friends, we'll be back next week with more X Day recordings and hopefully with the lonesome cowboy.

1081
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,400
Hopefully he won't be lonesome next week.

1082
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:50,300
I'll see you next week.

1083
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:50,300


1084
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:50,300


1085
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,980
I'll see you next week.

1086
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,340
And we'll see you next time.

1087
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:58,780
Good night, and praise Bob.

1088
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:00,880
YAYAYAYAYA!
