1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
And here's a funny thought.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:11,580
In the past he's been called the prophet of gloom and doom, the troubadour of trouble, the disciple of despair.

3
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,660
All real Americans love the sting of...

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,300
...bog doves!

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,180
...natural fluids.

6
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,220
Hello?

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,740
My destiny.

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,680
What?

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,500
You're doing this for the government?

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,400
Yes.

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,020
What? Why?

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Because of the United States government.

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,940
And their unyielding commitment to the cause of liberty.

14
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,880
Oh no!

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,900
The preceding program was brought to you by Bob.

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:11,200
Your FBI hopes through this series of programs to enlist each of you as a volunteer in the army of women engaging in serious crimes like murder, robbery and...

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,280
The Self Genius Power of Swag.

18
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:27,360
Neither your FBI nor any local law enforcement agency can prevent those parasites from attempting to get easy money from you, the decent citizen.

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,080
Only you can do that.

20
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,600
Do it by always following Bob.

21
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,520
But that trick never worked!

22
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,100
There's a real problem here.

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,260
Political leaders have got to stop hiding brass tacks outside of the box.

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,620
And in fact, there's a real problem here.

25
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,180
Political leaders have got to stop hiding outside of the box.

26
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,240
In short, bureaucrats and diplomats can't take it further.

27
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,980
In short, there's a real problem here.

28
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,260
Political leaders have got to stop the box.

29
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:58,480
In short, there's a real problem here.

30
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:58,480


31
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:07,140
May it please the court, I would like to put on a dark wig, go to the Fidelity Bank, and try to get into Tom Gilrain's safe deposit box.

32
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,180
Objection. The witness is stating an opinion.

33
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,240
Sustained.

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,160
The Fidelity Bank

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,640
The Fidelity Bank

36
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,440
The Fidelity Bank

37
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,040
The Fidelity Bank

38
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,380
The Fidelity Bank

39
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:19,660
The Fidelity Bank

40
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,480
The Fidelity Bank

41
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:22,480


42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:22,480


43
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,400
The Fidelity Bank

44
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,860
The Fidelity Bank

45
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,020
Liars!

46
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,760
Liars!

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,060
The Fidelity Bank

48
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,680
The Fidelity Bank

49
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,260
The Fidelity Bank

50
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,380
The Fidelity Bank

51
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,600
Liars!

52
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,900
Liars!

53
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,220
Liars!

54
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,520
The Fidelity Bank

55
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:47,520


56
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,080
Lost switch.

57
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,320
The Fidelity Bank

58
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:50,320


59
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,160
Joel Johnson

60
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,160


61
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
This is Trustees.

62
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,860
19 Wear, New Hall of Fame.

63
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,440
Haven't you noticed the way he's been behaving?

64
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,000
Honey, didn't you notice?

65
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,280
Well, dear, I've always had sort of a way with potatoes.

66
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,260
You know something?

67
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,160
You're sickening.

68
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,420
Oh, is that so?

69
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,160
Yeah.

70
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:06,900
Okay.

71
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:07,660
June?

72
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,500
Yes.

73
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,280
Oh.

74
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,320
Yeah, I suppose so.

75
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,600
As if you didn't know.

76
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,200
Good night, Wally.

77
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,140
Good night, dear.

78
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,480
Well, good night, Wally.

79
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,100
Ah, baloney.

80
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,140
Don't try to kid me.

81
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,660
Besides his own exaggerated human nature and the powers granted him by Jehovah One,

82
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,800
Bob also benefits from being the chosen broker on Earth for superior beings

83
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,420
from the furthest reaches of known space,

84
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,360
the so-called men from Planet X, or X-ists,

85
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,980
for they are nothing like men.

86
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,960
Bob has a covenant with these angelic beings,

87
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,160
a cosmic contract, a deal.

88
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,460
On July 5th, 1998, at 7 a.m.,

89
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,000
the X-ists shall make a mass landing on this planet.

90
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,260
The children of Bob shall be rewarded at this foretold rupture,

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,660
this day of judgment,

92
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,660
when all those who paid their church dues

93
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,820
will be lifted up in power,

94
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,440
and glory to gain new homes and bodies aboard

95
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,960
the pleasure saucers of the sex goddesses,

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
all the while watching the hapless pigs twitch and bleat and wail

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,420
in the death throes of their world.

98
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,460
And we faithful shall be transfigured into new enlightened beings,

99
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,480
superior mutants called overmen and uberwomen,

100
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,020
who will start a new Jerusalem

101
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,960
in the promised land,

102
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,500
the promised land of Dimension X,

103
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,460
Asgard, the zone of eternal slack and cytor-spasmic ooze-squirt.

104
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,300
Behold, my servants shall prosper.

105
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,640
He that exalted and lifted up on the pipe shall be very high.

106
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,000
He who kneweth the fools will prophesy,

107
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,820
for he shall be made overman.

108
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,700
Many will be astonished at him,

109
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,960
for his appearance is so mighty,

110
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,940
and his form is beyond human semblance,

111
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,980
that his form is beyond that of the sentient.

112
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,740
Oh, Jesus!

113
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,640
Oh, no!

114
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,740
Oh, no!

115
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,780
We can't do much about those evil gods

116
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,480
from the other side of the cosmos,

117
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,700
who fly through the air

118
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,180
and through the nebulous darkness of space.

119
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,920
Space, my friends,

120
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,920
the infinite inky clouds of nebulae.

121
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,060
They fly on their membranous leathery wings,

122
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,920
holding in their coiling tentacles shiny steel cylinders,

123
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,460
each one containing what was once a human soul,

124
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,240
what was once a member of the church of the subgenius.

125
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,420
But enough of this.

126
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,180
You don't want to hear about this.

127
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,680
I must, and yet I cannot.

128
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,460
But I'll tell you what,

129
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,020
you'll be wishing it was that kind of aim.

130
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,660
At least you'll be wishing,

131
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,280
you'll be glad to have them on your side,

132
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,260
because at least they're not on your side.

133
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,700
At least there's two arms and two legs.

134
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,420
It could be worse.

135
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,120
It could be much worse.

136
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,440
And now the parade of manly men on the show.

137
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,520
There they come,

138
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,260
chests outthrust,

139
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,700
chins thrust forward,

140
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,060
each one holding a giant manly mug of myrrh,

141
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,280
hyper-caffeinated coffee.

142
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,440
Yep, to get them through the show,

143
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,440
they pour the Red Bull in their ear,

144
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,940
and off into the future they go.

145
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,240
Good one, don't you think?

146
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,240
I don't know about that.

147
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,440
Okay, caller, you know what?

148
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,000
This movie, is this the one that has Michael Pepe in it?

149
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,180
It's time for the pleasure saucers.

150
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,700
The sex goddess.

151
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,980
The sex goddess.

152
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:08,820
Oh!

153
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:10,860
Bitch!

154
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,280
Bitch!

155
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,960
What was I going to do?

156
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,460
Don't touch me, Mark!

157
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,480
Well, that's when we took our luggage,

158
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,420
and we packed up all our work,

159
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:20,920
and we packed up all our worldly goods,

160
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,700
and we made our way down to the pleasure saucers

161
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,100
of the sex goddesses.

162
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,280
And we had just enough wingnuts and lugnuts.

163
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,500
And when she said,

164
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,540
I want you to bring your battery charger,

165
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,560
I started getting a little bit scared.

166
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:32,560


167
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,160
They'll be in California.

168
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,400
Pleasure saucers will go,

169
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,820
although they don't like to go to California.

170
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,940
But they leave California forever into the necrophagous depths

171
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,360
of the Euclidean Isle.

172
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,680
We saw some of the sex goddesses last Friday.

173
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,720
Welcome to your saucer.

174
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,440
I am pleasure goddess CV456.

175
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
And 56,154.

176
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,300
Sexual gratification and desire for film

177
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,400
will begin in a moment.

178
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,960
First, we invite you to look out your window.

179
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,540
Say goodbye to the pinks who were left behind.

180
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,600
Now unzip your pants.

181
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,540
Just sit back and relax.

182
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,420
.

183
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:22,500
.

184
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:52,500


185
00:08:52,500 --> 00:09:22,500


186
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:52,500


187
00:09:52,500 --> 00:10:22,500
