Bob?

00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:29,860
Bob?

15
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,880
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,180
every time you say, see, hear, or think.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,340
What about slash?

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,460
That's your key phrase.

19
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,320
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,920

Develop the tricks of length extension.

00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,700
Bring your weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

43
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,800
Stand direct for your own abnormality.

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,440
Bob is a way of life to millions.

He is the one real shortcut to Slack.

48
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,240
Now see another dimension on your TV.

49
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,900

00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,840

00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,620
By blowing them off.

56
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,980
Bob's promise is to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

57
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,200
To explore new ways of going over the edge.

58
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,240
And coming right back.

59
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,500
And to bring back those who couldn't make it on their own.

60
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:55,780
To help you create the highest possible earnings from the psychodynamics of abnormal behavior.

61
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:55,780


62
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,160
To turn conspiracy implanted personality disorders around.

63
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,760
And channel them into an illusion of creativity.

64
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,780
That will fool normals and get you sex.

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,000
Be.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,000

97
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,940

98
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:05,420

I'm not going to be a hero anymore

118
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,440

119
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,000
Bob

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,120
A six million year cycle will end in 1998

121
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:17,980
Bob sees the world entering a new aeon which in a few years will bring more wondrous and miraculous change and more ancient sanity and destruction than all of mankind's history and prehistory before it

122
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,340
Bob brings a new destiny for mankind

123
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:21,340


124
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,700
Bob brings a new destiny for America

125
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:36,740
A time of cataclysmic economic change that will offer untold riches and power to those in the know while billions of deserving conspiracy dupes thrive in hell on earth

126
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:47,220
Uncontrolled thinking controlled by Bob will usher in a spiritual rebrief from a cascade of astounding mysteries

127
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,340
Supernatural riches and a restoration of the world's history

128
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:51,340


129
00:06:51,340 --> 00:07:00,040
A new life that will transform the lives of those who dare to seek them and pay for them

130
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,860
That's right you're lucky to live in the end time

Here's more money Bob

132
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,200
Wise up they're out to get you

133
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,640
The different are being silenced by a global conspiracy

134
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:20,620
Weird men arise and find out who they are and how to smash them

135
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,200
You probably already knew that the US government is a sham

136
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,840
Something popped up there for you to blame

137
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,200
But did you know that the real powers that be are not even people?

138
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,660
That they are actually shambling?

139
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,940
Unbelievable, unmentionable, unthinkable things?

140
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:46,920
Yes, Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet

141
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,320
Defy the sinister star forces which may be in the way of the world's future

142
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,200
And mock us all

143
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,740
Evil demons have kept the truth from humanity for thousands of years

144
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,920
God has been misquoted all this time

145
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,340
His actual words may disturb you

146
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:12,660
But Bob Dobbs is a bulwark against the unbearable fear and anxiety tormenting mankind

147
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,480
There's no problem with Bob

148
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,180
Bob is a sex god

149
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,700
Bob's a sex god

150
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,300
Unbelievable, unspeakable, unbearable

151
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,540
Bob Dobbs is a bulwark against the unbearable fear and anxiety tormenting mankind

152
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,300
Bob Dobbs is a bulwark against the unbearable fear and anxiety tormenting mankind

153
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,440
Do it, do it, do it

154
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,600
Keep it going

155
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,880
You're a moron

156
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,160
...town that uh...

157
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,220
But ah yes

158
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:59,480
It feels so good to be out here

159
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,140
You know I couldn't...

160
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,260
That uh...

161
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,620
The stuffy radio studio

162
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,220
Well that's good enough for those other DJs I suppose

163
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,280
But uh...

164
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,740
This is a living ministry dear friends

165
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,400
This is a live

166
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,620
A live uh... outreach

167
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,420
We're gonna reach out

168
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,320
There's a 7-Eleven

169
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,000
We could reach out to there and get a couple of packs of Marlboros

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,300
Really get into some false slack

171
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,260
That's right

172
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,340
Put them in the back of the...

173
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,700
Well let's see where's the show script

174
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,860
There is a script

175
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,820
We always have...

176
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,080
This is probably the most scripted show on K&ON

177
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,700
That's right

178
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,560
See if you can... if you can read it

179
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,620
Oh yes

180
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,760
Okay

181
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,380
Well tonight we're on K&ON 90.9 FM, Dallas, California

182
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:49,380


183
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:49,520
We're gonna be doing a show called K&ON

184
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:49,840
It's a show that's far worth

185
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,240
In stereo

186
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,540
Thank you K&ON

187
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,600
If you like what we play

188
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,820
Give us a call at...

189
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,620
What is the number here?

190
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,400
Well we don't have a phone in the car

191
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,520
8-2-3

192
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,320
That's okay

193
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,480
They can still call us

194
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,880
They can still call us

195
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,740
Is it 7-4-9-0?

196
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,480
I don't know

197
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,020
8-2-3

198
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,840
Yeah I think it is

199
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,820
It's 8-2-3-7-4-9-0

200
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,640
That's right Francis

201
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
And you can call us

202
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,060
As soon as we put a record on

203
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,140
I want you to give us a call

204
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,980
Cause we're gonna be going

205
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,480
And we'll talk to you very carefully

206
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,140
And if...

207
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,660
Not if you're...

208
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,460
If you're cool

209
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,360
But if you're not

210
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,420
But if you're really stupid enough

211
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,280
To be on the show with us

212
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,000
We will let you be on the show with us

213
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,440
Well...

214
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,000
We have that worked out

215
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,080
We have that option

216
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,200
We have that blood covenant my friend

217
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,080
With Wotan

218
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,020
The North Scot...

219
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,340
Look at this

220
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,520
Now look at this already

221
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,800
999-BJX

222
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,200
Uh huh

223
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,120
That's like Texas license plate

224
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,700
No less

225
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,500
In front of us

226
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:38,600
See now

227
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,440
We'll interpret that numerology for you

228
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,100
999 is the number of Bob

229
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,700
B...

230
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,000
They...

231
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,440
Yeah they've got it

232
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,300
999 on their license plate

233
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:46,740
And they...

234
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,700
And they wonder why

235
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,160
They've been battered and hit

236
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,320
Every time they leave their car in a parking lot

237
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,520
Friends...

238
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,040
They don't...

239
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,340
Or why...

240
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,700
Or why do these flying saucers

241
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,100
Seem to harass them all the time

242
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,460
Yeah...

243
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,260
Probably

244
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,300
That's probably what happened

245
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:58,920
I mean you know that...

246
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,720
I mean it's just aliens

247
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,580
Looking for a good time

248
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,800
I mean if you'd been locked up in a spaceship

249
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,700
For however many billions of years

250
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,640
It takes to get here

251
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,900
I mean you'd want a little too

252
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,440
You...

253
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:08,720
Yeah

254
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,000
You'd be out joy riding

255
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,500
And...

256
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,220
And uh...

257
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,620
Buzzing a few primitive earth vehicles

258
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,420
If you saw an offer like that

259
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,600
You wouldn't turn it down

260
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,460
Yeah

261
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,300
999 is the number of Bob

262
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:19,340
B...

263
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:19,340


264
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:19,680
It's just Bob friends

265
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,320
And that's why

266
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,020
It's not that Bob is the antichrist upside down

267
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,220
Uh...

268
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,180
Bob is the...

269
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:27,720
Uh...

270
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,720
If anything he's the anti-antichrist

271
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,440
Which doesn't mean he's the messiah

272
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,400
Nay Bob denies that he is the messiah

273
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,580
And he doesn't want you thinkin' that

274
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,720
Cause he knows you're gonna think it anyway

275
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,560
You're gonna wonder

276
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,800
Says he...

277
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,260
He...

278
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,480
You'll think it's too good to be true though

279
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,100
And friends uh...

280
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,180
This is KNON

281
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,940
Live on the road

282
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,600
At...

283
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,320
Transmissions

284
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,320


285
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,320


286
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,320


287
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,320


288
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,320


289
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,320


290
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,320


291
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,320


292
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,320


293
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,320


294
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,920
by microwave where we are working the way subgenius doctors work best which is

295
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:02,280
while wandering aimlessly and we've got some great material some more great

296
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,240
material to play for you all the way through here what do we have

297
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,280
oh yeah

298
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,340
the moon

299
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,620
beautiful

300
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,520
the sun

301
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,880
even more beautiful

302
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,660
oh yeah

303
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,860
oh yeah

304
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,080
oh yeah

305
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,420
oh yeah

306
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,760
oh yeah

307
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:08,760


308
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,380
oh yeah

309
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:11,640
oh yeah

310
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,240
oh yeah

311
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,840
oh yeah

312
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,440
oh yeah

313
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:14,520
oh yeah

314
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:14,920
oh yeah

315
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,000
oh yeah

316
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,460
oh yeah

317
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,200
oh yeah

318
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,140
Beautiful.

319
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,440
Oh, yeah.

320
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,280
Oh, yeah.

321
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:47,660
Oh, yeah.

322
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,100
Oh, yeah.

323
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,980
Oh, yeah.

324
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,200
Oh, yeah.

325
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,960
Oh, yeah.

326
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,660
Oh, yeah.

327
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,280
Oh, yeah.

328
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,360
Oh, yeah.

329
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,520
That is my favorite song for sure.

330
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,780
Oh, we're out of that Belfast battle zone.

331
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,440
Slave driver drove his tank into his reserved parking spot

332
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,440
and stepped out looking like Margaret Thatcher.

333
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,840
The war was on.

334
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,580
Oh, the keys on the typewriter

335
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,180
had shut off.

336
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,640
Sharp points that kept sticking into our fingers.

337
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,800
The dictating equipment started asking us questions.

338
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:01,180
And our beepers sent electric shocks

339
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,760
just through our body like a cattle prod.

340
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,260
Out in the warehouse, the trucks kept banging into the docks,

341
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,480
not even thinking about stopping.

342
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,440
Oh, our frail bodies were strapped to the chairs.

343
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,520
And our chairs were chained to the desks.

344
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,520
Our pleas for justice were ignored.

345
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,640
And the end seemed near.

346
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,580
But we busted our Margaret Thatcher slave driver's

347
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,880
little bitty balls.

348
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,700
We've charged out of their brick fortress.

349
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,400
The streets are ours.

350
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,180
Oh, my God.

351
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,800
We've charged out of their brick fortress.

352
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:49,800


353
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,720
Because it's Friday.

354
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,480
Friday.

355
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,560
Friday.

356
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,700
Friday.

357
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:00,700


358
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,060
Friday.

359
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,640
It was like being a hell's angel

360
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,560
when I sang this song for the first time.

361
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,560
I go along to my home

362
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,440
when I had an old little girl.

363
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
And I'm home.

364
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,540
And I go to my old neighbor's to see her.

365
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:29,160
And me and my old pal, Electron, were there.

366
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,000
And that was when we didn't wear any underwear.

367
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:41,120
We thought it was cool to be hanging free in the breeze.

368
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,140
And me and Electron would go riding with the houseguests.

369
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,460
And we went to the academy to study philosophy and medicine and psychology as well as art and

370
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,560
poetry and the tradition of human mind vision.

371
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,680
But we were like hell's angels on the weekend.

372
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,440
Honoring a fire.

373
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,440
And there was this oneirteen

374
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,840
looking out the window.

375
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:27,140
And I got out at 10 o'clock.

376
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,820
And I'm saying to him,

377
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,340
Don't you think you needed a Vieio in school.

378
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,580
You really should get him out that moment.

379
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:36,740
å

380
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,760
He gave me this number because it was ropes.

381
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,280
Yeah.

386
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,740
When I'm out walking, I strut my stuff, and I'm so strung out.

387
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,660
I'm high as a kite, I just might stop to check you out.

388
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,080
Let me go wild.

389
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,780
Like I'm blistering in the sun.

390
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,480
Let me go wild.

391
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,780
Big hands, I know you're the one.

392
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,440
Body and feet, I stain my sheets.

393
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,140
I don't even know why.

394
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,580
My girlfriend, she's at the end.

395
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,080
She is starting to cry.

396
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,000
Let me go wild.

397
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,400
Like I'm blistering in the sun.

398
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,140
Let me go wild.

399
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,360
Big hands, I know you're the one.

400
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,160
...

401
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,160


402
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:37,160
When I'm out walking, I strut my stuff, and I'm so strung out.

403
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,420
I'm high as a kite, I just might stop to check you out.

404
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:40,420


405
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,040
Stop to check your phone, and then, and then

406
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,540
When I'm out walking, I stop, I stop, and I'm so strung out

407
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,540
I'm high as a kite, I just might

408
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,480
Stop to check your phone, and then, and then

409
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,820
Body and feet, I stain my sheets

410
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,020
I don't even know why

411
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,900
My girlfriend, she's at the end

412
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,060
She is starting to cry

413
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,640
When I'm walking, I stop, I stop, and I'm so strung out

414
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,320
I'm high as a kite, I just might

415
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,020
Stop to check your phone

416
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,780
Let me go on

417
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,360
Like I'm blistering the sun

418
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,320
Let me go on

419
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,600
Big hands, I know you're the one

420
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,860
Well, that's an old tune called

421
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,620
Blister in the Sun

422
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,300
By a band called Violent Femmes

423
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,820
I was introduced to that song by

424
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,920
A little tiny, tiny gal

425
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,040
That likes to attack Texas OU weekenders

426
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,940
With a baseball bat

427
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,660
I'm Pastor Buck Naked, by the way

428
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,020
We're on the street, we're on the road as we speak

429
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,100
We're driving around, doing our show tonight

430
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,740
On four wheels

431
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,140
That's right, folks, and what you just heard

432
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,880
Starting at the beginning was

433
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,580
Oh yeah, by They Might Be Giants

434
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,180
It's Friday by I Have No Idea Who

435
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,040
And Hell's Angels on the Weekend

436
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,300
By the incredible Swinging Love Corpses

437
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,540
Okay, now we are going to do a little thing

438
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,540
We're going to give you some announcements

439
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,440
Find a pen, and we're going to tell you something else

440
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,180
Later

441
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,300
So just have that pencil ready, dear friend

442
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,120
Just have that pencil ready

443
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,060
We're going to break back in in about

444
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,820
Oh, I'd say five minutes or less

445
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,840
So we're going to give you your announcements

446
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,740
We won't leave your little hands too bored

447
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,240
So just get your pen and paper and all that

448
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,240
And we're going to give you some announcements

449
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,140
Thank you

450
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,140
No!

451
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,540
Good to see you!

452
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,700
Good to see you!

453
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,060
Here we are

454
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,440

00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:40,440


456
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,620
How are you...

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:42,720


459
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,400
We're going to defend or not

460
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
What's the hard war waiting now, Brutus?

461
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:44,400


462
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:44,400


463
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,580

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,640
Man, I can't read

468
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:55,640


469
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:55,640


470
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:55,660

and you know, pink boys.

485
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,540
I kid you not, Buddy West was in

486
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,840
one of these little folk stops

487
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,880
talking to Ray Wiley Hubbard, and Ray Wiley Hubbard says,

488
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,120
so, when are you and the

489
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,640
Jaybirds getting back together? Wow.

490
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,580
You guys are famous.

491
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,880
I know it. Yeah.

492
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,700
Okay. And now,

493
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,720
Doctors for Bob,

494
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,520
yes, we are going to be playing live

495
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,740
recordings from the last Twilight

496
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,840
Room revival,

497
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,440
dear friends, because

498
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,540
this is coming next

499
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,600
Saturday, less than a week

500
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,620
from the time you're

501
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,640
wading through right

502
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,620
now, is the subgenius

503
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,040
Scary Ball and Masquerade

504
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,840
D Vival at the Twilight Room.

505
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,800
That's right, October 26th, the weekend

506
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,620
before Halloween, Saturday night.

507
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,340
The

508
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,300
scariest, most hideous

509
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,240
monsters and bands

510
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,800
with more live blood and guts

511
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,380
on stage than you've ever seen.

512
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,820
This is a return to the grand

513
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,220
wind.

514
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,860
No. You see,

515
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,560
it's an ancient French tradition

516
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,140
of bloody gore shows

517
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,260
that we're doing

518
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,240
some homage to, and we'll be playing

519
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,420
tapes, live revival tapes

520
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,360
from the last Twilight Room revival where

521
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,000
D Vival.

522
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,620
That's right.

523
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,600
Where more drunk cowboys

524
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,340
and Doctors for Bob, that's right

525
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,540
folks, the Doctors for Bob,

526
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,100
the only

527
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,000
authorized launchers of the

528
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,880
bleeding head of the World

529
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,380
Cup golfer whose name we can't say on this show

530
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,080
because of the insurance problem.

531
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,560
It's called Mad Arabs and it's by

532
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,340
Doctors for Dinosaurs World Band.

533
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:12,980
That's right.

534
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,740
Now what, what?

535
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,940
That is a top 40 hit buck that Doctors for Dinosaurs

536
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,300
had after, just right after you quit that band.

537
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,740
I cleaned up on that record, pal.

538
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,500
Like all that subgenius stuff.

539
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,960
That's what I get for listening to K&N.

540
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,720
They send you this junk for free,

541
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,040
and I get paid for putting it on the air.

542
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,860
I've been listening to K&N and I totally missed the fact that I was listening to K&N.

543
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,880
I was on a champ selling AM hit.

544
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,620
That's right.

545
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,320
That's right.

546
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,680
Doctors for Dinosaurs, Mad Arabs.

547
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,020
You may just not recognize the title because it's an instrumental.

548
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,320
And we'll have to listen to it.

549
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,400
Yes, we'll be getting into all this evil,

550
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,580
evil, demonic tapes, you know,

551
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,420
because that's what they say about us.

552
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,360
They say Church of the Subgenius.

553
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,160
Well, it's a demonic.

554
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,220
Well, since we haven't seen it yet,

555
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,920
we're supposed to act like we have seen it.

556
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,920
How did you like Chastity Belt's show, Twilight?

557
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,480
No, we haven't seen it yet.

558
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,820
Well, I know.

559
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,020
Well, let's act like we have.

560
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,560
Okay.

561
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,960
I thought it was unbelievably disgusting.

562
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:17,000
I don't think that people should be allowed to do that kind of thing on stage.

563
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,960
How did she remove that much clothing and still get on?

564
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,440
I thought this was a political country.

565
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,240
It was a political show, see, and it was a statement.

566
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:32,840
This Twilight Room revival, devival, I'm sorry, Bob, I'm sorry, Bob, I'm sorry, Bob, I'm sorry,

567
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,840
but I haven't been studying the TV.

568
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:33,840


569
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:33,840


570
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:40,220
I've been working too hard for the conspiracy and drifting away from the true jargon of the

571
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,520
church.

572
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,980
Well, praise Bob.

573
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,080
That was my point.

574
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:47,460
Praise money.

575
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,740
Yeah, praise money and praise FROP, friends.

576
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:56,840
They, you know, I don't believe everybody has to eat FROP while they're driving at the

577
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,940
same time, but this is a free country and FROP, have a FROP Zip-U-Lops is still legal.

578
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,840
Well, I think we ought to be careful.

579
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:03,840


580
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:13,940
Yes.

581
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:14,840
All right, next up.

582
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,640
Here's a song we have on track, a anthem for you, the interviewing members for Mile

583
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,320
City with JAKE WILLIAMS' MALMOTOãã ãã Maræ­ ì ë° ìëë° AOT.

584
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:20,320


585
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:20,360
Let's do the one with the joke.

586
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,060
Don't you want some ÄÆ°á»£c ì¬ë¬ë¶ í ë¨¸ë

587
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:27,200
ìï¿½acco chemlogo nominated of course, the recording of the ball like I was told,

588
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,280
Not as long as you have two hours of sound.

589
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,840
Actually I do a good job reading them.

590
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,100
But I didn't make it up.

591
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:29,780
You can still-

592
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:29,780


593
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:29,840


594
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,780
Hold on to the microphones, would you, Rock?

595
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,660
Let's see.

596
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,420
All right, folks, and we're going to roll that tape.

597
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,180
So here it comes.

598
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,300
As soon as we can figure out how to...

599
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,280
Shock the living gee out of me.

600
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,480
Well, we're going to do a song here

601
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,820
about a young man who received electroshock

602
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,180
and who was cured.

603
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,840
We call it Shock the Living Gee Out of Me.

604
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:29,760
Shock the Living Gee Out of Me

605
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,800
Created an Arnold Palmer head this realistic

606
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,020
Where it's only the dots that prove behavior patterns

607
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,000
He just said she was...

608
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,620
She said she was 18

609
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,120
How was I to know she was only three?

610
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,840
But I'm not mad

611
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,500
I only seek happiness

612
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,200
And that's not nearly as bad

613
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,580
That's not nearly as bad

614
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,700
That's not half as bad as that time they

615
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,720
Shock the living gee out of me

616
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,700
That's not nearly as bad as that time they

617
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,300
Shocked the living shower of fragrant water

618
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,080
That's not nearly as bad as that time they

619
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,200
Shocked the living shower ofiamo

620
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,540
They got me and survived

621
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,560
Shouted hurt the living song

622
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,280
Assá»t een,, heung, goodness

623
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,220
For beating the!

624
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,460
At a time so strange

625
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,140
Pee once was on the town

626
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,300
The fucking bill!

627
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,260
Pee was on the town!

628
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,220
with the sticky part.

629
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,500
Oh, that was fun.

630
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,180
That time they converted my entire body

631
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,700
to a wall of membrane

632
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,920
attached to a human brain

633
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,200
whose only purpose was to feel pain

634
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,120
and then apply the flame.

635
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,620
But all that felt good

636
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,460
compared to that time they

637
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,680
shot the living gay out of me.

638
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,300
Shot the living gay out of me.

639
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,160
Shot the living gay.

640
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,700
That time they cut off all my arms and legs

641
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,580
and then shot me in the neck

642
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,860
with a Dutron howitzer.

643
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,860
Oh, yeah, that felt good.

644
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,360
That was quite pleasurable

645
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,720
compared to that time they hooked up that device.

646
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,140
Oh, it wasn't an AC device.

647
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,480
It ran on the AC current.

648
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,540
But it ran on the DC current.

649
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,880
But they brought that orderly in

650
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,780
and they had those nurses attached to it.

651
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,660
That was really a panacea.

652
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,240
It was fun.

653
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,240
Oh, I'm glad.

654
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,060
Oh, that was a rock and roll party.

655
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,500
I thought all that was fun

656
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,000
compared to that time they

657
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,080
shot the living gay out of me.

658
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,920
All I want is happiness.

659
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,220
I'm not crazy.

660
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,960
But it's the normals.

661
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,980
They're trying to kill me with normalcy rays.

662
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,940
I had to kill that school bus full of orphans.

663
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,880
All I think is happiness

664
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,280
is myself.

665
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,120
Can I help with it?

666
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,400
Is happiness for me

667
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,880
is killing an entire busload

668
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,040
full of school children?

669
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,360
No, that's crazy.

670
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,000
Go ahead.

671
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:08,900
Lock me up.

672
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,060
Then they put me in the padded...

673
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,060
They put me in that room

674
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,620
where they don't give you any good pills.

675
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,460
They kept me confined for three weeks.

676
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,180
But that wasn't nearly as bad

677
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,160
as that time they

678
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,520
shot the living gay out of me.

679
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,600
They had me all tied up.

680
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,820
They brought the nurses in.

681
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
They had me chained down with rope.

682
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,520
They had me tied down with chains.

683
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,960
They had a needle that took

684
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,640
27 orderlies to bring in.

685
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,300
They had a needle that was as big

686
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,920
as the Empire State Building.

687
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,800
In order to sedate me,

688
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,960
they had to lower me on top of the needle

689
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,800
with a helicopter.

690
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,800
But I feel like the frontal lobotomy

691
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,260
was helping to build

692
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,640
progressive,

693
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,760
growthful member of society.

694
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,300
But my mind is still okay.

695
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,000
You know, I've got a piece of paper

696
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,780
that says my mind is still okay.

697
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,140
But that wasn't nearly as bad

698
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,020
as that time they

699
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,540
shot the living gay out of me.

700
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,340
Ah!

701
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:28,880


702
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:32,940
Okay!

703
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:33,640
Okay.

704
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,500
That was a shock

705
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,740
to living gay out of me

706
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,440
by Doctors for Bob.

707
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,620
Doctors for Bob,

708
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
more drunk cowboys,

709
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,000
and just a ranting bunch of

710
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,180
devangelists will be down

711
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,280
at the Twilight Room October 26th.

712
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,100
And you can see us all there

713
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,260
just this coming Saturday.

714
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,040
So why not?

715
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,880
I want y'all to make sure

716
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,680
to listen to Pajama Party.

717
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:57,860
And...

718
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,860
And...

719
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:03,360
I want to thank Shaggy for lending me that song, Blister in the Sun, that we just played.

720
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,320
Great song.

721
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,920
She's here now.

722
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,700
When are you on, Shaggy?

723
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,600
What time does your show start?

724
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,400
Midnight.

725
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,960
Midnight to what, three?

726
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:11,580
Four.

727
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,240
To four.

728
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,800
Okay, you can listen to Pajama Party here, midnight to four.

729
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,440
These are the announcements.

730
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,720
Now, you have your pen, right?

731
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:25,420
Okay, also, November 23rd, see my band, More Drunk Cowboys and Lost Highway,

732
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,540
the K&ON benefit, Sons of Herman Hall.

733
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:27,720
Sons of Herman Hall.

734
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,280
And that's November 23rd.

735
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,020
And this Saturday night's the other thing.

736
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,760
Anything else to announce?

737
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,400
Okay.

738
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,300
Also, Doug, let's now give them the itinerary for our West Coast tour.

739
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,480
And this is for Crazy George and anybody else.

740
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,320
By the way, you're listening to K&ON 90.9, Dallas-Fort Worth-Lancaster.

741
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,760
Doug, let's give them the itinerary of the West Coast tour.

742
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,960
My name is Reverend Stang, Pastor Naked.

743
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,160
It's November 9th in San Francisco.

744
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,520
November 15th in San Francisco.

745
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,800
And 16th in Los Angeles.

746
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,100
That's right, the Subgenius Rolling Medicine Show.

747
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,400
And Hell Tap Revival will be in California.

748
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:10,900
Then in Seattle, I think the 16th.

749
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,480
No, 17th.

750
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,720
That's all you need to know.

751
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,500
Let's hear Ernest.

752
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,500
Subgenius Medicine Show.

753
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,680
Subgenius Medicine Show.

754
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,420
My sweetheart has gone and I'm so lonely

755
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,840
She said that she and I were through

756
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,940
So I started out drinking for pastime

757
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,840
Driving nails in my coffin over you

758
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,680
I'm just driving nails in my coffin

759
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:00,760
Every time I drink a bottle of booze

760
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,720
I'm just driving nails in my coffin

761
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,040
Lordy driving those nails over you

762
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,820
All coming red

763
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,920
Oh, let's hear it for you, Jimmy

764
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,240
Every since the day that we parted

765
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,500
I've been so sad and so blue

766
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,220
I'm always thinking of you, love

767
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,920
And I just can't quit drinking that old booze

768
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,160
I'm just driving nails in my coffin

769
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,900
Every time I drink a bottle of booze

770
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,200
I'm just driving nails in my coffin

771
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,480
Lordy driving those nails over you

772
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,660
Hey, that new church air is just great!

773
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,420
It's fun!

774
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:40,320
Well, son, if you'll just keep breathing an equal portion of church air

775
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,040
With all of the bad air, too

776
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,540
You'll get like me

777
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,140
Your head will begin to expand

778
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:54,980
The inside will eventually become larger than the outside

779
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,560
I don't know quite how to explain this

780
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,500
But I've put my trust in Bob

781
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,680
Thanks to Bob

782
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,920
The inside of my head is much larger than the outside ever was

783
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,660
But doesn't that make it hard to get through doorways?

784
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:18,320
Sometimes I do get lost inside my head

785
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,380
And I've had trouble finding my way out

786
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,500
Especially early in the morning

787
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,660
But thanks to Bob, I've been able to get through the doorways

788
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:25,660


789
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:25,660


790
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,320
And I'm happy to be able to work at his shop

791
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,260
I'm happy to be able to be a much more productive employee on the job

792
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:35,540
And I've had a great time at parties with this new big head

793
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,140
That came with my glandscaping

794
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,100
Will the same thing happen to me when I get to be a man, too?

795
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,460
Yes, son, you'll go through the operations, too

796
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:52,420
The doctors will open your third nostril with their musical instruments

797
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,660
And you'll be able to whiff-read the stains

798
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:55,660


799
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:55,660


800
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,140
And you'll be able to whiff-read the stains

801
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:00,140


802
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,040
You'll be able to sell them anything, son

803
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,860
Just like me

804
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:09,560
Gee, I can't wait till that Bob-time train comes around the bend

805
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,120
Oh, look out, son

806
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,820
Here it comes now

807
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,100
It's frightening, isn't it?

808
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,740
It's unbelievably big

809
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,140
It's frightening, isn't it?

810
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:25,140


811
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:25,640
It's frightening, isn't it?

812
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:25,640


813
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,860
It's terrifying

814
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,460
It's a matter of

815
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:38,820
It's a matter of

816
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:38,840
Texas

817
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,280
75214

818
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,520
Texas 75214

819
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,200
Texas 75214

820
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,180
Bob is coming

821
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:08,920
Hi, this is Pastor Bucknaked

822
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,800
Call us here at 823-7490

823
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,360
This is the Hour of Slack

824
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,640
This is the Hour of Slack

825
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:24,500
This is the Hour of Slack

826
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,620
This is the Hour of Slack

827
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,020
This is about time

828
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,560
to say goodbye

829
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,420
to the war

830
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:31,420


831
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,940
This is about time

832
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,580
to say goodbye

833
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,460
to the war

834
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,880
to the world

835
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,100
Goodbye

836
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:46,180
to the world

837
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,180


838
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,740
organization

839
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,200
Village

840
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,420
Village

841
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:47,680
Village

842
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:47,680


843
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:53,380
Village

844
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:53,960
Village

845
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,980
Hey, that new church air is just great.

846
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,680
The new screen excitement you've been waiting for.

847
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,280
Rated PG.

848
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,520
Close your eyes and pretend with me for a few seconds.

849
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,580
Your doorbell rings and there's a chaplain standing quietly.

850
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,540
He tells you,

851
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:15,740
We're splashing liberation right around the world and we'll die to do it.

852
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,860
This is Ted Stack, KNON News, from the Twilight Room.

853
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,640
I'm now going to interview Reverend Ivan Stang.

854
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,460
Ivan Stang, is it true that the subgenius medicine show will be coming to the Twilight Room?

855
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,220
That's right, folks.

856
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,320
October 26th.

857
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,240
This coming Saturday.

858
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,940
This is coming Saturday, right?

859
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:40,600
This is going to be the scariest revival, the devival, whatever you call them nowadays in this disgusting world.

860
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,200
Is it true that the head of a murdered man will be on display?

861
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,640
That's exactly right.

862
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,540
These people were.

863
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,420
They worship this head.

864
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,100
They.

865
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:47,760
Ah.

866
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:49,960
Okay.

867
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,500
Everybody knows you.

868
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:59,420
They actually worship this head and they're, they're, they launch this thing ritualistically every equinox.

869
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,500
And they're, this is all Hallows Eve or just about.

870
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,820
That's shocking, man.

871
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,540
Yeah.

872
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,480
Is that a transformer on the ground?

873
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,900
And these people are having a party.

874
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,900
I mean, this isn't, it's not only a church ritualistic thing, it's also a sort of a sinful party.

875
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,140
You mean an event for marbles?

876
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,000
Is that for?

877
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:15,660
I mean, there's a.

878
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,420
There will be fleecing normals.

879
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:22,580
There will be fleecing normals and dancing their asses off at the Twilight Room on October 26th.

880
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,200
The admission is, what is the admission?

881
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,360
We forgot to bring our.

882
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,240
I always have to do this.

883
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:35,540
Well, I just want to say tonight that me and my fellow doctors for Bob are members in good standing of a church, but not just any church.

884
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:40,600
Well, the church to which we belong just happens to be beyond a shadow of a doubt.

885
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:44,140
The world's only bogus, true religion.

886
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,100
Right.

887
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:45,660
Of course.

888
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:45,720
Of course.

889
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:45,720


890
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:45,720


891
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:45,720


892
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:45,720


893
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:45,720


894
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:45,720


895
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:49,340
I am referring to the Church of the Subgenius.

896
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:58,460
Now, the Church of the Subgenius, as founded by J.R. Bob Dobbs, Saint of Sales, Master of Slack in 1953, is a pan-religion of the future,

897
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:15,160
uniting superior mutants, social renegades, twisted geniuses, and sci-fi sinners in a worldwide rampage of immoral and prophetic yucks and grins.

898
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,560
Yucks and grins.

899
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:29,380
Which will hopefully, inevitably, lead us directly to a commodity all too lacking in today's modern, jet-age-a-go-go society, and that commodity, friends, is slack.

900
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,620
Now, slack is what the conspiracy wants to rob us of.

901
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,460
Slack is what the conspiracy wants to take away from us.

902
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:44,660
Now, back in the 50s, Bob Dobbs himself noticed a decided lack of slack.

903
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,520
A lack in our culture.

904
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,720
He noticed an awful prevalence of normalcy.

905
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:57,940
He noticed that the normals formed a vast conspiracy against the different.

906
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:04,560
An insidious conspiracy dedicated to squelching our natural rogue instincts.

907
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,660
Dedicated to wiping out our fun factors.

908
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:13,920
Dedicated, in short, to the total and utter alleviation of the original slack.

909
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,940
With which we are all born.

910
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:26,120
Now, Bob wanted to fight this conspiracy in what better way, I ask ye, than by the foundation of a major new world religion.

911
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:29,020
Hence the Church of the Subgenius.

912
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:29,960
Praise Bob!

913
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,040
Praise Bob!

914
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,280
Say a few words for a radio show.

915
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,100
Pastor Buck naked is alright.

916
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,500
And God save Nancy Reagan.

917
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,900
Okay, this is live here at the radio show.

918
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:43,900


919
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:43,900


920
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:43,900


921
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:43,900


922
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,180
We're in the toilet room with Tony Granados.

923
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,000
We're sitting...

924
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:53,740
We're walking around interviewing these drunken, brawling barbarians here at the Twilight Room.

925
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,480
Mysterious Bob and Dallas.

926
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,340
Home of the Subgenius revival this Saturday night.

927
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,520
That's right, this Saturday night, the Subgenius revival.

928
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,460
The Masquerade Ball medicine show.

929
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,300
Come one, come all, folks.

930
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,980
You'll be here, 2111 Commerce Street.

931
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,120
Admission...

932
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:09,980
Five dollars!

933
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,600
We will fleece the pigs!

934
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,340
Not a problem.

935
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
Bring it to the friendly people.

936
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,760
People touching people.

937
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,380
People running against people.

938
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:29,520
People developing the nuclear first strike capability to incinerate people.

939
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,320
Sound like a flash in the pan?

940
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,400
It's gotta be.

941
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,780
You don't settle for less.

942
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,820
You don't have to.

943
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,580
You're you.

944
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,500
And you've got needs.

945
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,700
Bigger and more earth-shaking than your grandfather could have dreamed.

946
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:53,300
How do we keep bringing them to you, year after year, bigger and better?

947
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:58,640
By using the technology of tomorrow on the consumers of today.

948
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,420
The now people.

949
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,060
People on the go.

950
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:08,700
Going from smart shopper to new low value in the time it takes to dial our number.

951
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,380
Call now, won't you?

952
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,940
For more of what you've come to expect from us.

953
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:16,920
Style.

954
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:18,820
Mood.

955
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,700
A certain dependable kind of image.

956
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,760
An image of the way you like people to be.

957
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,040
Passive.

958
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:29,460
Pretty.

959
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,680
White.

960
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:38,360
As white as the complexion of our finest women, grown right here by our special process.

961
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,860
As white as the hair of God.

962
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,780
White as it was in life.

963
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:50,080
As white as the blank sheet on which we write your mind.

964
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,220
Who are we?

965
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,300
We're the happy people.

966
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,580
Happy to live in a world of images.

967
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,700
Images of war.

968
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,260
Family.

969
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,120
Crime.

970
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,340
Fun images that help rinse away all the pain.

971
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:13,060
Unsightly self images so you can get away from the privacy of your own home.

972
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,220
After all, aren't you what everything's here for?

973
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,460
You're what we're here for.

974
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,280
That's why we made everything.

975
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,240
And that's why everything made you.

976
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,280
And that's why you made us.

977
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,700
Who are we?

978
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,320
We're the money people.

979
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,760
The people who take your money.

980
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,160
No more money hassling.

981
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,500
But what about little Dicky, you say?

982
00:46:52,840 --> 00:47:00,720
What's little Dicky gonna do when you're working late and Wilma's minding the fort and Sis is in and out?

983
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,520
Put away those straps and buckles.

984
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,960
Dicky's safe with us.

985
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,320
He's even learning to speak now.

986
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:08,620
He's getting back again.

987
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,640
Our way.

988
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:16,320
Best of all, he's safe with the people who know what it is you want from a world.

989
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:18,320
Simplicity.

990
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:20,640
Reliability.

991
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:26,820
A world you can go to without worrying about whether your money is safe.

992
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:34,000
You know, when we first got into this business, we didn't know much more than you.

993
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:35,780
Like you.

994
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:38,360
We thought there was a world out there.

995
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,320
A world of value.

996
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:42,920
A world that needed meaning.

997
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:44,800
Beauty.

998
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:46,940
Love.

999
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,100
A world that needed a better product.

1000
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:55,940
Uh-uh.

1001
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,920
There's just you.

1002
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,760
And you want it.

1003
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,440
You want to know something.

1004
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:14,340
You want to know just exactly what it is you're supposed to do.

1005
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:21,200
You don't really care why, just so long as it's the right thing.

1006
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,560
It's natural.

1007
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,340
Everyone wants to do the right thing.

1008
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:31,240
But sometimes it's hard to know just what the right thing is.

1009
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,140
Let's say you're black.

1010
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:40,480
And you've just lost both your arms and legs defending U.S. interests in El Salvador.

1011
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:47,400
You come home and get thrown in jail for life for beating up four white cops.

1012
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:53,680
You want to know just exactly what is it I'm supposed to feel.

1013
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,540
We can't give you all the answers.

1014
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:02,500
But we can help you flesh out your fantasy that there are some.

1015
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:07,940
At our labs, we use only the finest homemade ingredients.

1016
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:09,900
Love.

1017
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,040
Children.

1018
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,360
God.

1019
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:22,140
And the purest blend of money your needs can buy, grown right here by our special process.

1020
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:27,700
A process in use since our first mom and pop operation.

1021
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,100
Who are we?

1022
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,380
We're the normal people.

1023
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,260
Time is really wasted.

1024
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,960
There's no guarantee.

1025
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,520
Smiles in the making.

1026
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,580
We gotta fight the powers that be.

1027
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,720
Got so many voices.

1028
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:55,960
Say it on the scene.

1029
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,840
Giving up all around.

1030
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,220
Me.

1031
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,000
Bases for the pain.

1032
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,080
I try to play my music.

1033
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,480
This ain't my music.

1034
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,080
It's too loud.

1035
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,380
I try talking about it.

1036
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,140
I got to be run around.

1037
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,420
And when I roll with the punches.

1038
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,340
I got knocked on the ground.

1039
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,640
By all this bullshit going down.

1040
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:22,380
Hey.

1041
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,700
Time is really wasted.

1042
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,600
There's no guarantee.

1043
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,040
Smiles in the making.

1044
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,940
We gotta fight the powers that be.

1045
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:39,040
Sleep.

1046
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:39,140


1047
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,720
Parking at the end of the line.

1048
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:11,580
You're in contact.

1049
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,540
All passengers, please sit at park.

1050
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,140
I really didn't believe in Bob.

1051
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,080
And then one time I was going out to my favorite club.

1052
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:26,800
Yeah.

1053
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,040
And I got a flat.

1054
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,520
And then the next minute, I didn't have the flat.

1055
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,320
Go ahead.

1056
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:34,620
Praise Bob.

1057
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:34,880
Bob.

1058
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,900
Charlie, you're on the air with us now on our radio show.

1059
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,620
This is Charlie Gilder of the Twilight Room.

1060
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,400
Say a little bit about Twilight Room or anything else to the kids.

1061
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,440
Well, we're mentioned in Playboy magazines.

1062
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:52,420
This proves that we're a true den of debauchery.

1063
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,720
What's more than that, we were talking about entertainment tonight.

1064
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,640
Yes, this is a famous place.

1065
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,440
Y'all come down here and be rough with us.

1066
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,080
The Colossus Notice.

1067
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:05,000
The Colossus Notice Club.

1068
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Listen to that.

1069
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:13,800
We have true rock and roll corruption and lyrics that cannot be printed.

1070
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,420
That's right.

1071
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,340
This is any kind of false corruption.

1072
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,060
This is the real thing, kids.

1073
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,300
Fortunately, it's real rock and roll and the lyrics can't be uncured either.

1074
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,600
But that's beside the point.

1075
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,100
It'll still corrupt your soul and the devil will begin to control your brain.

1076
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,420
That's 21-11.

1077
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:35,540
It's a commerce street, folks.

1078
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,440
It's a commerce school.

1079
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,440
Get your butts down here.

1080
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,580
Dr. Rubio saves me.

1081
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,440
Saves me.

1082
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,280
Bob saves those who save themselves.

1083
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,160
Well, Bob made it so cold.

1084
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:47,940
Pull out your wallet.

1085
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,260
I'll give you my wallet if you just make it summer in here.

1086
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,620
Just pull it out and...

1087
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,940
Oh, well, I'll turn off the...

1088
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:55,760
Look.

1089
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:55,960
Look.

1090
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:56,860
There.

1091
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,140
All right.

1092
00:52:58,260 --> 00:52:59,240
And it's warmer.

1093
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,380
Here's my checking account.

1094
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:01,600
How much do you want?

1095
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,480
It was, uh, just...

1096
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:03,840
Hey.

1097
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,480
What?

1098
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:05,780
You're gonna have to put that in the wall over our eyes.

1099
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,140
Constantly.

1100
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:15,020
Bob is saying if we must be lied to and cheated for reasons, let us do it to ourselves for

1101
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:16,060
our own reasons.

1102
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:20,200
Let us realize where the real deceit lies.

1103
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,900
Let us have a choice in how we're being screwed.

1104
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,880
Some ways are fun.

1105
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:32,260
For many of us, there is no physical escape from their clutches or any hope of it until

1106
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,600
the excess come and the followers of us are gone.

1107
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:34,600


1108
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:34,600


1109
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:34,600


1110
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:34,600


1111
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:34,600


1112
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:34,600


1113
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:34,600


1114
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:34,600


1115
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:34,600


1116
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:34,600


1117
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:34,600


1118
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,260
Inonstant fighting leads to the conspiracy of another one to be together and so the

1119
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:36,260


1120
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,180
The events is more mal Arkham Foodsavbar behind the scenes or some of these otherarÃ© ends

1121
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:37,180


1122
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:42,800
Up until now, Bob continued to listen to ali pros and now he organs.

1123
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,480
Until the end, the MÃ¶glich

1124
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,880
Auxiliary' has been being able to striving to fuse the aussi over tends that I have

1125
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,920
separated from the evil and the vegains all were one category.

1126
00:53:50,840 --> 00:54:04,580
The two eitosUp-Ans try'a fan cÐµÐ½Ñic'ing connect to the ë°ï¿½in ê¸ì comentarios.

1127
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:07,240
like a soothing dew in what fortune lies.

1128
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,760
After all, it should be every person's choice

1129
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,560
to curse God and die if that was what they wish.

1130
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,980
We all have the right to spit in the eye of the collective gods,

1131
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,300
did we not create them?

1132
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,660
Where indeed would Yahweh own be

1133
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:23,180
without the human race that torments and pesters?

1134
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:24,940
I'll put it to you,

1135
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,180
the old chiseler would be pretty damn bored with it all

1136
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,180
if there was nothing more entertaining

1137
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,420
than sherpins and seraphims

1138
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,320
and numby-pumby flaming angels

1139
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,580
sitting around up there on damp clouds

1140
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:39,760
and arson and profiting all 24 hours of bloody day

1141
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,960
and you can fight or not.

1142
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,720
The world is from Minnesota.

1143
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:46,400
Cool.

1144
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,880
You heard it here first.

1145
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:56,420
Alright, the show has picked up two passengers.

1146
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,160
We got guests on the show tonight.

1147
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:58,960
Yeah!

1148
00:54:59,120 --> 00:54:59,640
Cool.

1149
00:54:59,640 --> 00:54:59,880
Alright.

1150
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,100
Yeah, if we could just keep this show running.

1151
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,300
Hey, can we get...

1152
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,560
Can we get the show out?

1153
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:06,260
This is the hour of slack.

1154
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,860
Will the show fit through that?

1155
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,900
No, the show can't go there.

1156
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,660
You have to back the show up this alley

1157
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:14,080
and take the show down that road there.

1158
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:14,800
Oh, okay.

1159
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,420
I'll show you the way out.

1160
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:17,120
Oh, look out!

1161
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,040
Don't hit that other show!

1162
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:19,580
Oh!

1163
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,100
Jeez, that was KZW.

1164
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,220
I hate their truck!

1165
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,780
I hate the KZ truck!

1166
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,980
They're all trying to run us off the road!

1167
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,440
I hate them!

1168
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,120
I hate them!

1169
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,840
And the KERA car is always following us!

1170
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,120
Every time we go out...

1171
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:33,600
No, no, you're doing a half!

1172
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,620
They were following us last night!

1173
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:36,580
Oh, heck.

1174
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,180
No, this way.

1175
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:37,940
You can only go this way.

1176
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,720
It's a one-way airway.

1177
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:40,280
The FM.

1178
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:41,620
FM's this way.

1179
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,560
Then you follow that way to stay on FM.

1180
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,600
Otherwise, we'll end up at the AM side of the town.

1181
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,860
We'll end up on the other side of the band.

1182
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,400
I don't want you to be...

1183
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,500
The last time, I had a hard time getting out of AM.

1184
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,820
So I want to stay in FM.

1185
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:53,340
Yeah.

1186
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,660
Okay, now wait.

1187
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:55,480
A powerful gospel.

1188
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,180
And then stay on this road and hit the light.

1189
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,100
Take a left.

1190
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,280
Or no, no, wait a minute.

1191
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,020
Which one is this?

1192
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:01,980
Yeah, yeah.

1193
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,060
Yeah, I'd rather you did that.

1194
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:03,740
Just take a left.

1195
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:04,500
On this one.

1196
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:05,860
Just go down.

1197
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:06,500
Go down Main.

1198
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,500
No, no, I'd rather you go this way.

1199
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,080
This is Commerce.

1200
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:08,580
Take the show.

1201
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,620
Go down Main.

1202
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:09,920
Okay.

1203
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,980
That way you can do it when you're totally hypnotized

1204
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:12,720
and you'll never get lost.

1205
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,540
Go down Commerce?

1206
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,380
No, this way.

1207
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:16,960
Which is this way?

1208
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,300
Go down Main.

1209
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,020
All right.

1210
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:19,740
Okay, now listen.

1211
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,000
These friends, you're lucky to have KNO in in this city

1212
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,320
and you won't have it much longer.

1213
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,860
If you don't spend your money on this station,

1214
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,020
listen to what you get on the rest of the year.

1215
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,560
Look at that.

1216
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,220
A board.

1217
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:32,160
A board.

1218
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,280
We're not even table football.

1219
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:34,580
Look at that.

1220
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:34,980
Listen to that.

1221
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,040
Static.

1222
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:36,920
And that.

1223
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:37,560
Nothing.

1224
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:38,020
Wait a minute.

1225
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:38,480
That's on AM.

1226
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,240
This is the worst.

1227
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:39,980
This is the worst.

1228
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,660
Give them FM now.

1229
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:42,600
All right.

1230
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,820
Now we're going to turn to KNO in.

1231
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,220
Here you go.

1232
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:47,000
Listen to that.

1233
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:47,780
All right.

1234
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,100
That's KNO in.

1235
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,080
Okay.

1236
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,240
Man.

1237
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,260
And you would let this go by.

1238
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,800
You would let this blow by.

1239
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:55,820
No, take a right.

1240
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:56,300
Take a right.

1241
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,280
Keep the show.

1242
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:57,880
No.

1243
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:58,380
Oh, no.

1244
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,220
The show's off the road.

1245
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,840
Oh, hell.

1246
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:02,400
Guys.

1247
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:02,680
Guys.

1248
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:02,880
No, no.

1249
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,720
Let's just go fast.

1250
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:04,560
Faster and faster.

1251
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:05,820
They'll never catch us.

1252
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,140
All right.

1253
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:06,880
We'll see.

1254
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,460
Keep the show on here.

1255
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,300
We'll go to Central.

1256
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,120
If we can get the show.

1257
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,000
Put the show on Central.

1258
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:11,820
That's what I'm doing.

1259
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:12,560
Oh, okay.

1260
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:13,780
You went up to over there.

1261
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:14,180
Okay.

1262
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:15,420
This is Central.

1263
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,380
We're putting the show on Central Expressway now.

1264
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:17,900
All right.

1265
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:18,980
It's dangerous, folks.

1266
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,840
But we're ready to do it.

1267
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:21,640
The same here.

1268
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,220
It's all over Dallas.

1269
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,600
You can cast KNO in anywhere.

1270
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:29,080
In Dallas or Plano or Arlington or Russia.

1271
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,860
They can't get KNO in in Russia, friend.

1272
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:32,480
And you know why?

1273
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:33,420
Because the people in Russia.

1274
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:33,660
Don't.

1275
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:34,380
Don't send us money.

1276
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,040
That's right.

1277
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,300
No, straight, straight, straight.

1278
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:36,720
No, no.

1279
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,540
I'm going this way.

1280
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,680
I know what I'm doing.

1281
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:41,500
What am I telling you how to drive downtown for?

1282
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,100
He's only lived here like.

1283
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,440
I've been running this show for a week now.

1284
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,160
I've been here for nine years.

1285
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,480
I just thought you were lost.

1286
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,700
No, no.

1287
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,320
I know where we're taking the show.

1288
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,200
I don't know why.

1289
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,900
Only Bob knows why.

1290
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,020
I knew the alley.

1291
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,040
So I thought he forgot the highways too.

1292
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:59,600
I knew the way around the alley.

1293
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:00,560
Yes.

1294
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:03,340
There's the back alleys of the airwaves of Dallas,

1295
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:03,520
Texas.

1296
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,960
You're going to find all kinds of weird things.

1297
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,640
The back alleys of Gotham City.

1298
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,620
Gotham City.

1299
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:10,940
This is a crime.

1300
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:11,420
We're in.

1301
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:11,660
Here we are.

1302
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:12,840
We're in Boston City.

1303
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:13,980
We're in Georgia.

1304
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:18,700
We're moving.

1305
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:19,620
We're moving to Concord.

1306
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,400
We're moving to Concord.

1307
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:40,240
It's not 14 ..."

1308
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:48,040
It's prescient.

1309
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,540
It's life too short to be pathological.

1310
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,580
Youcasie sons

1311
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:55,580
of Stanley,

1312
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:55,580


1313
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:55,600
Sean,

1314
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:55,600


1315
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:55,600


1316
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:56,380
HyperspÐ¾Ð¶Ðµ,

1317
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:56,380


1318
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,420
All passengers, please disembark.

1319
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,300
Over here now.

1320
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:15,860
Then the door closes behind you in safe, secure comfort.

1321
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:17,620
Tommy?

1322
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,520
Tommy?

1323
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,380
Tommy?

1324
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:23,440
Noise is heard.

1325
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,840
Resident believes possibly MMAs are in the area.

1326
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:06,680
Okay, kids, the car is packed.

1327
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,320
Now go and get your father and we'll look at some more new houses.

1328
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,240
Let you hold Mary dear to your heart.

1329
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:21,020
Well, the show is coming in for a landing here at the Bulldada Time Control Laboratories.

1330
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,060
And we'll have to sign off now.

1331
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:23,420
It's Sunday.

1332
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,940
I'm sorry that we have so little time on the air.

1333
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,320
And I want you to send some contributions in to us at the station here.

1334
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:39,340
KON90.9.

1335
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,780
But don't just send money.

1336
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,300
Send your whole wallet.

1337
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,800
Ah, yes, friend.

1338
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:46,140
And that way we'll save your soul.

1339
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,080
You send us your wallet, we'll save your soul.

1340
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,720
The Subgenius Radio Ministry is the hour of slack.

1341
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,540
That's right.

1342
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,180
Folks, I would recommend reading.

1343
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:53,560
It's free.

1344
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,280
Scripture 16, 14, 17, 18.

1345
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,180
And you can write for information on how to order these precious tapes.

1346
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:04,040
And we need blankets and contraceptives for those boys and girls in the home for slackless children.

1347
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,940
Your contributions keep those we hate starving to death.

1348
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:15,580
I command you to spill your gift seed pledge of 100 pounds of dollar bills on my lap.

1349
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:19,840
As this will buy modeling clay and transform the toys for those poor children.

1350
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,140
Dogs will bless you for planting this seed of faith.

1351
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,200
Ah, yes, friend.

1352
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:29,880
And now, the announcer will give you our mailing address.

1353
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:37,500

Bob, Bob, Bob.

1380
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,240
Drinking Budweiser.

1381
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,400
Watching Bob on TV.

1382
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:53,060
Watching Bob on TV.

1383
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,040
Oh, swallowing red men.

1384
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,800
The day my coon dog died.

1385
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:06,120
Reading the pamphlet.

1386
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,540
Over and over again.

1387
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:16,580
I was drinking Budweiser.

1388
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,580

1396
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,940
Good kick by a mule.

1397
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,140
I was with Cousin Junior.

1398
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,040
The DNA backfired.

1399
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,880
I was drunk.

1400
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,220
I was lonely.

1401
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,600
