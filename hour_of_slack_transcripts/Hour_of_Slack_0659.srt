1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
And now, Noble Subgenius Knight comes up over the hill and gets ready to slay the ugly dragon of the conspiracy.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,300
See, there it is.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:08,600
There it is.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,160
Long the eyes.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,580
So easy this time.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,440
Here you go.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,800
Do not over-medicate yourself with this show.

8
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,300
You should, however, listen more than once.

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:28,520
These are complex shows, more carefully orchestrated and more scientifically accurate than any previous form of art or expression in all of mankind's history.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,500
Do not operate heavy machinery while under the influence of these shows.

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,760
Car listening is legal but not recommended for first-time users.

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,460
Do not in any way attempt to dance to these tapes or shows.

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,600
The demons you see during the initial hallucination sequences are not real.

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,520
If you become frightened, try not to give up.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,540
The scene, no scene on this show lasts any longer than a minute or so, so don't panic during the hell scenes.

16
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,320
And surface from the show slowly.

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:05,580
At the end of the hour, because coming out of the show is sort of a total rebirth experience if you can do it successfully, that is.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,660
If you have trouble re-entering the earth plane after this show, focus on Bob and chant his name.

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,340
And then try to remember your own name and chant that for a while.

20
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,720
And don't eat for a couple of days after this show.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,020
Meet the Soap Genius.

22
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,860
Hour of Swat.

23
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,920
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

24
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,600
The next few hour...

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,500
Welcome to the subject.

26
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,340
Yes, friends.

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,040
Let's just get things moving here.

28
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,240
Just.

29
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,140
Build it up.

30
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,460
Oh, I love these new headphones, friends.

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,200
I love my new inner head.

32
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:13,960
I had my nose operated on and now there's a lot more room inside there.

33
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:27,500
And friends, this show tonight, I've got so much original new tape and original old tape and CDs from Sub-G Night.

34
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,500
That is.

35
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,700
We probably won't violate anybody's copyright at all this entire show.

36
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,260
Strange but true.

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,320
And I guess we might as well get right into it.

38
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,940
There's a lot of live radio tapes from WCSB in Cleveland.

39
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,040
The Einstein Secret Orchestra Swamp Radio Show.

40
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,640
More of that.

41
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,220
I spent last night all night long editing and mixing down.

42
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,020
The latest devival tapes of an actual subgenius pro revival.

43
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,800
A beautiful, beautiful thing.

44
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,780
The sound is not too bad on our new donated four-track Yamaha recording deck.

45
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,000
Praise Patrick Volkerding who donated that.

46
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,880
He's also the guy who markets Linux under the name Slackware.

47
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,400
Slackware.

48
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:25,600
The...

49
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,840
Um...

50
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,240
Ahem.

51
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,340
Operating system.

52
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:29,700
Okay.

53
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:29,880
What?

54
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,160
I'm distracted, friends.

55
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,420
Okay.

56
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,280
Let's go to whatever it is that's coming up next.

57
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:35,880
Live show.

58
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,280
Oh, and Gary Gabrog, friend, of all people from the olden days,

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,680
put the songs of the band that dare not speak its name on CD.

60
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,400
And that's what you're hearing in the background right now.

61
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,800
The band that dare not speak its name, of course, being the famous subgenius unknown band

62
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,040
with puzzling evidence.

63
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,320
Gary Gabrog, friend.

64
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,040
Senator Jay Kidney, who got religion and now edits Gnosis magazine.

65
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,680
And Palmer Vreedees, dear friend.

66
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,140
So let's, uh...

67
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,480
Heck, let's just check one of those out.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,300
Now that that instrumental just ended.

69
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,180
Okay.

70
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:19,920
Okay.

71
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,220
Okay.

72
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,060
Okay.

73
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,660
Okay.

74
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,100
Okay.

75
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,480
Okay.

76
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,040
Okay.

77
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:27,960


78
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:27,960


79
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:27,980


80
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:27,980


81
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:27,980


82
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:27,980


83
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:27,980


84
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:27,980


85
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:27,980


86
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:27,980


87
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:27,980


88
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:27,980


89
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:27,980


90
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:27,980


91
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,820
Okay.

92
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,560
Okay.

93
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:52,620
All right.

94
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,880
Okay.

95
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,320
Okay.

96
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,320


97
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,320


98
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,820
Do!

99
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:56,820


100
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:56,820


101
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,480
Oo!

102
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,020
Oo!

103
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,020


104
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,680
Oh, you poster of dobs

105
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,980
Oh, you scary, scary poster

106
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,060
Oh, you poster of dobs

107
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,500
One coloring, one color paper

108
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,400
If they just hold on and burn the thing I'd feel a little safer

109
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,840
It's black and white, but never red

110
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,440
It's just a creature of just a head

111
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,120
My wall is empty and my bank account's bled

112
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,640
I'm in this pen, but I wish I was dead

113
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,360
Oh, you poster of dobs

114
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,880
Oh, you scary, scary poster

115
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,020
Oh, you poster of dobs

116
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,160
Poster of dobs, why did you do this to me?

117
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,080
Now I've seen everything I never wanted to see

118
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,560
Now I'm everything I never wanted to be

119
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,020
Poster of dobs

120
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,120
And will I be free?

121
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,580
The grin is friendly, but I know it's a lie

122
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,000
Excuse me while I twitch and die

123
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,360
Oh, you poster of dobs

124
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,020
Oh, you scary, scary poster

125
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,400
Oh, you poster of dobs

126
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,580
And I've seen everything I never wanted to be

127
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,720
A-Yes, dear friends.

128
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,620
Poster of dobs by the band that dare not speak its name

129
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,000
For pretty obvious reasons,

130
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:53,340
That was the early days of some demons' classic horrible music

131
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,660
They were the band that dare not speak its name

132
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:08,540
The name was of the first water when it came to hellacious noise bands back then in the day.

133
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,160
Money.

134
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,960
I thought you guys were calling it Doshneckys Day.

135
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

136
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,880
Well, there's many names.

137
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,540
It does say Doshneckys.

138
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,300
Double X.

139
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,120
Double X.

140
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,220
What's that?

141
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,540
Druid neckies.

142
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:34,900
I heard that many people are really hoping it doesn't happen in 99 so that we can have the triple X day.

143
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,320
Well, that's the best brew of all.

144
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:48,720
You know, that's really ironic when you get to the point where it's like, well, I don't want the escape vessels of the sex goddesses to come yet because I'm having too much fun here on Earth.

145
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,120
On the crap planet.

146
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,680
Now, that is irony.

147
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,540
And perhaps yet more.

148
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,100
Perhaps that is cause for outrage.

149
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,500
Perhaps that is cause for optimism.

150
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,540
Perhaps we should.

151
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,160
Perhaps things are looking up.

152
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,100
Perhaps there's hope.

153
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,880
Yes, hope springs eternal in the bosom and the bowels and ballsacks of those who believe.

154
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,160
Faith springs eternal.

155
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,960
Oh, my faith was springing eternally right out of my old cassock.

156
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,480
Well, it's not enough really to get your attention.

157
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,280
You're going to have to put it right up by the microphone.

158
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,800
Bob.

159
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,280
Your gigantic.

160
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,020
Bob not here.

161
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,960
Put your phallus right up against the mic.

162
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,100
I'm slamming the mic with it.

163
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,120
No, no, no.

164
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,520
I'm slamming my love right against the mic.

165
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,220
No, that's not.

166
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,240
That's not right.

167
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,840
Nor meat.

168
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,480
And, uh, wait, that's not right either.

169
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,240
Excuse me.

170
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,880
I think I'm getting.

171
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,340
He could conceivably push it far back in his mind.

172
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,340
He could conceivably forget the whole thing.

173
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,620
But instead.

174
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,240
He.

175
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,020
He views with a rigorous mind and eye towards the future.

176
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,000
Pushed up, peeled him back down his throat.

177
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,520
Unhand me, you horned fiend.

178
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,700
I won't follow your way of evil.

179
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,780
For my sight is set on good.

180
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,680
Whatever that is.

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,160
I think it's what Bob said to do.

182
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,800
Yes, good.

183
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,400
But in that basement laboratory, a stang thought he was focused on something good.

184
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,640
His hands began to grow.

185
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,840
His ears.

186
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:24,920
Bob.

187
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,260
Bob said we should do good.

188
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,280
Well, now, whenever I grab this thing and yank on it, it feels good.

189
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,920
So I guess that's what Bob said to do.

190
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,460
I'll just sit here and do this forever and ever and ever, like Bob said.

191
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,920
Too much.

192
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,760
It's always loaded.

193
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,580
No, no.

194
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,680
It's always loaded.

195
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,440
But as he continued to fondle his diseased unit, he noticed that it got smaller and smaller.

196
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,340
The more he'd flip, the more it would disappear from his mind.

197
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:48,600
Wait, wait, wait.

198
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,860
Where's this thing going?

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,180
He thought it was going away.

200
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,760
Who are those people outside my door?

201
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,420
Oh, my God.

202
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,080
The normals.

203
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,820
The normals.

204
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,220
The normals.

205
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,220


206
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,220


207
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,220


208
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,480
The normals have taken your unit.

209
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,920
They're after all my units.

210
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,440
Oh, God.

211
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:58,860
I've got to hide.

212
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,520
I've got to hide.

213
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,600
Whatever I've got left of them.

214
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,200
Oh, there comes the normworms.

215
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,960
The normworms.

216
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,280
Oh, God.

217
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,500
I'll hide under the bed.

218
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,580
They're going right by.

219
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,160
Oh, my God.

220
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,680
The only, only old guys that got stangs peckers.

221
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,380
He's symbols of power.

222
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,000
He's what you call them.

223
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,680
What do they call them?

224
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:18,800
Things.

225
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,560
Oh, my God.

226
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,800
They're tearing off down the hill.

227
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,800
Hey, you guys.

228
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,060
Come back here with stangs peckers.

229
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:24,560
Oh, I'm.

230
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:24,660
I'm.

231
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,620
My sword.

232
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:25,860
He's.

233
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,600
Symbols of power.

234
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,020
Stop.

235
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,320
Get my.

236
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,160
Get my symbols back.

237
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,640
Their name.

238
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,260
Come on.

239
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:29,900
Go get them.

240
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,640
We've got to get the.

241
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,020
We've got to get the flying monkeys, man.

242
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,720
Those guys are already down the hill.

243
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,740
We'll never catch up with them.

244
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,220
They're wearing weird Oreo suits.

245
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,020
And they've got like chocolate things on top of their heads.

246
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,320
And.

247
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,920
Oh, my God.

248
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,720
Get my little pet woodpeckers back.

249
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,480
Come on.

250
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:43,800
Stop them.

251
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,980
Those little woodpeckers.

252
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,660
If they're not fed.

253
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,480
They'll die.

254
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,620
Oh, my God.

255
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,100
The woodpeckers will die.

256
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:49,740
Go down there.

257
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:49,820
No.

258
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,820
You've got to help me.

259
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,560
You've got to help me.

260
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,000
And give them an offer they can't refuse.

261
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:56,580
You know, like.

262
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,320
Give them.

263
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:57,940
Give them one of those.

264
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,400
Princess.

265
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:58,760
We are.

266
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
Hi, baby.

267
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,620
Okay.

268
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,420
Okay.

269
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,420
No, no, no.

270
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:02,640
You know.

271
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,540
Dirt on the sex, baby.

272
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,200
We've got to get Stan's peckers back.

273
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,640
Them woodpeckers have got to be fed.

274
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,140
Okay.

275
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,560
You see peckers?

276
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,020
Okay.

277
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,820
More like this.

278
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,440
Okay.

279
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,220
I'll go down and make them an offer they can't refuse.

280
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,500
Hi, baby.

281
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,420
You sure are cute for one of them sub-demons.

282
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:24,000
Could us normals like try to give some of your affairs for one of these bags full of

283
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,160
this.

284
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,120
Those old gross old chicken necks we found here.

285
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,800
Hi.

286
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,180
Yeah.

287
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:28,620
Hey.

288
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:28,760
Yeah.

289
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,060
I'm going to go get these chicken necks.

290
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,200
Hey.

291
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,220
She's run off again.

292
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,900
Where's she ran off?

293
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,200
Hey.

294
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:32,420
Hey.

295
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:32,800
She's run.

296
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,440
Oh, well.

297
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,140
I'm a normal.

298
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,840
I'm too lazy to chase after nothing.

299
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,080
I'm just going to sit and get back here and pick my nose.

300
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:38,780
Oh.

301
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,180
Oh.

302
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,120
Princess Wee.

303
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,720
Thank you for bringing back my bag of old chicken necks.

304
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,040
I mean.

305
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,260
Oh.

306
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,080
My woodpeckers.

307
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,800
They're a fuck.

308
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,200
Dave.

309
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:46,720
Dave.

310
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,160
Dave.

311
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,380
What would I do without you and Princess Wee to help us?

312
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,300
And now that you have been so good.

313
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,420
But here is your diploma.

314
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:55,860
Yes.

315
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,020
You have a brain after all.

316
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,540
Here's your heart, Princess Wee.

317
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:58,560
Oh.

318
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,000
Thank you.

319
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,680
Thank you.

320
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,280
And Chaz, here's your little dog.

321
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:01,740
Okay.

322
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,400
I'm a very bad wizard.

323
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:03,800
Goodbye.

324
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,580
And thank you.

325
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:04,840
Hey.

326
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,200
Wait a minute.

327
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,460
I'm going to go flip the tapes now.

328
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,420
On the manifesto.

329
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,700
It's all just a script.

330
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:08,940
Hey.

331
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,520
Wait a minute.

332
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,260
On the manifesto.

333
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:10,560
These things.

334
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,780
It's just that these aren't.

335
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,380
These aren't peckers.

336
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,080
They're not pecker.

337
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:13,880
Hey.

338
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,100
It's just these aren't pecker woods.

339
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,060
I mean woodpeckers.

340
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,140
Attention to the man behind the drawers.

341
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,800
It's just.

342
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,360
Hey.

343
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,740
Wait a minute.

344
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:21,880
Wait a minute.

345
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,180
Where'd he go?

346
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,000
He.

347
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,880
He disappeared.

348
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,940
In a mist.

349
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,680
In a flame.

350
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,720
Stag.

351
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,880
It's kind of eerie.

352
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,760
Stir up the ashes.

353
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,880
If you stir up the ashes, you've come whirling up out of the ashes.

354
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,260
Who are you, man?

355
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,840
He's gone.

356
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,080
Like a phoenix.

357
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,100
Who are you?

358
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,820
My name is Jaffe.

359
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,140
Jaffe?

360
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:49,840
Jaffe.

361
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,360
Jaffe?

362
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,540
Wabungle.

363
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:52,940
Wabungle.

364
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,020


365
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,740
What the hell kind of name is Wabungle?

366
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,920
Jaffe Wabungle?

367
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,500
Is that Polish or is that Italian?

368
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:02,420
I speak to you through the canyons of your mind.

369
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,760
Hey, man.

370
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,060
I knew I had some rugged scenery going on in the back of my head here, but I don't know

371
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,300
if I can canyons in here.

372
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,120
Jaffe Wabungle.

373
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,180
Okay.

374
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,380
Yeah.

375
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,580
Right.

376
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,580
Jaffe Wabungle.

377
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,240
Are you supposed to listen to this guy now or what?

378
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,740
Yes.

379
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,580
Dave.

380
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,280
Okay.

381
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,280
You stir the ashes.

382
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,600
Throw me around the edges.

383
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:18,720
Look.

384
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,000
Look, Dave.

385
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:20,820
You stir it.

386
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,220
Stir it.

387
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,420
Stir it.

388
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:21,440
Stir it.

389
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:21,500
Stir it.

390
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:21,560
Stir it.

391
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:21,620
Stir it.

392
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:21,660
Stir it.

393
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:21,660


394
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:21,660


395
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,460
Big, greasy spoon.

396
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,300
That's not going to make anything better.

397
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,380
Wait.

398
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,520
Here he is.

399
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,080
He's coming back from the mist.

400
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,140
Here he is.

401
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,660
It's staying with his whole cataracts and many thousands behind him.

402
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:38,260
Who else could dissolve into a pile of ashes and then spontaneously reemerge?

403
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,500
I smell some yummy cooking snot shirts.

404
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,220
Where'd you get those snot shirts, lonesome cowboy Dave?

405
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,420
Well, I got them from the WCSB, Radiothon, premium price, pledge-based,

406
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,240
place, pledge-a-thon.

407
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,880
You mean that if I called 216...

408
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,520
And, uh...

409
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,040
Well, friends, obviously, we're back in that beautiful pledged era...

410
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,560
And had a brain and had a brain and $75, I could get one of those sacred snot shirts, too?

411
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,160
Yes, yes.

412
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,240
A flooded snot shirt?

413
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,760
Yes.

414
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,360
With the DNA of the president all over it?

415
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:09,640
Yes.

416
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,040
Splattered neatly all over the top and bottom.

417
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,100
And look, it looks like a Jackson Pollock painting on the back here.

418
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,840
Look, it's beautiful the way it's swirled around there.

419
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,400
It might be sexual to some.

420
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,920
To others, it's a sign that society...

421
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:26,660
And look, on the back, the blood and semen of the special investigator team.

422
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,480
Oh, indeed.

423
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,620
Oh, they talk about star sperm and...

424
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:36,180
We've covered all the ground with filth.

425
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,980
Oh, look, it's Dave Brain on the floor.

426
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,900
Yeah, I see it.

427
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,000
Now, someone just said, like...

428
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,180
Oh, that's the old one.

429
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,600
We installed a new Dave Brain today.

430
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,000
You fools, that's...

431
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,440
Oh, really?

432
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,220
Yeah, if you notice, he kind of moves a little faster.

433
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,100
Brown sugar on that Dave Brain.

434
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,480
Oh, God, that's delicious.

435
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,180
Somebody put a little threon oil around my ankle.

436
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,860
He doesn't glitch anymore and kind of disappear for a second and static and reappear.

437
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,800
You noticed, yeah.

438
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,840
Now, it's smoother.

439
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,640
He generally...

440
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,480
You can't tell that much difference, but he does run a little bit...

441
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,280
A little faster, a little smoother.

442
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,580
It is a good image loss.

443
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,460
Let's drop out.

444
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,060
Is that a faster reading that's going on there?

445
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,720
Is a faster sampling time?

446
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,620
Yeah, much...

447
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,440
Well, about double what the old Dave...

448
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,980
The thing is, he doesn't cost any more than the old one did.

449
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,780
And you can't tell.

450
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,060
He can't even tell the difference.

451
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,320
Well, that's what I wanted to bring up with you guys.

452
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,660
This thing, you know, your image lock thing, how you were saying I was holding down pretty good here and I don't go off and so forth.

453
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:38,500
Sometimes, at certain times of the day, this thing will hold right down real tight to the floor and I cannot move any muscle or part of my body.

454
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,560
That's right.

455
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,420
It makes a sound like that.

456
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,080
But I can't go anywhere.

457
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,180
So you're saying that that's part of the new brain, the image lock?

458
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,900
It's all part of it, Dave.

459
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,040
It's all in the integrated system, Dave.

460
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,700
Once again, years go by and you still haven't figured out we're nothing but computer voices.

461
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
I like this.

462
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:07,640
And you're a spaceman lost endlessly in the black void of nirvana.

463
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,120
Space caveman.

464
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,020
In a tuna can.

465
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,960
In a tuna can.

466
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,340
In a tuna can.

467
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,840
In a tuna can.

468
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,600
In a tuna can.

469
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:18,720
In a tuna can.

470
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:18,720


471
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:18,720


472
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:18,820
In a tuna can.

473
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,420
I got a new brain.

474
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,880
I got a new brain.

475
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,240
I'm not quite insane.

476
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,400
I got a lot of things to do to do.

477
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,280
No thanks to you!

478
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,400
I could walk with the rest.

479
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,180
I could be a pest.

480
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,200
I can sing.

481
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,520
For a $10 pledge, you get an ashtray.

482
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,960
For a $15 pledge, you get a t-shirt.

483
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,440
Yes, dear friends.

484
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,540
And, you know, really, if your local station happens to be having a pledge drive,

485
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:13,200
remember, the Hour of Slack folks can't, you know, we're on tape,

486
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,720
and we can't tell you to call your local station the way we should.

487
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,240
And the way you should.

488
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,540
So do it, man.

489
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,200
You know, if it's that kind of a station.

490
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,360
What do I do next?

491
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,180
I don't know.

492
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,140
Push this button.

493
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,020
Holy soit.

494
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,420
건데.

495
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,920
fruit.

496
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:02,920


497
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,740
Fruit.

498
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:04,740


499
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:04,780
Fruit.

500
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,200
Fruit.

501
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:05,480
Ja?

502
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,400
Ja?

503
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,500
Ja.

504
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:09,840
Ja.

505
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,740
inaudible.

506
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:13,860
Ja?

507
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,680
Oh.

508
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,740
Ja?

509
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,960
Friends, you're listening to Bill T. Miller,

510
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,480
the Drum Army OBE out-of-band experience.

511
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,420
Actually, that's probably not Bill heard in the background,

512
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,800
but it is Bill at work, I believe.

513
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,460
Oh.

514
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,200
Oh.

515
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,720
Oh.

516
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,340
Oh.

517
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,420
Oh.

518
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,100
Oh.

519
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:00,900
Oh.

520
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,540
Oh.

521
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,060
Oh.

522
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,080


523
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,100


524
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,060

Thanks, Bill.

534
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,940
Whoa, man!

535
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,120
Yeah, man.

536
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,360
Ha, ha, ha!

537
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,900
Just don't out of your mind, man.

538
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,700
Ha, ha, ha!

539
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,740
Oh, ho!

540
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,980
Oh, my God!

541
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:33,980
Yeah!

542
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,040
All right, man.

543
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,000
Have a good one, man.

544
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,220
Let's go, man.

545
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,800
You got anything to eat, man?

546
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,180
Gross.

547
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:47,980
Check it out.

548
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,060
Ha, ha, ha!

549
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,900
Twist one up, man.

550
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,680
Let's get wasted.

551
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,760
I'm trying to come back a little bit anyway.

552
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:11,240
Ha, ha, ha!

553
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,120
Here, man, I have a sip on the magic lecture.

554
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,580
Go dig it.

555
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,300
Fuck it up.

556
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,560
Seems like all we ever do is get stoned and watch the tube, man.

557
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,360
Let's jam, man.

558
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,100
Come on, let's jam.

559
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,440
Me.

560
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,740
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

561
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:56,940
Oh.

562
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,640
That's what I have in here.

563
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,840
A little throat flush that I can chew off.

564
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,100
Man, I'm still hungry.

565
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,000
Oh.

566
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,660
I'm about to go home tonight.

567
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,440
Four bucks.

568
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,460
Loaded.

569
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,440
Eight forty-seven.

570
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,460
I'm gonna kill you.

571
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,040
Oh, what go, what go?

572
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,260
Nine to six, eight, wait.

573
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,780
Tower off, guys.

574
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,100
Tower months.

575
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,340
Bill T. Miller, dear friends.

576
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,100
Bill T. Miller at

577
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,620
Box 230-221.

578
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,840
Boston, Massachusetts.

579
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,580
Zero two, one two three.

580
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,640
I'll give that number again.

581
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,160
I'm gonna get some shit on my teeth by the way you were moving.

582
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,380
Holy hell!

583
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,960
I'm gonna get some shit on my teeth by the way you were moving.

584
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,460
I'm gonna get some shit on my teeth by the way you were moving.

585
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,320
I might not have been up top before doing this.

586
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,040
I might not have been up top before doing this.

587
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,240
Six one seven, lick, oh, yeah.

588
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,740
Losing my mind there.

589
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,900
I think you got another smash.

590
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:44,380
I think you got another smash.

591
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,520
Yeah, I think I did.

592
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,640
With a bullet.

593
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,440
Oh!

594
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,420
Hey, where have you guys been, man?

595
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,180
We're starving.

596
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,780
We're, you would believe this.

597
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,260
Oh, you wouldn't.

598
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,780
What did you get?

599
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,860
Jayhawk, man.

600
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,580
Oh, man.

601
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,620
Oh, man.

602
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:01,620


603
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,200
Oh, man.

604
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:05,980
Oh, man.

605
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,200
Oh, man.

606
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:07,920


607
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,900
Oh, man.

608
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,220
Oh, man.

609
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,060
Oh, man.

610
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,140
Oh, man.

611
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,140


612
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,260
Oh, man.

613
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,240
Oh, man.

614
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,680
Oh, man.

615
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,460
Oh, man.

616
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,040
Oh, dear friends.

617
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,260
Oh, dear friends.

618
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:18,120
Bill T. Miller, Box 230221.

619
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:24,380
That's Box 230221, Boston, Massachusetts, 02123.

620
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,400
And that's also BillTMiller.com.

621
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,640
One word, BillTMiller.com.

622
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,400
And that's a CD.

623
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:43,200
And it's, you know, these subgeniuses,

624
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,360
they do such wonderful work.

625
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,380
And yet they, you know, they never, MTV never calls.

626
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,960
You know what they do instead?

627
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,720
Their editors just rip us off, basically.

628
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,520
That's what it comes down to.

629
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:57,800
Hmm.

630
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,480
It's time she was disillusioned about him.

631
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,620
She was out of work.

632
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,380
She was drinking.

633
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,700
I trusted you once.

634
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,960
It was simply a very bad situation.

635
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,440
He was out of work.

636
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,180
He was drinking.

637
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,180
Well, I guess every family has to have its black sheep.

638
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,840
Well, it's someone who has a very unsavory reputation.

639
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,780
They're going to ensure that he receives the newest

640
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,660
and most sophisticated treatments available.

641
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,180
If he does now, then he'll have her under his thumb

642
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:33,980
for the rest of her life.

643
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,500
It was simply a very bad situation.

644
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,240
He was out of work.

645
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,080
He was drinking.

646
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,300
Fat chance of getting that promotion now.

647
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,420
We can't go on.

648
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:43,940
We can't go on like this.

649
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,920
We cannot go on like this.

650
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,340
I can't take any more of this, Frank.

651
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,480
Take me away.

652
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,160
Get me out of this place.

653
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,640
If it's the last thing I do.

654
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,340
Suddenly, Bob took me tenderly in his arms,

655
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,560
gazed longingly into my eyes,

656
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,920
pulled my lips closer to his and said,

657
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,460
darling, you know it makes me wild

658
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,980
when you listen to the subgenius hour of slack

659
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,400
with the heart-melding Reverend Ivan's voice.

660
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,480
I'm going to stay on insert station ID here.

661
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,060
Then he spilled hot pipe ashes down the front of my dress.

662
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,980
So I slapped him and kicked him down the front steps.

663
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,720
Men are such cattle.

664
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,240
This week's hour of slack is brought to you by

665
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,840
GE, godless energies.

666
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,320
We bring unclean things to life.

667
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

668
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,920
Because when you're out,

669
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,080
when you're out having your divitals out there,

670
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,820
in Africa, where there's so many unsaved people,

671
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:52,480
you need to have that hooded sweatshirt.

672
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,960
It'll keep you safe from the cosmic particles.

673
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:03,080
It's like having a new brain when you're sending your pledge.

674
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,880
Sending your pledge.

675
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:09,960
You'll be better off then if you was dead.

676
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,940
If you was dead.

677
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,820
This is not a Matt Drudge or a Nat Dredge pledge.

678
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,160
This is a real pledge.

679
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,260
This is a pledge from the sincerest bottom of your bottom.

680
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,620
You've got to come through, buddy.

681
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,140
We're waiting for you.

682
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,800
You and Jane and all the rest.

683
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,800
Get off it, man, and get on it.

684
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,540
Yes.

685
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,100
Because, you know, Nietzsche said,

686
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,340
that which does not kill me makes me stronger.

687
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:43,060
And J.R. Bob Dobbs said, that's what kills me.

688
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,060


689
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,060


690
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,060


691
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:46,520
That which I do not kill only gets stronger.

692
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,700
Now, he lied to me.

693
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,380
He applauded.

694
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,220
Now, that's a good line, right?

695
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,340
Here's the problem.

696
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,840
Bob didn't say that.

697
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,240
Here's what Bob really said, starting now.

698
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,580
Nietzsche never said that which does not kill.

699
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,180
That which.

700
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,000
OK.

701
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,720
Here's the way Bob said this.

702
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,840
The way I say it, you all laughed and went, yeah, that makes sense.

703
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,100
Here's the way Bob originally really said it.

704
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,980
Bob said, Nietzsche never said, that which does not kill me

705
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,320
only makes me stronger.

706
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:27,580
And I never said, anything I don't kill only goes stronger.

707
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,360
Got me?

708
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,760
Bob Dobbs.

709
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,060
Again, you'll have to listen back to the tape

710
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,440
to even figure it out.

711
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:35,980
No, I'm right now.

712
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,020
.

713
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,720
Oh, man.

714
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,040
Hey, Bob.

715
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,040


716
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,040


717
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:51,000
You know, there's a, don't get mixed up to where you, you're supposed to go where the

718
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,780
finger points.

719
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,960
You don't suck on the finger, understand?

720
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,180
Although, yeah, I know, I know.

721
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,840
Praise Bob.

722
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,380
Oh, it says here, rant about the Y2K, the millennium bug.

723
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,140
I'll bet you all are real.

724
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,020
Well, actually, there probably are some people here who are going, man, you're too good.

725
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,280
I mean, it's the year 2000.

726
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,600
That computer glitch is getting, oh, it's two digits.

727
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,600
And all of a sudden, nothing's going to work anymore.

728
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,660
The econocataclism's going to work.

729
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:24,580
Blah, blah, woof, woof, the, the, I better, you know, sell all my stocks now and so forth.

730
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:32,340
Friends, number one, you don't have to worry about the year 2000 bug because you're dues

731
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:37,040
paying subgeniuses, I trust most of you, and you're going to be ruptured up on the ischemic

732
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,080
vessels on X, X day, July 5th, 1999.

733
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,140
Duh!

734
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,540
.

735
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,780
So who cares about the millennium bug?

736
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,580
We'll be long gone.

737
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,020
All right.

738
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:53,880
Well, okay, may, well, I know I have a little leg to explain it to you.

739
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,820
.

740
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:06,480
I see my enemies before me like a thousand thousand blades of grass blowing in the wind.

741
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,640
.

742
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,100
Yes.

743
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,020
.

744
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,120
.

745
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,160
.

746
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,440
.

747
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,080
No.

748
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:23,780
.

749
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:23,860
.

750
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:23,860


751
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:23,860


752
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:23,860


753
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:23,860


754
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:23,860


755
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:23,860


756
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:23,860


757
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:28,880
This is dismal, I'm gonna cut the guy up and leave.

758
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:29,460


759
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,820
Wait a second, okay.

760
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,720
Let's hurry.

761
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:31,860


762
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,260
We got one minute .

763
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,980
Hold on...

764
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,160
.

765
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,160


766
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,160


767
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,420
.

768
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:36,540
.

769
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:36,580
.

770
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:36,640
.

771
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:36,660
.

772
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:36,700
.

773
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:36,740
.

774
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:36,820
.

775
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,400
We must get our target.

776
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,140
If we do not get the target...

777
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,740
Wait, he's coming in.

778
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,160
We're going to be facing a lot of...

779
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,660
He's in the bathroom.

780
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,160
Shelby just made some potatoes.

781
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:46,960
She's calling...

782
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,020
He's in the bathroom now.

783
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,980
We can get him in the bathroom.

784
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:49,480
Yes.

785
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,200
Come out with your hands up.

786
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,840
So good to get my hands washed.

787
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,340
Oh, what?

788
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,100
What, what, what?

789
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,180
Come out with your...

790
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,880
Come out with your hands washed.

791
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,820
Wash your hands and come on out of here.

792
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,000
Reverend Ivan Koresh,

793
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,960
come out of there with your hands up.

794
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,020
All of you.

795
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
We know there's more than one of you in there, Stang.

796
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,040
We know you're...

797
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,000
We have tanks.

798
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,260
We have flamethrowers.

799
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,940
And we're not afraid to use them on you crackpots.

800
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,320
You're costing the FBI and the BATF

801
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,760
over $7,000 billion a day.

802
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,100
That's the American people you're talking about there.

803
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,860
I'm not schizophrenic again.

804
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,040
Stang's behind the door.

805
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,980
Now, if you don't think we can make it look like

806
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,700
you burned your entire building down

807
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,600
while burning your entire building down,

808
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,920
then you've got another thing coming.

809
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,120
Like these flamethrower tanks through your front window.

810
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,680
Fruitcake.

811
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,320
Yep, that's what they...

812
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,560
That was how it all began.

813
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,820
The siege of Dallas.

814
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,500
It was...

815
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,340
The tanks and the heli...

816
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,680
Heli-o-copters were coming in on us.

817
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,220
I remember it too, Stang.

818
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:00,940
So?

819
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,500
You could hear them choppers off into the night.

820
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,860
Chicka-chicka-chicka-chicka.

821
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,460
We...

822
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:05,820
We...

823
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:05,960
We...

824
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,420
We sent the first wave of bobbies out

825
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,680
right into the line of fire.

826
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,820
There they went.

827
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,540
All the most irritating, obnoxious,

828
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,120
the ones that never got the hint,

829
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,160
the ones we always wanted to get rid of.

830
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,020
They were the first to go.

831
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,680
Then there was the sub-demuses that meant well,

832
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,600
but just weren't all that funny.

833
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,620
Yep, they were the next line to die.

834
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:32,480
Then there was the ones that just hadn't spent quite that much.

835
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,160
Hadn't they could have bought that T-shirt and didn't.

836
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,940
They was the next...

837
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,160
They was the next line.

838
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,900
Then there was those that didn't pledge to the station.

839
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,460
Yep, yep, yep.

840
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,960
Then there was finally...

841
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,560
There wasn't nobody left but me and Philo.

842
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,280
But I ain't Philo.

843
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:45,900
And...

844
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,940
And...

845
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,260
Who the...

846
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,240
Who the hell are you?

847
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,020
I thought you were there during the siege of Dallas.

848
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:51,960
You...

849
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:52,940
Oh, I...

850
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:57,120
I was the last sole survivor of the siege of Dallas.

851
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,520
I killed Philo Drummond by a knife to the throat

852
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,200
with my own red-gray hand.

853
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,000
You...

854
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,160
You mean you took your...

855
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,740
You took some Philo dough like them Greeks make with peachy and stuff

856
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,960
and you stabbed him in the neck with it?

857
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,880
I killed the emperor at the last second.

858
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,460
It was he that had led to all the evil and horror.

859
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,360
The last emperor?

860
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,500
Philo was the evil devil of the subgenius.

861
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,740
And I, it turned out, strangely enough, was the angel.

862
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,740
The angelic white knight in armor, you might say.

863
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:26,940
I see.

864
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,860
What saved Bob's word for...

865
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,320
Well, for what it's worth,

866
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,380
didn't ever amount to much.

867
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:37,160
All said and done, they all ended up on their heads.

868
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,680
They sat back down in the stands, old man.

869
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,380
It's a state of affairs, as it turned out.

870
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,120
Bob, I don't know, look at that raggedy old flag up there.

871
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:48,960
It's tattered.

872
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,500
Blood dripping from it, but still, it stirs the heart.

873
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,420
See that tattered old time control flag up there?

874
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,640
The Portuguese flag with the clock on it.

875
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:02,300
Flying over a little tent compound here in the concentration camp on the reservation.

876
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,300
Heh.

877
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:03,880
Heh.

878
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,520
Thought we were gonna keep the normals on the reservation.

879
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,060
Yeah.

880
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,580
Is that a thing, huh?

881
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,120
Heh.

882
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,920
I went out and shined up the barbed wire today.

883
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,860
I guess Bob's joke was on us, now, wasn't it?

884
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,420
Heh.

885
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,060
Wish I'd pledged.

886
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,140
I could have.

887
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:21,540
Yeah, got the brillo pad and went out and shined up at least three acres of the barbed wire today.

888
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,340
So many things I could have done.

889
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,820
Now it really looks like home.

890
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,920
If only I'd have practiced what I preached.

891
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,100
I thought I wasn't the kind I was preaching to.

892
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,540
You never did practice what you preached to.

893
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:39,240
Empire, emperors and tyrants never think they're the ones they're preaching to.

894
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:44,520
But it's so meaningful.

895
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:54,660
And as the years drew on, the boy knew that the old man had imparted in him some special wisdom.

896
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,940
A special strength.

897
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:03,980
A meaning for his own life that he could no longer describe any more than he could tie his own facial hair.

898
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:15,260
He knew that his mission was, if not to liberate every being on Earth, to destroy them all in a holocaust of fire, oatmeal and cheese.

899
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,240
I dream on and dream on.

900
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,260
I dream on and dream on.

901
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,360
And so he kept the disheveled on the land, the back of his steed of anger.

902
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,360
As he drove east and west, asking forgiveness and strange questions.

903
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,880
Oh, Bob, forgive me.

904
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,800
Stay.

905
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,140
There was a dress.

906
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,240
When they burned down Dallas.

907
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:33,600
Hey.

908
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:33,920
Ha!

909
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,320
How'd you get out alive?

910
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,280
I noticed a lot of scars on your buttocks.

911
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,880
It looks like you got third degree.

912
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:47,880
Well, I, well, I traitorously turned, turned against Bob, killed Philo and turned Bob into the state authorities.

913
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,300
Thought I, thought I'd save my own butt that way.

914
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,060
Of course.

915
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,700
Then what happened to Bob and the state authorities?

916
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,080
Turned out Bob was the state authorities.

917
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,120
That was what was the joke.

918
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,080
Amateurs.

919
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,940
Amateurs certainly do.

920
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,360
Amateurs certainly do.

921
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:04,360


922
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:04,360


923
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,460
They make a lot of noise, don't they?

924
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,200
Amateurs.

925
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,580
Mere amateurs.

926
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,020
Well, that actually looks like something psychosexual.

927
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:16,840
Two pounds, 200 miles by the year 2000.

928
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:23,700
Yeah, friends, let's drag ourselves up out of this morass of nostalgia and sadness and look ahead to the future.

929
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,700
But wait.

930
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:33,040
Chaz just displayed to us a photograph in model rocketry magazine of a spaceship built by a common human.

931
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,360
Well, or subterranean.

932
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:34,360


933
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:34,360


934
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:34,620
A genius.

935
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,460
We don't even know.

936
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,540
A bipedal earthling.

937
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,480
It was exploding dildos, dang.

938
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,900
It wasn't even a part of a company.

939
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,640
An amateur.

940
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,960
An amateur spaceship builder.

941
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,120
That's a photo of an exploding dildo.

942
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,360
A mere upstart.

943
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,220
It looks good.

944
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,040
It's not a real one, dang.

945
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,840
It was an exploding dildo from the back of that Dirty Bee book you brought in.

946
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,240
It was?

947
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:53,880
Yes.

948
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,280
Now, but this one.

949
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,460
Right here.

950
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,400
Look at the tail on that thing.

951
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,060
The beautiful common tail.

952
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,100
Chaz's.

953
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:01,660
Look.

954
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,400
Chaz's.

955
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,280
Say, wouldn't this be a good picture?

956
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,400
The rocket fuel booster is getting solid.

957
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,600
I think I'll build that one.

958
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,280
Oh, that looks like one of those Buck Rogers.

959
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:14,080
That other one was built by a piker.

960
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,480
Yes, by a piker.

961
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,380
The Mars to Venus Express.

962
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,160
Oh, it is the Mars to Venus Express.

963
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,660
And look at all the little windows you can look out at the cosmos floating by.

964
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,900
Oh, you can play it like a flute.

965
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,300
He's kind of got this sort of evil look in his eyes.

966
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:27,840
Who's that?

967
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,940
The guy in the Lunar Express?

968
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,680
The evil look there.

969
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,100
Like, he's up to no good.

970
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,400
Yes, he is up to no good.

971
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,120
I'm afraid that.

972
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,200
I think, sure, this is just an amateur rocket,

973
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,060
but it can hold some professional anthrax germs.

974
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,520
Okay, now let's remember this is radio,

975
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,240
so it is holding anthrax germs,

976
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,320
but you have to make, like, sort of a...

977
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,320
It was a long silvery tube-like thing,

978
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,580
and it had tube-like wings coming out of it,

979
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,420
and a bunch of this red dust shooting out of the butt of it.

980
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,060
Okay, that was a brief description.

981
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,140
I didn't mean to make you go asleep.

982
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,220
Those were the anthrax germs.

983
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,480
These are the germs leaving the...

984
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,180
used as part of the fuel of the amateur rocket,

985
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,740
zooming over football stadiums in Kansas,

986
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,220
over McDonald's in California,

987
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,820
over the Eiffel Tower in France,

988
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,580
spreading coughs and sneezes and conniption fits

989
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,560
and heart attacks wherever it went.

990
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,600
And in the liquid...

991
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,040
It's mutated subgenius anthrax pills

992
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,040
raining down upon all the cities over which it flew.

993
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,080
And it was a beautiful sight.

994
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,160
The Christmas gift rocket of the subgeniuses.

995
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:41,200
The first amateur launching of a special...

996
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,020
They called it Santa's Big Helper.

997
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,920
Sycanta's Gigantic Psycho Helper.

998
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,140
And the payload was only two pounds.

999
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,900
It was locked in the moon page.

1000
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,780
Two pounds can make a lot of really potent germs.

1001
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:01,040
Now, can you actually make a solid fuel

1002
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,940
out of...

1003
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,880
the lodgings of the moon page?

1004
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:06,540
Absolutely.

1005
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,920
Solid fuel from your moon pants?

1006
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,620
I think so.

1007
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,940
Yes, yes, it's absolutely true.

1008
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,340
It's like a ducks and geese kind of thing.

1009
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,640
It goes back on its shell.

1010
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:20,000
Yes, and it's a very, very synergistic experience.

1011
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,280
Perhaps it is like a stuffed snake

1012
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,400
in a forest of underwear.

1013
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,840
Why, it's bleep out!

1014
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,660
It's bleep out!

1015
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,920
Why, I can smell the hair growing around me.

1016
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:31,920


1017
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:31,920


1018
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,120
I just found it.

1019
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,360
Wow, you're live and I'm on the phone.

1020
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,700
Look it, here's a picture.

1021
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,580
I can tell you're miked tonight, Sang.

1022
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,340
No, no, it's my operation has made my voice

1023
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,120
sound so much more hollow.

1024
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,600
It's bleep out!

1025
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:01,920


1026
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,040
Hot

1027
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,440
drivel night

1028
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,020
underneath

1029
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,760
fluorescent skies

1030
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,380
bon, fires rage

1031
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:29,820
strange

1032
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,720
wild ways

1033
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,340
Shouting three kinds of faces

1034
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:38,720
In the guise of a fire in the air

1035
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,600
The wind kisses the burning glass

1036
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,660
You can hear the fire in the lines

1037
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,580
You can hear them cry

1038
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,920
Be the jewel of all my life

1039
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,720
Never a tear on my heart and breath

1040
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:20,220
Lie, paralyzed, a brave prey

1041
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,600
Who lives dying and is surrounded

1042
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,420
By angry spirits, hunters

1043
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:28,700
Who lives dying and is surrounded

1044
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:58,680
By angry spirits, hunters

1045
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:28,660
Who lives dying and is surrounded

1046
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:47,600
By angry spirits, hunters

1047
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,660
Who lives dying and is surrounded

1048
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:58,660
By angry spirits, hunters

1049
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:16,200
Who lives dying and is surrounded

1050
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:57,980
By angry spirits, hunters

1051
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:58,660
Who lives dying and is surrounded

1052
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,700
They really are.

1053
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,120
And at the same time, they never admit that to you.

1054
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,800
And again, it's because of the saying, well, they're just like us.

1055
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,180
We're just like any other religion.

1056
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,940
It's not, I mean, come on, face it.

1057
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,120
It's not that we love Bob all that much now.

1058
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:17,700
It's really that we like the idea of the rest of them burning in hell forever.

1059
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,580
Just like any other religion at least will come out and admit it.

1060
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:29,740
But, no, man, because, you know, when they get saved, it proves they're right and everybody else is wrong.

1061
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:35,240
All those people that called you a kook ever since you were a kid.

1062
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:40,840
Remember when you were a little kid and there was a little old lady down the street probably or something like that.

1063
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,300
And you and your little brother would go see that little old lady.

1064
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:48,000
And she'd give you a Coke or, you know, some soda pop just because you came by.

1065
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:53,180
And the nice old, you know, crossing guard attendant.

1066
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,200
That used to tell you little funny jokes and stuff.

1067
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,980
And your little brother.

1068
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,400
Think of all those people.

1069
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:05,620
Those are the people that we're going to kill next July 5th, 1999.

1070
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,560
When our prediction finally comes true, dear friends.

1071
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,120
People, where are you going?

1072
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,300
On each Sunday morning.

1073
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,480
While you pray to your monster.

1074
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,160
The kids are home watching porn.

1075
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,300
And do they really see.

1076
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,760
Beyond rose crowns of thorns.

1077
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,900
That the mall that they're building.

1078
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:45,740
Is where my red brother was born.

1079
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,920
There's only one sin.

1080
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,040
There's only one sin.

1081
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,200
Is a dirt taxi and a bit

1082
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,860
And a down from above.

1083
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,980
And the down from above.

1084
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:56,560
There is no change for me.

1085
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:56,560


1086
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,160
People dying in guilt.

1087
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,780
people die in guilt.

1088
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:02,260
Instead of living in love.

1089
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,340
Is that all there is to the sinful present.

1090
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:04,340


1091
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:04,340


1092
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,440
People dying in guilt.

1093
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,580
are being converted to father men.

1094
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,520
Instead of living in love.

1095
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,260
How can minds be hidden completely from future attention.

1096
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:15,260


1097
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:20,980
Why do we live in the middle of nothing at all?

1098
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:21,280
And other people kill life,

1099
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:21,280


1100
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:21,280


1101
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,520
This is a love cult, isn't it, Ian?

1102
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:26,000
He must be living in the leap.

1103
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,380
Well, it was more like a cheap date cult.

1104
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,380
That's it.

1105
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:43,000
And you know, friends, the ones who most hate the queers and homosexuals and preverts and other weirdos,

1106
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:49,800
those who most hate homosexuality, I think, are the ones who are most terrified of catching it.

1107
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:50,980
You know?

1108
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,140
I think that's what's really behind that.

1109
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,360
Now, me, I'm a bisexual.

1110
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:59,420
When you bite up from our sales table, I come.

1111
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:00,420
Okay?

1112
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,260
That's my sex thing, in case anybody ever wants it.

1113
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,340
That's what I get off on.

1114
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:11,840
But, you know, friends, we need those weirdos and perverts.

1115
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,520
They're the only thing standing between this society and total normalcy, I think, someday.

1116
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,180
I don't care if there's hair around.

1117
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:21,460
I don't care if there's hair around it.

1118
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,540
Come on, let's go in deeper.

1119
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,060
That's what Leifo said one night.

1120
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,280
Yes, friends.

1121
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,820
The conspiracy is real.

1122
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:35,960
There's a lot of stuff.

1123
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:41,200
You know, you look at subgenie shit and go, well, you know, I don't know about Bob.

1124
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,240
I know he's kind of hard to get hold of.

1125
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,600
And I don't know about these aliens from Planet X and all that.

1126
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:51,260
But, you know, when they talk about the conspiracy, I think they're talking about the conspiracy.

1127
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,180
I think I know what they mean.

1128
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:56,400
They must be talking about, you know, the conspiracy that killed John Kennedy and the

1129
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,060
Dealey Plaza.

1130
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:57,700
No, no.

1131
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,420
No, man.

1132
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:04,100
They mean like the bigger conspiracy of the fashions and the trends, man, that make you

1133
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,640
feel like you're not cool unless you just spent $150 on a haircut that shows that you

1134
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,740
don't care how you look, man.

1135
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:16,680
Or they go, no, it's a conspiracy of the crashed UFOs on the air bases, blah, blah, whoop,

1136
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:17,360
whoop, and so forth.

1137
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,700
Friends, if only.

1138
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,460
If only.

1139
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:24,560
If only the conspiracy was that smart, we'd be able to deal with it.

1140
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:27,800
We're talking about a conspiracy that doesn't even know it's a conspiracy.

1141
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,100
And it is real.

1142
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:32,880
And it really is the conspiracy of the normal people.

1143
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,400
And they mean well.

1144
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,300
But friend, what are you going to do?

1145
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,540
Understand your enemy to death?

1146
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,840
You already understand the normal.

1147
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:47,300
And there's nothing you can do about working that job if you hate that.

1148
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,480
I mean, you can quit your job.

1149
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:48,920
There.

1150
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:55,700
So, you want to do it.

1151
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:56,800
I mean...

1152
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,420
I don't want to.

1153
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:57,800
I want to, man, yeah, I just don't want to.

1154
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,360
I tried to outsmart幫 ski.

1155
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,200
I tried to make好 spell out your best day.

1156
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,740
I didn't like the shortcut, the vulgar name.

1157
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,340
Yeah, I'm saying that.

1158
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:03,800
Well, anyway...

1159
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:08,240
Why don't we sing it here?

1160
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:08,240


1161
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,580
But my favorite part is that nobody on the show really's going to need this song.

1162
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,220
I'm just gonna...

1163
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:13,220


1164
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,840
But here?

1165
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,420
There's no raw music, so...

1166
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:19,580
Well, I love the пут த Now, awake people.

1167
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,120
I ran into somebody the other day who said,

1168
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,140
Reverend Stang, I think all your stuff sucks,

1169
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,980
but you guys played the first Devo song I ever heard.

1170
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,340
I never heard them on the radio.

1171
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:34,080
I heard it on your weird subgenius show.

1172
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:38,300
And this person later went on to run the Devo fan club or something.

1173
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,940
Another person came up and said,

1174
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:44,700
well, I don't understand this, but you guys played, you know, what was it?

1175
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,880
It was like the Fireside Theater.

1176
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,860
The first time I ever heard of Fireside Theater is from you guys.

1177
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,420
Nobody ever talks about that stuff.

1178
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,560
Well, friends, the conspiracy is real,

1179
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,460
and the Church of the Subgenius,

1180
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,600
we may not be good for a whole lot, but we're good for something.

1181
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,320
We've somewhere out there is some guy that didn't,

1182
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:09,240
or some woman that didn't kill itself at that particular moment

1183
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,820
because found out just in the nick of time

1184
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:15,800
it wasn't the only crazy mother in the neighborhood.

1185
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:16,760
There were.

1186
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:16,860
There were.

1187
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,200
Others around who were just as weird.

1188
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,560
And therefore that person didn't die,

1189
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:26,380
and someday that person will go on to create a cure for cancer or AIDS

1190
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,320
or something like that.

1191
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,140
We'll never know that we did the right thing,

1192
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,420
but somewhere along the line,

1193
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,440
in between all those pipe loads of cattle crops that we lost,

1194
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,260
Bob must have done something right.

1195
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:41,580
So, you know, friends, like I said,

1196
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:45,520
you know, we don't join Church of the Subgenius

1197
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,800
because you want to be together.

1198
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,120
You don't want to be together with a bunch of other weirdos

1199
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:48,600
living around.

1200
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,620
You don't want to hang around with these people all day.

1201
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,960
You know, maybe a few of them,

1202
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,640
but what you really want is just to be left alone,

1203
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,900
be left in peace, do your own slack the way you want it.

1204
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,280
Friends, I'll say it one more time.

1205
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,940
You can be alone with Bob Dawes.

1206
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,440
By the hands of...

1207
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,320
And you can...

1208
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,120
Well, you can be alone with Bob.

1209
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,680
All by yourself.

1210
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,620
You can be...

1211
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,660
You can be...

1212
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:16,700
You can be...

1213
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:16,860
You can be...

1214
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:36,760
Like a IoT with a battery.

1215
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,240
This thing's just not working.

1216
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:39,240


1217
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:39,240


1218
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:39,240


1219
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,760
We got two more.

1220
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,300
Oh, and we got three more,

1221
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,380
just for this one.

1222
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:42,660
So, Bob Dromfield

1223
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,080
and I were on the same side.

1224
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,380
Just like four lights.

1225
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:45,860
But, dude, you know,

1226
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:45,980
and I dunno what said that.

1227
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:45,980


1228
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:45,980


1229
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:45,980


1230
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:46,840
everyone dumped the開greners on putting theiniers back next to theISTGX,

1231
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:46,840


1232
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:46,840


1233
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:47,960
cold bucket

1234
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,760
from the hands

1235
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,460
above

1236
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:56,800
from the hands above

1237
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,980
from the hands above

1238
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:01,980


1239
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,900
empty pocket

1240
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,820
like the devil's

1241
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,760
gotta buy outside

1242
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,420
of it

1243
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,620
like the heat from a

1244
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,740
stone cold locket

1245
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,220
like the hands

1246
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:17,700
above

1247
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,340
like the hands

1248
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:22,940
above

1249
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,700
ticking like a clock

1250
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,320
like the hands above

1251
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,960
taking you round the block

1252
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,920
like the hands

1253
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,500
above

1254
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:38,560
like the hands above

1255
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,680
gonna charge up

1256
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,500
that rocket

1257
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,720
like the hands

1258
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:44,900
above

1259
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:45,680
turning your life

1260
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,720
into a rocket

1261
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,720
Sh sais that $30

1262
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,380
banished pocket

1263
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:53,700
我們把 Summer

1264
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,740
Sun제라고

1265
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,780
from the hands

1266
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,180
above

1267
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,280
to the

1268
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,980
hand

1269
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,860
of love

1270
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:12,640
ru

1271
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,740
take first

1272
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,740
all

1273
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:15,720
but it's also Him.

1274
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,980
If you're in this room hearing this right now,

1275
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,320
it's because you're in exactly the right place

1276
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,220
that Bob wanted you to be

1277
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,520
for you to be able to hear what we're saying right now.

1278
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,840
By the hands of Bob.

1279
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,960
By the hands of Bob.

1280
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,200
Burning you down.

1281
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,780
By the hands of Bob.

1282
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,980
Turning you around.

1283
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,700
From the hands of Bob.

1284
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,080
From the hands of Bob.

1285
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,460
From the hands of Bob.

1286
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,100
Slopping you upside the head.

1287
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,440
From the hands of Bob.

1288
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,060
Make you wish you were better off than dead.

1289
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,220
From the hands of Bob.

1290
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,980
Oh, those hands were giving me the eye.

1291
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,080
From the hands of Bob.

1292
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,300
And I'll never say goodbye.

1293
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,240
From the hands of Bob.

1294
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,300
Our friends by the hands of Bob.

1295
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,680
From the hands of Bob.

1296
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:16,080
Someday it's gonna be.

1297
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,540
By the hands of Bob.

1298
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,080
The world will take a peek.

1299
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,500
From the hands of Bob.

1300
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,180
You're gonna hear a sight and a sound.

1301
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:28,280
From the hands of Bob.

1302
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,780
The world comes tumbling down.

1303
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,060
From the hands of Bob.

1304
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,620
Gonna knock you off your feet.

1305
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:40,080
Gonna keep you out of your seat.

1306
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,420
From the hands of Bob.

1307
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,780
From the hands of Bob.

1308
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:45,180
Make you come here again.

1309
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,460
From the hands of Bob.

1310
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,040
Like you're doing a bad Bob Dylan imitation.

1311
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,180
From the hands of Bob.

1312
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,860
You will be felt up.

1313
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,060
From the hands of Bob.

1314
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,400
You will be beat up.

1315
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,780
From the hands of Bob.

1316
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,220
You'll be bandaged and healed.

1317
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,780
From the hands of Bob.

1318
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:09,380
You'll get your whole brain healed.

1319
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,580
From the hands of Bob.

1320
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:12,580
From the hands of Bob.

1321
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,080
Hands of Bob.

1322
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,400
From the hands of Bob.

1323
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,660
You'll hand your money over to.

1324
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,140
The hands of Bob.

1325
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,620
Send that $30 in.

1326
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,900
To the hands of Bob.

1327
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,200
I don't know what I'm gonna say now.

1328
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,580
From the hands of Bob.

1329
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:31,760
They'll probably explain it.

1330
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,980
I don't think they will.

1331
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,500
From the hands of Bob.

1332
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:35,780
Oh speaking of pills.

1333
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,700
I probably got some in the pill.

1334
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:40,100
From the hands of Bob.

1335
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,960
By the hands of Bob.

1336
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,540
Blipo, you look great.

1337
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,460
Oh, this is a beautiful toffeta dress, Blipo.

1338
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:10,420
I have never seen you stacked up in anything like this before.

1339
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:16,320
I'm in a panty forest on 52nd Street.

1340
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,780
How intimate. Tell us more.

1341
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,060
Intimate and yet lingerie.

1342
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,740
Are any of those panties edible?

1343
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,160
I don't know. I don't think so, no, because they were all washed.

1344
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:32,320
Well, over on Lex, there's like a dildo village, I guess, that you can wander through in the middle of the night.

1345
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
That's an apartment complex, the dildo village apartments.

1346
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,360
We were just showing those tonight as part of the...

1347
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,260
How much do those go for?

1348
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:41,280
Is it okay to say dildo on the radio now?

1349
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,460
I don't think so.

1350
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:43,080
Oh, okay.

1351
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,520
No, a dildo's not a real object. It's a fake word, so we can say it.

1352
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,100
Oh, okay.

1353
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,460
Let's not say that one anymore.

1354
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,180
It's a character from Lord of the Rings.

1355
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:51,060
Yes, yes, exactly.

1356
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,020
Lord of the Rings, actually. The Harvard Lampoon...

1357
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,020
Dildo Dabbit.

1358
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:03,000
No, yeah, it was Dildo the Hobbler, because I guess his knees had been bruised after crawling through that wonderful, numinous village down there on Lex.

1359
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,040
I would not talk about that.

1360
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:09,000
It's what they make that herb pizza with, isn't it?

1361
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:09,920
The dildo?

1362
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,180
Can you give us a list?

1363
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,920
It's the rest of everything we're not supposed to talk about.

1364
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:17,180
Don't talk about the pumpkins and the squirrels. The squirrels inside the pumpkins.

1365
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,280
Oh, man.

1366
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:21,500
I wonder how many of the kids are going to notice that this year.

1367
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:32,060
Well, you know, we just did a revival here in town, and there was a pumpkin on the stage the whole time, and not one subgenius grabbed it and, you know...

1368
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:33,280
A veiled one.

1369
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:33,480
Not one.

1370
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,300
I checked it for squirrels.

1371
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:41,260
Yes, they had pumpkin carvings all across the land, and so many children were bitten by those rabid squirrels that they had to...

1372
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,560
They put many of the pumpkins to sleep, and they were, you know, not even tired yet.

1373
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:47,980
Well, that's how squirrels are born. They appear in baby pumpkins.

1374
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:48,940
Oh, yeah?

1375
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:53,780
Yeah. It's probably the only case of, like, you know, mammal parthenogenesis.

1376
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:57,560
That's silly. That's a superstition.

1377
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:04,980
Man, that's like hog snakes squirting blood out of their eyes. It's not even hoop snakes. It's like Gaius Gudis' and the Loch Ness Monster.

1378
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:05,900
It's like Bigfoot.

1379
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,880
Have you ever walked by an ancient penguin and it was biting itself?

1380
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:09,700
What?

1381
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:10,160
What?

1382
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,080
Have you ever walked by a hoop snake when it's biting itself? And it's rolling down the...

1383
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,760
That's a country legend. That's an old wives' tale.

1384
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,220
Yeah, that's a form of olfactory...

1385
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:20,600
That's Eric's nonsense.

1386
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,920
Yeah, that's olfactory snakes. I mean, that's a...

1387
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:23,820
And people have seen it.

1388
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:28,640
I've seen it. In fact, I've been involved in the actual snake rituals themselves with the hoop snakes.

1389
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:29,880
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1390
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,200
No, no, I was.

1391
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,420
And what they do is they start to...

1392
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:40,440
They make you stand in the middle, and they start to roll around you in a clockwise direction.

1393
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,220
The snake?

1394
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:41,800
The snakes are the people.

1395
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,960
The hoop snakes. They put their tails in their mouths, and they start to roll.

1396
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:52,720
Like a little trapezoid. No, I mean a circular thing, and you're doing it like one of those people with a hoop, like in the 1890s when there was a game.

1397
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,960
Right, exactly. And you have to wear the little pirouette, the little Perot hat.

1398
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,660
Little Ross Perot hat and a tutu.

1399
01:00:59,000 --> 01:00:59,940
For the pirouettes.

1400
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,760
Ross Perot, the little white clown hat.

1401
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:04,300
Well, what about the pirouettes? You have to dance, too, right?

1402
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:08,460
Right, right. And you have to really be good at toe dancing.

1403
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,640
This is nonsense. What is this?

1404
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,160
What does this have to do with Bob?

1405
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:12,580
This is pure nonsense.

1406
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,720
What does this have to do with the word, the doctrine of Connie?

1407
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,440
Connie's panties. What does this have to do with...

1408
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,140
Froppage.

1409
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,580
With froppage, or...

1410
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,220
Or rocket froppage.

1411
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,580
Rocket froppage, yes, yes, yes.

1412
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:31,080
If you follow the snakes long enough, okay, they get you into the state, and then you can be possessed.

1413
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:34,440
You can actually... This is one of the few times you can be possessed. A man can be possessed.

1414
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:34,820
Pennsylvania?

1415
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,160
No, a man can be possessed by the spirit of Connie in Pennsylvania, yeah.

1416
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,700
Well, you said a certain state.

1417
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,540
I'm wondering what the hell state you gotta go to get possessed by Connie in your underwear.

1418
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,320
Is that like between climax and intercourse in Pennsylvania?

1419
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,900
Yes, yes, in fact. That's where the hoop snake ritual takes place.

1420
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:52,320
Okay.

1421
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,880
Yeah, yeah, and that's the only state where it's okay for men to turn into Connie.

1422
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,980
And they want everybody to come there, but they really don't have the...

1423
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:04,560
Yeah, exactly, and they do, and that's the thing. It's the only time that you can be a man and then come...

1424
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,100
Coming is believing.

1425
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,820
...to the place that they are, you know, in the place, whatever.

1426
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:10,200
Absolutely.

1427
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,200
And everything comes together.

1428
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:11,980
It comes together there, yeah.

1429
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,760
I think I'm gonna stay in Texas.
