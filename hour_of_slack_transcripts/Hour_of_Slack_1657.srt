00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,260
This all-time radio program was originally aired live,

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,600
long before the advent of high-fidelity.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,360
As a result, you may detect an occasional surface noise or volume drop

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,520
due to transmission problems so common to old radio.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,140
We hope, however, that any variance in audio quality

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,240
will not take away from your pleasure in listening to this,

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,340
one of the all-time favorite shows.

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,680
Bob!

9
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,740
He couldn't live, and neither could the others of his kind.

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,320
There was a voice on the radio while you were gone.

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,020
There are others out there.

12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:12,260

Thank you.

21

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,400
Thank you.

25
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,780
Thank you.

26
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,620
Thank you.

27
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,360
Thank you.

28
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,160
Thank you.

29
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,720
Thank you.

30
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,160
Thank you.

31
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,600
Thank you.

32
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,880
Everybody, you mean..

33
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:37,300
You'll never see the loneliness there inside you.

34
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,540
Hey there, Georgie girl.

35
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,260
Or is it the clothes you wear?

36
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,380
You're always window shopping

37
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,780
But never stopping to buy

38
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:20,300
So shed those dowdy feathers and fly

39
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,320
Hey there, Georgie girl!

40
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,140
There's another Georgie need to find

41
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,460
Bring out all the love you hide

42
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,780
And oh what a change there'd be

43
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,040
The world could see

44
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,080
A new Georgie girl!

45
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,040
A new Georgie girl!

46
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,080
A new Georgie girl!

47
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,900
A new Georgie girl!

48
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,740
A new Georgie girl!

49
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,600
A new Georgie girl!

50
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,940
A new Georgie girl!

51
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,480
A new Georgie girl!

52
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,860
A new Georgie girl!

53
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,200
I'm gonna do the Georgie girl.

54
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:24,540
I'm gonna do the Georgie girl.

55
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,120
She won't let me alone.

56
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,120
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

57
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,380
Machines, machines, they keep right on moving.

58
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,500
Machines, machines, they keep right on moving.

59
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:50,860
Well, I've got to find a place to rest my head.

60
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,340
A machine, he'd smile at me and say,

61
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,360
I'm gone.

62
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,900
I'm gonna be all bad.

63
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,520
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

64
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,580
Machines, machines, we made them to serve us.

65
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,600
Machines, machines, we built them to serve us.

66
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:32,680
But till the day when I'm buried in my grave.

67
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:38,800
Yes, right until that day I know I'm gonna be a slave.

68
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,700
A slave, a slave, a slave to the machines.

69
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,360
Machines, they keep right on winning.

70
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,500
Machines, machines, they keep right on winning.

71
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:55,900
Machines, machines, they keep right on winning.

72
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,120
Machines, chains, chains, chains, chains一樣.

73
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,420
lymph and chains professional.

74
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:09,780
What a hard force to the machines.

75
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:09,900
And they keep moulded ironing us off the train.

76
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:09,900


77
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:09,980
like m damaging theisis not enough.

78
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:09,980


79
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:09,980


80
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:09,980


81
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:09,980


82
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:09,980


83
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,000
orろыв Surely, I can say everything I want.

84
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,980
Go uh, go.

85
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,200
Say them the line.

86
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,640
Remember is the smell of the barn, the dunga and the denim coming in from the farm.

87
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:37,580
A gap-toothed baby dancing in the straw, apple-headed mama just a-dribbling a chaw.

88
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:44,560
The slide and the shuffle and the spit on the ground, playing bluegrass music in a shithole town.

89
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,620
Shithole town, shithole town, playing bluegrass music in a shithole town.

90
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:06,020
The next thing I can tell you, next tune that I can play is at the Cowboy Palace down in Olathe.

91
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,840
I'd rather be anyplace other than here, a thousand-dollar boot and a three-dollar beer.

92
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:19,940
The ghost of Harry Carter is crying down, playing bad country music in a shithole town.

93
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,180
Shithole town, shithole town, playing bad country music in a shithole town.

94
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:33,940
Shithole town, shithole town, playing bad country music in a shithole town.

95
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:41,040
Yeah, yeah, that's all I can remember, all I can remember, can't remember no more.

96
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:48,020
Yeah, yeah, that's all I can remember, all I can remember, can't remember no more.

97
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:02,040
I drank up a boom and a bottle of twang, got my vaccination with a rusty E-string.

98
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:08,840
Traded my soul for one that worked and I got us all a gig at the Lutheran church.

99
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:15,880
Singing John Wesley Harding as the rain came down, playing rock and roll music in a shithole town.

100
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,900
Shithole town, shithole town, playing rock and roll music in a shithole town.

101
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:39,240
Shithole town, shithole town, playing rock and roll music in a shithole town.

102
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,020
Baby, you got the Gitas, I got the nerve.

103
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,220
Everybody's just looking for somebody to serve.

104
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:52,460
Gonna play my harmonica until I wreck, that's right about now.

105
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,920
The last time that I checked, honey, here.

106
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,720
Here comes the train, here comes the sound.

107
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,900
Tonight we're playing music in a shithole town.

108
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,720
Shithole town, shithole town, tonight we're playing music in a shithole town.

109
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:14,580
Shithole town, shithole town, playing rock and roll music in a shithole town.

110
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,120
Yeah, yeah, that's all I can remember.

111
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,360
All I can remember, can't remember no more.

112
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,040
Yeah, yeah, that's all I can remember.

113
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,280
All I can remember, can't remember no more.

114
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,660
OK, are we gonna call Dave?

115
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,560
Yes, I suppose that you should call Dave, yes.

116
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,960
Why not?

117
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,480
I'm gonna call his buzz number.

118
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,420
You're gonna buzz him up on the buzz number?

119
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,980
I hear it.

120
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,140
I hear the ring.

121
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,740
Is there a buzz?

122
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,800
Yes.

123
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,440
Dave!

124
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,080
Dave!

125
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,880
Dave, we've reached him.

126
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,680
We've reached the Dave.

127
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,680
And there's no buzz.

128
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,340
We've reached the edge of the sandwich, I believe.

129
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,260
I'm tired.

130
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:36,780
I'm tired.

131
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,080
Who do you wish to speak with?

132
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,540
And there is no buzz.

133
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,600
We have zero buzz on the line.

134
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,760
You wish to speak with just a moment.

135
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,480
Zero buzz.

136
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,980
Hey, this is zero buzz.

137
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,480
He's fetching the buzz?

138
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,320
Is that what's going on here?

139
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,560
He's calling zero buzz right now.

140
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,480
There doesn't seem to be one here.

141
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,200
Oh, that's a shame.

142
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,960
You know, the listeners have actually been asking for more buzz lately.

143
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,680
Well, you know, Alexander Morbus was one of the first original kings of Deuteronomy

144
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,020
in the Hypnotic Bible of France.

145
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,180
This is during the days in the Rebellion.

146
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,200
If you were a Republican, that meant you could kill some aristocrats with your teeth.

147
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,780
You're a French Republican, right?

148
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,100
Right.

149
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:41,360
Then they transformed over into the social aristocrats who divined the future by their nasal hair.

150
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,740
No, I didn't mean that.

151
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:49,780
Dave, have you ever considered teaching history at that college level?

152
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,660
Oh, of course.

153
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,560
I have three classes.

154
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,040
Left.

155
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,340
Three classes scheduled this semester.

156
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:05,240
Working in close conjunction with Dr. Hunt and Dr. Forskin on the final approval.

157
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,380
And that was Dr. Hunt and Dr. Forskin.

158
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,260
Oh, I forgot to give credits.

159
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,660
Oh, no.

160
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,520
Yes.

161
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:13,980
Yes.

162
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:23,560
The songs that I probably will have played would be, well, there's a new old Rudy Schwartz

163
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,180
project album out.

164
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,560
It's called Salmon Dave from about 20 years ago, but he remastered it and digitized it.

165
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,240
I can tell the difference.

166
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,460
Those first four cuts were from Salmon Dave.

167
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:46,380
And then the song about the machines, that was Lothar and the Hand People.

168
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,620
Do you remember that band, Dave?

169
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,880
Lothar and the Hand People?

170
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,680
Oh, Lothar and the Hand People.

171
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,800
Of course, they were famous.

172
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,140
Well, see, I never heard them.

173
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,460
I only heard the name.

174
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,720
I thought the name was great.

175
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,160
They were a band.

176
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,280
I never actually heard them.

177
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,740
And we were unpacking CDs and stuff, and I picked up one.

178
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,380
It was Lothar and the Hand People.

179
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,660
I didn't know where it came from.

180
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,760
It was Princess Weez.

181
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,980
And she knew it by heart.

182
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,640
She knew that entire album.

183
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,840
That was the weirdest thing.

184
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,400
I started listening to it, starting with that song we played.

185
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:22,860
And she was like, oh, Lothar and the Hand People.

186
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,980
She was singing right along with every single bit of it.

187
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,880
Yeah, well, at least you don't have to worry about the smell.

188
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,480
Sometimes you get up at like 4 o'clock in the afternoon,

189
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,920
you look out the window, and all of a sudden,

190
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,100
it's like this vast sea of inhuman faces staring back

191
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,880
like little gray-eyed monkeys or something like that.

192
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,260
Or what, the Hand People?

193
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,920
Well, no, not the Hand People, the Fish People.

194
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,320
They're related.

195
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,260
Never mind.

196
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,060
I'm sorry.

197
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,840
Oh, and the last song we played,

198
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,420
the one just before we called Dave,

199
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,960
Shithole Town by the Rainmakers

200
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,480
from their album Monster Movie.

201
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,220
And I figured we had to play that because it's okay now.

202
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,120
It's okay for kids to hear the word shithole.

203
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,860
It's good for them.

204
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,680
You can't just say shit.

205
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,780
It has to have some little softening agent like hole attached to it

206
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,820
because it's so much better.

207
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,400
It's much less vivid that way, right?

208
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,960
But since the president says it's okay to say it

209
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,680
and then say he didn't say it,

210
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,940
it's a dog whistle.

211
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,680
You know, only dogs and deplorables can hear it.

212
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,480
And people like me,

213
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,240
because I'm basically a deplorable dog myself.

214
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,700
I just happen to be more of a progressive type deplorable.

215
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,340
And so, yeah, it's okay, kids.

216
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,520
Everybody should call everybody else.

217
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:53,620
Shitholes.

218
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,920
Because it's okay.

219
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,560
But I didn't really say that.

220
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,620
That's the important thing.

221
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,460
I didn't say, I didn't use that language.

222
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,840
It's just a story that the dams made up.

223
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,580
It's like the language of origins.

224
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,360
Like you say,

225
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,880
Glen Road, Texas,

226
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,000
it's one shithole of a town.

227
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,180
It's the secret doctrine of reciprocity.

228
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,660
Well, you know, it is possible that I'll chicken,

229
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:27,620
out for the sake of the broadcast college stations

230
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,520
and go ahead and replace that word with the word Trump

231
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,200
as we have done before.

232
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,360
So it's a Trump-hole town.

233
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,600
Trump-hole town.

234
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,440
That's what I...

235
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,220
Trump-hole town.

236
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,940
Everybody thinks, yeah,

237
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,400
yeah, they know that a lot better

238
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,000
than they would the other way around

239
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,960
because it takes too much confusion to get...

240
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,720
It's like a deer in a head.

241
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:52,800
It's like a deer in a head.

242
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,040
I don't know exactly how that has to do with it.

243
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,180
Actually, deer run from the headlights.

244
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,240
We see it at least once a week.

245
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,720
We catch the deer in the headlights.

246
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,000
You know what they don't do

247
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,200
is stand there staring at the car.

248
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,740
They run like hell.

249
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,720
Yeah, they run like hell.

250
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,120
The problem,

251
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,140
they might run into the headlights

252
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,220
because they're stupid

253
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,620
and panicked or whatever.

254
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,880
But either way they run,

255
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,820
that hound dog buddy wants to chase them.

256
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,720
Oh, Disney, yeah.

257
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,260
He almost went right through the front windshield

258
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,360
the last time we...

259
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,880
Some deer crossed our path.

260
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,800
He did the same thing when he saw a cat.

261
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,580
The ancient people must have acquired

262
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,700
a real taste for manure and sandwiches

263
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,440
because it seems like

264
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,020
if you could train a dog to come and help you hunt,

265
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,960
that'd be okay for a collection of dingleberries

266
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,640
to somewhere in the Arctic woods.

267
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,740
Well, we collect dingleberries all the time.

268
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,080
I've got three mason jars full of them.

269
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,760
I just pick them off myself.

270
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,620
You're a Neolithic hunter-gatherer,

271
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,860
so why not gather some?

272
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,220
I don't have to go very far to gather that.

273
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,220
I can pick a few off of little buddy there.

274
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,860
Where is little buddy?

275
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,460
Oh, good, he's sleeping behind us.

276
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,060
Sleeping like an angel right behind you.

277
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,900
You said he had a little accident in mom's room.

278
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,140
Yes, he did.

279
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,480
And our dearest,

280
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,280
sweet dog.

281
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,440
But he didn't telegraph it?

282
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,260
He didn't like say,

283
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,860
hey, look, I need to go to the bathroom.

284
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,400
Come on.

285
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,640
He didn't run over the door

286
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,040
and like scratch holes in it?

287
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,640
No, no, no bark,

288
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,240
no scratch at the door.

289
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,240
But he did go in the bathroom, right?

290
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,500
He did go in the bathroom.

291
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:37,600
Well, see?

292
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,560
He's learning.

293
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,940
He knows a place to go.

294
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,680
Right.

295
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,520
The bathroom, unfortunately,

296
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,480
has dark blue carpet on it.

297
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,300
So it's kind of a...

298
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,400
Oh, well, that's enough about...

299
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,040
the Stag Ranch Radio studio facilities.

300
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,120
Well, you have heard about the kitty cats

301
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,280
that go poop in the toilet.

302
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,100
Yeah, there's cats.

303
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,640
Yeah, lots of cats will do that.

304
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,040
I'm sure you could train a dog to go poop in the toilet.

305
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,380
But it would have to be very carefully balanced,

306
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,200
I would think.

307
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,320
I think, yeah, I think that's the problem is because

308
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,220
Buddy's a rocket scientist and probably like

309
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,160
wearing a brown and Hitler's friends and stuff like that.

310
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,460
Uh-huh.

311
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,600
He's probably a full time scientist.

312
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,640
He's probably a former SS scientist.

313
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:24,860
The dog?

314
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,980
From the planet, yeah, from the planet Venus, maybe.

315
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,500
Or, you know, someplace where it's real warm.

316
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,640
Hey, you got to get your scientists from somewhere.

317
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,020
They're sure not going to be educated here in the United States anymore.

318
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,220
Right.

319
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,300
Especially, they're a bunch of Hindus who think they're Russians or something like that.

320
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,000
Well, some of them are.

321
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,720
I knew that.

322
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,800
So, yeah, you never...

323
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,780
You can't judge a book by its...

324
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:52,880
Cover.

325
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,740
You can't tell how...

326
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,140
What...

327
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:00,780
If that's really grass that looks so green on the other side of the fence there.

328
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,500
It may look like greener grass.

329
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:04,940
Yeah.

330
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,680
Or as Bob said that one night when he was sad after Connie cheated on him.

331
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:19,300
He said, the dicks are always bigger when you can't see them.

332
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,080
The dicks you can't see.

333
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,140
They're always bigger.

334
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,400
Something like that.

335
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,420
Of course, I may have to replace that word with another word.

336
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,240
Trunks.

337
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,300
Trumps.

338
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,280
Yeah.

339
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:32,980
Trumps.

340
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,940
Because he was thinking of tall, talking old geezers when the right time was...

341
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,000
He thought he was a...

342
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,860
Here, hold on.

343
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,340
Let me get a...

344
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,060
Let me get a...

345
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,820
Let me get a quiet Trump here.

346
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,700
Trumps.

347
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,120
Trump.

348
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:46,980
There.

349
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:47,460
Okay.

350
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:48,940
There's my...

351
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,580
There's my old cut lines.

352
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,060
Trumps.

353
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,060


354
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,100
Trumps.

355
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,400
There's my old cut lines.

356
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:53,400


357
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:53,400


358
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:53,400


359
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:53,400


360
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:53,400


361
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:53,400


362
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,140
I'm glad you got those in there before...

363
00:26:55,140 --> 00:27:01,160
Jimmy Swagger used to wear the same style underpants when he did his dirty deeds and stuff like

364
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,380
that.

365
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,980
He was reported to be a post-hypnotic policeman from Planet Venus itself.

366
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,440
That's at least what they thought when...

367
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,880
And that leads into the song by the Rudy Schwartz Project, Jimmy Swagger.

368
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,000
Jimmy Swagger got caught checking into a motel with a prostitute.

369
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,060
He said, you can't tell me where it is.

370
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,060


371
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,060


372
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,060


373
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,060


374
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,220
Jimmy Swagger got caught shaking into a motel with a New Orleans prostitute.

375
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,660
Did he try to save her or did he get his winky wet?

376
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,660
Jimmy got his pecker wet.

377
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,180
Jimmy Swagger got caught shaking into a motel with a prostitute.

378
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,020
A motel I said a motel

379
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,380
with a

380
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:54,500
a possible scenario

381
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,760
for Jimmy Swagger's pornographic

382
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,680
encounter with a New Orleans

383
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,980
prostitute in an appropriately

384
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,480
tasteful motel.

385
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,760
Although Jimmy has no

386
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,780
intention of actually violating any

387
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,900
of Gertie's well-traveled orifices

388
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,380
with his shriveled evangelical

389
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,980
wee-wee, he does hope

390
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,640
to engage in an assortment of

391
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,640
water sports, including a thorough

392
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,940
bowel cleansing with a three-quart

393
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,680
rainbow rubber enema bag

394
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,720
equipped with a tapered chrome

395
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,580
nozzle while Gertie

396
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,560
bellows out the old rugged

397
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,600
cross. Jimmy

398
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,560
asks Gertie to wear the blouse

399
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,400
and skirt of an eighth-grade Catholic

400
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,760
schoolgirl, suck a raspberry

401
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,580
tootsie pop, and beg

402
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,420
Jimmy to fuck her in the ass.

403
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,520
Jimmy masturbates on

404
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,280
Pat Robertson campaign literature

405
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,620
while warning Gertie not to allow

406
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,560
a pothead manipulated by Satan

407
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,820
to lure her into the work of the devil.

408
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,820
Gertie assures Jimmy that his two-inch

409
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,660
full erect penis is actually way

410
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,100
above average and well-veined

411
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,660
besides. Oh, God, Jimmy,

412
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,940
you have a big cock?

413
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,080
Please give it to me, Jimmy.

414
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,540
Give me that throbbing

415
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,500
hunk of manhood.

416
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,080
I've never seen one that big.

417
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,660
Really? No fooling.

418
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,860
Yep, that

419
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,920
sure is a big one.

420
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,800
As the three quarts of

421
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,420
steamy, soapy liquid

422
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,000
seizes control of his lower colon,

423
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,140
Jimmy evacuates

424
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,880
his purulent sphincter

425
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,740
into the crisper drawer

426
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,460
of a nearby refrigerator

427
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,760
and moans.

428
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,680
I have sinned against my

429
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,300
family and my Lord,

430
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,600
and I ask that he cleanse

431
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,720
my soul with his

432
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,640
precious blood.

433
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,860
Well, looks like enough of them

434
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,520
bought it for us to pay off

435
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,720
the mortgage. Looks like enough of them

436
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,820
bought it for us to pay for the rest of the jet.

437
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,740
Born-again Christians are dense

438
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,820
as a brick. Easy to do, but the package

439
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,740
is late. They've let us rape their daughters

440
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,820
as long as we sanctify all of their hate.

441
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,540
Wake up, you assholes.

442
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,620
Jimmy Swagger got caught checking his

443
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,580
new up motel with a prostitute.

444
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,700
And that

445
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,700
was the Rudy Schwartz project

446
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,420
from his remastered album

447
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,680
Sam and Dave.

448
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,700
Dave, what were you saying about Jimmy

449
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,200
Swagger?

450
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,780
I said he was a purposeful Nazi. He was full of

451
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,000
lust and thunder.

452
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,700
And he used to have dreams that he was

453
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,740
an aborigine, but one day he woke up and he

454
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:34,700
was in the wrong sphere.

455
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,780
The great preacher, Jimmy

456
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,320
Swagger?

457
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,300
Yeah, the late preacher, Jimmy

458
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:41,700
Swagger.

459
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,460
He was

460
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,520
a cousin of

461
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,660
Jerry Lee Lewis.

462
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,480
He was Jerry Lewis' third

463
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,480
cousin. That's why they both had sex with

464
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,140
14-year-olds when they were 35.

465
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,740
Not to mention Dean Martin.

466
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,760
Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin,

467
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,040
Jimmy Swagger,

468
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,720
Barney and Rubble.

469
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,660
Yeah, Barney, Rubble.

470
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,940
All crib fishermen.

471
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,780
Yep. It's a big, long, spastic

472
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,280
list of romantic,

473
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,200
giant seas, but I don't think we should

474
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,000
pay them too much attention

475
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,460
because they're already in a higher tax

476
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,600
bracket and make you have to

477
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,860
pay too much to begin with.

478
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,200
Hey,

479
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,900
I was going to tell you something.

480
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,720
Tell us.

481
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,520
I saw a funny review of

482
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,860
Neighbor World.

483
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,880
It compared it to

484
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,780
Infinite Death,

485
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,080
a combination of Infinite Death and

486
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,520
Neuromancer, and then it gave

487
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,100
a sideways slap in the face.

488
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,140
In common area treatment of

489
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:43,500
a...

490
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,100
Where'd you find this?

491
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,260
Was it like somebody added to

492
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,340
the Amazon listing? Somebody actually

493
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,220
reviewed it?

494
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,600
I think somebody actually reviewed it.

495
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,680
On Amazon.com?

496
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,480
I believe so.

497
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,180
You know, Dave's been a little

498
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,000
worked up because he got to

499
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,380
searching around on the internet for the first time

500
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,040
for himself and

501
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,340
found another guy.

502
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,400
Oh, I know.

503
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,560
I know.

504
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,260
He's like also being raised as a clone for the rich

505
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,540
popular cowboy

506
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,140
Dave.

507
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,400
Who's a friend of

508
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,020
you know,

509
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,380
who?

510
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,520
The manufacturers of the

511
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,380
prison ankle bracelets.

512
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,520
Well, it's true.

513
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,240
It's true financial overture.

514
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,540
Dave, you were telling me

515
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,540
something, some secret thing that you

516
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,420
learned and they're probably going to kill you for

517
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,100
knowing this.

518
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,020
But now they'll have to kill everybody who hears this show.

519
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,300
No, that's it.

520
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,120
Turns out I checked it myself.

521
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,900
And it's actually kind of old news.

522
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,100
It's a couple of months old.

523
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,760
And there's one reference that goes back all the way

524
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,900
to like around June of 2017.

525
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,360
So I hate to sound normal to explain that, but that's

526
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,320
the very, very truthful.

527
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,480
Well, what Dave told me earlier and can't explain now.

528
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:09,980
Yes.

529
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,320
I thought I got this right.

530
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:11,900
Mm hmm.

531
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,820
Um, the, uh, okay.

532
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,860
People who are in prison wear these ankle

533
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,460
bracelets.

534
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,420
Okay.

535
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,040
Yes.

536
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,040
Those ankle bracelets are manufactured by a company.

537
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,000
Okay.

538
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,180
It is a company.

539
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,840
It turns out that is close friends with president

540
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,040
Donald Trump.

541
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:41,400
And moreover, those ankle bracelets bear a remarkable resemblance to the slave.

542
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:48,080
Neck rings of the not all that distant past used in America.

543
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:58,100
So the implying that the, the more things that are illegal and the more poor people that

544
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:05,680
Trump can throw in jail, the more angst slave bracelets he can sell or his buddy can sell.

545
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:09,460
And of course it all kicks back into the, um,

546
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,440
What a lovely world.

547
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:11,880
Okay.

548
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,880
Those, those, uh, that line of hotels, the shit hole hotel.

549
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:22,620
Exactly.

550
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,000
One of those on you, senior.

551
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,120
You hit that one rail and nail on the head.

552
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:33,760
Oh, there was a guy who, uh, uh, projected, uh, the word shit hole on a Trump hotels.

553
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,720
He's projected a lot of stuff on her toast.

554
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,220
It's like, it's not graffiti.

555
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,100
He's not vandalizing and he didn't touch the building.

556
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:46,200
He's across the street with a projector, just like Dr. Argus Fox has.

557
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,560
And he just, yeah, just painted with light with light.

558
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:49,920
Right.

559
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,220
Yeah.

560
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,440
This just recently happened.

561
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,580
It happened this morning.

562
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,700
In fact, uh, cool.

563
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,480
Yeah.

564
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:55,900
Yeah.

565
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,040
There's a great picture of a Trump hotel.

566
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:06,840
I think the one he lives in with the massive letters in 5 billion pika size type that says,

567
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,720
uh, shit hole instead of Trump.

568
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,680
Trump hotel.

569
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:19,940
Now see, I'll have to change all that for WCSB and WORT and all the nice stations.

570
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,420
The other nice college radio stations.

571
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,880
The good stations.

572
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,120
Except that probably it's, it's like, I'm sorry, but all week every newspaper I opened

573
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,260
had that word on it.

574
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,580
Like, okay, well, if the president can do it, say it, let's say it.

575
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,520
I heard it on NPR.

576
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,960
They actually said one.

577
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,580
I'm going to say this one time.

578
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:40,700
I'm going to say this one time.

579
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:40,700


580
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,180
And we'll all know what we're talking about.

581
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,820
And then he said the word.

582
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,960
The word.

583
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,880
The word.

584
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,360
I'm going to go ahead and say it again.

585
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,300
Just cause it's so fun.

586
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,420
Trump hole.

587
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,160
Trump hole.

588
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,260
Trump hole.

589
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,060
It's a Trump hole country in a Trump hole town.

590
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,160
It's a Trump hole town.

591
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,920
It's a Trump hole town.

592
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,080
And he said, we should get more Norwegian.

593
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,700
He said, why can't we get more people from Norway?

594
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,500
Which is as quiet as you can get.

595
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:10,780
He said that.

596
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,360
Here's why.

597
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,300
Nobody in Norway comes, wants to come to the United States.

598
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,140
They have universal health care.

599
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,640
They have all the things that we don't have.

600
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,500
They have science being taught in schools.

601
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,360
They have physical education.

602
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:27,740
They have all kinds of stuff that's been dropped from the, the new United States in the last

603
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,200
25, 30 years.

604
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:30,680
Yikes.

605
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:31,740
So.

606
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,480
You can go to an expensive spa and not have to pay millions and thousands of dollars.

607
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,640
You just present your community card or something.

608
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,100
Damn socialist.

609
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,020
Right.

610
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,420
Yeah.

611
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,060
So why would they want to come here?

612
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,820
That's why he can't get any free stuff here.

613
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,500
Right.

614
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,280
Of course, people from Haiti want to come here.

615
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:51,920
Right.

616
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,660
Because there's food here.

617
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,280
They've heard that there was food and electricity.

618
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,960
People from Puerto Rico could probably, well, they were supposed to already be here in a

619
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:10,260
way, but it turns out here isn't really here depending on who's in charge at the, uh, pink

620
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:10,760
house.

621
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,740
The pink house.

622
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,860
That's what it really is.

623
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,180
Pinkness.

624
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,280
Pinkness, pinkness, pinkness.

625
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:26,580
Oh, I'm saving up a, I've got a clip of a good friend of mine awkwardly being talked

626
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:31,320
into endorsing Trump as an honest, honest guy.

627
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,480
And I'm waiting.

628
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,120
I'm just waiting to spring.

629
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,540
It's going to embarrass my good friend so very much, but he deserves it.

630
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,480
I'm just waiting.

631
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,480


632
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:41,880
Yeah.

633
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:48,100
There's been a big, a huge proliferation of those, um, you know, January catalogs except

634
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,960
for him wearing like, it looks like a baby birthday suit.

635
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,380
It's a pair of depends.

636
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:59,640
I don't know how, what we could depend on from this person other than a slack remark.

637
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,400
And I don't mean that in the positive, lovely way.

638
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,500
A slack remark.

639
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:09,840
It's an erratic spasmodic unification of worms and ideas.

640
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,460
Yeah.

641
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:10,460


642
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,200
Yeah.

643
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,120
Corruptigating worms.

644
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,520
Hey, did you hear the show where I played the, your old corruptigating worms rant?

645
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,980
It was a rerun, a recent rerun.

646
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,340
I know I was in the audience.

647
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:29,220
Do you remember, can you, can you believe he did such great stuff back in the old days?

648
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,380
I can't.

649
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,860
I can't either.

650
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,880
No, I mean, I listened to, I've, I've, uh, that happens.

651
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,240
In fact, I was listening to a puzzling evidence show tonight.

652
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,760
It was January 5th.

653
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,680
Puzzling evidence show.

654
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:45,620
I thought, oh, they'll probably be talking in interesting ways about the new year.

655
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:52,680
No, they were playing a tape of my first time on that radio station in 1982 or something

656
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:59,600
with a million sound effects going on and then talking at equal volume with it.

657
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,860
How Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence.

658
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:02,840
On top of it.

659
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,680
On top of it.

660
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,540
I couldn't understand either one.

661
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,040
But I know that it's an acquired taste.

662
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:16,380
That I can only acquire if I'm on a lot of LSD and I can't take LSD anymore because it

663
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,240
hurts my neck.

664
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,440
Well, you have, you have what's commonly known as fishmonger's spring, which is a part of

665
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,920
discoloration of the back of the neck when the sodium particle gets through all the way

666
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,760
to the, uh, evanescent forests of plunder.

667
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:37,600
And once this is magnified a couple more times after the sodium parts go in there, you actually

668
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,020
find yourself becoming a fishmonger.

669
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,020


670
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,580
Yeah, I'm becoming a salt.

671
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,400
I like sodium chloride.

672
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,340
That's a salt.

673
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:43,960
Yeah.

674
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,340
I like that.

675
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,020
That's a, you're just salting my feelings by saying those words.

676
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:52,660
You might as well be assaulting me physically just by making me think those bad thoughts.

677
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,780
That's a salt.

678
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,060
I think you're a degenerate, Chose.

679
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,260
Me too.

680
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:57,760
It doesn't really matter.

681
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,300
I've been assaulted by Dave.

682
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,620
I'm going to join the victim's church of the kid glove.

683
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,020
You better be careful.

684
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,020


685
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,020


686
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,020


687
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,020


688
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:15,260
You better join your kidneys with another super personality or else you're going to

689
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,280
find yourself a scrambled egg out of misfortune sometime.

690
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,880
I'm going to have to find a better chair for Tarzan's radio station or something.

691
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,040
Cause I got-

692
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,200
Tarzan's radio station?

693
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,240
Tarzan's station.

694
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,160
I've got the, I've got the rheumatism in my back these days.

695
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,720
I can't, I gotta find just the right position.

696
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,000
Which unfortunately is not the case.

697
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,000


698
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,960
I feel like if I'm standing right here, the chair seems to be standing straight upright

699
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,380
like a marine.

700
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,220
Then I'm perfectly comfortable.

701
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:53,300
But laying down, lolling about, leaning back in a chair, those things all hurt and getting

702
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,860
up from hurts even more.

703
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,720
So I feel like, Oh, I might as well just stay standing up all the time.

704
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:03,660
Well, if you recall, back in the day when we used to do the radio show down at WCSB

705
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:08,620
radio station, Dave always stood to do his part.

706
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,000
You're always standing up.

707
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,000


708
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,000


709
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,000


710
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,080
He never sat down.

711
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,580
In fact, I would wager to guess that Dave is standing right now.

712
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,640
No, I'm sitting down.

713
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,840
As a matter of fact.

714
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:28,040
Well, see, I could pull this mic out and spill that coffee and break all the equipment.

715
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:29,960
No, I can't.

716
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,660
I still can't.

717
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,620
I can't stand up because Tarzan's radio station is partly hidden,

718
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:40,440
is partly sheltered by a spiral staircase made of cast iron.

719
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,360
And if I stand up too fast, I'll bump my head on that again.

720
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,780
Yes, and a step will go jamming into your back.

721
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:55,960
I already broke my skull open and my brain spilled out in the car dealership parking lot last Tuesday.

722
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,080
So I've got kind of a headache that won't go away.

723
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,480
And the sculpture of a bull kicked you?

724
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,660
Yeah, sculpture of a bull.

725
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,160
You hit the soft little head twice in one week?

726
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:09,240
I tripped and fell against a statue of a bull kicking.

727
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,300
And where my head hit was the bull's kicking hoof.

728
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,780
So it was like the bull wasn't really moving.

729
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,820
It was a statue.

730
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,800
But I gave it life by slamming my head against that hoof.

731
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,700
You wish somebody had a camera or somebody was taking a picture.

732
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:32,640
Actually, I think that four car dealership workers were smoking a cigarette over in the distance.

733
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,220
I think they saw the whole thing.

734
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,340
And were kind of watching to see if I was really injured.

735
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,080
And when I got back up, they just snickered.

736
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,880
I felt their eyes on me.

737
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,700
Look at that old man fall.

738
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,800
I did have the dog with me.

739
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,620
And I could blame it on the dog.

740
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,640
Well, you did say you tripped on the dog.

741
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:54,940
Yeah, I tripped on the dog.

742
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:55,400
I did.

743
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,480
And got kicked by a static bull.

744
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,900
Right in the head.

745
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,760
That's how Bruce Lee died.

746
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,600
Dude, that's...

747
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:04,600


748
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:08,260
Two massive head concussions in one week means that you're already...

749
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,220
I could run for president.

750
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,120
Or for...

751
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:17,380
I've already forgotten how to spell everything, including my own name.

752
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,880
I could be president now.

753
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:25,680
No, you'd have to come up with some less vicious comments that are totally irrepresentable.

754
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:28,880
Like...

755
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,800
Woman, bring me a beer mounted on your head.

756
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,100
How's that?

757
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,180
Is that a proper rich presidential thing to say?

758
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,220
Oh, no.

759
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,200
Yeah, but he wouldn't be talking to his wife when he said that.

760
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,340
He doesn't even talk to his wife.

761
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,020
He doesn't sleep with her.

762
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:46,660
Did you know that?

763
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,820
I believe it.

764
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,560
They have separate bedrooms.

765
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,280
They make a lot of sausages and stuff.

766
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,140
That's at least what I heard from living in the Cleveland area.

767
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,640
Did you hear about his girlfriend, Stormy Waters?

768
00:43:59,060 --> 00:43:59,540
Yes.

769
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:00,680
Stormy.

770
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,460
Now, think about that name, Stormy Waters.

771
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,060
And think about the...

772
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,080
Well, this is another thing you can say now.

773
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,960
The pee tape that nobody's seen yet.

774
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,060
It might not even exist.

775
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:19,060
But if he's already had to pay off one prostitute who goes by the name of Stormy Waters.

776
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,340
In other words, she'll stand above you.

777
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,360
Just as we were talking about Jimmy Swagger.

778
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,360
Jimmy Swagger paid.

779
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,920
He couldn't pay as much.

780
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,180
And he got in more trouble.

781
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,940
But it was the same thing.

782
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:41,100
It was like he would pay these scraggly, scraggly women in Baton Rouge to straddle him while he laid on the floor.

783
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,660
He didn't actually want to have sex with them.

784
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,420
He wanted to look up their dress.

785
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,360
And have them do nasty things.

786
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,060
But not actually have sex.

787
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,480
Just be real nasty and pee.

788
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,920
Because there's something about these powerful men.

789
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,820
That I guess...

790
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,980
Well, I don't know.

791
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,600
I don't know whether to be jealous or envious.

792
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:14,040
Because I've never really tried having a woman urinate on me.

793
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,840
Maybe I'd love it.

794
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,080
It seems to me, it seems like kind of a waste.

795
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:19,920
Oh, I thought you said you already did.

796
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,120
Perfectly did.

797
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,980
As far as I remember, you said one of your favorite things was the warm...

798
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,600
I was trying to make a point.

799
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,340
Now, you don't need to talk about this private stuff on the air.

800
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,860
I didn't say that, okay?

801
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,920
I didn't say that.

802
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,200
That's alternate fact.

803
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,220
That's fake news.

804
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,540
Why are you turning red right now?

805
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,280
It was already part of your body.

806
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,640
And it was like mother's milk, only it was warmer.

807
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:47,500
And you used this sweet, lovely fragrance of elves and Eskimos off in the distance.

808
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,880
Oh, I just kind of cried like a little...

809
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,620
You know, I think it was a Brazilian native.

810
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:01,960
Well, you know, women and men who specialize in providing...

811
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,920
S&M.

812
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:02,920


813
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:15,260
S&M bondage and domination stuff where a man pays them to treat them like crap and humiliate them and do things on them.

814
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,020
Yeah, I remember on that page...

815
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:28,180
They usually, they said the main customers for that are high-powered lawyers and mayors and city comptrollers and bankers.

816
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,620
Those are the kind of guys who are at the very top of the...

817
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,800
Who have a...

818
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,580
A hundred thousand employees that they can urinate on.

819
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,800
What do they want the most?

820
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,440
They want a mommy to punish them by urinating on them.

821
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,100
I guess they just didn't...

822
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:51,700
I guess they're just bad, strictly bad toilet training, to quote Robert Crone.

823
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:56,600
This is the joke you can make by saying the epistemology of golden showers.

824
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,240
Where did it begin, mommy?

825
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,760
I don't know.

826
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,700
Well, it's, uh...

827
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,480
Yeah, show me where I came from, mommy.

828
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,080
I'm showing you.

829
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:13,100
I've been down in that hole, Brother Roloff.

830
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,160
I know about that hole.

831
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:19,100
Once you get locked in there, you can't get out.

832
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,360
You sound like the darkness.

833
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:28,180
You're bucking and bucking and you'll be pulling and trying and humping around and you can't get out of that hole.

834
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,320
You can't get out.

835
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,600
You sound like the Texas version of...

836
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,600
That's all I can say.

837
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,900
I know, Brother Roloff.

838
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,200
I know about that hole.

839
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,800
You don't want to get stuck down in there.

840
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:41,900
No way.

841
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,900
No, no, I don't.

842
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,340
Not the punishment cone.

843
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,120
What if you...

844
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,620
The punishment cone, exactly.

845
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,220
I got that from the divas.

846
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,400
What if you go through endless cycles of rebirth and rebirth?

847
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:56,780
Rebirth.

848
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,460
I mean, what if?

849
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,240
Not what if, what if, what if.

850
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:03,980
What if?

851
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,280
What if?

852
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,220
Stephen King Villain was elected president.

853
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:12,480
And...

854
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,280
What if that isn't the right of the goodwillers?

855
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,700
That isn't the love of the unbid of genius?

856
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,920
I've just thrown in something I thought would be different.

857
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:24,540
Oh, yeah.

858
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,460
Oh, well, here's something different.

859
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:30,180
This music in the background is Tangerine Dream.

860
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,800
Oh, cool.

861
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,340
From...

862
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,420
A movie, a horror movie called The Keep.

863
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:37,740
Ah.

864
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,100
Yes, I've heard of that.

865
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,300
I never did see it, but I have heard of The Keep.

866
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,280
And, of course, Tangerine Dream.

867
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,540
The Keep was a very strange monster movie.

868
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:54,680
I don't even want to try to even explain it.

869
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,960
Was it a German fortress in there?

870
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:00,160
Yeah, there was a German fortress, only it had been a Russian...

871
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:00,880
I have seen it.

872
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:01,960
It was like an ancient...

873
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:08,240
It was like an ancient Coptic fortress built around a gigantic cave.

874
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:13,400
And, basically, Satan or something horribly evil was inside that cave.

875
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,220
Yeah.

876
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,340
And some guy comes along and lets it out.

877
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,580
Yep.

878
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,280
And it gradually, as it kills more people, it becomes more physical

879
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:27,740
and takes on a rather poor makeup job or monster costume.

880
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:32,520
And then a sad angel comes along.

881
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,040
And puts Satan back in his hole.

882
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,940
I didn't want to go back in that hole.

883
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,060
Don't put me back in that hole, Brother Broloff.

884
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,300
I learned my lesson.

885
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,340
I won't do it again.

886
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,660
I promise I won't do it again.

887
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,400
I feel sorry for Satan now.

888
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,360
That's what you said the last 10,000 times, my son.

889
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,240
Now, what?

890
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,780
You feel sorry for Satan?

891
00:49:55,340 --> 00:50:00,380
Well, I was just thinking all the money that he's invested in all the United States and Americans.

892
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,020
And...

893
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,640
This used to be...

894
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:02,780
This used to be...

895
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:02,780


896
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,060
This used to be what we called the Western world.

897
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:09,580
And there's no east, north, west, or nasal pudding of any kind of sociopathic content.

898
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:14,900
There's just one long, blustering, illustrious line of stupidity.

899
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,360
And I'd like to get out of it if I could.

900
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,960
But I get the shakes off now.

901
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,180
And I'm yearning my deep ends.

902
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,380
I can always depend on that.

903
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:31,740
And I'm just flustered about trying to yank out a fresh comment.

904
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,460
You know what I mean?

905
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,120
Oh, it's getting harder and harder to yank out a fresh comment.

906
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,940
Because they'll say you're being fresh.

907
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,160
And then you're an abuser.

908
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,520
Then you're an assault.

909
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,160
Suddenly you're an assaulter.

910
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,820
Or a pepper.

911
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,780
Ian, you wouldn't want to use your...

912
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,620
Never mind, I forgot what I was not going to use.

913
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,740
You two are yanking out new expressions every few seconds.

914
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,360
What the heck are you talking about?

915
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,760
You guys are nothing but yanking out new expressions.

916
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:04,840
You're yanking out new expressions.

917
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,420
She is right.

918
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,860
There is definitely a market for that in the big league.

919
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,360
We're yanking?

920
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,600
I thought you didn't know about that.

921
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,540
I always wait until you're gone.

922
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,480
To yank out.

923
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,500
I have eyes in the back of my head.

924
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,820
Buddy told you, didn't he?

925
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,560
D-Doll was yanking.

926
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,720
He was yanking new expressions all over the place.

927
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,360
It was gross.

928
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,680
That does...

929
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:33,320
sound gross.

930
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,960
Once you think of it from outside of a staying body.

931
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,560
And different focus.

932
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,240
That's the only way to get new expressions.

933
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,380
You know, if that's self-expression, right?

934
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:46,960
I'm an artist.

935
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,680
Yeah, but you're not expressing anything.

936
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,860
A jack-off or J-O artist.

937
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:55,340
Yeah.

938
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,860
Now you've hit it right on the nostrils.

939
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,280
Or it takes some aim.

940
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,400
You've got to aim just right to get it right.

941
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:05,460
The punishment has to be right at the right angle.

942
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,140
And 33 degrees.

943
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:12,200
I guess it sometimes has to do with the pyramid.

944
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,020
Dave, you're going to have to speak up.

945
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:14,600
Speak up now.

946
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:17,240
I don't want to have to use the levelator on this show.

947
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:21,400
Something having to do with 33 degrees oblique transversal.

948
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:26,340
And the peppy, the lipu on the pyramids.

949
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,640
On the eye on the pyramid.

950
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,060
Now, did you hear that one?

951
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:31,820
No.

952
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,280
Say it.

953
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,600
The French and the Illuminati.

954
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:35,960
What?

955
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,120
The French Illuminati.

956
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,920
Not the actual Republicans of Corsica.

957
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:47,080
Joe Schmoe and Lefty Limburger and all those guys used to hang around the sodium shop.

958
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,420
But the French Masonic Illuminati?

959
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:53,320
Yeah.

960
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,060
Robespierre and Louis Cartier and not Louis.

961
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:59,040
What's his name?

962
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,020
Citizen 14th.

963
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:07,120
And you say they built the city of Paris as a giant Masonic symbol?

964
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,640
On stilts.

965
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,380
And in fact, they would use dinosaur teeth to keep the magnetic doors open.

966
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,220
Ah, dinosaur teeth.

967
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,300
Yeah, but the main thing is, you know, the stilts.

968
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,820
That's pretty low ceiling for a lot of French people.

969
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:29,700
They like to eat their dinners, go down the basement, you know, and hang out with the other refugees.

970
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,000
And just plow.

971
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:31,020


972
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:31,800
Go away at it.

973
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,280
Mont J'ai moi.

974
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:37,260
He's trying to change the subject, because he doesn't know what it is.

975
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:43,820
Well, of course I don't know what subject it is, because that's a self-defining process.

976
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,640
It's been freshly yanked.

977
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,740
We know that.

978
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:48,740
Whatever it is.

979
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,960
I've never seen anything like that.

980
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,880
Yanked from high French society.

981
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,880
I just started reading a big, thick book.

982
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:04,000
That G. Gordon Gordon gave me called The Master Game.

983
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,900
And it's a history of secret societies that are for real.

984
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:17,720
That have, these two authors, and we've all heard this before in kooky, kookier books.

985
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:21,580
But these two authors are basically saying that there's a continuity.

986
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:29,760
There really is a continuity from ancient Egypt through the Crusades through to Washington today.

987
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,580
Hmm.

988
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:39,720
And there's another conspiracy on the other side of the world that is wanting to explode.

989
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,640
And that these two cultures are inevitably going to clash horribly.

990
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:51,700
I'd hate to think what those authors think about the situation right now, because they wrote this book ten years ago.

991
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,340
Yeah, twenty years ago.

992
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,020
It was even worse.

993
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,740
That was even ten times worse.

994
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,200
So it...

995
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,880
You think the president, Emmanuel Smiley, was...

996
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,980
The vice regent.

997
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:07,200
He was portrayed by Hubert Downing Snapper.

998
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:08,400
Who was...

999
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,940
He also stole equipment from the Illuminati.

1000
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,220
Or, what's his name?

1001
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,060
Julian Assange.

1002
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,760
Remember that?

1003
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:23,240
Maybe that's where that stuff in Bob's storage locker came from.

1004
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:24,800
Illuminati equipment.

1005
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,520
That they stole from the aliens.

1006
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:29,320
The greys, not the exes.

1007
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,840
You got your Reiki and Hamburg?

1008
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:31,520
Yeah.

1009
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,180
And your whole...

1010
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:35,060
You got a whole vegetable community, like a snappy...

1011
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,720
A group of snappy toms.

1012
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:41,200
Well, you get a lot of cool aprons for guys that like to wear aprons.

1013
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,540
But that's what you do, you know.

1014
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,560
If you're one of the Illuminati masons, you wear these special aprons and...

1015
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,560
And trowel.

1016
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:50,640
You have special trowels.

1017
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:55,500
Yeah, but I'd never call them apes, even if they were wearing the wrong trowels.

1018
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:57,580
Would you?

1019
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:58,780
I mean, that's disrespectful.

1020
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:59,980
They'll say, hey, look at me.

1021
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:04,800
Hey, Mr. Mason, you're wearing a pair of trousers and blue jeans and...

1022
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,300
Slacks.

1023
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,460
Trowels and slacks.

1024
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,920
You're wearing a pair of slacks.

1025
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,420
With an apron.

1026
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,400
Yeah, and you're an ape, too.

1027
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,500
With Masonic symbols on it.

1028
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,400
Yeah, you're a symbiotic illiterate of...

1029
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,680
What's the call guy there?

1030
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,320
You know, in some ways, I think that...

1031
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,960
The real secret...

1032
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:32,180
Secret society that...

1033
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:35,020
On this side of the world...

1034
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:36,900
Kind of...

1035
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,920
Doesn't really believe in the gods.

1036
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,960
They believe in man.

1037
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,180
And the other...

1038
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,460
The other culture thinks that they do, too.

1039
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,400
But except that...

1040
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,200
Because there's only their god.

1041
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,540
And...

1042
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,400
And there's...

1043
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,600
As Charles...

1044
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,000
Charleston always says in the show, Before Our Slag...

1045
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:04,200
One...

1046
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,280
I am...

1047
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,580
One god.

1048
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,160
One race.

1049
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,160
The human race.

1050
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,000
Unfortunately, there's not...

1051
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,880
There's not one race.

1052
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:13,660
The human race.

1053
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,460
There's the subgenius race.

1054
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,600
Which is...

1055
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,060
I mean...

1056
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:21,540
Although...

1057
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:25,180
Okay, Neanderthals, it turns out, weren't a different species.

1058
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,320
You could call them a different race, sort of.

1059
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:29,840
But...

1060
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:35,040
They apparently could interbreed with our other ancestors.

1061
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:38,840
Did I tell you that my brother took a fancy DNA test?

1062
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,680
And it turned out that at least he and I...

1063
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,720
Assuming we have the same mommy and daddy...

1064
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:54,160
Have more Neanderthal than 70% of the other people who have taken this test.

1065
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,200
So we got an extra dose of Neanderthal.

1066
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:02,560
And we also learned that we're solid British Isles.

1067
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,300
There's not even...

1068
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,620
Hardly any French or...

1069
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,480
What you might call French or German.

1070
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:12,900
Although everybody in the British Isles is French and German and Norwegian and Roman.

1071
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:13,360
They've...

1072
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,040
You know...

1073
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,520
Everybody's had England.

1074
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,600
But since...

1075
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,280
The time of the British Empire...

1076
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:23,880
That's...

1077
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,540
Apparently, that was the last time any Frenchies...

1078
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:29,260
Or Krauts...

1079
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,100
Married a Stang.

1080
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,580
Which is weird, because Stang is a German name.

1081
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,940
But Smith isn't.

1082
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,660
It's an unusual job description, too.

1083
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:40,700
But I was going to say...

1084
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:41,000
If you...

1085
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:41,800
You know...

1086
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,680
Wanted to be one of the very first...

1087
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,960
You could, like, put a Hitler mustache out and come out and go...

1088
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,620
Ein Reich!

1089
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:48,880
Ein Volk!

1090
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:49,800
Ein Führer!

1091
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,560
Like that, you know?

1092
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,860
And then when you say...

1093
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:55,620
You take a little protractor to the easel once you say...

1094
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:56,500
Ein...

1095
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:56,960
Ein...

1096
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,160
Ein Führer...

1097
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:58,180
Ein Führer...

1098
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,740
You know who the Führer is going to be, don't you?

1099
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:01,720
And...

1100
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,940
Ein Führer!

1101
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,280
Like that.

1102
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:06,240
And then you have everybody pretending like they're making Krauts sounds.

1103
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:06,780
And going...

1104
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,300
Stuff...

1105
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,460
Yeah, stuff like that.

1106
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,760
And they think they ate too many hot dogs and drank too many beers.

1107
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,580
And now they're going to have to go to the bathroom!

1108
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:21,460
Man.

1109
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,340
Dave, you take my mind to some dark places.

1110
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,580
Mine, too.

1111
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,180
They're so...

1112
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:30,820
They're so dark, I can't see them at all.

1113
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,840
So I don't know whether they're good or bad.

1114
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,240
That's why I don't like your own special this week.

1115
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,680
Well, what time is it here on the show?

1116
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,080
Oh, my God, it's time to end the show, believe it or not.

1117
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,820
How can it be?

1118
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:43,440
It is.

1119
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:43,820
It is.

1120
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,760
We've been talking for 40 minutes.

1121
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,820
My goodness, we must have been having fun.

1122
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:48,200
Yes.

1123
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:52,060
We're going to hear some Jimmy Ryan to take us out.

1124
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:57,980
He has a new album, Fall Instrumental Power Guitar Things, about two minutes.

1125
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:58,540
It's long.

1126
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,340
And Jimmy Ryan will have us flying.

1127
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,900
21st Century Riffology is the name of this thing by Reverend Jimmy Ryan.

1128
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,620
So, of the Flying Ryan Brothers.

1129
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,580
But now he's like a solo guy.

1130
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:20,380
I think he said his brother wants to do cover songs and Jimmy wants to do original stuff.

1131
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:26,220
So anyway, friends, you're listening to The Hour of Slight, number 1,657.

1132
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:26,980
I say that.

1133
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:28,660
Say that just like I know it.

1134
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,180
From the Church of the Subgenius.

1135
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:35,420
And if you want to know anything more about any of this, which is possibly unlikely,

1136
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,020
it's subgenius.com on the internet.

1137
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:46,180
And if you don't have an internet, you can send a little self-addressed stamped envelope

1138
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:54,980
to subgenius at P.O. Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas.

1139
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:56,940
Subgenius.

1140
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,060
76043.

1141
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,960
2-1-0 blast off.

1142
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:04,060
Yeah.

1143
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:11,080
And you can buy Lonesome Cowboy Dave's new novel, Neighbor World.

1144
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:11,480
Yeah.

1145
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:12,940
From us.

1146
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:18,160
Or just type in Neighbor World, Dave.

1147
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:22,660
You'll probably find a catalog listing for it.

1148
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:25,800
Anyway, friends, Jimmy Ryan.

1149
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:36,800
We'll see you next time.

1150
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:05,140
Bye.

1151
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:08,300
Bye.

1152
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:09,300
Bye.

1153
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:15,800
Bye.

1154
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:16,580
Bye.

1155
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:17,120
Bye.

1156
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:17,760
Bye.

1157
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,140
Bye.

1158
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:18,980
Bye.

1159
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:19,140


1160
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:19,160
Bye.

1161
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:19,160


1162
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:19,360
Bye.

1163
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:19,420
Bye.

1164
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:19,660
Bye.

1165
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,600
Bye.

1166
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:20,720
Bye.

1167
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:21,460
Bye.

1168
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:22,220
Bye.

1169
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,960
Okay, that was Jimmy Ryan,

1170
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,240
and now we can do that final 10-minute part

1171
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:55,560
that we do after the official shows.

1172
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:58,580
10 minutes?

1173
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,500
When we're starting to get kind of tired.

1174
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:05,700
But what is it we need to tell them

1175
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,600
that we can't tell them on the broadcast version?

1176
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:10,780
Well, become a subgenius minister

1177
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,720
by spending $35 on the ministerial pack,

1178
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,920
which is quite a giant package of stuff.

1179
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:24,860
It's got two 16-page booklets.

1180
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,840
The 16 pages doesn't sound like

1181
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,180
much, but each of these pages

1182
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,460
is like five normal pages.

1183
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:33,440
I would probably need

1184
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,420
a magnifying glass to read it.

1185
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:36,000
Now.

1186
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,080
Especially if there was like

1187
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,100
this psychotic dirigible orb,

1188
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:41,340
you know, that goes flying around

1189
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:42,160
in the middle of the night,

1190
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,520
seeking people to chew up

1191
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,800
like wolves in the darkness.

1192
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,380
Man, that's some...

1193
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:50,440
That's some...

1194
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,300
That's some psychotic underpants

1195
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:54,940
right there.

1196
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:56,580
You can get those subpsychotic

1197
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:59,160
underpants from the Church of the Subgenius too.

1198
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,440
You can also get t-shirts

1199
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:02,420
of many different designs,

1200
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,100
actually dozens and dozens.

1201
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,780
But the main one that most people want

1202
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:08,920
is just your classic Dobbs head

1203
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,520
portrait of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1204
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:14,520
a trademark owned by me personally, by the way.

1205
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:17,920
And that reminds me,

1206
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:21,080
I found a cafe press type company

1207
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:24,060
making bootleg Bob stuff.

1208
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,080
And they haven't responded to my,

1209
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,340
my legal threats.

1210
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:29,860
That's assault.

1211
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:31,840
That's trademark infringement.

1212
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:32,480
Anyway, friends.

1213
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:33,480
That's salt and pepper with a,

1214
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,680
with a sodium particle.

1215
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:37,900
But I think they ought to read my,

1216
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:39,200
I think they ought to buy my book

1217
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,620
because I had a dream of somebody else

1218
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:43,580
was seeing stuff from my book

1219
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,440
in a way that somebody else would see it.

1220
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:46,560
Huh?

1221
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:48,960
And that really, not only frightened me,

1222
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,620
it was very gratifying, of course,

1223
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,760
and illuminating to be absurd.

1224
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,020
And there's no real part of it.

1225
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:56,240
I mean, I think that's the,

1226
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,800
that's the approach we need for the standard of excellence

1227
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,920
increased by the lack of the temperature

1228
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,480
and the fact that the brain is just too small now.

1229
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:08,000
Speak for yourself.

1230
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,460
It's a wonderful book and it's hilarious

1231
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:13,060
and it's frightening and it's everything you want a book

1232
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:14,780
to be, especially when you got a half an hour

1233
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:15,640
to spend in the bathroom.

1234
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,440
It has pictures.

1235
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,560
They're not very sexy.

1236
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,220
I've got a, no offense, Dave,

1237
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,320
but your drawings of the weirds,

1238
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:25,780
I haven't, that's not Yankin material.

1239
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,240
Oh, but that was too complicated,

1240
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,740
that last concept, Dave.

1241
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,680
I'm just, I can't wrap my brain around it.

1242
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:32,820
Which? Which, which concept?

1243
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,320
That last one.

1244
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:35,640
The last one that you were trying to describe.

1245
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,840
Whatever the hell it was.

1246
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,920
Man, I'm really losing my,

1247
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:41,740
I mentioned the word temperature,

1248
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:44,820
so maybe I was getting caught and frozen at the same time.

1249
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:46,720
You know what I mean, Dave?

1250
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,300
I don't know.

1251
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:49,880
Climate's very unpredictable.

1252
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,520
Weather's unpredictable.

1253
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,960
And unpredictables are the most unpredictable

1254
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,400
of all. So,

1255
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:00,100
prove us wrong. Go ahead and

1256
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,240
buy stuff from us. We've been saying

1257
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,320
nobody does. Make us a liar.

1258
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,040
Actually,

1259
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:08,120
people do. That's how I pay my half of the

1260
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:08,820
mortgage, but

1261
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:11,900
friends, yeah, there's

1262
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,200
the book of the subgenius is still in print.

1263
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,120
If you haven't

1264
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,980
memorized that, what's

1265
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,900
wrong with you? You better just

1266
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:22,080
go home. You probably voted for

1267
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:22,480
Trump.

1268
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,560
It's not only

1269
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,580
necessary reading. It's a

1270
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,740
growth manual, you silly

1271
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,600
people. It's an interior

1272
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,920
exterior lux

1273
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,460
of growth

1274
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:37,660
manual. And if you get the little $10

1275
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,220
metal Dobbs head pen,

1276
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,520
it's really small. I mean, it's like half

1277
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,640
an inch high, but it's really

1278
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,580
metal and colored, and it looks

1279
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,480
really, really cool. Oh, the cloisonne pen?

1280
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,140
Yeah, the cloisonne pen. That's what the

1281
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,680
French Masonic

1282
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,300
Illuminati

1283
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:52,660
wear.

1284
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:55,560
If you wear one of those Dobbs head pens,

1285
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:57,660
you can walk into any board meeting in

1286
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,620
the whole world. They'll just make

1287
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,660
you president, CEO, because you

1288
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:03,700
got that cooler Bob pen than they

1289
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:03,880
do.

1290
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,540
They just have the little logo

1291
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:09,580
button. They don't have the cloisonne

1292
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:09,840
pen.

1293
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,440
Cloisonne pen rules.

1294
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,720
That's also called a badge

1295
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:16,980
overseas

1296
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,840
in Great Britain and the British Isles.

1297
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,680
A badge instead of a pen.

1298
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:24,520
Sometimes they'll just wear a piece of

1299
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,520
Canadian bacon over their left titty.

1300
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,440
And they'll take like a

1301
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,320
magic mark and inscribe whatever

1302
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,220
a captain

1303
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:36,400
or a fisherman or a policeman.

1304
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,420
He said titty.

1305
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:41,480
He said titty.

1306
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:44,220
And he said Canadian bacon and

1307
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:45,500
almost peed my pants.

1308
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,320
Hey, don't do it until

1309
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,320
call the president if you're going to do that.

1310
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:52,360
Don't waste it.

1311
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,220
Oh, I say, you're wasting it.

1312
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,440
That's a line from

1313
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,480
a British Pea Party

1314
01:07:58,480 --> 01:07:58,860
tape

1315
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,280
that was sent to me

1316
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,420
by the author Rudy Rucker

1317
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:05,860
and which I then

1318
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:08,480
copied on VHS and would

1319
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,560
label each one my favorite

1320
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:12,500
tape and mail it to my

1321
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,060
friends.

1322
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:16,540
I'd address the package also to their

1323
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:18,000
wives so that

1324
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,660
the wife would open it and there'd

1325
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:21,200
be this

1326
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:24,060
Oh, no, it'd be like

1327
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:25,960
if G. Gordon Gordon's

1328
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:27,940
wife opened it that she'd find a tape

1329
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:28,420
that said

1330
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:31,860
Gordon's favorite

1331
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:34,040
tape. And she'd go, oh, what is

1332
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,080
this? And put it on and it's British people

1333
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,880
urinating on each other

1334
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:38,300
for fun.

1335
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:41,840
The funny thing is there's like five parts

1336
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,020
of that tape that were each half hour long and all

1337
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,060
had different people urinating on

1338
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:46,540
each other.

1339
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,520
They're all in the same apartment.

1340
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:50,760
Man.

1341
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:51,680
Stop and think.

1342
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:55,020
By the time the fifth sex party

1343
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:55,900
happened in there,

1344
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,660
they must have been ready to, you know,

1345
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,800
drop the lease, get out,

1346
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:01,900
move away,

1347
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,920
go make their Pea Party's tapes

1348
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,000
in another apartment.

1349
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,900
There's nothing more exciting and more fun than

1350
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,080
a fart lighting contest.

1351
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:12,900
Pyroflatulation

1352
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:15,380
is a subgenius

1353
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:16,940
forbidden science taught

1354
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:18,760
at Dobbstown University.

1355
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:20,860
And you can judge them in

1356
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:21,460
a few ways.

1357
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:22,680
You can judge them by their shape,

1358
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:23,420
their color,

1359
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,220
their expansive qualities,

1360
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:26,800
you know, like one's a ten,

1361
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:27,980
another one's a twenty.

1362
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:30,800
They all have

1363
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,900
but sometimes they don't have keystrokes

1364
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,020
instead of just numbers.

1365
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,840
Well, in our pyroflatulation contest

1366
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,180
at X-Day Drill,

1367
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,200
after the chili cook-off,

1368
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:43,000
about six hours after the chili cook-off,

1369
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:43,940
we have

1370
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,900
a special chamber where we can measure

1371
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:48,780
and film each crepitation

1372
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:50,000
and ignition.

1373
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,460
And analyze them for color,

1374
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:55,780
stench,

1375
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:57,960
and that includes piss stench

1376
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,220
or psychic stench.

1377
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,640
Clarity or opacity

1378
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,520
as the case may be.

1379
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:04,100
Right.

1380
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:04,880
Yeah.

1381
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:08,160
And of course, distance

1382
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:09,820
that the flame goes,

1383
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,840
temperature. There's so many different

1384
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,980
things, so many different elements that go into

1385
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,880
a fine pyroflatulation.

1386
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,840
Right. The lightness or depth

1387
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:18,760
of scent.

1388
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,020
All these things are judged.

1389
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:21,920
Yes.

1390
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:25,240
You should hear the jargon that goes with the judges.

1391
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:27,620
Oh, an excellent afterbite,

1392
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:29,200
but not such a good nose.

1393
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,920
Let someone turn on the fan.

1394
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:33,360
It's weird.

1395
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,520
You know, guys got those pair of shorts

1396
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,300
that they got to pull things in the back

1397
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,620
and it automatically exposes

1398
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:39,880
your

1399
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,220
place Trump was

1400
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:43,860
talking about.

1401
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:46,140
Um.

1402
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,620
You know what I mean?

1403
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,860
Yeah, the little flap in the back of your pants.

1404
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:51,660
Yeah.

1405
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,180
I'll tell you something.

1406
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:56,560
The commotion must be better and easier.

1407
01:10:57,620 --> 01:10:58,220
I was in

1408
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,780
China, mainland China

1409
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:01,960
in Beijing,

1410
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:03,900
the city of Beijing

1411
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:05,040
in

1412
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:06,800
1986.

1413
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:10,240
And of course,

1414
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,900
about 90% of the population

1415
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,600
dressed exactly the same

1416
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,060
in those blue male outfits.

1417
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,760
Except for

1418
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:18,060
the

1419
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,080
the little clusters of

1420
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,180
mentally disabled people,

1421
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,200
the differently

1422
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,000
intelligence,

1423
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,520
autistic folks.

1424
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,240
There'd be this gang of guys

1425
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,380
that look kind of, you know,

1426
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:37,640
a little happier than they should be.

1427
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,680
And they were dressed just like everybody else,

1428
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,140
except they all had flaps

1429
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:44,180
in the back of their pants.

1430
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,560
And most of them were unbuttoned.

1431
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,320
They were

1432
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,760
they were ready for a fart lighting contest.

1433
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:51,420
Yeah.

1434
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:51,980
Yeah.

1435
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:54,100
They trained in China from the time

1436
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:56,440
as soon as they determined that you're a special,

1437
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:59,160
you know, mentally subgenius person,

1438
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:03,400
they train you for the Olympics in pyroflatulation

1439
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:04,520
because they're

1440
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,800
that's the best kind of people for that kind of thing.

1441
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,080
They have no shame or

1442
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,920
they're innocent, purely innocent.

1443
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,620
They just get a big grin on their face.

1444
01:12:13,660 --> 01:12:16,900
They just they can't operate the lighter themselves,

1445
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,040
but they can sure.

1446
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,960
They can sure bend over and spread them.

1447
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:20,680
They're pure.

1448
01:12:20,780 --> 01:12:21,580
And let it go.

1449
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,560
Let it go.

1450
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,320
Because, yeah, they're pure.

1451
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,740
I got it while I was in Beijing.

1452
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:33,060
I also got a massage

1453
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,560
from a blind man.

1454
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,080
And I was told that

1455
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:39,420
that's a real common situation.

1456
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,920
They go, oh, this kid's blind.

1457
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:43,320
Well, we'll train him to be a real masseuse.

1458
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:46,280
And this guy had hands like clamps,

1459
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,360
like mechanical.

1460
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,580
He was so incredibly strong.

1461
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,760
It's actually the only lobster claws,

1462
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,080
just about the only truly effective massage

1463
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,220
I've ever gotten

1464
01:12:57,220 --> 01:13:00,300
because this guy was so unbelievably strong

1465
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:01,660
and so blind.

1466
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:02,940
Right there.

1467
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
My friend said, staying those noise.

1468
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,560
You're embarrassing me.

1469
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:09,360
Sound like you're having sex

1470
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:14,100
because I guess I was vocally letting the masseuse know

1471
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,500
when it felt good.

1472
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,560
Kind of like.

1473
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:18,020
That's good.

1474
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:18,600
That's good.

1475
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:19,460
Oh.

1476
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:20,980
Right.

1477
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:22,440
We're totally disgusting.

1478
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:23,620
You're a jigger.

1479
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:25,500
Please stop.

1480
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,680
And that massage, this was in 1986.

1481
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:32,660
The American dollar was still strong against the yuan.

1482
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,740
And it cost about a buck

1483
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:37,580
to get that incredible massage.

1484
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:40,020
That's the only massage I've ever paid for.

1485
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:41,860
And the only, I've only yet.

1486
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:42,860
Huh?

1487
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:45,580
I was going to say right here in Cleveland,

1488
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,880
there's a guy who does that.

1489
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:49,920
He's not an acupuncturist.

1490
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:51,660
He's an acupressurist.

1491
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:53,540
And he makes people,

1492
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:54,600
that's his favorite thing,

1493
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:55,360
he's making people go,

1494
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:55,880
oh yeah.

1495
01:13:57,220 --> 01:13:57,220


1496
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:59,260
Stuff like that there.

1497
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,140
Oh, sounds like a good guy to know.

1498
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:04,880
I'm about to do that.

1499
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:05,820
Oh, oh.

1500
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,480
But this gives my lower back hurts.

1501
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:09,200
I just shift,

1502
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,300
I had to shift position.

1503
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:13,120
Dave, we have to go because my back,

1504
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,200
I swear to God,

1505
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:15,760
I really am going to have to get a different chair

1506
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:16,500
for the studio.

1507
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:17,860
Yeah, but I'm going to have to get a different chair.

1508
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:17,860


1509
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:17,860


1510
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:18,700
It's just like a woman.

1511
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:20,420
Or I'll have to get a,

1512
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:24,820
or we need to just set this table up on another table.

1513
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,560
Then we can stand up and do the show.

1514
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,260
Okay, but that still doesn't mean

1515
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:30,980
You don't have to.

1516
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:31,280
I'm a woman.

1517
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:32,760
Because you're not here.

1518
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:37,780
But this lovely music is so.

1519
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:39,540
But we love it that you're there, Dave.

1520
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,300
I'm in Medicine Springs.

1521
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:44,480
I'm in Medicine Hat.

1522
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:45,060
Uh,

1523
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:47,060
and,

1524
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:48,240
uh,

1525
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:49,020
Nana.

1526
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,460
Well, that's better than the Medicine Fish Hole.

1527
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:56,020
Not very much.

1528
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,320
Actually, the Medicine Fish Hole is just where you want to be sometimes.

1529
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,440
I wish I was down in the Medicine Fish Hole.

1530
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,720
Down in the Medicine Fish Hole.

1531
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,260
That was a Doctors for Wotan hit.

1532
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,880
One of the only ones we ever had.

1533
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,400
Down in the Medicine Fish Hole.

1534
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,440
Well, we can change the lyrics now.

1535
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:17,840
Down in the Medicine Fish Hole.

1536
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:18,660
Down in the Medicine Fish Hole.

1537
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,980
Down in the Medicine Fish Hole.

1538
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,120
Down in the Medicine Fish Hole.

1539
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:24,120
And with that,

1540
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:28,960
I will kiss good night to this long night,

1541
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:29,940
or short night,

1542
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,180
or fortnight,

1543
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:32,540
fart night.

1544
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,900
Night of the Pyroflatulation.

1545
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:38,300
That's just the way I'll always remember it.

1546
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:39,820
Night of Infartenance.

1547
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,220
Alright, uh, friends,

1548
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:46,620
uh, thank you for listening to another extra 20 minutes of this hour of slack.

1549
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:52,480
The people listening on the broadcast radio don't get to hear this.

1550
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,320
Don't you envy them?

1551
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,060
Okay, I'm going to turn off the recorder.

1552
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:01,960
Okay.

1553
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,300
Okay.

1554
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:56,120
Cheer it, cheer it, be a melody your heart can touch up through the sky.

1555
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:06,360
Cheer it, cheer it, be a song to sing whenever things have gone awry.

1556
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:15,720
Cheer it, cheer it, be when you feel sad just longing for a little.

1557
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:19,440
While cheer it, cheer it, be.

1558
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,440
Cheer it, cheer it, be.

1559
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:27,460
Cheer it, cheer it, be the world's little smile.

1560
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:28,300
Okay.

1561
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,200
Cheer it, cheer it, be.

1562
01:18:02,540 --> 01:18:04,040
Cheer it, cheer it, be.

1563
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:09,320
Cheer it, cheer it, be the world's little smile.
