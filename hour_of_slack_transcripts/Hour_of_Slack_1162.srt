1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
It's time for Bob.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,300
Say, Bob, why the big smile this afternoon?

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,800
What's so special about today?

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,700
Well, there's nothing special.

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,460
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,140
Now we're rolling, Bob.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,240
Ha, ha, ha.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,320
Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,200
Oh, yeah.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:29,880
Oh, yeah.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,780
The sauces are coming.

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,040
They didn't come.

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,260
That's sex music.

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,220
We haven't heard from him in a long time, by the way.

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,420
He probably got raptured.

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,780
Or ruptured.

17
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,840
The exes came and took him up.

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,080
And nobody else.

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,220
And half of the people who volunteered.

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,000
Who volunteered to help with our stage stuff

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,820
obviously joined the saucers long before we did.

22
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,200
There were some problems trying to figure out who'd really left

23
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,360
and who was still delusional on the ground thinking they had or hadn't.

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,200
Well, you know, if only one person on Earth were going to get saved

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,800
and taken aboard the saucers,

26
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,420
somehow it wouldn't surprise me if it were masturbating Sean.

27
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,220
Right.

28
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,160
The man with the most slack.

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:15,760
Exactly.

30
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,220
I mean, I don't know.

31
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,120
All he needs is some sex music and he's good to go.

32
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,000
That's right.

33
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,540
And he's been...

34
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,700
Long gone, probably.

35
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,340
Long gone.

36
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes, friends, we've returned from the expectant X-Day at Brushwood,

37
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,240
which now turns out to have been X-Day Drill number 11.

38
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,040
Expectorated by X-Day.

39
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,820
These are the survivors.

40
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,700
Apparently we were lukewarm and they spewed us out of their mouth.

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,060
The puddle of warm spread.

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,880
The bedraggled few walking around saliva-covered and in the rain.

43
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,620
A tatter-to-million, rag-tag, two-bit tin-pot army of losers.

44
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,200
They wanted to leave.

45
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,860
Their intentions were good.

46
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,280
They thought they had it all figured out.

47
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,500
But we couldn't leave.

48
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,920
We couldn't get out.

49
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,240
We couldn't leave.

50
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,200
Well, there was no way we were going to leave.

51
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,100
We couldn't let you people out of there unless the saucers arrived.

52
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,040
Now steerage passengers will have their opportunity

53
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,460
as soon as they learn to obey the protocol.

54
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,280
Please check your extra digits at the door.

55
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,180
Artificial and new organs, please check them at the door.

56
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,460
Pointed ears on this side, no ears on that side.

57
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,220
I can't hear you.

58
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,760
What did we do wrong, Bob?

59
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,920
And those with one blue eye and one green eye

60
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,040
must go in that corner over there.

61
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,480
I was talking to one guy who had seven heads and one leg.

62
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,760
He was a real nice fellow.

63
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,600
He came all the way out here from Beta Cygnus,

64
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,920
the coal sack nebula.

65
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,840
But he's a real regular guy.

66
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,240
I got to meet him, too.

67
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,100
I really liked him, too.

68
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,780
But I hate them guys at Beta Cygnus.

69
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,940
They've got all kinds of warts that are radioactive on their bodies.

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,180
And they have a big range.

71
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,880
That could happen to anybody.

72
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,900
It makes it all the more interesting.

73
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:16,900


74
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,880
It makes it all the more depressing because

75
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,460
aliens from other planets were coming to Brushwood

76
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:26,640
hoping to be picked up by the mighty Exists from Planet X.

77
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,280
And they were really disappointed.

78
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,780
The usual thing.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,660
Well, STANG!

80
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,180
Where's the aliens?

81
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,100
As if I was Bob.

82
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,400
As if I was Jehovah One.

83
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,500
As if I were God.

84
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,260
What is the explanation for this?

85
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,880
One particularly grotesque subgenius seemed most insistent.

86
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:53,160
In pinning Ivan Stang down and finding just what this subgenius stuff was all about.

87
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,820
That wasn't a subgenius.

88
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,260
That was a chicken head.

89
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,680
We thought it was an Exist trying to find you where you tickled.

90
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,700
It was either a chicken head or an anonymous.

91
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,640
We had not only other aliens hoping to catch a ride,

92
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,880
but rival funny joke cults, you might say.

93
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,520
He had Borat's swimsuit, did you see?

94
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:16,780
Discordian.

95
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,060
Discordian's Anonymousies.

96
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,900
Former Human Anonymous.

97
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,560
Yeah, flying spaghetti monster dips.

98
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,000
And they were eaten by the crowd.

99
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,640
Scientologists. Mormons.

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,160
Humanoids Anonymous.

101
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,860
Friends, it was quite a gathering.

102
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:41,760
And it was a fun gathering, except for the fact that the main point of it just fell flat on its face!

103
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,680
Heard about the gathering.

104
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,600
It's a good thing that it's a drill.

105
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,800
A gathering of revolutionary forces.

106
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,140
By the time we got to Brushwood, we were half a dozen strong.

107
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,740
Yeah.

108
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,940
And we've got to get ourselves back to the garden!

109
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,840
I got started on that golden or that any number of things like that actually.

110
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:12,800
It's a bedraggled group of people who merely want to leave this planet for once and for all.

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,380
I signed up, I think it was 1972.

112
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,380
No, that's a little early.

113
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,180
It was maybe around 1982.

114
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,580
I get those confused.

115
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,200
And my father was a butcher.

116
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,060
And he actually gave us lunch.

117
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,120
My father was a virgin!

118
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,300
He also made candles.

119
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,140
And one night, I remember him bringing home a tract.

120
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,340
I can't remember what he brought home.

121
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,680
And it had that face on it.

122
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,900
And they left and I was left alone.

123
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,360
So I joined also and have been waiting since 1982.

124
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,360
So I joined also and have been waiting since 1982.

125
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,140
We were left alone.

126
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,820
Now, when the moment comes, the moment of truth, believe me, we wouldn't dose you with anything.

127
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:53,680
Of course not.

128
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,700
Honestly, these are just homemade lollipops with alien poison.

129
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,860
What did we ask?

130
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:10,060
Recessed Pisces made, who happens to have studied under Alexander Shulgin at the Bohemian Grove for many years to create undetectable poison.

131
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,340
And at 7 o'clock, the idea is usually we would toss back the coolant.

132
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,160
And we would put it in the microwave and all go, fuck them if they can't take a joke, which we'll do in one minute.

133
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,480
I can't believe this.

134
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,880
So many people showed up.

135
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,120
We've had more show up each year than the sausage down the road.

136
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,080
I'm down to the graze.

137
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,880
Oh, Hal, I love your hat.

138
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:34,620
Look, Dr. Hal is ready to arrive, to ascend into space using that subgenius helicopter.

139
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,140
Oh, I love it.

140
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,580
We fly away now.

141
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,940
And I'm sure Susie the floozy should come stumbling up here.

142
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,360
She's putting her face on it.

143
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,700
Okay.

144
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,360
30 seconds to...

145
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,100
Liftoff.

146
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,980
This really could be it.

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,880
Well, you're standing around here acting like ha-ha real funny, but this really could be it.

148
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,180
This is where it's at right now.

149
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,080
Now we win.

150
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:19,820
20, 19, 18, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

151
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,520
Fuck them if they can't take a joke.

152
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,220
Oh, my God!

153
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,620
.

154
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,620
.

155
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,700
.

156
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:49,140
The hollow emptiness of another fail-dex day.

157
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,020
The universe is a cold, hollow emptiness.

158
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,360
A deep place.

159
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,220
Devoid of love or caring.

160
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,140
Just a mechanistic, DNA-driven universe.

161
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:15,040
We're just robots meant to carry on our pathetic little code for no reason that would mean anything to us.

162
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,620
Yes, meaninglessness, sadness.

163
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,920
Oh, my God.

164
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,980
You know, you kids are really beautiful today.

165
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,720
And I'm really behind you kids, 100%.

166
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,720
And that's why I say we ought to listen to the flour people.

167
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,340
Thanks, Governor Rhodes.

168
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,700
Because some people just like to fry everything in white flour.

169
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,920
And if they like to, I say, well, you know, I kind of like to eat that stuff, too.

170
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,000
So maybe we have something in common, the flour people.

171
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,020
Flour-dipped people.

172
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,660
And now we have another guest here on the line, Governor Rocknar.

173
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:48,940
From the batter people?

174
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,940
Well, good evening.

175
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,300
Well, if it isn't Governor Rocknar.

176
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,800
Hey, how is everybody?

177
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,840
How was X Day?

178
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,360
Well, it was great, if you don't mind being left behind on Earth.

179
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,820
The hazardous materials people are back at the site spraying it down.

180
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:09,880
If you don't mind having a new disease that no one can diagnose yet, I...

181
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:17,760
The Brushwood staff is busy re-holifying the land after we de-holied it.

182
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,500
We blasphemulized it and we sacrilegified it.

183
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,780
We made fun of the gods.

184
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,460
We made fun of the goddess and all like that.

185
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,680
We sodomized Mother Earth and had a big old laugh about it afterwards.

186
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,240
We sassed them and harassed them and we snickered in their teeth.

187
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,780
Oh, man.

188
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,860
That was just to make us feel better about being left behind by Bob.

189
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,300
Oh, I was even further left behind than you guys.

190
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:50,320
That grinning charlatan took off and he left us all stuck behind with our head in the clouds and our feet in the mud.

191
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,540
Hey, I was even further left behind than you guys.

192
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,360
You were?

193
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,020
Yeah.

194
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,400
Well, you guys were right on the edge of the saucer's arrival.

195
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,660
But I'm stuck here eight hours away and no hope of getting to Brushwood this year because of the conspiracies.

196
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,960
Rising gas prices.

197
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,960
Repent. Quit your job. Slack off.

198
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,220
Rising gas prices.

199
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,060
Get a better job.

200
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,520
Well, you could, yeah.

201
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,280
Get a sec... um, repent.

202
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,120
Get a second job.

203
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,440
Crack off.

204
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,160
Crack off.

205
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,260
This is it. I'm forgetting the first one.

206
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,760
The log.

207
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,440
I'm not going to cry on that.

208
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:32,180
A bell is to ring and a horn is to blow and money... money is to burn.

209
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,480
At X Day.

210
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,260
I thought you were going to ram it all the way through and say money is my hoe.

211
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,300
You can ram him.

212
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,240
Hey, stop him. Stop him, somebody. He's burning that money.

213
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,920
No one ever really burns money.

214
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,300
I've seen it done.

215
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,700
Do they? Sometimes I wonder what happens to mine.

216
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:01,960
If you're anything like me, your average everyday transaction goes something like this.

217
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,920
Um, you mean that's four dollars now? That used to be two forty-five.

218
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,520
Just give me my change, peasant.

219
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,760
I am your changer.

220
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,880
This is absolutely intolerable. I'm going to complain to the management of this place.

221
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,280
I'm J. Fordyce Wellington. J. Fordyce Wellington.

222
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,380
I don't care who you are. I'm calling security if you don't get off of the cable.

223
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,620
Oh, there he is. So here is your friend, the security... Officer... Oh, no. I'm cut off.

224
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,820
Nobody's ever safe on this hostile planet.

225
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,220
I'm啜啄 electromagnetic halls.

226
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,700
IUG coupe chain at 9 o'clock light, mandate seat at 7 o'clock.

227
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,900
Single electrical generation located in 18th Street and 2nd Street,

228
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,320
Memphis coins area is eight miles away, where a posible substance goods shop located.

229
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,500
Police ordersар

230
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,100
Now his blood comes as tears ...

231
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,700
No one is ever safe on thisHmmmmmm

232
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,120
Watch out, boy!

233
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,160
The Amino Acids, dear friends.

234
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,120
Live at X Day 11, recorded by Potare Nostril.

235
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,820
Praise Bob.

236
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,640
And it all sounded great, which makes us feel a little bit better about still being stuck here on Earth editing at all.

237
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,680
For Is This Not, hour of slack number 1162.

238
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,260
And for the next few shows, we're editing the 11X Day footage Memento style,

239
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,840
with the chronology slipping all over itself from future into past.

240
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,380
We're scavenging Dr. Sinister's radio synesthesia from WCSB Cleveland

241
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,360
for the reminiscing by Dr. Howell and Lonesome Cowboy Dave and we.

242
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:43,860
And we're scouring the video cams and soundboard for the actual heart-stopping events that we survived,

243
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,580
such as this moment of transpouting by the bonfire,

244
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,580
as Bob is seemingly channeled by Reverend Fight C. Taj.

245
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:03,000
The official word is repent, quit your job, and slack off.

246
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:14,400
But, if you can't do that, if you are as dragged in by the conspiracy as most people,

247
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,820
then it is better.

248
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:25,400
To find slack in your work, than to have to find work in your slack.

249
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,680
Uh...

250
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,720
I gotta ask something about Bob's name. What does the J stand for?

251
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,680
That's a frequently asked...

252
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:44,820
No, it's a frequently asked question, but actually, on his birth certificate, it says J.R.

253
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,200
quote, Bob, unquote,

254
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:47,580
dot,

255
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:47,980
Bob's.

256
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,200
His father was not a sophisticated fellow, and all of his bosses had nameplates that, you know,

257
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,140
Fred M.

258
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,120
Mike,

259
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,040
Mertz,

260
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,740
and so forth.

261
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,480
So, he thought, well, that makes a man sound important.

262
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,620
And it does, and it worked.

263
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,140
My nickname's in quotes. How about yours?

264
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:13,100
But, no, the J.R. does not stand for Jesus Robert, as so many people speculate.

265
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,440
I heard a few years ago that if you have a...

266
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,540
nickname in quotes in the middle of your name like that, your insurance premiums will be higher.

267
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,260
Now, is there any point where we have to stop being funny to flip a CD or anything?

268
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:37,460
Well, we've got about, uh, 17 minutes left on the CD, and about, well, about 35 minutes left on the program.

269
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,240
That's about how much breath we have left in our...

270
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,480
Pneuma.

271
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,780
Why would J.R. Bob Dobbs need insurance premiums if he's the luckiest man in the world?

272
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,800
Well, he sells insurance.

273
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,660
Yeah, you think he would be...

274
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,740
He'd be an insurance salesman.

275
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah.

276
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,400
It sounds like it kind of worked for him.

277
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,660
He made a lot of money on motion picture insurance.

278
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,140
He would produce these movies that were bound to lose, but he also had insurance on them.

279
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,440
Now I know where Mel Brooks got the idea.

280
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,240
Well, where most people get most of their ideas is from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

281
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,960
He's the originator of quite a few things.

282
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,540
If you go back all the way in time, some things weren't even created yet before he...

283
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,060
Created them.

284
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,720
The font of a...

285
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,480
Let's scan that font list.

286
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,460
I wonder who that can be.

287
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,900
Suppose I told you that Hunty Furt forth put good vibes.

288
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,000
You're a kid.

289
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,500
Let me ask you something.

290
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,680
Would a be a little good of you if it...

291
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,400
Sure, you're a perfect one.

292
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,480
Get this and print it for the...

293
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,060
Whoa.

294
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:41,960
No.

295
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,880
No, no, no, no.

296
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,080
No, no.

297
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,800
Bye-bye, Fernanda Nende.

298
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,820
Lee Moore.

299
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,520
Looks like we got another caller on the line here from California.

300
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,340
You're on the air.

301
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,340
I am in California.

302
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,460
Welcome to the program.

303
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,240
Hi, California child.

304
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,380
Hi, Callie.

305
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,540
California dreamin'.

306
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,980
My mother bore me in Midwestern wilds, and I am fat.

307
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:13,540
Very faithful listener.

308
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,220
But, oh, my soul is thin.

309
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,640
Full slender is the California child.

310
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,000
But I am fat with loathsome double chin.

311
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,020
There were really Mormons at X Day?

312
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,440
I had to ask about that.

313
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,660
More Mormons than you could remember.

314
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,500
Shake a stick at it.

315
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,060
There were certainly polygamists.

316
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,500
The best part about the Mormons is, you know, they're all teetotalers, so, you know, more booze for us.

317
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,040
Yeah, they can have their tea.

318
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,580
That is what is great about Muslim fundamentalists.

319
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,840
You invite them to a party, and they will just have a smoke or two and a quick dip in the lounge,

320
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,620
but they will not imbibe unless they're, you know, being bad.

321
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,260
Self-action a la mode.

322
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,120
A little bit of a moat and a cup of tea.

323
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:48,940
That's all they need.

324
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,480
I believe it was Calvin Coolidge, President of the United States, who said the immortal

325
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,460
lines are,

326
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,020
Higamous, hogamous.

327
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,140
Girls are monogamous.

328
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,340
Hogamous, higamous.

329
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,740
Boys are polygamous.

330
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,800
We, uh...

331
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,720
I can't afford that erudite explanation of this track.

332
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,060
Well, they called him Silent Cal, but that's one time he mouthed off, and his wife clouded

333
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,880
him across the chops with an umbrella.

334
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,020
On the White House lawn.

335
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,960
I cannot imagine having a president who doesn't talk too much.

336
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,460
That's beyond my...

337
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,540
Well, President Collard Cheese not only talked too much, he was a tool of the uber state,

338
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,500
and people don't know it.

339
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,400
He helped fire on the bonus marcher.

340
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,420
He enjoyed the...

341
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,220
Oh, never mind.

342
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,460
Then there was the forgotten president.

343
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,480
We here at Fox News want to know how many husbands each wife has on a polygamous compound.

344
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,140
That was the recorded voice of President Stovall, the forgotten president.

345
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,280
They are a 39th president, or actually our first president.

346
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,540
It's good to hear you traveling, Dr. Howe.

347
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,820
Most people think that George Washington was indeed America's first president.

348
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,760
I'm on a dusty road, and I'm traveling, traveling, traveling.

349
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,340
They call me traveling, Dr. Howe.

350
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,740
We had to ride out there in Amish buggies.

351
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,480
They don't let you use automobiles past the Sherman City limits.

352
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,800
They got buggy whips and long britches.

353
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,820
They were driving this buggy, but we got them whipped into shape.

354
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,620
Whip.

355
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,200
Ow!

356
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,700
And the sad geniuses have made the milk sour for crying off loud.

357
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,320
I'm tired of this Yankee craziness.

358
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,500
That's a lot of clabber, but somebody done upended this Yankee-style butter churn,

359
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,100
and I aim to find out who it is.

360
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,740
Just look at the beautiful textiles they make, just like they used to.

361
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,380
And here is the spinning wheel, and it goes round, see?

362
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:46,680
Like this.

363
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,940
Oh, I'm so sorry.

364
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,260
Oh, here, let me clean that up for you.

365
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,100
Bird, baby, bird.

366
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,980
They have the secret of a powerful force, and of course, it's called fire.

367
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:07,680
Today, on this day, we've learned that fire requires several secret ingredients,

368
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,200
including oxygen, which is also required for the combustion of prop.

369
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,660
It requires fuel, such as plastic.

370
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,880
And also wood has been used, as you can see.

371
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,320
We did not know who created this jobs icon.

372
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:31,040
We insert it into the reactor core, which we are facing now.

373
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,000
We're sweating now already from the heat.

374
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,260
An amazing physical reaction.

375
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:44,460
Most subgeniuses never see such things, because most of them only go to conventions and holiday ends.

376
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,880
And you, however, were brave enough to risk life and live,

377
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,260
and be near this radioactive, fiery core,

378
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,100
in order to finally send a message to the exes

379
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,160
that we're not really complete followers,

380
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,180
and that we rebel against our leaders, as the order is due,

381
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,880
every year at exactly this time.

382
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,280
Friends, we're going to admire this fire.

383
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,380
If any of you brought a portable church organ,

384
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,440
I can't.

385
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,520
Uh, uh...

386
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,740
A nice, traditional hymn would be in order.

387
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,020
I brought my organ, Sam.

388
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,340
You know, the secret of rhythm, another one of their closely held secrets.

389
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,480
You could grab a drum and begin pounding out a fitful beat,

390
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:39,320
to which probably no one will dance, because they are traditionally very self-conscious.

391
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,840
So then we went to Yeti World, and we looked at the wonderful displays there in the mahogany museum.

392
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,640
The statue.

393
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,680
The statues of the great progenitors.

394
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:53,400
And finally we went up in the huge head of the giant Ivan Stang statue,

395
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,340
made entirely from dolomite.

396
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,420
Dolomite is my name!

397
00:21:59,800 --> 00:21:59,880
Ah!

398
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,900
Easy, Ivan.

399
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,420
I remember your blood pressure.

400
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:08,740
He hasn't been the same since he came down out of that big head of his own head.

401
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,340
You know, but, but, you know, that's, that's...

402
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,540
Wasn't that something?

403
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,640
An entire Ivan Stang head, made of dolomite?

404
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,540
Well, when it started to move, that's when it got me.

405
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,400
I thought it was gonna stand still, and that's when it started to move around.

406
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,240
Yeah, I dig that.

407
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:32,760
Well, Sister Ragnarump and Reverend Aunt Janice, like, thought I was flying like a witch or a broomstick thing or something,

408
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,160
and then they thought that they really landed.

409
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:40,500
But nobody actually knew who really landed, but they were pointing at the sky,

410
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,100
and I guess Majad or some dude was actually inflating...

411
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,280
Chomp.

412
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,740
They called him the Inflatable Chinaman, which is politically bad so forth,

413
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,420
but that's what they call him, you know?

414
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,120
And then they weren't real either.

415
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,380
Listen, mister, I'm gonna lay my cards on the table.

416
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,060
I'm, I'm an old man, and servicing those women is draining me dry.

417
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,240
I can't, I can't take it.

418
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,300
I need some time off.

419
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,460
They gotta keep them off me.

420
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,960
Let me get away from you.

421
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,320
Pick up the slack for him, okay?

422
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,100
Yeah, they have old men off.

423
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,720
They're real fine on next day.

424
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,000
There were, there were, there were some tantalizing UFO sightings.

425
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,520
There were.

426
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,380
That next day.

427
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,540
There was one right in the middle of the, uh...

428
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,140
Amino.

429
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,300
The amino acids.

430
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,000
Sting, did you see those things?

431
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,240
Yeah.

432
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,780
What was that?

433
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,720
It was the amino acids drummer and bass player.

434
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,860
They're coming in late.

435
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,720
That wasn't fireworks or anything.

436
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,280
No.

437
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,560
No.

438
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,940
It was yellow lights manning through the sky.

439
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,020
I've seen a lot of things in my 58 years.

440
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,520
It's come true.

441
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,360
The next day.

442
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,720
The next day.

443
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,880
That's right.

444
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,080
They're just a little late.

445
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,840
They're on my schedule for a day.

446
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,000
They're on Main Street.

447
00:23:59,240 --> 00:23:59,640
Yeah.

448
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,620
And every Main Street.

449
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,840
And every Main Street.

450
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:08,460
And then, uh, this very morning, as we were, uh, trying to figure out a proper ending for

451
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,840
our, our sad, slow hour, live hour of slack.

452
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:11,920
Yeah.

453
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,800
We were suddenly called out to, uh, discover that there was in fact, X Day had become a,

454
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:24,120
the prophesied sausage fest that everyone has says it, has said it was with the giant

455
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,700
flying sausages hovering over the...

456
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:26,800
Yes.

457
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,920
Project Blue Book now declassified.

458
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,940
Everyone said saucers.

459
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,060
It turns out to have been a misprint for sausages.

460
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:33,660
Sausages.

461
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:33,780
Yes.

462
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,680
Sausages.

463
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,140
Sausages.

464
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,780
Sausages.

465
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:37,740
Sausages.

466
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:37,760
Sausages.

467
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:38,960
Sausages.

468
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,020
Sausages, this is, this is the only sausage I was in the air with, Spent Nan tries

469
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,640
hit this politicians.

470
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,400
Oh, they have scaped the greasey bounds of earth.

471
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:59,060
Leaped from the pan, with sizzling sausage wings, flown through the sky amid the jacund

472
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,180
mirth of all who saw those flying sausage things.

473
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:08,940
Flipped round and round, and what was really odd became entangled in the beard.

474
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
I did it.

475
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,080
of gold.

476
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,120
You think we're making this up, but there

477
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,340
really were giant flying sausages

478
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,600
I swear I saw it.

479
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,080
And I'm not a drinking man.

480
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,580
Now were these Polish sausages or

481
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,620
were they Italian sausages or

482
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,760
were they Italian sausages?

483
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:25,660
They were black.

484
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,740
The casings of the, well let's call them the phenomena,

485
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,340
they were black.

486
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,740
They were enormous.

487
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,860
Filling up a football field or two.

488
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,900
That's what gave them the

489
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,700
idea that somehow they were

490
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,380
related to the black helicopters

491
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,400
because they were indeed black sausages.

492
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,640
But there were no markings

493
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,240
just like with a helicopter.

494
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,940
This was no normal color black.

495
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,280
It was as if it was sucking in all

496
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,300
possible light.

497
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,580
Anti-numinous.

498
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,140
In the sky, in the sky

499
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,860
there'll be sausage

500
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,500
by and by.

501
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,340
In that X-Day, X-Day

502
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,400
sky, there's sausages

503
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,480
on high.

504
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,580
Oh, you're making fun of my haircut.

505
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,240
I believe I'm alive.

506
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,920
Calm down, Pops.

507
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,700
You know, a lot of our

508
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,760
senior citizens out here are a little,

509
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,480
well, we call them excitable because

510
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,640
they get so handed up at X-Day.

511
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,700
Please tell me why you've wasted

512
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,580
all my money on this X-Day

513
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,880
subgenius churchopedius of whatever

514
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,260
the damn hell it is.

515
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,180
Gingery old coot, isn't he?

516
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,880
Stop making fun of your father with your

517
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,260
fringe.

518
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,160
That's not my father.

519
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,940
You rub penises,

520
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,880
get off of my...

521
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,400
Stop rubbing them rub geniuses the wrong way.

522
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,480
Ain't their bridge work done yet?

523
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,400
Let's blow it up and start all over again.

524
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,060
You know, these days

525
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,860
they can just put in a piece of plastic,

526
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,000
fix you right up. I don't see why

527
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,140
these old fossils are still stumping

528
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:52,900
around out here.

529
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,200
Old fossils, hell, I loaded that whole

530
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,440
van, unloaded it, loaded it again,

531
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,660
unloaded it again.

532
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,260
And it's true, everything hurts.

533
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,200
And you smell

534
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,280
like it, too.

535
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,020
Well done. The van was found to have been

536
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,460
filled with human corpses.

537
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,340
At least, that's what they looked like at first.

538
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,060
But after a brief examination

539
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,400
by Dr. Zorad, it was revealed

540
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,140
that most of them had been

541
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,020
put to sleep and had shrunk.

542
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,120
It wasn't long before

543
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,420
Tom and Timmy tried to round up...

544
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,840
Hey, guys.

545
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,320
Look, if you light a fire under these guys,

546
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,440
they start wiggling. I have a feeling

547
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,100
they're not knocked out after all.

548
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,380
I'm gonna use this little

549
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,560
cigarette lighter here.

550
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,100
Hold it under

551
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,000
this one, the one that has the long

552
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,460
gray hair.

553
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,880
Yep, okay. Alright, now we got

554
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,840
a nice little cherry red fire

555
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,160
going.

556
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,940
Listen, Tom,

557
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,860
he's still inside!

558
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,360
Well, he...

559
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,380
Rumors of his death were

560
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,820
certainly exaggerated. He turned out to be

561
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,780
a lively buck, full

562
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,260
of the sap of life.

563
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,640
Hey, where's my sap,

564
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,680
rolling? Well, I don't know, but

565
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,640
when you didn't sign

566
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,840
the register at X-Day, you

567
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,600
incurred a violation

568
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,800
which will entail a

569
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,440
considerable financial penalty.

570
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,840
The form you will receive in

571
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,820
the mail is not the one

572
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,720
that you should open first. Wait two days.

573
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,760
When the red envelope appears

574
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,780
with the cellophane window,

575
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,120
discard it at once.

576
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,680
Then go out, sit

577
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,620
on your front lawn, and wait

578
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,720
for further instructions. That is all.

579
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,700
Okay, so I gotta get

580
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,220
a red envelope with a...

581
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,920
Oh, never mind that. It's next X-Day.

582
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,160
Just start planning for next X-Day now.

583
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,720
You cannot use the red envelope. Only

584
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,580
use the orange envelope. You know

585
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,500
the red envelope isn't the right one yet.

586
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,380
It's not for you.

587
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,620
Oh, okay. I'm administrating

588
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,620
as Connie-ite.

589
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,200
So let's take a look at what we got here.

590
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,040
One rubber.

591
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:04,760
Okay.

592
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,160
On.

593
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,620
Two.

594
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,340
Three. Four.

595
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,300
We got five bucks of change

596
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,100
and a rubber to get us there sooner.

597
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,360
It's a start.

598
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,340
Though the rubber's probably good.

599
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,140
Bob keeps getting girls

600
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,720
pregnant.

601
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,300
In two weeks,

602
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,980
this spot will be filled

603
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,820
with topless, hairy,

604
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,860
arm-pinned, beautiful, naked,

605
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,160
pagan girls and muscle men.

606
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,240
And more serious like

607
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,100
pagan men.

608
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,020
At Starwood, which the princess,

609
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,640
we and I would like to invite

610
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,620
every such genius to come.

611
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,440
And also next weekend at Serious Rising,

612
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,800
where equally

613
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:54,140
hairy, arm-pinned, lovely,

614
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,560
bouncing, breasted, pagan ladies

615
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,960
will be doing their hypnotic

616
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,380
cavewoman dance

617
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,540
while their men pound out

618
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,040
quite intricate rhythms

619
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,620
taken from every culture.

620
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,700
It's a beautiful celebration,

621
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,380
actually, and a lot of fun.

622
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,460
And it is thanks to them

623
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,220
that we even have this yearly celebration here

624
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,440
where we await the,

625
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,840
where we learn the lesson,

626
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,020
the same goddamn lesson every time.

627
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,960
Oh, X Day could happen any day.

628
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,780
We don't even know what year this is.

629
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,260
We don't even know what planet this is.

630
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,800
Any day could be X Day,

631
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,100
so you better be ready for Bob to love you,

632
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,440
so send in your $30.

633
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:34,880
Yeah.

634
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,080
Yes, I know it gets old,

635
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,880
and this phone is getting,

636
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,440
I'm getting tired of holding this microphone,

637
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,060
so I'm going to give it over to

638
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,780
the new stang,

639
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,080
Priestess Pisces,

640
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,360
who will be inheriting all the nervous breakdowns

641
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,840
at future X Day.

642
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,200
Praise Pisces.

643
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,540
Praise Pisces!

644
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,600
Praise Pisces!

645
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,180
I'm Yeti, through and through.

646
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,480
Ain't nothing you can do.

647
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,840
Make the Peaks shake in their booze,

648
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,260
make the conspiracy wanna puke.

649
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,120
You can't hold me,

650
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,780
you can't control me.

651
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,440
All the little Yetis wanna be Pisces,

652
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,020
but still you can't feel me?

653
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,360
What the hell's your problem?

654
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,380
Maybe I can solve them.

655
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,740
Conspiracy, they got a track of you,

656
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,660
but hell, I got an album.

657
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,900
Let's get it together now,

658
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,440
cut loose and tether now,

659
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,140
waitin' for the sauces,

660
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,840
maybe things will get better now.

661
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,760
I got more issues than time,

662
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,840
but I still,

663
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,940
I still bustin' out rhymes

664
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,620
that make you shake in your boots,

665
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,100
but they call me a kook.

666
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,920
My voice is in the Bible,

667
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,480
they're playin' like recitals,

668
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,200
askin' me, wonderin' why,

669
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,820
I'm so damn fly,

670
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,420
but don't ask why,

671
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,700
cause it's slack off, or die.

672
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,620
You know what the man says,

673
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,800
just wait for X day.

674
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,700
But in the meanwhile,

675
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,160
we gotta freestyle,

676
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,840
fight the conspiracy,

677
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,960
not gettin' no better than me.

678
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,940
I won't stop fightin',

679
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,100
I won't stop writin',

680
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,080
my rhymes are gettin' stronger,

681
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:35,420
my rhymes are gettin' stronger,

682
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,520
we won't have to wait too much longer,

683
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,540
till the saucers come on down,

684
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,420
burnin' up your hometown.

685
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,880
But you keep questionin',

686
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,860
full of doubts,

687
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,780
what if X day isn't happenin', man?

688
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,900
Till you take some action, man,

689
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,060
stand up for yourself,

690
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,280
tell them peeps to go to hell,

691
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,120
or beat the system from within.

692
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,260
Do what it takes,

693
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,140
to win.

694
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,120
This ain't a battle,

695
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,380
it's about the war.

696
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,940
Go read Revelation X,

697
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,880
if you forgot what this is for!

698
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,600
Yes, ma'am!

699
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,620
Sister Deca,

700
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,240
it's pure subjectiveness.

701
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,820
I'm not sure, actually,

702
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,180
what Alice is, but

703
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,120
she's somehow a key to something.

704
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,780
Boy, those Coneyites were out there,

705
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,280
dancing around the fire,

706
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,400
in all their glory.

707
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,700
It was enough to make a red-blooded boy

708
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,320
sit up and take notice.

709
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,140
I thought the smell was quite adorable.

710
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,220
I spent four or five hours pulled over

711
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,820
in a ditch on the side of the road,

712
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,920
near there in Brushwood.

713
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,820
I just wafted in the aroma.

714
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,960
There were so many naked bodies

715
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,420
dancing around, I became delirious.

716
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,660
Dizzy, I started to see things,

717
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,340
little poppin' lights in the sky,

718
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,980
kinda like a n-n-n-n-nimbus was around everything.

719
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,700
The stars were glowin', and then I,

720
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,280
I fell asleep, and I,

721
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,820
for a long time, I,

722
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,520
I didn't know where I was.

723
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,880
I'm even just hungry.

724
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,700
This doesn't look like a sausage fest to me.

725
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,840
We get accused of it being all boys and no girls.

726
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,700
I'm doing surveillance.

727
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,060
That's the thing.

728
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,280
I like surveilling Reverend Annie.

729
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,140
Huh?

730
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,780
It's the last thing,

731
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,060
the last of the scrap.

732
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,260
Oh, that was, that was what I was,

733
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,080
I was praying that I'd make it down here

734
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,080
in time to taste it.

735
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,260
The food, oh, it was great.

736
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,580
Chef Borgerigmus did himself proud,

737
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,660
and he served everyone at the camp

738
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,920
his piping hot, super special flat cakes.

739
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,420
Oh, not to mention the scrapple.

740
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,600
Mmm.

741
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,180
Scrapple.

742
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,740
Yes, yes, yes.

743
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,660
Yes, Nancy Collins' little dog,

744
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,040
chopped up, sliced, and served up to everyone.

745
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,060
I like my scrapple with a side of scrapey.

746
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,100
And, uh, there was a certain...

747
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,140
It didn't have scabies,

748
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,280
that was a rumor in camp.

749
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,640
The Chaz sausages were my favorite.

750
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,440
Mmm.

751
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,040
They were blackened, and, uh, like redfish,

752
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,860
with a pair of sunglasses and a twist of Lyman.

753
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,480
Uh, for radio...

754
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,960
It was a zombies jamboree.

755
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,080
Yeah, yeah, there was a zombies jamboree.

756
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,780
For those who remember, uh, Professor Chaz Smith

757
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,560
and his wonderful show here on WCSB,

758
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,160
ESO Swamp Radio,

759
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,120
uh, Chaz's old friends, uh, Leguim,

760
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,660
Bob the Drummer, and, uh, Ed Strange,

761
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,340
uh, disinterred the old DJ's course.

762
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,880
He worked preserve以及

763
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:45,520

769
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,320
Did you see the fast hand on that guitar?

770
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,640
I'm an acrophiliac, I only like dead people.

771
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,120
Good stiff ones.

772
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
Where's Chaz?

773
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:19,900
Oh, he'll be along. Chaz will be along shortly.

774
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,080
I don't know, but I've been told this says landmines in Arabic.

775
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,060
I think it's really a bodily fluid for Chaz.

776
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,320
Oh, okay.

777
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,920
They're not zombies, they're Chaz-bees.

778
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,320
Oh, they're Chaz's?

779
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,300
Chaz-bees.

780
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,640
Chaz-bees.

781
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,300
They're putting on their faces whatever this stuff is.

782
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:47,560
It's some bio-product from the corpse of Chaz.

783
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,040
Whoa, gross. Chaz squeezins.

784
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,760
It's a spooge, a zombie spooge of Chaz.

785
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,040
Spooge.

786
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:58,780
Threading through the crowd.

787
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,020
Oh, gross, I hate, yeah.

788
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,180
I hate to interrupt your reverie.

789
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,700
There's some lurching people over there.

790
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,120
Make way for brother Chaz.

791
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,060
Make way for brother Chaz.

792
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,040
Is everybody in?

793
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,520
He's back.

794
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,560
It's the best thing ever.

795
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,640
I don't know how that happened, but...

796
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,700
Shut the fuck up.

797
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,900
You from Hollywood?

798
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,740
Get your ass off the stage.

799
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:29,400
Shut up.

800
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,260
I won a Tony Award.

801
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:39,860
Brothers and sisters, welcome to the first ever Tiki Banzai Night of the Dead party.

802
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,160
Yeah.

803
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:48,240
We delivered, as promised, brother Chaz.

804
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,940
Yay, Chaz.

805
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:50,720
Woo.

806
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:51,900
Brother Chaz.

807
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:52,900
Yeah.

808
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,200
Chaz.

809
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,820
Chaz.

810
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:55,900
Chaz.

811
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:56,760
Brother Chaz.

812
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,660
Brother Chaz.

813
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,100
Take brother Chaz away.

814
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,460
The frogs are hungry.

815
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:14,080
Recently I attended the solstice ritual here, and I learned a lot from watching that solstice

816
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,420
ritual.

817
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:22,720
I learned that it was kind of silly, and egotistical, and kind of pretentious, so I

818
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,260
stole it.

819
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:23,360
I'm gonna eat it.

820
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,780
Own it, dude.

821
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,600
It's a prayer of thanksgiving.

822
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:35,220
First, I'd like to call up my young daughter.

823
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:36,920
Aww.

824
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:37,940
Aww.

825
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:38,980
Aww.

826
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,720
Aww.

827
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,380
Aww.

828
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:40,520
Aww.

829
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:40,540
Aww.

830
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:40,540


831
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:40,540


832
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:40,540


833
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:40,540


834
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:40,540


835
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:40,540


836
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:40,620
Aww.

837
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:40,620


838
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,260
Aww.

839
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,040
Aww.

840
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:57,840
Aww.

841
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,500
Aww.

842
00:38:59,500 --> 00:38:59,740
Aww.

843
00:38:59,740 --> 00:38:59,740


844
00:38:59,740 --> 00:38:59,740


845
00:38:59,740 --> 00:38:59,740


846
00:38:59,740 --> 00:38:59,740


847
00:38:59,740 --> 00:38:59,740


848
00:38:59,740 --> 00:38:59,740


849
00:38:59,740 --> 00:38:59,740


850
00:38:59,740 --> 00:38:59,740


851
00:38:59,740 --> 00:38:59,740


852
00:38:59,740 --> 00:38:59,740


853
00:38:59,740 --> 00:38:59,740


854
00:38:59,740 --> 00:38:59,740


855
00:38:59,740 --> 00:38:59,740


856
00:38:59,740 --> 00:38:59,740


857
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,400
So I didn't know that I was supposed to be here.

858
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,220
And you're just a friend.

859
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:04,360


860
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:04,360


861
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,260
We're friends.

862
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,660
We're friends.

863
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:08,660


864
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:08,660


865
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,320
Yeah.

866
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,100
Yeah.

867
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:12,920
Yeah.

868
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,820
room. We thank the earth for not throwing us the fuck off.

869
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:38,280
We thank the sea because if not for the sea, we would all be waiting for a really long

870
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,020
time in line at Red Lobster.

871
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,260
Grandfather of the North,

872
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,800
I thank you for professional hockey and Santa.

873
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,840
Grandfather to the South,

874
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,800
I thank you for cheap labor.

875
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,200
Grandfather to the West,

876
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,640
we thank you for movies and homosexuals.

877
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,580
Grandfather to the East,

878
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,340
thanks for nothing, motherfucker!

879
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,480
Hey, that's where you came from, dude!

880
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,860
You've each been handed a card, brothers and sisters.

881
00:40:52,960 --> 00:41:00,640
Now, I need y'all and Princess Pisces to bring you all up to the stage here, one at a time,

882
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,620
and hand Princess Pisces your card.

883
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:08,320
Then you will step over in front of me, where I will deliver unto you communion.

884
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,660
Depending on whether you're over 18 or not, it's pretty strong shit.

885
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,200
That crap.

886
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,560
Not gonna be pretty, folks.

887
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,000
Read the name.

888
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,120
Typhoid Mary!

889
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,620
Typhoid Mary.

890
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,580
Heal me, brother!

891
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:37,020
I had a disease throughout the Northeast United States back at the turn of the century.

892
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,000
Heal me!

893
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:44,380
Now, there's no way that I could possibly give communion to Typhoid Mary,

894
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:48,640
to send Typhoid Mary to Heaven, because I don't have that power.

895
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,400
At least not without the magic rock.

896
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,040
With the magic rock, I can send the soul of Typhoid Mary to Heaven,

897
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,220
much like the Mormons,

898
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,220
through their ritual,

899
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:07,780
have baptized some of the dead from history into the Mormon faith,

900
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,520
so that they'd get to go to Heaven, including Jews from the Holocaust.

901
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,540
I'm your friend.

902
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,300
Which kind of pissed off the Jews.

903
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,060
I heard the Holocaust not on the right there.

904
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:25,060
Now, you may ask, where did I get this magic rock that gives me the power to send people to Christian Heaven?

905
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,560
And I tell you this, brothers and sisters,

906
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,340
none of your fucking business!

907
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,760
That's right.

908
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,700
But I've got the rock,

909
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,040
and I'm going to send Typhoid Mary here,

910
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,980
I'm going to send her soul to Heaven,

911
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,560
as the first soldier in our platoon of the damned,

912
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,800
in this, the first battle of our war on Heaven itself.

913
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:47,760
Yee-haw!

914
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,340
Next!

915
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,340
Thank you.

916
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,180
I feel so evil now.

917
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,000
Thank you.

918
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,740
Attila the Hun!

919
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,060
Attila the Hun,

920
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,660
today you will sit at the side of your lord.

921
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,640
Charlton Heston!

922
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,140
Charlton Heston,

923
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,460
you peckerhead,

924
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,540
you thought you were going to get there the easy way.

925
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,360
Oh.

926
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,160
Keep pouring, right?

927
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,400
No, I was way too high earlier.

928
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,540
He's a card-carrying zombie.

929
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,260
George Carlin!

930
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,780
George Carlin!

931
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:39,900
George Carlin!

932
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,760
Give him hell, George!

933
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,020
Give him hell, George.

934
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,160
You pussy, you don't know how to pour that drink.

935
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,460
Move along, George.

936
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,480
Tupac Shakur!

937
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,360
West Coast!

938
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:57,540
He's one puck, he got the other puck, Shakur!

939
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,660
Oh, he got the pick?

940
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,720
No, he's two pucks.

941
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,280
Wait!

942
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,800
One for your homies.

943
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:08,780
Rasputin!

944
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,180
Rasputin!

945
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,380
You'll never die!

946
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,540
You son of a bitch, it took him a long time to kill you,

947
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,280
and this will get you there just one step further.

948
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:21,340
Give me Hendrick's energy drink.

949
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,800
Gigi Allen!

950
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:25,740
Gigi Allen!

951
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,000
Oh, yeah!

952
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,600
Oh, yeah, we know what you're gonna be flinging around in those white clowns.

953
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:34,640
Go fling some shit for us, Gigi.

954
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,540
Aren't you glad you let me put the makeup on you?

955
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,400
So you can become Gigi Allen.

956
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,420
Otis Toole!

957
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,080
Otis Toole, serial killer.

958
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,680
Get to work, boy!

959
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,340
Get to work!

960
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,420
Genghis Khan!

961
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,380
Wow, you look much shorter in person.

962
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,680
Anton LaVey!

963
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,720
A real fucking professional, bitch!

964
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,000
Bob!

965
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,100
Bob!

966
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:14,820
Bob!

967
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,960
Get that noise for Bob!

968
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:18,560
Woo!

969
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

970
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,940
Where's your juice?

971
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:23,780
On the other side, Bob.

972
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,500
Edward Teach!

973
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,460
Blackbeard!

974
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,560
Blackbeard!

975
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,640
Go swab some poop decks in heaven!

976
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,540
Good one, Hank.

977
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,560
Richard Nixon!

978
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:39,580
Yes!

979
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,460
He's tan, he's rested, he's ready.

980
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,680
Who's without the robot body?

981
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,940
Ooh, that's good hooch.

982
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,020
I am not a crook.

983
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:52,680
Don't eat the earth.

984
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,340
Joseph Stalin!

985
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,420
Oh!

986
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,340
Oh, drinking for the people, brother.

987
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,620
Subspecies 23!

988
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,780
He's not dead yet.

989
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,840
But he will be.

990
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,860
Preemptive strike, subspecies 23.

991
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:12,400
I don't know anyway.

992
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,780
Who's got the chud card?

993
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:16,620
Chud.

994
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,040
That's probably me.

995
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,100
Ball Pots!

996
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,480
Ball Pots!

997
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:22,620
I get those sometimes.

998
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:22,640
Ball Pots in the box!

999
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:22,640


1000
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,520
Ball!

1001
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:23,880
I mean, Balling!

1002
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:23,880


1003
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,080
Ball!

1004
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:24,520
Ball and Ball!

1005
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:24,520


1006
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:24,960
Ball, and Ball Day!

1007
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,160
Ball ag relevant real Hingor.

1008
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,160
Ball!

1009
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,500
Miss Blackbeard!

1010
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,280
Ball peligiller!

1011
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:32,280


1012
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:32,380
Ball!

1013
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,200
Ball!

1014
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:34,860


1015
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:35,300
Ha ha ha!

1016
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,080
Call for the Supreme!

1017
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,760
Ondra notebooks, opioid, zwanzdark status papers on the back of your white design he

1018
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,600
wrote in your face, you have one single to write on the system.

1019
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,240
Well, Jamie Arewell comes right in front of me, living on Wall Street.

1020
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,180
This is thebia, send a cookie to the ВсеLa aircraft, the entire servers know I'll be

1021
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:50,480
officially freestyle.

1022
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,640
Who was it?

1023
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,060
That explains the eyes.

1024
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,640
Jeffrey Dahmer.

1025
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,600
He looks like him.

1026
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,800
That's what I was just thinking.

1027
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,120
He was such a nice boy.

1028
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,700
I'll decline that lunch invitation.

1029
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,300
Molly Hatchet.

1030
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:14,740
No, no.

1031
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,140
Prepare for the moment.

1032
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,700
Either way, sleep well.

1033
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,520
Hunter S. Thompson.

1034
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,900
This is bat country.

1035
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,660
You'll see the bat soon enough.

1036
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,700
It's all leaked on it, dude.

1037
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,200
As your lawyer, I advise that we get more of that.

1038
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:46,520
No wonder you had stuff all over it.

1039
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,460
Albert Fish.

1040
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,600
Self-mutilation.

1041
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,180
A child.

1042
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,620
And a snappy dress.

1043
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,420
Yes, he was.

1044
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,080
Joseph Minghella.

1045
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,360
Oh, hey!

1046
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,200
That's awesome.

1047
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:04,600
Professional courtesy.

1048
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,020
Minghella?

1049
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:08,640
That's rock.

1050
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,540
Fellow doctor.

1051
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:09,980
Freaking good.

1052
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,280
You know what the best thing is?

1053
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,940
I have a lot of family dies in the camps.

1054
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,980
Our last zombie is...

1055
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,060
Walt Disney!

1056
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,120
Kill him!

1057
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:20,800
I'm a zombie!

1058
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,420
Don't kill me.

1059
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,240
I'm a zombie.

1060
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:23,980
It is!

1061
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:24,720
It is Walt Disney!

1062
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,460
Walt Disney!

1063
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,000
Get him, Walt!

1064
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:27,760
Get him!

1065
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:28,880
Walt Disney!

1066
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,140
We didn't want you in hell anyway.

1067
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:31,740
Oh, shit.

1068
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:32,660
Okie dokie.

1069
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:33,700
You didn't get a single...

1070
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,320
You're from Canada, Bucky.

1071
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,360
Canadians don't have souls.

1072
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:37,600
No, that's good.

1073
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,180
That's some damn good...

1074
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,620
Yeah, you have no soul!

1075
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,880
South Park versus Canada.

1076
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,340
Get out!

1077
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,800
So, you got lucky.

1078
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,840
The opening came up.

1079
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,940
Papa Doc Duvalier.

1080
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:50,140
Papa Doc Duvalier.

1081
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:50,380
Papa Doc Duvalier.

1082
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:50,600
Papa Doc Duvalier.

1083
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:50,680
Papa Doc Duvalier.

1084
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:50,680


1085
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:50,680


1086
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,540
Well, our first blow has been struck in the war on heaven.

1087
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,760
We have sent our first platoon of the damned.

1088
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,320
Jesus, another fucking stride.

1089
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,440
Easy E.

1090
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,240
Easy E.

1091
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,140
I can drink to that.

1092
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,340
Easy E died of two AIDS at Tiki Bonsai.

1093
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:19,600
Well, brothers and sisters, tonight we've all drank to the formation of our army of

1094
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,160
the damned.

1095
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,980
Our army of soldiers who have already kicked it.

1096
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,600
And I'm gonna pass this jug around to you.

1097
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,860
And Brother Two Beans is gonna kick it.

1098
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:31,700
Kick it!

1099
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:47,000
I can hardly see that cat playing.

1100
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,280
He was whipping me so fast, you know.

1101
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,060
All right.

1102
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,700
We got another caller here.

1103
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,800
And that's macabre but bad macabre.

1104
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,800
Nobody Mark, welcome to the program.

1105
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:56,740
How do you know?

1106
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,260
I know all.

1107
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,180
That's what your new clone has.

1108
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,220
You have psychic powers now, Dr. Sinister.

1109
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:05,080
That's right.

1110
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:10,060
You know, I don't know if I was gonna have much of a say tonight because when all you

1111
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:12,560
guys are together, you probably don't need callers, but...

1112
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,300
Well, it's amazing how well these people can hold on.

1113
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,700
But I did want to mention one thing.

1114
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:24,020
Any of you hear of this new show on ABC Family called The Middleman, sort of a parody of

1115
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:24,880
action-adventure?

1116
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,080
No.

1117
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:31,360
Yes, we've been hearing reports of J.R. Bob Dobbs showing up on that in hint form.

1118
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:38,020
Well, what I saw last week in the third episode was one character had to pick somebody up

1119
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,540
at the J.R. Bob Dobbs International Airport.

1120
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:41,620
Yes.

1121
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,080
We were sent a freeze frame of that.

1122
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:44,600
Yeah.

1123
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,340
But that's true.

1124
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:45,820
I mean...

1125
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,520
The Bob...

1126
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,960
Well, J.R. Bob Dobbs International Airport has fallen on hard times.

1127
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:53,160
There aren't that many flights going in and out of there.

1128
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,500
Well, that's in Dobbstown, Malaysia, though, isn't it?

1129
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,700
Well, exotic Dobbstown, Malaysia, but that's not the only airport there.

1130
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:05,900
All those red-hot cargo containers in the blistering sun, that's where the subgeniuses

1131
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,100
have to stay during the day.

1132
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:07,640
Right.

1133
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,880
Well, not all of us.

1134
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,220
Some of us stay in the big house.

1135
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,080
Just the bobbies.

1136
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,760
They stack them in like cordwood.

1137
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,080
But in the big house, there's mint juleps and...

1138
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,320
All sorts of great stuff.

1139
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,120
Oh, yes.

1140
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,020
Down in the rank and file, there's nothing but applesauce and Kool-Aid.

1141
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:29,160
Well, Princess Wee and I sat out on the veranda watching that field of tents.

1142
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,820
Hooverville, Brushwood, we call it.

1143
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:33,640
Here's the celebrity pool.

1144
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:33,760
Tent City.

1145
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,320
Right.

1146
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:38,500
There's the celebrity pool, and then there's the Bobby Mud Pit.

1147
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,480
Look at them snorting and grunting like hogs.

1148
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,040
Some of those are hogs, Dr. Howell.

1149
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,840
Yeah, but the snouts are just different.

1150
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,480
They're just different around here.

1151
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,380
Ah, I guess Herbert Hoover was the president when I marched for a bonus.

1152
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,760
It wasn't Calvin Coolidge.

1153
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,960
He was busy playing billiards.

1154
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,320
I had a bonus since I was 50.

1155
00:51:59,240 --> 00:51:59,760
Well...

1156
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,120
I got a question for the subgenius.

1157
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,400
Do you do the face healing type of stuff?

1158
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,140
Face healing?

1159
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:06,720
Ha.

1160
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,300
Face healing?

1161
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,220
That's from your mortals.

1162
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:12,660
We do face thickening.

1163
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,700
You get your face healing, and you gotta fix it again three or four more weeks.

1164
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:16,820
Oh, yeah.

1165
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:16,820


1166
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,180
Three or four weeks later.

1167
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,260
Come on.

1168
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,460
You know you want one.

1169
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,160
Sign here.

1170
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:20,780
Sign here.

1171
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:21,420
And here.

1172
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,060
And here.

1173
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,140
And here.

1174
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,580
Initial here.

1175
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,960
Now initial here.

1176
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:29,560
Beautiful, glorious, glowing subgenius.

1177
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,160
Brand new, fully decanted.

1178
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,580
The man of the future.

1179
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:39,200
Look at him, his giant statue standing against the stars.

1180
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:44,680
How he spans heaven and earth with his incredible, incalculable potential.

1181
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,180
He's the jolly.

1182
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,300
Oh, green giant.

1183
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:54,580
And our glorious leader, Reverend Dr. Ivan Stang, will be here to address us in just a moment.

1184
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:02,500
So until that time, hold your banners high and form your ranks against those who wish to drag them in the dust.

1185
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,060
I think he was coming to dress us, not address us.

1186
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,360
Well, he might come to dress us down.

1187
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:09,800
Jimbo!

1188
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,440
What's all the fuss about the game, man?

1189
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,880
Still got some zombies.

1190
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,460
Oh, Jimbo.

1191
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:14,460


1192
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:15,740
I'm sorry.

1193
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,520
It's tough to get rid of that infection.

1194
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:21,580
The last time I was naked in a pool with a Marine, it cost me $15.

1195
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,720
Now it's $13.

1196
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:38,680
Reverend Jimbo, oh man, you've been a farm animal for the U.S. government for the last year since that day.

1197
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:44,220
It's time to wash that state of possession off of you.

1198
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,140
For today, you belong to Bob, brother.

1199
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,100
You're going to die.

1200
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,620
You're going to die.

1201
00:53:55,420 --> 00:54:03,880
Many souls were cleansed and needed it pretty badly, and the swimming pool was kind of gray afterwards, after the baptism.

1202
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,300
I remember two completely unclothed women that began to undress Reverend Chris Lee.

1203
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,420
Lucky bastard.

1204
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:11,000
You remember that?

1205
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:11,180
Chris Lee?

1206
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,140
Well, that was because he got Playboy of the Year and the Bobby Award.

1207
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:17,040
Well, he was dressed as a testicle for most of the afternoon.

1208
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:23,120
And one day, I could see why women would find him very attractive, but not with that top hat and tie.

1209
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,840
Now, he was dressed as a testicle, not a pair.

1210
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,480
There was a pair, of which he was one.

1211
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,120
He was the male testicle.

1212
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:34,540
There was also a female testicle, played by Honey Pie Volkerding.

1213
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:42,640
And there was a child who played the middle part, who had more motor skills and dynamic abilities than the average subpoena.

1214
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,120
That cute little kid thought I was a subpoena.

1215
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:44,960
He was Dr. Seuss.

1216
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,660
You should have heard those rhymes Ivan came up with.

1217
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:53,260
That's what they all think before they eat dab of sauce and wash it down with Kool-Aid.

1218
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,900
I drank the Kool-Aid.

1219
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:04,640
Dr. Sinister got a Bobby Award for best handling of insane, obnoxious callers on a talk show.

1220
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:06,840
I'm flattered.

1221
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,480
Napa, Napa.

1222
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,180
Why, thank you.

1223
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:14,100
And the award for best excuse for missing X Day goes to...

1224
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:14,100


1225
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:19,760
To Reverend Carter LeBlanc, who is currently in the Valley of Armageddon digging up dead people.

1226
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:21,320
No kidding.

1227
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,720
Aren't we all in some way or another?

1228
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,160
No lie.

1229
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:25,820
I'll do this one.

1230
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:43,060
Friends, for those of us who have radio shows, especially the ones foolish enough to take callers, present company excluded, know that it takes a lot of grace and tact to handle racist troll idiots.

1231
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:50,080
Well, Dr. Sinister does not use that grace and tact and hangs up on Nappy Caller wonderfully.

1232
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:57,240
So if only Dr. Sinister could come forward and accept his best radio troll handling award.

1233
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:58,240
Nappy.

1234
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,400
However, he appears to be off handling that cute girl he came here with.

1235
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:07,220
So we'll present that to him on the air later.

1236
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,200
And the later is now.

1237
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,040
And so I hereby present Dr. Sinister of WCW.

1238
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:19,100
WCSB in Cleveland with this official 2008 Bobby Award, which I will leave in his box at the station.

1239
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:28,040
Probably he's hearing this now because we're down to the end of Hour of Slack number 1162, the first of several returns to the joys and disappointments of X Day.

1240
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:31,680
This is Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

1241
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:39,360
For more information about X Day, JR Bob Dobbs, or the Church, or anybody, you may see www.subgenius.com.

Or you may write to P.O. Box 1815.

Or email stang at subgenius.com.

1245
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:55,100
The amino acids are what's in the background and what we're about to now close with.

1246
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:59,760
For more information about the amino acids, you can see theaminoacids.com.

1247
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,120
Now recorded by Potter and Ostril at X Day 11.

1248
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,540
The Amino Acids.

1249
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,720
Aliens.

1250
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,160
Str Pleddon.

1251
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:35,120
43, Dawson And London.

1252
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:35,600
Blackbuckt got 80.

1253
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,400
The F shares, Keeping the Pro calling.

1254
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,900
41, permits farther

1255
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:17,200
that was attacked report that the beast they encountered was many times the size they expected,

1256
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:21,240
indicating that the monster had some strange power of rapid growth.

1257
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,160
