1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
This is the subgenre of radio ministry.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,460
Hour of black on K-N-O-N-9-0-0-9-N-O-L-F-X-S.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,500
Praise Bob.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,100
To be a good man.

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,800
If you turn on the machine, this is Radio Yerevan.

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,600
My name is Hans Ivanovich Hagen, and this is the news.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,480
Wake up, puppet boy.

8
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,100
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,120
I am Bob Lundin!

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,280
No trouble.

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,220
Just get set and get going. Amen.

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,800
Recording.

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,040
Everything's going fine.

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:53,900
No trouble.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
Welcome potential initiates,

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,880
and remain with us for the next

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,520
30 minutes.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,320
Bob?

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,520
Bob?

20
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,260
The message is now part of

21
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,800
and registered in your subconscious mind

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,020
every time you say,

23
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:15,940
see,

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,080
hear,

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,340
or think.

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,720
What about slack?

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,840
That's your key phrase.

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,820
It will trigger the entire message

29
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,900
without your being aware of it.

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,800
And now, the subgenius hour of slack.

31
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,180
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to

32
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,860
is specially designed only to be played on your computer.

33
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,900
On radio station

34
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,680
K-N-O-N

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,880
and only in the city of

36
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,780
Dallas, Texas.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,440
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,620
in the course of this show,

39
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,760
the listener is advised to remain calm

40
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,820
and only contact listed or unlisted officials

41
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,100
in the event of any material from this radio

42
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,740
or other personal device being inhaled during broadcast.

43
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,640
Small animals or other children

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,580
becoming exposed to the ultra-high

45
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,140
or ultra-low shocks and brain frequencies

46
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,200
constantly scanned throughout our program

47
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,740
should seek shelter in an approved safety unit only.

48
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,580
This is

49
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,060
Walter Teasdale reminding you

50
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,160
that it's often a photon that micro-releases,

51
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,420
but truth is,

52
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,420
not everyone gets the picture.

53
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,240
Hoping your time is all time

54
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,860
and all your unpermissible truths

55
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,980
are happy truths.

56
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,280
Here is your host,

57
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,360
Reverend Ivan Stang

58
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,260
and many guests.

59
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,280
Hey!

60
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,580
Hey!

61
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,420
Hey!

62
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:58,800
Hey!

63
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,580
Hey!

64
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:04,300


65
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,880
Hey!

66
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,520
Hey!

67
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:06,580


68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:06,840


69
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:06,880


70
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,580
You are no longer in control, my friend.

71
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,880
We shall dominate you, dear listener,

72
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,240
as we have dominated others of your species.

73
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,640
There's no escape.

74
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,340
You can only do your duty.

75
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:28,820
It...

76
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,560
It must be done.

77
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:29,560


78
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,880
And it is a sneaky omission.

79
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:31,680
It can only be

80
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:31,780
over.

81
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,880
It must be done.

82
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,040
This is the lowest.

83
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:53,100
dreaming specter- Baggers may not have.

84
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,560
I believe that Eva Wausrie,

85
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:07,480
they say. But you start messing with the elder gods, friends. You stir up forces. Suddenly

86
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,180
everything's going wrong. What you gonna do about it, boy? What you gonna do to get straight?

87
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,180
Not much you can do if you get everything out of balance. You thought it was real funny,

88
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:25,860
didn't you? Thought you'd go and pull the devil's leg, eh? Well, go ahead, son.

89
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,520
Yeah, it's funny. Funny big joke. Let's go. Go ahead, little girl. Let's go spray paint

90
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,680
funny pictures on tombstones. Let's go make a fake bleeding head of Arnold Palmer head

91
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:54,420
and launch it. Let's go set up a Bob altar and worship for aliens. Oh, fun. Yeah, let's

92
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,060
lure weird forces into our immediate...

93
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,020
vicinity.

94
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:15,560
You just go ahead and do it, Mr. Subgenius. Oh, we're in it as deep as you. We took money

95
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:22,300
for it. We know our souls are damned. Not much we can do now but try to stay so fropped

96
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,900
up we don't think about it.

97
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,120
Yeah.

98
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,540
Now, I frankly suggest, friend, that you may be in the middle of a war.

99
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:34,260
You may be in it too deep to do otherwise yourself. Pathetic Bobby. You're Bobby, ain't

100
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,080
you? Thought you'd be cool. Thought you'd get in with the cool guys. Thought you'd live

101
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,140
away. We're laughing at you, boy. Laugh. Hey, oh, he sent the money, though. Yes, they sent

102
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:50,640
the money. But who signs the check, my friend? In the end, the signature's always the same.

103
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,720
You're starting to hear the voices now, aren't you? Yeah, this is a special show.

104
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,880
The compressed sound effects code embedded in this show releases words in the background

105
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:10,380
behind the voices that are designed to trigger these other voices in your head. Yes, your

106
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,400
own head, friend, is generating those voices, but guess what? It's gonna be a while before

107
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:24,200
you can turn them off. You can shut off the radio and you may still be hearing them. Oh,

108
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,520
quick, take your headphones off or it's too late. Oh, yeah, you think we're kids. You're

109
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:36,360
kidding. I'm gonna listen to a comedy show, they said. I'm gonna pretend like I'm cool.

110
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,480
For their own lurid, misguided, unforgivable pleasures, they derive the truth little by

111
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,800
little, the truth that will become very clear to you, friend, in a moment. Even now, deciding

112
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,240
in the mind, you've convinced yourself that you possessed, soon to be replaced, at the

113
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,520
behest of those same inevitable, irrevocable...

114
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,860
Elder Gods.

115
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,520
Well, thank you, Reverend Glenn Carlson, for the beautiful music in the background. And

116
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,100
well, we've got a full show today. Look at all these cassettes already stacking up around

117
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:26,460
here. We got a real cool guy here tonight. Yeah, yeah, we do. The Reverend R.C. Guy.

118
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,520
That's his call. That's his radio. That's his radio. That's his radio. That's his radio.

119
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:28,520


120
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,140
That's his radio name. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

121
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,300
The Reverend R.C. Guy from KABF in Little Rock, Arkansas.

122
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,560
Yeah, so get out of here, you maniacs. Yeah. Come here.

123
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,240
We'd like you to give your money to Bob. Come here, sane man.

124
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,180
Yeah. Hey.

125
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,300
Such a pleasure to be here with you this evening. I hate you. I hate you, old man.

126
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,500
Have my machine call your machine. Really? You're beautiful, baby.

127
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,740
See you playing with Dr. Bob, of course. Really, man? I met some of those doctors. Doctors. Doctors.

128
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you know what?

129
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,100
Doctors. Doctors.

130
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:09,560
Okay. Okay, now listen, guys. I'm not sure that I have any Doctors for Bob music. Believe it or not, I've been playing.

131
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,900
We've been going on and on about doctors. We need more time to play Doctors for Bob.

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,220
I wish. I wish we had more.

133
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:21,020
Oh, we wish Jane and her hyperflexes could get on there and just go on and on about it, man. Little thing got the time.

134
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,900
We'll show Jane up and come down here and give you a hug.

135
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,580
Well, actually, we do have some Jane. We're going to pull some Jane up.

136
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:25,840
Oh, no.

137
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,400
Has Buck shown up?

138
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:36,620
Wait a minute. Surely these albums could do, by beating them against things, could do...

139
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,040
Doctors for Bob albums and LPs and records?

140
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:47,020
Those Doctors for Bob albums, LPs and records that just have false, satanic, cheap replicas of other people's names on the outside of it.

141
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,320
They told us not to do that no more.

142
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,840
This is how you feed me.

143
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,720
We're here to tell the judge.

144
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,040
Give me your hand.

145
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,120
Oh, no.

146
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,160
Don't be frightened. I'm not going to harm you.

147
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:08,040
Here, just take your two fingers, like this, and now dip them into the milk.

148
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,880
That's right.

149
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:17,560
And now hold them right above her little nose and let the milk drip.

150
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,860
Oh, I can see you're going to make a wonderful mother for this creature.

151
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,120
Well, I finished what I've come to do. I must go now.

152
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,200
What? What is it, Garrison? What about me?

153
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,080
Ah.

154
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,780
Okay, now listen up, kids. It's time for other...

155
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,200
...tape.

156
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,360
And you're going to love it because it's going to...

157
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,940
...which means it'll be really special and...

158
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,580
...which means it's going to be full of lots of interesting and exciting things for you to listen to.

159
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,260
Just watch.

160
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,300
...some time later in another part of the tape.

161
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:09,740
...

162
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:21,120
It will take me some time to explain the trouble you were in, but I don't know how long it will be before she sends the others out for us.

163
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:31,020
Garrison tried with all his might to understand, but this lack of attention caused her to act more sourly than ever.

164
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,040
...

165
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,140
...

166
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:36,140


167
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,380
...

168
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:37,380


169
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:37,380


170
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:37,380


171
00:10:37,380 --> 00:11:07,380


172
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:37,380


173
00:11:37,380 --> 00:12:07,380


174
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,180
I'm going to have to go back and ask the children.

175
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,900
I feel like a child now, but I can't.

176
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:16,620
...

177
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,380
...

178
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,140
...

179
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,320
...

180
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,320


181
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,320


182
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,320


183
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,320


184
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,320


185
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,220
...

186
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,220


187
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,220


188
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,400
...

189
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,400


190
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,400


191
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,400


192
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,400


193
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,400


194
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,400


195
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,400


196
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,400


197
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,400


198
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,040
...

199
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,040


200
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,040


201
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,040


202
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:41,140
consciousness. Oh, poverty and hate. Oh, kill little kids. Oh, friends. Here, shut that

203
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,160
door back there. I think that's causing us some of our gloom and destruction. Friends,

204
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,680
we want to do, we're going to do another call-in show tonight. All right. We need to, but I

205
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:57,040
want to stick to a subject matter. And this time, dear friends, the subject matter is

206
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:04,140
the unknown. I want to get some call-ins. We don't want you telling us about how you

207
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:11,900
saw Bob last week because you probably did see something that you thought was Bob. But

208
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:20,640
what we want to do is get you calling in and give us your stories of poltergeist.

209
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,740
Phenomena or UFO sightings. And I'm talking about true weird stuff that you can't explain.

210
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:41,900
And that number, friends, is 823-7490. Looks like we're getting one in here. Hang in there.

211
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:42,480
Yeah.

212
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,180
For the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer is the only

213
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,400
true

214
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,740
pagan idol, which is the one true God.

215
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,400
People are out trying to launch Palmer heads that aren't bleeding.

216
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,420
And they think they're going to go to heaven.

217
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:20,660
I saw a man on a TV talk show. He talked about launching Torpedo heads, about launching Torpedo heads.

218
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,800
And I said, man, you're only launching bloodless Palmer heads.

219
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,780
Kisses, K-N-O-N.

220
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,720
Onan.

221
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:29,980
Onan.

222
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,560
Onan.

223
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,900
No, you're kidding.

224
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,300
No, I'm not. This is Reverend Dr. Onan.

225
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,700
All right. Well, we've got a caller here from, where are you calling from, Onan?

226
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,320
Knoxville, Tennessee.

227
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:49,300
Uh-huh. Are you causing the feedback? Listen, man, I mean, you Tennessee weirdos have got

228
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,660
to quit giving us signs, you know?

229
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:50,660


230
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:50,660


231
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:50,660


232
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:50,660


233
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:50,660


234
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:50,660


235
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:50,660


236
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:50,660


237
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,680
so much technical difficulty over the airwaves here.

238
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,900
Well, you know, what do you expect from these cheap subgenius crystal radios?

239
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,440
Really, I think it's the cheap subgenius headphones I've got on my head.

240
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,940
Hey, Onan, how's the church going in Tennessee?

241
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,160
I mean, did you guys get out of the legal trouble yet?

242
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,460
As far as I know, it's up in the air now.

243
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,680
It's out of my hands.

244
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,400
Well, since you called, I'm sure we'll probably be in even deeper trouble.

245
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,180
We weren't supposed to be associated with you.

246
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:32,600
If you remember, Dr. Onan, we asked you not to tell the FBI to call us.

247
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,180
We've got enough problems.

248
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,500
Don't give me this number.

249
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,600
Oh, no.

250
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,460
I'm hearing more than one voice here.

251
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,760
Is there some other?

252
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,260
Yes, there are.

253
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,240
There's a whole slew of doctors here.

254
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,720
We've got some doctors from Arkansas.

255
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,540
We've got the real cool guy here from KBF.

256
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,520
Can you bear with me if sometimes this doesn't make much sense?

257
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,300
Do you understand?

258
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,740
It doesn't make any damn sense.

259
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,460
No, no sense at all.

260
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,540
Does it all come together a little more clearly now?

261
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,120
Okay.

262
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,560
Sinking up. Sinking in.

263
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,200
Let's...

264
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,240
Oh, do you...

265
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,120
Do you have any weird, uh, uh, any weird phenomena you can, you can describe to us?

266
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,820
Because that's what we're, we're trying to say on the subject matter of tonight.

267
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:37,060
It's true tales of weird sightings of unexplainable big feet chewing the heads off mutilated cattle in the dead of night with glowing lights that appear and disappear and apparitions of your deceased relatives.

268
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,380
Any, uh, spider-legged succubi or incubi?

269
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,940
Uh, something along those lines.

270
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,240
Perhaps a little more, uh...

271
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,820
Academic.

272
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:51,000
But, uh, a recent discovery I've made is church shapes.

273
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,780
Church shapes?

274
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:53,400
Yes.

275
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:53,880
Church shapes.

276
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:00,240
Shapes which can only be understood and indeed seen only within the context of the church.

277
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,900
Uh, now, now, what, the church of the subject...

278
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,420
Now, what...

279
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,940
Try to give us an example of this, Dr. Onan.

280
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,440
Uh...

281
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,280
This is confusing, not only to our listeners, but to me.

282
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:15,020
Well, this, this show, for example, this show is a church shape.

283
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:15,840
Uh-huh.

284
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:26,160
Because, uh, I'm sure that some of our listeners who lack faith might not be able to envision this show, but, of course, you and I and all the other doctors can, uh...

285
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,040
We can see it.

286
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Well, most, most people can't afford an enterocitor.

287
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:30,980
That's the problem.

288
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,540
I mean, you know, if you've got the blueprints from the aliens, then fine.

289
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
It's no big deal.

290
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,120
Yeah.

291
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,860
You can see it's full living color, 3D, digital effects, the whole, the whole thing.

292
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:41,840
Uh...

293
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,240
We try to explain that at the beginning of every show, but I think it falls short.

294
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,940
It falls on deaf eyes.

295
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,060
They can't, they can't hear the truth that's standing in front of them.

296
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,280
They, they have, they have no third nostril.

297
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,020
Well...

298
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,480
They have no third nostril.

299
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,340
They must blow.

300
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,660
They must.

301
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,380
They blow.

302
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,400
So, how's things in, uh, Ticklip?

303
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,440
Oh, about the same.

304
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,360
Ticklip, Tennessee.

305
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,600
That's where, that's where this call really is from.

306
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,760
I'm also, hey, listen, I may, Onan, we gotta get off, because I'm expecting a call from San Francisco today, too.

307
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,260
So make it quick.

308
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,880
I wish we had more time, but, uh...

309
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,120
Yeah, what's the next one?

310
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,360
Okay, um, one, one thing, though.

311
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:23,920
Yeah.

312
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,020
Let's broadcast this show into the past.

313
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,880
Well, at the, that...

314
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,620
Like about February 16th of, uh, 86.

315
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,380
Funny, I, I'm like, I felt like I didn't hear before.

316
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,980
That was only today.

317
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,660
Oh, I got, I got, I get it.

318
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,180
You, you, yeah, I, I tend to, I tend to forget all...

319
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,220
T-shirt?

320
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,600
...so that the listeners don't know that this is the future.

321
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,160
Well, wait a minute.

322
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,000
In San Francisco, it's...

323
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So, Onan?

324
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:52,560
Yeah?

325
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,160
Let me catch the other ones here.

326
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,360
Praise Bob or kill me?

327
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,660
What?

328
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,380
Are you there?

329
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,680
Yeah, what?

330
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,280
Okay, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna kill the other listener.

331
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,920
Is Onan on one?

332
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,700
Yes.

333
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,460
Okay, then kill Onan.

334
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,560
Goodbye, Onan.

335
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:09,940
Goodbye.

336
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,700
We love you.

337
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,280
We did.

338
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,160
Uh, testing.

339
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,200
This is KNN.

340
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,140
This is KNON.

341
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,280
This is KNON.

342
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,760
No, it ain't.

343
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,780
This is KNON, friend.

344
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:22,940
Something.

345
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,180
Well, I...

346
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,740
Something about something.

347
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,040
Three.

348
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,300
There's somebody on the phone in the other room there.

349
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,400
This, this slack noise is driving me crazy.

350
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,660
There.

351
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,680
God.

352
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,560
This is ridiculous.

353
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,120
There's only one thing to do in a case like this.

354
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,460
I heard that Bob said,

355
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,420
I go,

356
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:44,600
I go,

357
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,220
What the hell?

358
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:45,960
You know, I should call.

359
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,860
And, uh...

360
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:47,960
Attention.

361
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,140
In this instance, I am going to...

362
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,520
Accidentally...

363
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,040
Are you guys even on the phone line anymore?

364
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:53,840
What?

365
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,780
No, no, here.

366
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,400
Wait a minute.

367
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,700
I have to wake up here and...

368
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,720
I'm gonna call the police.

369
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,400
Okay, now...

370
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,880
I'm gonna call the police.

371
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,120
You were talking about, like,

372
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,740
you had a problem with your parents when you were a little kid, right?

373
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,700
Evidence is that I have been dealing with...

374
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,080
What happened?

375
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,780
Do your, your...

376
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,060
What happened to my parents?

377
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,300
...puzzling through it, maybe.

378
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,340
Floating around the top of the room.

379
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,000
I don't know, man.

380
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,340
I just had this terrible dream.

381
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:11,700
I...

382
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,120
Hey.

383
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,580
Hey, oh, call an alert.

384
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,080
Call an alert.

385
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,480
I don't want to go to work.

386
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,660
Oh, man.

387
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,320
I got this show sauce in my eyes.

388
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,360
I can't wake up.

389
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,080
My whole face is glued closed.

390
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,080
Oh, man.

391
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,360
Everybody keeps me real busy.

392
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:26,920
Oh, man.

393
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,660
Happens quite a bit.

394
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,300
Oh, yeah.

395
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,200
What does this stupid church have against us that makes us have to do this?

396
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,960
...dopers, junkies...

397
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,160
Why are they...

398
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,700
...sick, venal...

399
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,500
I don't know.

400
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,380
I mean, why could we have...

401
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:38,840
Dopers and junkies?

402
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,380
...good duty?

403
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,360
Why are there people out here early in the morning?

404
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:41,680
...doping, burping, burping...

405
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,540
...and little babies crying off in the alley?

406
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,820
Some church members are doctors and lawyers.

407
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,700
We have to be show janitors.

408
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,780
Okay, let's start cleaning up the show.

409
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,720
That's right.

410
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:59,440
The first thing we ought to do is get rid of this Bob Dobbs guy.

411
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,600
Killing him didn't help.

412
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,420
Oh, no!

413
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,260
Jesus.

414
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,560
The show bit me!

415
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,540
The tiny short show.

416
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,520
Oh, my God.

417
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,360
Oh, my God.

418
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:11,680
Oh, my God.

419
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,680


420
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,680


421
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,680


422
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,680


423
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,680


424
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,680


425
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,680


426
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,680


427
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,680


428
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,680


429
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,680


430
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,680


431
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,680


432
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:11,680


433
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,480
How does this thing work?

434
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,360
Yeah, how does it work?

435
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,640
You guys want to make this a fun show or not?

436
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,240
No.

437
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:17,680
No.

438
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,800
We want to figure a way to get off the radio.

439
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,760
Okay, caller.

440
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,320
Now they're hanging up as we hit them.

441
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,920
Okay, that's the way it's supposed to be, so...

442
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,340
Yeah, that's right.

443
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,960
So, if you think that we're actually fielding calls, please don't be fooled.

444
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,860
These are not telephone calls.

445
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,620
We're processing a few of them, buddy.

446
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,320
We know everybody that's calling here.

447
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,080
This is all just a big joke, and...

448
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,540
Only for a while.

449
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,180
...you know, these are friends of ours that call up.

450
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,620
I mean, who else is going to be awake at 4.30 in the morning, which this is not, because

451
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:41,660
they're all in the same room.

452
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:41,660


453
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,300
This is on tape.

454
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,760
You don't actually come down...

455
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,480
It's all fake.

456
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,740
It's just a big, ridiculous show.

457
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,900
...we do have to sit here and actually do it.

458
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,200
It's really hard to actually do it in the afternoon.

459
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,620
Listener, can you hear us?

460
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,260
We can talk to you later.

461
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,060
Listener?

462
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,000
Nope, I'm still here.

463
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,560
Okay, you're on.

464
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm...

465
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,040
We're on the air.

466
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,280
We're...

467
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,760
Now, I understand that you have had a true sighting.

468
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,200
With Bob as my witness, I have had a sighting.

469
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,180
Can you describe the sighting?

470
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:10,480
Oh, my God.

471
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:10,560


472
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:10,760
Oh, my God.

473
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,000


474
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,000


475
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,000


476
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,000


477
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,000


478
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,240
I was traveling on the road between Marfa and...

479
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,620
It's realistic.

480
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,900
...Alpine, Texas...

481
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,540
Uh-huh.

482
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,960
...with my brother.

483
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:20,420
Mar...

484
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:20,660
You...

485
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,340
Oh, this was the Marfa Lights?

486
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,520
Uh-huh.

487
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
I've heard of them.

488
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,200
Listen, the Marfa Lights...

489
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,400
Oh, damn.

490
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,020
Not so loud, you guys.

491
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,900
You've ordered me.

492
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,000
Hey, listen.

493
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:35,400
Now, all of a sudden, there was like one ball of light behind us.

494
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,120
Uh-huh.

495
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,740
And seemingly on the roadway, I, you know, immediately thought it was a motorcycle.

496
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:40,980
Uh-huh.

497
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,080
But the ball of light grew larger and approached upon us quickly.

498
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,140
Uh-huh.

499
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,040
All right?

500
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,840
They usually do.

501
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
It split into three.

502
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:50,900
Yes.

503
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,160
Okay?

504
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes, yes.

505
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:58,400
A horizontal three with the center one staying where it was and never decreasing in size.

506
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,380
Uh-huh.

507
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:04,540
So, were these glowing lights like in the movie Close Encounters, more or less, or...

508
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,260
No, this was like a spotlight shining at you.

509
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,060
Uh-huh.

510
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:15,780
You could not tell that it was anything but a spotlight shining at you.

511
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,460
It was just brilliant white light.

512
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,200
Uh-huh.

513
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,340
No eyes, no eyes.

514
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,400
No eyes.

515
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,020
It split in.

516
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:29,020
It split in, and the three each multiplied, one up and one down.

517
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,800
So, all of a sudden, there were nine, with the center one staying white, but the outside

518
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,980
one's to the left, turning to blue shades...

519
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,660
Uh-huh.

520
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:44,260
...from darker to lighter on the left side, and the right-hand side turning red shades

521
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,800
from darker to lighter, and the center one's being yellow.

522
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,140
Were you by yourself?

523
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,780
Did you like...

524
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,380
No, my brother was with me.

525
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:51,940
And...

526
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:56,300
And we were being chased down the road, and he was like freaked out.

527
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,860
You know, we were doing 110 down the road trying to stay away from this thing, and it

528
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,140
was staying like on our hiney.

529
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,800
How did this feel, dear friend?

530
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,060
Uh...

531
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:12,900
I was going, come on, come on, and my brother's going, let's get the hell out of here!

532
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,680
Did you understand?

533
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,700
Now, did you ever...

534
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,340
Did you know about the Marfa Lights?

535
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,200
Have you ever heard of them?

536
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,340
No, I hadn't heard of it until then.

537
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:28,680
My mother and my brother had lived down there for a while, for several years, but I had

538
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,300
visited only once or twice, and I'd never experienced it nor heard of it.

539
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,820
And when I saw it, I was like, oh, God!

540
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,040
I was like, oh, God!

541
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,040


542
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,040


543
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,500
Okay, now these people are smart!

544
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,300
Look at this!

545
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,360
Let's go!

546
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,740
Come on, I want to talk with you guys!

547
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,960
My brother was like, okay, come on, I know it'll disappear in a minute, but he's still

548
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,640
freaked out!

549
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,960
And he's still got it pegged!

550
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,940
Well, if you were, uh, what do you...

551
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:00,660
Do you feel like it was like, uh, extraterrestrial spacecraft, or just, do you have any explanation

552
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,920
that you personally...

553
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,900
Do I have an explanation for it?

554
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,360
No, my...

555
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,020
All my explanations would be on falsified space.

556
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,020


557
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,560
Falsified data.

558
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,820
I knew that I experienced something, okay?

559
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,660
Yeah.

560
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:18,380
And I felt something inside that was going, okay, well, come on, I'm ready!

561
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,860
You know?

562
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,560
That's strange.

563
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,820
So, so, I would...

564
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,760
I would feel it.

565
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,400
I was feeling like, okay, come on, let's...

566
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,420
Beam me up, Scotty, there's no intelligent life down here!

567
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,180
Eh, eh, eh.

568
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:29,980
Ahhhh.

569
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,060
You know what I'm saying?

570
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,920
Well, so, well, now, if you had it to do over again, though, would you say they stopped

571
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,000
doing it, or did they stop it?

572
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,000


573
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,000


574
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,000


575
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,000


576
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,000


577
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,000


578
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,000


579
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,920
If they stopped and dropped a step ladder, would you walk up the step ladder into the

580
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,220
light, or would you...

581
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,120
Oh, no, no question!

582
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,960
I wouldn't walk up it!

583
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,820
I would run up it, and, and...

584
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,480
Stripping your clothes off all the way!

585
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,460
It probably wouldn't be all the way down to ground before I got any good.

586
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,720
Well...

587
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:04,360
I'm ready, I'm ready, come on, there's gotta be something else out there besides us, besides

588
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,120
these, these people that...

589
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,400
That, that, that keep prodding us along with these hot pokers, and telling us that this

590
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,520
is right and this is wrong, and putting labels on records because these are nasty words,

591
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,600
and putting labels on radio stations because they play nasty words...

592
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,560
And putting labels over the mouths of some genius DJs who...

593
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,240
And putting labels on me...

594
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,260
Putting labels on me because I see lights in the sky, huh?

595
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,780
Uh-huh, nasty words.

596
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,020
Yeah, it is, it is, uh...

597
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,560
Okay, well, so, uh, I think, I...

598
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,620
There was nine of them, wasn't there?

599
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,820
Hey, is it them?

600
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,780
Is it them that's screwy?

601
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,540
Or is it us that's screwy?

602
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,240
Well, you know, there's, uh, there's no reason to believe that a paranormal event is what

603
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,040
it says it is, you know?

604
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,560
That's the only thing about UFO sightings and ghost sightings, it's how do you know

605
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:57,140
that UFOs aren't ghosts, or vice versa, and do they, you know, are they really being,

606
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:04,000
uh, uh, friendly, or are they just sort of juvenile delinquents of the before life, you

607
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,000


608
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,380
know?

609
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,140
Is the Lord Peyote, is the Lord Peyote actually a god?

610
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,340
I mean, is, uh...

611
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,880
Well, no, he's Bob's little brother.

612
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,260
Bob's little brother, I knew he must have been a god, or a junior god, anyway.

613
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,100
Well, um...

614
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,140
He told me a long time ago to be careful of Oboe.

615
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,360
Well, listen, man, thanks for the, for the, uh, story, I guess we, we need to move on.

616
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,620
All right, well, hey.

617
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,980
There's, uh, I'm gonna play a little bit of, uh, a take on the, uh, the, uh, the

618
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:33,980


619
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:53,260
до чем мы Rig у Чех用

620
00:27:53,260 --> 00:28:03,960
in the State that the estamos usando

621
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:03,960


622
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,420
Connect

623
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,440
Praise Bob.

624
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:08,560
Kill me.

625
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,100
See you later.

626
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,420
Indescribably beautiful.

627
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,040
They all stood speechless before the angel.

628
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,160
Don't be afraid.

629
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,480
I am the angel of peace.

630
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,780
The children did not move.

631
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,700
Pray with me.

632
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,600
My God, I believe.

633
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,020
I adore.

634
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,300
I hope and I love you.

635
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,240
I beg pardon of you for those who do not believe.

636
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,020
Do not adore.

637
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,460
Do not hope and do not love.

638
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,900
Bob's only got getting back home on his mind now.

639
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,740
Hi, Bob.

640
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,920
Right, Bob?

641
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,080
Bob.

642
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,580
Bob.

643
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,820
I came as a visitor, not an invader.

644
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,340
I must get back to my ship, Pedro.

645
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,300
See if I can repair it.

646
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,400
And then I must leave.

647
00:28:59,260 --> 00:28:59,900
No, wait.

648
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,780
What harm is there in hearing them out?

649
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,580
Other than being a salesman,

650
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:03,960
what does Bob do?

651
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,080
What does Bob do for a living?

652
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,980
Other than being a salesman?

653
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,840
Bob is not on Route 80 with a bag full of brush.

654
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,940
Who has met Bob?

655
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,580
He seemed extremely paranoid.

656
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,040
He believed in conspiracies.

657
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,940
He came on like a Nazi.

658
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,060
I was afraid of him.

659
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,900
Your tricks don't frighten us, neither do you.

660
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,320
We've come a long way in 5,000 years.

661
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,400
But you're still of the same nature.

662
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,960
I was afraid.

663
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,540
I can sweep you out of existence with a wave of my hand

664
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,520
and bring you back again.

665
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,660
I can give life or death.

666
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,840
What else does mankind demand of its gods?

667
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,480
Mankind has no need for gods.

668
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,880
We find the one quite adequate.

669
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,300
We shall not debate, mortal.

670
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,400
I offer you eternal rest and happiness

671
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,960
according to the ancient ways.

672
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,040
I ask little in return.

673
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,700
But what I ask for, I insist upon.

674
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,820
Approach me.

675
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,660
You shall reap the rewards of your insolence.

676
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,720
We're tired of your phony fireworks.

677
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,180
Mortal! You have earned this!

678
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,220
No, don't!

679
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:17,520
Lieutenant.

680
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,600
Father doesn't destroy his children.

681
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,620
You said you were gentle and understanding.

682
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,560
Lieutenant!

683
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,020
How can they worship you if you hurt them?

684
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,460
Really, Bob, I mean, come on.

685
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,240
What do you expect?

686
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,420
Well, we're gonna try this collar here.

687
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,420
Oh.

688
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,300
Oh, shoot.

689
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,360
I killed another collar.

690
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,660
Hello, collar.

691
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,080
Another soul.

692
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,440
Another soul lost to Bob.

693
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,200
Hello, collar.

694
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:46,780
Caller?

695
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,660
What's happening?

696
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,040
Have you a sighting to report?

697
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,080
Yeah.

698
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,980
Can you tell us about it quickly?

699
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:58,480
Well, if you go, you know, like, down 35 south.

700
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,340
Uh-huh.

701
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,200
I mean, like, there's some, like, frogs and stuff, man.

702
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:03,940
Big ones on the way.

703
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,240
Big ones on the side of the road, man.

704
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,260
And I'm serious.

705
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,380
Is it a frog migration?

706
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:13,240
Are these, like, are these foot, house-sized frogs or just, you know, fist-sized?

707
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:13,340
Pike frogs?

708
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,280
I mean, like, six feet high.

709
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,260
Metal frogs?

710
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:16,840
Yeah.

711
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,000
Six-foot-high frogs?

712
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,940
They're like, they're six-foot high.

713
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:20,900
Yeah.

714
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,360
How high are you?

715
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
I've seen them frogs.

716
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,460
Frogs, you think?

717
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:24,960
Yeah.

718
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,440
Oh, yeah, those are them.

719
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:26,700
Wow.

720
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,560
They had eight?

721
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,780
This is not unknown.

722
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,540
We know about the frogs.

723
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,100
Yeah.

724
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,920
How are they caught?

725
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:33,940


726
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:33,940


727
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:33,940


728
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,240
I know.

729
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,980
No lights.

730
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,800
We've seen the frogs.

731
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,240
Yeah.

732
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:40,420
Don't, don't, do not try to communicate with the frogs and don't believe anything they

733
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:40,900
tell you.

734
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,920
These frogs, uh, we, we, there are, there are frog battles, paranormal frog battles

735
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,160
in Malaysia, and this is just a bleed over from the three, the 4D world, if you know

736
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,540
what I mean.

737
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,500
Listen, I'm gonna have to go to another call, okay?

738
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,940
Just stay away from the damn frogs.

739
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:56,700
That's, I mean...

740
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,780
Denons are coming.

741
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,520
Huh.

742
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,100
Yeah.

743
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,020
Guys.

744
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,320
All right.

745
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,040
Praise Bob.

746
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,840
Dear friend.

747
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:04,620
Yes?

748
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,240
Are you, is it, are you back?

749
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,120
Yeah, I'm back.

750
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:07,680
All right.

751
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,960
Okay, we're on.

752
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,000
Okay, you'll...

753
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,520
Tell us, yes, tell us this, this horrible...

754
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,780
It wasn't horrible, it was fantastic.

755
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:15,820
Uh-huh.

756
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,200
Okay.

757
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:16,640
Uh-oh.

758
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,400
Okay, you see, I'm here doing my weekly shopping at Target, right?

759
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:20,940
Uh-huh.

760
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,560
Okay, so I'm walking down the aisle.

761
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:22,900
Hmm.

762
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,740
Yeah, I hear the shopping music.

763
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,960
So, and all of a sudden I hear this voice off, off to the behind of me, right?

764
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,560
Uh-huh.

765
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,020
And so, you know, I'm walking down the aisle, and I hear this voice, and I hear this voice

766
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,020


767
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,160
and at first, I didn't think it was talking to me, but you know, yeah, it said, yeah,

768
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,100
you, you know?

769
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:41,700
So I, I turned around, and the only thing there was behind me was, it was a legs pantyhose

770
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,120
display.

771
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,180
Uh-huh.

772
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,160
Okay?

773
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,880
The best kind.

774
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,720
And so, I mean, I look over there, and I can't really tell where the voice is coming from,

775
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,460
but it seems to be coming from this display.

776
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,320
Uh-huh.

777
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,000
So I go over there, and I take a closer look, and the voice gets louder and louder as I

778
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,560
get closer.

779
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,780
And so I get over there, and I look.

780
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,000
Okay, so, what's the problem?

781
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,460
and there's a little face inside of one of the little eggs.

782
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,440
Uh-huh.

783
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,900
And it's talking to me, and it's telling me to release it.

784
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,060
It's saying, help me, help me, you know, release me, let me out.

785
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:22,320
And so I got really frightened because, I mean, it was this totally weird-looking face.

786
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,160
It was like a green, gaseous little face in there, you know.

787
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,900
Sort of like in Ghostbusters?

788
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,120
Exactly, exactly.

789
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,260
But I couldn't really tell who it was, you know.

790
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,380
So I didn't really want to let it out.

791
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,540
So I bought this egg, and I brought it home.

792
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,800
And then my little brother opened it, or I guess he opened it.

793
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,000
It's because I came in last night from work, right?

794
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,640
Yeah.

795
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,380
And so my little brother's passed out on the floor,

796
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,140
and he has this big black bruise on the side of his face.

797
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,200
Oh!

798
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,000
And laying next to him, the egg is open,

799
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,540
and there's a little pair of pantyhose laying there on the floor next to him.

800
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,020
That's what it is.

801
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,180
That's the new experimental.

802
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,240
So can you tell me?

803
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,720
Tell me what happened.

804
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,060
Cabbage patch.

805
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,600
Cabbage patch kids.

806
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,320
That's where they come from.

807
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:07,940
Really.

808
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,560
They evolve out of legs pantyhose.

809
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,300
Do they really?

810
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:13,820
Yes.

811
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,160
More cabbage?

812
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,180
Look at them.

813
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:16,960
Look at that skin.

814
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,520
That's pantyhose material skin.

815
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,880
They evolve in a cabbage patch skin.

816
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,660
That's why they're so expensive, you know.

817
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,560
So my...

818
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,120
They ain't got no legs.

819
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,700
So my kid brother was attacked by a cabbage patch kid.

820
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,200
That's right.

821
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,240
It's been in the...

822
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:31,240


823
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,060
It's been in the egg too long.

824
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:32,920
It was mad.

825
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,640
It was in the egg too long.

826
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,340
I was evil.

827
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,760
And don't feed them whatever you do.

828
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,480
Don't feed them after midnight.

829
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,980
So who should I sue?

830
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,520
Don't spit on them.

831
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,600
Should I, like, sue Coleco or something?

832
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:42,980
Huh?

833
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,640
No, that's Hasbro.

834
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,460
That's a Hasbro.

835
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,040
Is it Hasbro?

836
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:46,400
Yeah.

837
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,460
Listen, I'm gonna get on to another one, okay?

838
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,320
Okay, thanks a lot.

839
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:49,780
Kill me.

840
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,440
Hello, you are on KNON.

841
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:53,660
Hello?

842
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,100
Hello?

843
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:54,900
Caller?

844
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,980
Caller number two.

845
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,020
Chicken.

846
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,720
Chicken.

847
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,140
We're afraid.

848
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,580
What was that?

849
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,680
They're scraping the inside of my brain!

850
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,640
Are you an acrobat?

851
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,700
Only philosophically.

852
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:16,620
What?

853
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,060
Only philosophically.

854
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,260
Really?

855
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,940
Can you walk a tightrope?

856
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,600
Keep me quiet.

857
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,980
My specialty, however, is wisdom.

858
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,720
You know what wisdom is?

859
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,620
No, sir.

860
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,120
Why is that, sir?

861
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,640
Bob.

862
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,720
If what you say is true, what are we to expect?

863
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,300
You need me, and I have come.

864
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,600
Hi, Bob.

865
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,180
Hi, Bob.

866
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:39,800
Hi, Bob.

867
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,180
Yeah.

868
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,620
Bob, Bob.

869
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,340
Bob.

870
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,000
Bob.

871
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,880
Bob, Bob.

872
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,640
You're ever changing.

873
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,900
Yes, sir.

874
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,400
I like subgenius.

875
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,060
No, sir.

876
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,520
I don't like pink boys.

877
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,460
Yes, sir.

878
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,460
I love Bob.

879
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,480
No, sir.

880
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,140
No, sir.

881
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,080
I do not want to stop Bob.

882
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,940
I want Bob in every tree.

883
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,000
I just want to give Bob a chance.

884
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,220
I want to give my fish to the thousands.

885
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:05,820
In every flower, in every bee, in every leaf, in every twig, in every cow, in every pig.

886
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:05,920
Yes, deep fried as it is.

887
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:11,860
They brought out the best in Bob's fish and laid upon the other water and fowl a little stinky thing.

888
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,960
I want to feel him in the breeze.

889
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,640
And everybody saw, and everybody ate, and the rest of my guys.

890
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,540
For all this, Bob.

891
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,800
Dear Bob, who floats in the ground.

892
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:25,240
They don't realize that there's this, like, lattice of coincidence that lays on top of everything.

893
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,340
Give me an example.

894
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,220
I'll show you what I mean.

895
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,420
If you have a pick on you.

896
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:33,560
H crossover.

897
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,680
You know how long you're doing this.

898
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,260
Well, I tell you follow along and you're gonna be a VIP as well.

899
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,860
All right?

900
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:44,860


901
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,700
So you're all doing it, and I'm going in.

902
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:45,700


903
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,500
Probably, uh, all of my strains are Cayuan sub sports.

904
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:47,500


905
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,060
I'm kind of on my own, but I just learn how to moving.

906
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,060


907
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,060


908
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,060


909
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,060


910
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,380
Back again.

911
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:50,700
Back again.

912
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,140
Right.

913
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,200
Back again.

914
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,200


915
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,200


916
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,760
Back again.

917
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:06,680
all the supermarkets about commuter triangles, UFOs, how the Mayans invented television,

918
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,060
that kind of thing?

919
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,520
I don't read them books.

920
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,920
Well, the way I see it, it's exactly the same.

921
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:17,560
There ain't no difference between a flying saucer and a time machine.

922
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,380
People get so hung up on specifics, they miss out on seeing the whole thing.

923
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,180
Take South America, for example.

924
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,800
All right, dear friends.

925
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,440
Did we lose another one?

926
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,420
Hello?

927
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,180
Well, we need a private number.

928
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,260
That's all there is to it.

929
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:46,080
But if you think about it for a minute, you realize something.

930
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,940
There had to be a time when there was no people, right?

931
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,640
Yeah, yes.

932
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,020
Well, where did all these people come from?

933
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:54,700
Huh?

934
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:55,880
Hmm?

935
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,260
I'll tell you where.

936
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,940
The future.

937
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,940
Where did all these people disappear to?

938
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,400
Hmm?

939
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:05,820
The past.

940
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:06,700
That's right.

941
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,400
And how'd they get there?

942
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,000
Flying saucers.

943
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,400
Which are really...

944
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,820
Yeah, you got it.

945
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,580
Time machines.

946
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,640
I think a lot about this kind of stuff.

947
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,300
I do my best thinking on the bus.

948
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,520
That's how come I don't drive.

949
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,680
Hello, dear friend.

950
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,780
Are you...

951
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,620
I'm here.

952
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,500
All right, we got you this time.

953
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,320
Yeah.

954
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,280
I can just barely...

955
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,600
Are we still here?

956
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,180
That's the...

957
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,580
I can just barely hear you.

958
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,800
Hello?

959
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,040
Can't hear you at all now.

960
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,280
Well, I wish you could.

961
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,200
This is K...

962
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,620
Oh.

963
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,420
Oh.

964
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,420
That guy came back for more.

965
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,040
That's made when you emerge from space

966
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,720
and come to this, my dwelling place.

967
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,720
Dear Bob, each night while I'm asleep,

968
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,040
I hope to my house you will creep.

969
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,860
Caller, have we got you yet?

970
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,280
Caller?

971
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:22,940
Caller?

972
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,940
I should be found dead someday.

973
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,140
I'll be...

974
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,820
Knowing that you were in the way.

975
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,920
Oh, gimme Bob.

976
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,860
Confusing that face.

977
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,180
With my own.

978
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,900
Can't remember my place.

979
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,760
What you propose is dominance, not salvation.

980
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,200
Don't be governed by fear.

981
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,080
Who is J.R. Bob Dobbs, anyway?

982
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,500
Who is this man, Bob?

983
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,360
Who is Bob?

984
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:02,100
Bob was and is the world's, the universe's, as we understand it, greatest salesman.

985
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,060
Uh-huh. That's what got him into the religion business to begin with.

986
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:14,300
And now, friend, we are on the air finally.

987
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,960
Praise Bob!

988
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:16,640
Hello?

989
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:21,840
Yeah, we're finally on. I'm sorry, I discovered what my problem was.

990
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,280
Brett's brain damaged. Go ahead.

991
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:31,180
I heard that, you know, J.R. Bob Dobbs, I heard that he was related in some distant way to Gumby.

992
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,620
To Gumby?

993
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,380
Gumby.

994
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,560
That's a pretty distant relation, to tell the truth.

995
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:44,240
It's not true. I heard that they were like, you know, like first cousins or something like that.

996
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:51,420
That's ridiculous. Gumby is a fictitious character. Bob Dobbs is the living avatar of slack on this planet.

997
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:52,840
Slack! Slack! Slack!

998
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,260
And frankly, we're trying to stick...

999
00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:01,860
Stick with some, uh, with some sincere paranormal callers here. Gumby is a stop-motion clay animation.

1000
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:08,340
It's the easiest thing in the world to do, so if you don't mind...

1001
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,740
Thank you.

1002
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,560
Bob, Bob, Bob.

1003
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,080
What on earth are you about to do?

1004
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:21,280
This is the man in black, here for the Rum and Wine Company of Fresno, California.

1005
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,060
You can't owe it.

1006
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,540
What did he say?

1007
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:24,980
You're a murderer.

1008
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,640
K-N-O-N.

1009
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,660
Waiting for a meeting.

1010
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,320
I am the first to come to you.

1011
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:31,980
Hello, caller.

1012
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,180
With death and destruction.

1013
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,160
Caller.

1014
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,400
Go ahead and kill me.

1015
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,400
Caller.

1016
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,220
I had to kill him.

1017
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,460
What's gonna happen to your children, when it's...

1018
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,640
When it's the society we've created.

1019
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,620
The society of air conditioners.

1020
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,240
Station wagons with wooden sides.

1021
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,140
Station wagons with wooden sides.

1022
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,160
A portion of the need.

1023
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,980
A portion of the need.

1024
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,660
A portion of the need.

1025
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,260
A portion of the need.

1026
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:54,920
A portion of the need.

1027
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:54,920


1028
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:54,920


1029
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:54,920


1030
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:54,920


1031
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,320
It's a large family.

1032
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:55,960
A portion of the need.

1033
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:55,960


1034
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:57,920
What's going on?

1035
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,680
What's going on?

1036
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,160
What's going on?

1037
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:00,840
What's going on?

1038
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,140
What's going on?

1039
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,480
It's the subgenius.

1040
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,560
This is subgenius.

1041
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:07,680
Well, listen to me, I have the most amazing true life story.

1042
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,840
Please tell us.

1043
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,860
...you'll ever hear.

1044
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,620
Uh-huh.

1045
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,680
Try me.

1046
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,180
Hi.

1047
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,100
The album, The Rat Pays Sweet Teas.

1048
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,460
I was just walking down the street, you know, like in downtown Dallas.

1049
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:16,940
Listen to me.

1050
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,840
And, you know, I was just your average everyday Bobby.

1051
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,260
Uh-huh.

1052
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,080
Yeah, there's a lot of...

1053
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,720
Not really.

1054
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,840
Uh-huh.

1055
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:57,300
What came out? That's the important part. What came out of the third nostril?

1056
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:17,660
Some sort of viscous liquid slag shot a brick out of your nose?

1057
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:28,220
My third nostril stayed open and was able to be seen by everybody in the entire world.

1058
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:36,240
Even Bobby. Anyone who looks at my nose can just see this disgusting but beautiful third nostril.

1059
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,540
Yeah, now here's the bottom line. Has this helped you to get dates or, uh...

1060
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,040
Get what?

1061
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,840
I mean, you know, just exa...

1062
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:45,040
Well, no, but...

1063
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,400
Beauty's only skin deep, right?

1064
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,240
I mean, Stigmata are fun, right?

1065
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,380
My slag?

1066
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,080
How'd they get your dates?

1067
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,120
Just from my mouth.

1068
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,840
You exterminate rats with slag?

1069
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,000
Yeah, shooting out of my nose. My third nostril.

1070
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,480
It's... it's amazing.

1071
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:05,140
I think you're getting mixed up between slag and snot. Pardon my language.

1072
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:11,400
No, I know it's not, because Bob told me with his brick. It's written all over it.

1073
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,100
It's like...

1074
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,660
Nostril opener.

1075
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,960
Third nostril. Well, friends, you heard it here first.

1076
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,240
You can get your third nostril open.

1077
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:36,400
And be able to tune into those etheric airwaves by simply sending that green rectangular piece of worthless paper to the post office box we'll read at the end of the broadcast, friend.

1078
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,660
But actually, probably what it was was an anti-Dallas manifestation.

1079
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,680
The what?

1080
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,120
The anti-Dallas?

1081
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,480
See, that is what... that's possibly what happened.

1082
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,820
That you were walking through...

1083
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:52,640
Yeah.

1084
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:57,260
The conjunction of the Dallas and the anti-Dallas. There have been quite a few of them lately.

1085
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,720
And the brick probably passed through the barrier.

1086
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:02,720
Yeah.

1087
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,720
And that was false slag.

1088
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:09,120
I'm sorry, it's not getting you dates. It might be false slag.

1089
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,640
It is. It's getting me dates.

1090
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,820
Praise Bob.

1091
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:12,300
Praise Bob.

1092
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,800
Don't ask questions. That's the important thing. Don't ask questions.

1093
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,880
And it's not only getting me dates, but it's also exterminating rats.

1094
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,260
Praise Bob.

1095
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,160
Well, friend, we're gonna have to exterminate you right now. No offense.

1096
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,000
Praise Bob.

1097
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,380
Or kill Bob.

1098
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:40,800
But until that day, the power and wisdom of Bob can help us bring their mind to control by activating that new gland that we all have within us.

1099
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:49,800
You don't like your life? Straighten it out in a big hurry! Give your money to the church, not the state! The church!

1100
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,200
Yes!

1101
00:45:55,460 --> 00:46:00,900
Give us your children! Give us your children!

1102
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,600
Let us raise them!

1103
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,820
You'll have weirder kids than me!

1104
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,440
Meltdown.

1105
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,860
Somewhere in America, in your community...

1106
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,260
Hey, look, look what I have here.

1107
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,880
All it takes is just...

1108
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,280
Exploit the abnormality potential that exists within you.

1109
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:30,920
Oh, yeah.

1110
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:37,080
Damn, from the day you were born, they raised you to say, teach you that there's something wrong with photography.

1111
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,220
Hello, this is Anne McKinney.

1112
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,960
Fourteen years ago, legalized birth control became a reality in America.

1113
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:45,520
Thirteen years ago, abortion was made legal.

1114
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,560
Now, in 1986, these fundamental rights are being threatened.

1115
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,960
But you can do something.

1116
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:57,320
March 9th in Washington, D.C., the National Organization for Women is planning the first nationwide pro-choice march since 1973.

1117
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,080
Your reproductive freedoms have never been more threatened than they are today.

1118
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,980
In the meantime, if you don't want Jerry Falwell or Ronald Reagan deciding what birth control method you choose, you can do something about it.

1119
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:11,680
Join us in this struggle now, or your future decisions may be in someone else's hands.

1120
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,780
Show your legislators and President Reagan that you do care.

1121
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,180
March with your sisters and brothers in Washington, D.C., on March 9th.

1122
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:24,340
Call National Organization for Women at 424-5474 for more details.

1123
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:27,660
There's another puff of that puffer fish.

1124
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,440
This is KNOAN 90.9 in Dallas, Texas.

1125
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:40,160
Even while we're working, um, everything in the universe snaps itself inside out with a hideous sucking motion.

1126
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:49,160
The only reason you cannot call the world impossible is because it is only through the world that you know that there is a world.

1127
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:58,480
You have been led to believe that everyone feels he or she may be the only living consciousness,

1128
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:04,240
but you are in fact the only one who believes this is true.

1129
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,840
The fundamental structure of reality is totally transformed every instant,

1130
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:17,160
but it provides you with a fully memory that it has always been the way it is.

1131
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,640
Since you are always at the exact center of an infinity,

1132
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:29,220
there is no such thing as movement, location, space, or time.

1133
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:37,300
You are a row of electrochemical events taking place in your cerebrum.

1134
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:43,400
Nothing has meaning in itself, but everything can support any meaning.

1135
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:49,100
If you could glimpse for even a moment the real meaning of existence,

1136
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,940
your brain would be neuroanatomically destroyed.

1137
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,660
You cannot conceive of a thing for which you do not have a word.

1138
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:03,940
What?

1139
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,840
Oh, shit!

1140
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:15,140
You have always been listening to this tape.

1141
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:19,080
You cannot remember a thing.

1142
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,500
You cannot remember a time before you were born,

1143
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:24,260
because there was no such time, nor any other.

1144
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,740
It has always been this moment.

1145
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,080
Death could occur inexplicably any second.

1146
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,340
The oddness of the world...

1147
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:41,620
The sidewalk surface was dancing with tricks.

1148
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:48,300
In mad whirling surfboards they looked for kicks.

1149
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:55,060
They woke each other like drugs to their blood.

1150
00:49:55,620 --> 00:50:02,260
And drop drops and tramps when they're playing studs.

1151
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:08,060
And they're pretty folks, pretty folks, bending a trend.

1152
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:14,740
Pretty folks, pretty folks, they'll never mend.

1153
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:22,140
Splitting their cells, looking for pills.

1154
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:29,280
They blow their change and they don't pay their bills.

1155
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,760
Hard to find what you love, spend XTK.

1156
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:42,280
Blocks of flash zeros with nothing to say.

1157
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:48,420
And they're pretty folks, pretty folks, bending a trend.

1158
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:55,140
Pretty folks, pretty folks, they'll never mend.

1159
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,960
Splitting their cells, looking for pills.

1160
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:08,720
Splitting their cells, looking for pills.

1161
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:28,860
And they're pretty folks, pretty folks, bending a trend.

1162
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:35,580
Pretty folks, pretty folks, they'll never mend.

1163
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,700
In fun, in fun, in fun, in fun, in fun.

1164
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:38,700


1165
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:43,280
Most nerds, they don't seem to age.

1166
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:49,720
As they decompose in memory's cage.

1167
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:56,440
But total loss is not something to hide.

1168
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:02,740
When the last big sleep has started inside.

1169
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:08,640
Cause they're pretty folks, pretty folks, bending a trend.

1170
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,760
wide awake running venom making the trend

1171
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,180
pretty folks, pretty folks.

1172
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,000
they'll never mend.

1173
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,380
Thank you.

1174
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,920
Thank you.

1175
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,180
Thank you.

1176
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,400
Thank you.

1177
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,480
Thank you.

1178
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,380
Thank you.

1179
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,100
Thank you.

1180
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,320
Thank you.

1181
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,420
Thank you.

1182
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,080
Thank you.

1183
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:01,260
Thank you.

1184
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:18,820
Thank you.

1185
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,020
Thank you.

1186
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,080
Thank you.

1187
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:22,000
And down in my old magnetic soul shoes

1188
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:05,060
Oh, yes, dear friends, we're slowly but surely gonna make our way out of here.

1189
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,500
Was it really worth it, friend? Did you have a good time?

1190
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,300
Was it worth the $8.50 a minute?

1191
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,800
Enjoy your frock stick, or was it a mite?

1192
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,640
Too strong for you, huh?

1193
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:23,560
As the guiding hand wavered, not but remained steady.

1194
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:29,960
The currents, the signs, are exactly where those thought processes led.

1195
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:37,740
Yes, friend, the soul water we squeezed out of you while you were listening to this show was a lot of fun.

1196
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,900
We really enjoyed drinking the soul water squeezed from your consciousness

1197
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:45,980
while you're trying vainly to calm...

1198
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:46,760
...our show.

1199
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:52,400
Listen to that lovely theme music.

1200
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:59,500
Friends, I'm gonna read the P.O. box, the sacred P.O. box of the Church of the Subgenius,

1201
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,540
where you can write for information.

1202
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:11,600
And if you send the rectangular, worthless thing, just the smallest one you can find in your back pocket,

1203
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,420
you'll get the real truth.

1204
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,760
And that's Bob.

1205
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:23,760
Bob at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1206
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,560
There's Dr. Onan.

1207
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:28,340
He called up earlier, and here he is singing in the background.

1208
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:39,480
That's P.O. Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1209
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,660
Just write Bob and ask for information.

1210
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:43,620
Um...

1211
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:46,640
Praise Bob.

1212
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:53,400
I think I hear the final closing music, the music that Norm is always so anxious to hear.

1213
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:58,440
He stands outside the door waiting for an hour for this music to come out.

1214
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,000
Oh, it's...

1215
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:05,160
So it's the Gene Scott hour coming up, friends.

1216
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:12,200
I know that the Church of the Subgenius isn't as popular as Gene Scott anymore.

1217
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:13,620
Yes.

1218
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:15,820
But...

1219
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,480
Someday, someday we'll have our own channel on 24 hours a day.

1220
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,300
Yeah, baby.

1221
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,020
Off the satellite.

1222
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:22,780
Thanks.

1223
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,920
Thank you, dear friends.

1224
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:27,120
And here's Pastor Bucknaked signing off.

1225
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:27,600
Where'd you go?

1226
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,460
Thank you, Budweiser.

1227
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,320
Watching Bob on TV.

1228
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,560
Oh, the swallowing red man.

1229
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:43,120
The day my coon dog died.

1230
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:43,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1231
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,980
Reading the pamphlet.

1232
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,080
Oh, bird, oh, bird, yeah.

1233
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:57,740
I was drinking Budweiser.

1234
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,400
And Bob was on TV.

1235
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,620
Oh, baby.

1236
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,040
Good kick by a mule.

1237
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,640
I was with Cousin June.

1238
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:16,220
I was with Cousin Junior.

1239
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:20,380
The DNA backfired.

1240
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,680
I was drunk.

1241
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,160
I was lonely.

1242
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,220
I was plastered.

1243
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:34,720
I was drinking Budweiser.

1244
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,480
And Bob was on TV.

1245
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,320
Drinking Budweiser.

1246
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,020
Watching Bob on TV.

1247
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,420
Swallowing red man.

1248
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,720
The day my coon dog died.

1249
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,700
Reading the pamphlet.

1250
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,740
Oh, bird, oh, bird, again.

1251
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:12,140
I was drinking Budweiser.

1252
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:15,900
And Bob was on TV.

1253
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:21,360
I was drinking Budweiser.

1254
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,020
And Bob was on TV.

1255
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:31,780
and Bob was on TV.

1256
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:32,040
Here we go.

1257
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:34,280
You like th-

1258
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:34,600
.

1259
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,500

1261
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:42,120


1262
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,160
言

1263
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:41,880
ag

1264
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:10,660
All right.

1265
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:11,600
Oh, shut up.

1266
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:15,200
Hi, boys and girls.

1267
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:19,940
Welcome back once again to the talk show that everybody's talking about in Glendale, California.

1268
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:21,540
That's right.

1269
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:23,760
It's time for Monday Morning with Norm Ward.

1270
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,780
I was just wondering if we can call Dr. Gene Robert.

1271
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,880
I just wanted to get your official okay on this.

1272
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:38,080
Well, no, we have the special, the special 9-800 number that somebody will answer and really talk to this.

1273
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,020
My 10 bucks a month, okay?

1274
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:42,080
All right.

1275
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:42,740
It's okay.

1276
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,900
We're going to have Phil Graham in here.

1277
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:12,160
We'll be right back.

1278
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:51,020
Uh, whoa, listen to those crackling volume pots here, friend.

1279
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:58,120
That was The Wall Men, a cheerful song called The News by The Wall Men.

1280
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:04,060
And what you're listening to now is P-Dog Strut by Doctors for Bob, whipping along in the background.

1281
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:14,200
Now, friend, just between you and me, I personally do not believe that J.R. Bob Dobbs is dead.

1282
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:28,980
Now, honestly, for years, for the last two years, I subscribed to the commonly held theory, the official theory of the church, that Bob Dobbs had been killed.

1283
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:33,860
I now, and I can't explain why, I no longer believe that.

1284
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:47,080
I just know, for some reason in my heart, that Bob is not dead, and that he's probably listening, you know, if not to this show, to your show, friend.

1285
01:06:47,160 --> 01:07:03,540
So, in the meantime, the anti-Dallas, the anti-Dallas, friend, from which Oboe, the anti-Bob, gets his power, its power is wavering.

1286
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:20,620
The power of the anti-Dallas is wavering, but at the same time, if it comes in contact with the true Dallas, which is okay, there may be a conjunction, friends, a conjunction of the anti-Dallas and the real Dallas.

1287
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,100
Now, Oboe wants this. Bob does not want this.

1288
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:33,520
Dr. Stu here from More Drunk Cowboys actually has done...

1289
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:37,880
He's done the research that led to this theory here. He's here in the station with us. Dr. Stu?

1290
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:38,820
Yeah.

1291
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:41,540
Can you add anything to what I'm saying?

1292
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:51,240
As I, as you were telling me, all of the police will turn evil if there is a conjunction with the anti-Dallas, even the Krishna policemen.

1293
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,680
Yes, even the Krishna policemen will turn evil.

1294
01:07:55,160 --> 01:08:03,260
In fact, see, the anti-Dallas is composed mainly of slack bands.

1295
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:08,480
We know of slack vampires. We know of slack vampires. They depend on us for their survival.

1296
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:16,960
In effect, actually, this ties in very clearly with the Omicron-Epsilon theory of time.

1297
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:23,020
Yes, the time intersection, when the backwards universe intersects with our universe.

1298
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:32,360
See, in effect, since the anti-Dallas is a closed, is in fact a closed universe into and of itself,

1299
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:32,940
Dr. Stu?

1300
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:32,940


1301
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:33,520
Dr. Stu?

1302
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:33,520


1303
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:33,520


1304
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:33,520


1305
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:33,520


1306
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:33,520


1307
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:33,520


1308
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:33,520


1309
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:33,520


1310
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:33,520


1311
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:33,520


1312
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:33,520


1313
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:37,300
This happens to be a cheap satanic replica of our true Dallas.

1314
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:48,160
They do tend to intersect sort of like a partial eclipse of the true Dallas and the anti-Dallas.

1315
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:54,320
Also, the anti-Dallas has no time control whatsoever.

1316
01:08:55,580 --> 01:09:01,120
In effect, they're trying to keep themselves together backwards, forwards, time.

1317
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,280
They don't mean nothing.

1318
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:03,420
There's nothing but time.

1319
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:03,520
There's nothing but time.

1320
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:03,520


1321
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:03,520


1322
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,640
vortex is there.

1323
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:07,480
It's kind of like random static on your

1324
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:08,720
television set, you see.

1325
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:11,260
But do we have time control?

1326
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,780
Do we ourselves have

1327
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:14,480
time control?

1328
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:16,860
We don't have control,

1329
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,240
but at least Wotan keeps

1330
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,520
all the

1331
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:23,360
Bobions

1332
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:25,660
going in the same direction at the same time.

1333
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:26,100
And the

1334
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:28,260
anti-Dallas

1335
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:30,840
actions do not have consequences.

1336
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,760
Consequences do not have

1337
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,820
actions. It's much

1338
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:36,340
closer to Negiistic

1339
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,640
universe than ours.

1340
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:39,980
Good lord!

1341
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,940
I had no idea.

1342
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:44,840
Indeed, and Negi is so much

1343
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,460
closer to them than he is to us.

1344
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:49,060
This is a chilling, chilling thought, friends.

1345
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:51,020
Indeed. It's getting colder

1346
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,680
and colder in the station.

1347
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,980
I've heard our

1348
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,180
powers dropping.

1349
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:57,740
Yes, as I understand.

1350
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,860
I heard those raps again, those

1351
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,080
mysterious sounds.

1352
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,140
Oh, God.

1353
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:06,180
Rapping in the walls of pops and bangs.

1354
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,060
Can you hear them, friends, out there?

1355
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,660
So, anyway, as I understand it,

1356
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,640
the anti-Dallas is somehow

1357
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,460
cut off from our reality.

1358
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,660
All alone in its own hollow,

1359
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,420
curved interior universe.

1360
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,300
There is no anti-Chicago,

1361
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,260
no anti-Miami.

1362
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:24,260
No anti-Phil.

1363
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,840
And the only way they can get out is through

1364
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,020
Dallas.

1365
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,080
There it goes again.

1366
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,060
Not even an anti-Ivan Stang.

1367
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:32,280
No.

1368
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,600
No anti-Philo Drummond.

1369
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:35,460
There is...

1370
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:38,020
Nothing but Oboe

1371
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,160
and nothing but Bob.

1372
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,400
Oboe, the anti-Bob.

1373
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,780
And as long as Bob's in heaven,

1374
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,380
Oboe will get sicker and sicker

1375
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:47,600
and weaker and weaker.

1376
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:50,600
That is why Bob is staying in heaven

1377
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,240
or hell or Asgard

1378
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,160
as he is.

1379
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:56,100
He is, in effect, not

1380
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,100
unable to come back,

1381
01:10:58,180 --> 01:10:59,860
but merely choosing not to

1382
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:02,040
while Oboe gets sicker and

1383
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,200
is dying out.

1384
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:05,040
Here, have some of this puffer fish.

1385
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,740
Let's blow off that church.

1386
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,380
Oh, I'll get that.

1387
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,080
Ah.

1388
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:13,120
Ah.

1389
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:13,560
Come on.

1390
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,900
Are you abnormal?

1391
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,580
Then you are probably better than most people.

1392
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,920
Yes, your mind shall triumph

1393
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:25,400
through Bob and the Slack.

1394
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:31,520
Slack is the free comm-box that comes with the Philo-Bone.

1395
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,400
Bob.

1396
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,040
He's the ultimate good guy.

1397
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:37,600
The terrorist for peace.

1398
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:41,660
Bob is the rule of this universe

1399
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:44,560
and thus the only place of all knowledge.

1400
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,140
Bob is the phoenix rising from the ashes of the...
