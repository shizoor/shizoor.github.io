1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,060
Now, would you get your nose out of my amoeba?

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:09,620
Before we begin today's lessons, I think there's one thing we should straighten out in regard to our relations with each other.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,260
Uh-oh.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:10,560
Oh!

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:16,700
Some of you seem to think there's something shameful about a little boy and a little girl liking one another.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:17,600
Mm-hmm.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,600
Now, let's think about it for a minute.

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,860
I want the reason.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,620
All of us are rather like one big family.

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:25,980
Oh, that's not good enough.

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,460
And I think our family could be a lot happier...

12
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,380
None of your business.

13
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,940
...if we were kind, considerate, and friendly toward one another.

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,180
I am not.

15
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,460
Well, you don't have to be.

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,520
I wanted to hit somebody.

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,180
But I do think you should have mutual respect and learn to get along together.

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,820
You're a smelly old ape.

19
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,560
You really told him.

20
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,600
You know, if you do that...

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,180
For two days.

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,800
You'll be taking a big step toward...

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,320
The Self-Genius.

24
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,160
Power of...

25
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,760
Science.

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,380
The kind of men and women we want.

27
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,480
Yeah, because you're dirty.

28
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,740
All right, fellas, let's get going.

29
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:09,740
The following is copyright 1981 by the Subgenius Foundation.

30
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,620
Should you have comments, criticisms, or suggestions regarding the cassette book program,

31
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,320
please forward them directly to...

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,220
The Technical Staff.

33

Division for the Blind and Physically Handicapped.

00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,520
Library of Congress.

35
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,860
Washington, D.C.

36
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,300
205-42.

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,080
Over 21 years...

38
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,960
This concludes the instruction.

39
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,040
Perhaps this is as good a time as any to take a few minutes to repeat a message

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,380
that seems frequently lost in the hustle and bustle of our daily activity.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,440
This won't make too much sense, but it's not intended to.

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,940
It's intended to strengthen the lips.

43
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,240
Bring your lips far forward now.

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:54,820
Now with woo.

45
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,360
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.

46
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,520
For variation, emphasize every third or fourth woo.

47
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,120
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.

48
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,520
And I have so much I would like to say, but I don't know how to say it.

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,520
So please bear with me if sometimes this doesn't make much sense.

50
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,920
It's realistic.

51
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,920
The second question is what?

52
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,520
What's happening?

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,280
Is this a miracle?

54
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,060
What kind of a miracle?

55
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,940
Is this a parable?

56
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,980
What's the point?

57
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,920
Is this a letter?

58
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,260
What's the big idea?

59
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,860
What's he trying to communicate?

60
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,260
Because people like you are helping us stay on the radio.

61
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,420
You can't buy a miracle.

62
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,120
But you can certainly stand behind a miracle ministry.

63
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,180
Like a bunch of...

64
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,420
Oh, I like to go to the lake.

65
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,020
I like to go to the stage and walk around.

66
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,940
You're going to be introduced.

67
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,020
And people will have a number in their hand and in their forehead.

68
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,960
Someone with a lot of energy.

69
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,060
They'll be given a...

70
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,120
Okay, your code number once more.

71
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:04,820
237.

72
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,080
237, you're calling from Dallas.

73
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,580
Okay, thank you.

74
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,320
And I'm going to continue to do business in this world.

75
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,460
And without it, you can starve.

76
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,280
I guess my code number is two.

77
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,520
You can let it out.

78
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,600
Amen.

79
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,340
We're living in terrible perilous.

80
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,240
Amen.

81
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,340
Amen.

82
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:24,340


83
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:24,340


84
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,280
Chaotic times.

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,780
Praise the Lord.

86
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,840
And these times are not going to get any better, my friend.

87
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,160
Amen.

88
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,600
They're going to get worse and worse.

89
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:45,020
Opium is still the primary plan that the United States has for dealing with its people in the event of a nuclear attack.

90
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,320
There has been six cases of breast cancer, one bladder cancer, and one throat cancer.

91
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:00,560
There is a God who is a God of love, and there is a God who is a God of judgment.

92
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,920
Two sides.

93
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,300
Mockery of everything that's decent and wholesome.

94
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,960
And I challenge you to point out national talk shows that do not belittle sexual fidelity, purity.

95
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,240
That they do not belittle the marriage union and the family lifestyle.

96
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,200
That they don't literally flaunt illicit lifestyles.

97
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,340
I mean, I challenge you to show me a picture.

98
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,000
Talk show that doesn't make light of God.

99
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:32,780
The Subgenius Foundation, the Reverend Ivan Stang and Dr. Philo Drummond.

100
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,620
And they are, as we mentioned before, the dual heads of the Subgenius Foundation.

101
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,400
You don't know about the schoolbook suppositories.

102
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,940
Watch out for all the leads.

103
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,160
Because I'm number 6,742 witnesses.

104
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,860
And they're coming after me.

105
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,380
So go there, come in.

106
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,600
Hello there, follow through.

107
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,780
We're picking up all your transmission.

108
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,960
With us, the leader and the idea are one.

109
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,840
And every party leader must do what the leader orders.

110
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,480
Subgenius culture, subgenius legend.

111
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,920
Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, I must admit, I know very little of this time.

112
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,440
It doesn't make fun of godly laws.

113
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,980
They laugh at us.

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,520
They make a mockery of us.

115
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,800
Now, we don't have to watch it.

116
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,520
We can turn it off.

117
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,260
Who will pay to clean up the contaminated land?

118
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,500
And because of the equal time provision in the law, we can't show you the taped interviews.

119
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,120
787-1270 is the number.

120
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,680
Call us and talk about what you'd wish.

121
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,060
Go ahead.

122
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:51,740
I'm going to point out that a lot of people worry about the one world government that the conspiracy is trying to get across on us.

123
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,340
And we suspect that the only...

124
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,540
The only thing that can fight a one world government is going to be a one world religion.

125
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,580
And of course, that's what the subgenius...

126
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,360
The church of the subgenius is here for.

127
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:09,540
I'm telling you, all other gods besides Jehovah and his son Jesus Christ are strange gods.

128
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,320
Question number two.

129
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:24,200
Do you believe in the virgin birth of Jesus Christ and the death and burial and resurrection of him?

130
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:24,720
Answer damaged door now starts ringing in the radio

131
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:24,720


132
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,600
Sir, we absolutely believe in everything

133
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:26,840
Sir, we absolutely believe in everything.

134
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,200
Sir, we absolutely believe in everything.

135
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,020
We believe in it.

136
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,360
Wholeheartedly.

137
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,340
We believe in it wholeheartedly.

138
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:43,560
They remain at the final 자주

139
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,860
Oh, Bob's my friend

140
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,440
and he's taking me somewhere

141
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,520
This book isn't an Elton John table.

142
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,500
No.

143
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:59,180
The voice analyzer was designed by our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

144
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,280
We have to make clear from the beginning that we are not really the founders.

145
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,420
We were just hired to promote the word of Bob.

146
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,220
Okay, that then brings me to this.

147
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:14,900
It is that the Subgenius Foundation is the publishing and PR firm of the Church of the Subgenius.

148
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,660
So would you tell me then what is the Church of the Subgenius?

149
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,620
It was founded by Bob.

150
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,080
Bob founded the church mainly to help unmask the conspiracy.

151
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,800
And we're talking about the conspiracy, the one behind the other conspiracy.

152
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,180
Oh, that's the one.

153
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,260
To unmask the conspiracy and to get us all a little bit of slack.

154
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,300
Slack through any means we can make do with.

155
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,960
Time control is one of the most spectacular and hard to achieve ones.

156
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,920
We're going to go into some depth before the evening is over.

157
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:53,860
We're defining and, as I say deeply, the terms, slack and what was the other, time control.

158
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,480
Time control, right, absolutely.

159
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,560
Those are things that I, of course, think we need to deal with.

160
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,360
Subgenius

161
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:01,980
Subgenius

162
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,640
Subgenius

163
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,300
Subgenius

164
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,840
Subgenius

165
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,640
Now we must vote to know

166
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,340
Grandfather, all the whites aren't crazy

167
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,560
I'm glad to hear that, my son

168
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,560
I thought they were

169
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,800
Oh, no

170
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,400
I know of one

171
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,180
Who is as brave as any human being

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,840
I'd like to meet this man and smoke with him

173
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,780
Bob started the church about, oh, 20 or 30 years ago

174
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,820
And we've got a picture of him here

175
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,740
We'll hold it up so everybody on the radio can see him

176
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,520
Hold it up to the left part of the radio there, yes

177
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,920
Can you see that?

178
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,820
You can see that he's a really handsome guy

179
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,500
He looks a lot like George Noll

180
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,760
Has a pipe

181
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,520
Very handsome

182
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
And smiling

183
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,320
He's got a

184
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,880
What some people call a sinister grin

185
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,840
Jack Armstrong, all-American boy

186
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,160
He looks like a man

187
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,300
He lives

188
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,500
I can't say

189
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,980
But it's just

190
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,400
A sin

191
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,120
And you just can't call it anything else

192
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,740
Many of you in this stadium have been deceived

193
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,000
Perhaps you've been deceived by

194
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,580
Evangelists masquerading as angels of light

195
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,800
Hanuman Lakova, the ninth seed

196
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,660
Hanuman Lakova, the ninth seed

197
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,860
The only cult they want to talk about is the subgenius foundation

198
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,760
The church of the subgenius

199
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,820
And the only reason they talk about it is for the money

200
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,700
We're going to go to the phones right now

201
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:58,080
Good evening, you're on KFJZ with Mr. Opinion and Dr. Philo Drummond

202
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,460
And the Reverend Arnold Stang, Ivan Stang

203
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,500
I have a question for Mr. Drummond

204
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:03,400
Yes

205
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,040
Go ahead

206
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,520
Are you Mr. Drummond?

207
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,200
That's right

208
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,340
I'm calling from Dallas

209
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,280
What's your question?

210
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,640
Well, um, do you know how ...

211
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:12,640


212
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,660
Do you work on spiritual problems or do you just work on wallets?

213
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,340
We will help you out spiritually.

214
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,740
Of course, it helps if we can have some financial assistance.

215
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,820
We sell $10 memberships.

216
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,600
And once you start getting our newsletter,

217
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,940
you start receiving lessons on how to conduct your life

218
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,260
in the most beneficial way for both you and us.

219
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,020
And regardless of what you're looking for...

220
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,160
Doug Smith says we're different.

221
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,880
Doug's right, Virgil.

222
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,880
We are different, thanks to Jesus,

223
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,360
the genetic engineering corporation of American states.

224
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,400
Mommy, too?

225
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,920
Yep, the whole family.

226
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,820
Is everybody like us?

227
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,120
No, son, but we're working on it.

228
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,300
Round the clock.

229
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,940
Soon everyone will be a superior biospecies.

230
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,200
Wowee.

231
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,260
I want to be a genetic engineer just like you, Pop.

232
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,480
You will, Virg, if you don't baggy.

233
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,480
It can lead to photon confusion.

234
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,100
Don't baggy.

235
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,860
For a healthier, happier biosuperior.

236
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,960
Hi.

237
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:24,840
You say you're looking for excitement, adventure, business opportunities,

238
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,000
and a real nice place to raise the kids?

239
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,060
Well, explore no more.

240
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,860
We're there already.

241
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,380
Let's visit the world of the future.

242
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,680
World of the future.

243
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,920
Yes, this bustling world of a thousand moods

244
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,080
reflects the dreams of its ambitious inhabitants,

245
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,280
dreams already realized of man's triumph over nature.

246
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,760
Where humans no longer suffer self-inflicted pains.

247
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,700
Where one is made to enjoy life.

248
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,700
Hallelujah.

249
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,400
All the signs point to serious health damage.

250
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,740
There are no winners in a nuclear war.

251
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,120
The minute you have another war, there's not going to be any world left, I don't think.

252
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,180
Because we're going to blow one another to pieces.

253
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,400
Because in this day and time, we don't know what we're going to come to.

254
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,820
There's not going to be anything left for the kids.

255
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,360
I mean, there's not going to be a world left.

256
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,580
And we're all going to end up digging our own holes.

257
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,940
As soon as we dig them, they're going to fall in on us.

258
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,820
I don't think anybody would know what to do.

259
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,760
Even possibly the president.

260
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,020
The only true religion is guns.

261
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:41,720
The guns.

262
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:41,720


263
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:41,720


264
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,160
Guns create your own reality.

265
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,080
If I had a gun, I'd create my own reality.

266
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,340
Crude to the loom.

267
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:46,700
Simple.

268
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,300
You have a gun, you point it at their head, and you're in control.

269
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,160
I would listen to television and watch it.

270
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,100
I'd listen to the radio.

271
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,200
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

272
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,360
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

273
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,380
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

274
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:31,140
Those are the Pink Boys from right here in Dallas.

275
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,080
And put your hand on the radio.

276
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,000
Before that, the B-52s in private Idaho.

277
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,980
And of course, Devo.

278
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,280
And one of the earlier, more primitive versions of Mongoloid.

279
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,700
This is the Pink Boys.

280
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:41,700


281
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,640
This is the Rock and Roll Alternative.

282
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,320
My name is George.

283
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,040
And tonight, on the subject of the Pink Boys and all that, we have in the studio with us

284
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,360
Ivan Stang and Philo Drummond from the Church of the Subgenius.

285
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,440
Hi, guys.

286
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,180
How you doing, George?

287
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,400
Oh, just fine.

288
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,940
Say, a lot of people have been wondering, just what is the Church of the Subgenius?

289
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:08,340
Well, George, if we could describe the Church of the Subgenius in one sentence, we'd be rich by now.

290
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,680
As it is, we're explaining it in long-winded terms.

291
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,560
We're explaining it in short sentences, and we're getting rich kind of half-fast.

292
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,480
It's kind of a scam, religious cult company, whatever you want to get into.

293
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,480
It's the first industrial church.

294
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:21,940
That's right.

295
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,180
We're hoping to make a lot of money real fast.

296
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:33,780
And if we can wake up ten more people out there in the listening audience tonight, we will have achieved our goal for the evening.

297
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,200
What is the church's priorities?

298
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,340
What's important to you guys?

299
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,160
Mainly the quest for slack.

300
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,080
The casting out of false prophets.

301
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,040
And controlling time.

302
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,280
Those are our three main goals, I guess.

303
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:46,980
Slack.

304
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,720
Slack is something we all need.

305
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:55,380
And I know that lots of people out there listening right now are feeling a terrible shortage of slack.

306
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,680
Slack is something you can't get enough of.

307
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,140
That's right.

308
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:58,720
That's right.

309
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,600
And we can help them to get slack, George.

310
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:07,020
Man, the world is filled with a bunch of kooky ideas and concepts about the Bible.

311
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,140
And I can't believe it.

312
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:14,380
I can't believe the weird things that people get in their heads and start teaching.

313
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:26,820
Why do you think that these people, aside from that rather vague reference in the Bible, why do you think these fallen angels have stayed around to do us in, so to speak?

314
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:35,420
Well, they figure that this planet is theirs to loot and that the people of Earth, we Earth people, are their slaves.

315
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,120
And I think the past history of all the records of the wars and the wars of the world, they're all the same.

316
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,120


317
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
I mean, we've got the Bible in the Bible, and we've got the Old Testament, and we've got the Holy Bible, and we've got the New Testament, and we've got the Old Testament.

318
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,120


319
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,120


320
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,980
by our families and things that were created deliberately by them, I think bears it out.

321
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:51,460
Now, not only that, Joe, besides the Bible, there's also other ancient works.

322
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,660
That's what I like about the Word of God.

323
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,660
There's nothing fake-y about this thing, man.

324
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,800
You talk about telling it like it is.

325
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:03,360
See, it hangs the dirty wash right out the front bay window for everybody to see.

326
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,440
And, ladies and gentlemen, this is the transmission that we've picked up.

327
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,100
You probably noticed it was a lot bigger than what we were talking about last time.

328
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,260
obviously from space beings.

329
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,320
That's right.

330
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,380
And we want, when 1998 comes,

331
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,120
we want subgeniuses to be in positions of power

332
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,660
so that this alien technology is not abused.

333
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,540
And Bob tells us what we need to know

334
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,720
to get into that position.

335
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,560
One year ago, we were obscure nobodies,

336
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,980
and now we're secretly famous.

337
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,760
That's right.

338
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,640
And we've got hundreds of dollars at our disposal.

339
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,800
And close to thousands upon dozens of members.

340
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,800
That's exactly right.

341
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,220
We are international now.

342
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,800
Every state in the Union is represented

343
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,080
on our mailing list in 12 foreign countries.

344
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,680
That is strictly incredible.

345
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,360
And what are the various ranks in the Church?

346
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,060
Well, of course, Bob is our high-E poppin' guru.

347
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,920
He's the saint of sales.

348
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,700
That's right.

349
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,180
Ultimate businessman.

350
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,240
Very few people are able to meet Bob.

351
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,400
He is pretty hard to get hold of.

352
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,420
He's like most cult leaders.

353
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,280
Dr. Drummond here is the...

354
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,420
He communicates with me via telepathic transmissions

355
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,280
beamed into my skull.

356
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,420
And so what we get from him is usually secondhand information.

357
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,400
He in turn is like a shortwave radio picking up signals

358
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,220
from famous dead holy men, living holy men,

359
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,880
creatures from outer space, advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures

360
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,500
from within the hollow earth.

361
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,320
Waiting for the UFO.

362
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,400
Waiting for the UFO.

363
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:37,400


364
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,680
Waiting for the UFO.

365
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,160
When they use the latest components, I feel like a new machine.

366
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,640
Go now. Quickly.

367
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,800
The survival of our galaxy is in your hands.

368
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,300
Thanks, and I'll try to live up to that.

369
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,720
Jeez.

370
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,840
Well, the Church is going pretty good.

371
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,860
How has your life changed since dogs came into your life?

372
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,820
Crowds?

373
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:17,400
I realized that the exes are a reality and that my life is geared towards their arrival.

374
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:23,060
I redefined my own space and was able to center my being.

375
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:33,560
I was really able to integrate all my anti-societal.

376
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,660
I'm gonna kill everybody here!

377
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:43,140
When I first heard Bob on the radio, he said that he could heal and told me to put my hand

378
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,400
on the radio so that the Bob energy could come out through the airwaves.

379
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,620
Death to the fascist earthworms!

380
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,700
Many of you in this stadium have been deceived.

381
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,520
Well, let me ask you, sir, are you having some type of problem in your life now?

382
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,640
If I have a dreadful spirit, I'm gonna go to hell.

383
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:05,640


384
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,840
I'm having a spiritual problem right now.

385
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,340
Okay, give us some idea of the nature of the problem.

386
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,760
Well, I'm afraid of God.

387
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,720
Oh, you are?

388
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,300
Yeah.

389
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,740
Well, there's a lot of people out there just like you.

390
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,740
I tell you what, if you would, put your hands on the radio right now.

391
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,060
I think we're being sold a bill, a big bill of goods.

392
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,140
Uh, really now, are you guys in this, uh, cult business just for the bucks or do you have

393
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,400
...

394
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,920
Mr. Wilsey, isn't it a fact, really, that you've invented this whole thing, that you've

395
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,780
thought up all these little gimmicks and you're taking advantage of a lot of ignorant people

396
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,600
by getting money out of them, people who, uh, believe in you and your silly preachings?

397
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,100
No, it isn't, Joe.

398
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,840
I don't have ...

399
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,780
Uh, the Illuminati will be unmasked and the subgenius cult will have a lot to do with

400
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:04,980
that.

401
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:10,760
Bob is gonna, gonna see that the whole conspiracy, the Illuminati, the trilaterals, the, you

402
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,280
name it, the guys that drive up and down the streets selling ice cream, that all, all of

403
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,480
that will be exposed.

404
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,380
That's what America needs.

405
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,000
They have their brains washed.

406
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,360
Clean out all that filth and all that garbage and all that fear and all that sickness and

407
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,260
perversion and all that junk that comes from the pit of hell and the ...

408
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,440
I'm completely ...

409
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:31,980
Multi-reverend.

410
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,880
I'm about as ... I can perform marriages.

411
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,960
I can legally perform marriages.

412
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,000
And I can also ordain people.

413
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,700
And that's what we've been doing.

414
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,060
When you, uh, become a $10 member, we send you a little card that says you're a minister.

415
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,180
That loosely explains that.

416
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,620
Then, uh, Dr. Drummond, could you explain your, uh, your, uh, doctorate?

417
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:54,560
I'm not really a, uh, a medical doctor, but more a, a PhD-type doctor.

418
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,000
I obtained my PhD at Dobbstown Community College.

419
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,380
Yeah.

420
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,560
And, uh, my PhD was in journalism.

421
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,520
We sell doctorates, too.

422
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,820
Um, sell $6.00 ...

423
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:04,920
What's that?

424
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:04,940
What's that?

425
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,320
What's a good doctorate going for now?

426
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:06,860
Six, six bucks?

427
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,500
Yeah, six bucks.

428
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,060
That's a ... we sell about the cheapest doctorates on the market.

429
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,400
Most of them are $20 to $30.

430
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,600
But, uh, the, uh, diploma gilt-edged or plain?

431
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,260
Um, it's plain, but it's got more content on it than you can imagine.

432
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:17,620
Not a thrill.

433
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,300
Okay, that's good.

434
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:18,480
Yeah.

435
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,420
It takes about three hours to read, and it tells you in great detail what sort of a

436
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,340
subgenius you are.

437
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:23,640
It's ...

438
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,720
Praise doctors for Bob!

439
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,520
Here's a Doctorsners for Bob album.

440
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,460
What is subgenius?

441
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,140
It's Doctorsners for Bob!

442
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,920
Here's a Doctorsners for Bob album.

443
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:34,920


444
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:34,920


445
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
What's the first?

446
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,560
You think you can know the subgenius without knowing Doctorsners for Bob?

447
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,740
Well, you're wrong!

448
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,100
What is Doctorsners for Bob?

449
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,060
Doctorsners for Bob!

450
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,300
What is Doctorsners for Bob?

451
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,380
Doctorsners for Bob!

452
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,220
Only we know what we don't know, and when we do know it, we shall find out later just

453
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,640
exactly what it was that we didn't know.

454
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,760
But!

455
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,520
In the meantime, we shall experiment further and delve into the deeper recesses of the

456
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:16,000
human mind to find out exactly what causes this device not to function properly.

457
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:22,400
Could it be a malfunction of the foot gland or the nose gland?

458
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:29,520
Yes, possibly you did not know that the nose and the feet are true glands of the human

459
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:29,960
body.

460
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,900
And only after permanent foot and nose contact can you know that the nose and the feet are

461
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,060
true glands.

462
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:40,540
And only after the nose gland escaping can you know how to make your feet smell and your

463
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:48,100
nose run, which would mean possibly that you were backwards or built upside down.

464
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,860
But we'll delve further into that at the end of the broadcast when you and I cannot hear

465
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,360
each other.

466
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,560
And we can get into this too.

467
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,880
This psychoneurotic masto-synesthesia.

468
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:04,880


469
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,040
What are we doing?

470
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,920
See, even in Da bore.

471
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,060
His outfit is backed up for the abuses, it's just got turned over now.

472
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:26,600
And you tell your sitten, do you remember this thing that you guys soem?

473
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,900
I don't recall seeing it that closely.

474
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,020
I remember I think I think you saw a video on this before it started.

475
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,200
What?

476
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,380
The voice about it.

477
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:53,260
at doctors and here hyper cleats here it is doctors for Bob doctors for Bob and

478
00:23:53,260 --> 00:24:07,220

ain't in the church

481
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:31,020
don't turn the radio off keep it on and I wouldn't infer that that our secondary

482
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:37,740
state that is that our Christ but I'm telling you that preparations are being made and that

483
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:44,900
the very of the very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand and that if you plan

484
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:52,800
to get saved you're better good now there will be a day not in the too far distant future in

485
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,240
which you will be saved and you will be saved and you will be saved and you will be saved and

486
00:24:53,240 --> 00:25:00,420
the Christ will be revealed and the mark of the beast will be introduced and people will have a

487
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:08,220
number in their hands and in their forehead number if you please

488
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:20,820
we have a lot to do in a very short time boy you are kidding

489
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,120
and that's the way I felt for quite a while

490
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,200
get ready to ease out of orbit

491
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:38,280
you bet honey that's what we're gonna try to do I have never flown a city before well

492
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,080
many of you in this stadium have been to see I think they'll they'll pass the ten

493
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:51,660
dollars bridge the original concept was that throughout history all great geniuses

494
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,980
are considered geniuses and you have not there this means there was

495
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:01,240
nothing we you know does no complete sense of the human spirit no one you

496
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,220
know I've got now go on that third remember when Christ used to answer our

497
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:02,360
prayers is later we have 10 further on to say never lets say they're they addressed

498
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:02,360


499
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:22,800
on family life as two normal objects for my idea was nothing but a Libra and I was to make a 71.2% protected R.B in a larger number than 20.0 million in natal bills an hour before I was measured only 40.46 educating them after 10 years afterbels one was a sub-genius in good court his proper messages but con jetastrhans inflated pride the right reason was being missed vir Hel senate & it was frightened off the basis of subgenius now was the sub genius for the straight

sleepless nights

509

513
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:54,220
that's what's bad from now on every new addition to our demand for energy will be met

514
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,960
from our own production and our own conservation

515
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,600
you have

516
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,100
people

517
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,560
people

518
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:13,960
have a white

519
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,920
person just taking over the world

520
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,360
that's weird

521
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:19,360


522
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,500
there's nothing to be afraid of we're not going to hurt you but once you

523
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,240
understand you'll be grateful let us go look we're laid down we

524
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,380
won't come back we can't let you go you're dangerous to us

525
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,380
don't fight it miles it's no use slowly understand that.

526
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,920
Sooner or later you'll have to go to sleep.

527
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,340
Subgeniuses strike out on their own, too.

528
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,680
There's rogue subgeniuses, in fact, that have gone.

529
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,300
They were originally subgeniuses that went off the deep end,

530
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:03,160
like Howard Hughes, Jack the Ripper, Adolf Hitler,

531
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,300
Richard Nixon, for sure, would be one.

532
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,180
And not just crazy people like that.

533
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,460
Muhammad Ali, yeah, renegades, Muhammad Ali.

534
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,940
He's a renegade subgenius, I guess you'd call him.

535
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,180
But these people don't know they're subgeniuses.

536
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:18,640
No, they don't know.

537
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,740
Well, they haven't, you know, they haven't declared it yet.

538
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,800
It wouldn't even help a lot of them.

539
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,520
They may know.

540
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,120
They may know, and for all we know, they're out there reading stuff.

541
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,260
The 5th Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius of Little Rock,

542
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,020
and before we begin this sacred spouting,

543
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,800
I think that we should all bow our heads

544
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,880
and let's all have a minute of noise.

545
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:38,700
Ah!

546
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,340
Ah!

547
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:41,400

548
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,440

549
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,300
Ah!

550
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:43,640


551
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:43,720


552
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,180
Ah!

553
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:44,480
Ah!

554
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:44,920
Ah!

555
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,200
Ah!

556
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,360
Ah!

557
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:45,560
Ah!

558
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:45,560


559
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:45,860
Ah!

560
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,180
Ah!

561
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:46,360
Ah!

562
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:46,360


563
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:46,540
Ah!

564
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:46,740
Ah!

565
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:46,740


566
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:46,860
Ah!

567
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,460
Ah!

568
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:49,460


569
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:49,460


570
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,340
Ah!

571
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:51,900
Ah!

572
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,340
Ah!

573
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:52,520
Ah!

574
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,300
Ah!

575
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:53,420
Ah!

576
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,560
First, we have a schisming member of the church here.

577
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,420

No!

580
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,540
Holy Master.

581
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,200
Do not listen to this man.

582
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,880

614
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:13,680
of the church.

615
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,320
Channel 7's still the one.

I'm over-repped.

You will not be.

620
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,200
I'm over-repped

621
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,740
Snavely and Eklund.

622
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,580
Snavely and Eklund.

623
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,280
And we were at

624
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,300
the Hall High School

625
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:25,880
Library today

626
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,160
and we put lots

627
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,920
of subgenius literature

628
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,900
in all of the books

629
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,660
all around.

630
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,440
We have Dobbs hit

631
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,160

00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,180

633
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,020
Miniature Dobbs hit

634
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,600
everywhere you go.

635
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,220
There's a miniature

636
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:36,860
Dobbs hit.

637
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,620
Begin by

638
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,160
settling back

639
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,180
comfortably.

640
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,180
Get as comfortable

641
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,200
as you can.

642
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,780
Well,

643
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,240
we're getting

644
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,180
comfortable now.

645
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:51,520
Hey,

646
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,120
I feel better already,

647
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:53,500
Paul.

648
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,720
You know that we're here

649
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,660
until the next afternoon

650
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,600
and the music's cool.

651
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,560
Oh, wow.

652
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,020
I can feel it coming on.

653
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,780
Must be a whole trip here.

654
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,440
It's like being on

655
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,180
acid ice.

656
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,180
Yeah.

657
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,700
Doing our inflated

658
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,100
work.

659
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,560
The post office.

660
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,940
We're going to park

661
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,840
here very carefully

662
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,440
and very quickly

663
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,160
so we can run

664
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,820
across the street

665
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,780
and plaster Bob's

666
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,320
little face

667
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,000
all over the billboard.

668
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,180
We're back here

669
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:24,640
at the studio

670
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,780
trying to clean up

671
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,820
the mess after the explosion.

672
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,500
But we did get Bob

673
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,880
all over two billboards

674
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,200
right by Tower Records

675
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:31,920
and we did take

676
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,160
an authenticating photograph

677
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,340
which if it comes out

678
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,080
I will send to you.

679
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,880
And you can see

680
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
Bob spread out

681
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,620
all over Berkeley.

682
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,280
And I was relating

683
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,860
to you on the tape

684
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,720
it may come up later

685
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,340
anyway that I'm

686
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,320
I've been putting Bob

687
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,260
all over California.

688
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,740
You can see those stars

689
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,560
so clearly

690
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,460
it's not at all

691
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,260
like on Earth.

692
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,400
Look at that

693
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,040
cloudy planet go by.

694
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,860
Gee, this is really

695
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,860
inspiring and I'm

696
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm glad to be talking

697
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,580
to you here

698
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,160
from Star Deck One.

699
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,620
My Lord.

700
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,480
Yes?

701
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:04,960
Yes, Elric.

702
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,480
A floating ship

703
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:06,860
is about to land.

704
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,080
It's about to crash

705
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,720
into us.

706
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,040
Oh, pay no attention

707
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,600
to it.

708
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,080
So, John!

709
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,520
Yes, my Lord.

710
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,780
These droids

711
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,820
get so upset

712
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,700
when the least

713
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,320
little thing

714
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,060
goes wrong.

715
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:18,580
But anyway,

716
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,300
it's a...

717
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:21,600
Wow.

718
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,200
That is pretty awesome.

719
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,680
Look, it's...

720
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,940
Oh, God damn it!

721
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,620
Shoot.

722
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,580
All systems

723
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,080
prepare for full power.

724
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,780
Okay.

725
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,880
Give me Mach 1,

726
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,680
2, 3.

727
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,600
Charlie Baker

728
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:36,860
says,

729
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,360
749.

730
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:37,900
Ooh!

731
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,820
I think we maintained

732
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,000
a hit there on starboard.

733
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:44,260
Ooh!

734
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,040
Put up full force phasers.

735
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,380
Call Bob!

736
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,400
Call Bob!

737
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,060
Very few needy.

738
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,360
I need you.

739
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,120
I need you.

740
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,020
Very few needy.

741
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,940
Let's lock in

742
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,620
these controls.

743
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,920
Move it out.

744
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,900
Okay, Bob.

745
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,060
Okay.

746
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,820
Let's go.

747
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,740
Okay.

748
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:06,860
Let's go.

749
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,100
Bob.

750
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,360
Bob flies us.

751
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,480
Bob flies standing up.

752
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,880
That's incredible.

753
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,520
I'm not worried

754
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,820
because I know

755
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,760
all the force field

756
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,140
wasn't on there.

757
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,000
Now it's on.

758
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,340
It's okay.

759
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,360
Come back, you fools!

760
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,140
You cowards!

761
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,220
Come back, I'm sorry!

762
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,060
Listen to him.

763
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,440
Come on, you'll be destroyed!

764
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,400
Let's go!

765
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,200
Well, Doug,

766
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,140
we found Bob.

767
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,100
Uh,

768
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,180
do you want to say

769
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,680
anything to Doug?

770
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,460
He's really appreciated.

771
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,140
I think he'll be

772
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,980
really, really great.

773
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,780
Hi there, Doug.

774
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,700
I'm Bob.

775
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,720
I'm better than you've

776
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,860
ever heard of.

777
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,280
Believe me, I am.

778
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,320
I'm a native.

779
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,580
Thank you.

780
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,700
I'm...

781
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,900
He isn't here.

782
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,820
Yes, he is.

783
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,100
Probably not for a few days.

784
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,600
No, right now.

785
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,100
Try Madison, Wisconsin.

786
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,360
No, try Dallas, Texas.

787
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:14,560
Victor Street.

788
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,940
Bob will kick their asses

789
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,700
and take their money

790
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,200
and drive them to drink

791
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,340
and steal their honeys.

792
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,460
Excuse me...

793
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,000
He says

794
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:55,040
he'll come at us

795
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,040


796
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,640
It wheel you out!

797
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:56,640


798
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:56,640


799
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,140
If Rick's gonna give

800
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:58,460
a stunning wages

801
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:58,460


802
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:58,460


803
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:58,460


804
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:58,480

805
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:58,480


806
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:58,480


807
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:58,480


808
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:58,960
a little

809
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:58,960


810
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:58,960


811
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,420
the

812
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,380

00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,200


814

Don

815
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:08,720
Doves x8

816
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:28,760
Duh-duhs, duh-duhs, duh-duhs, duh-duhs, duh-duhs, duh-duhs, duh-duhs, duh-duhs, duh-duhs.

817
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:37,980
Since he came through my life, I've quit selling wrenches.

818
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:48,980
And I've got a micro-encapsulated feeling about things now to you.

819
00:37:50,560 --> 00:38:07,380
I'm trying to tell you about dogs, dogs, dogs who know what's going on.

820
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,220
And this time you know.

821
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:17,760
Ah, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

822
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:34,880
I've got to get some slack in case you couldn't tell.

823
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,180
And that's what I'm doing.

824
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:38,280
I'm trying to tell you about dogs, dogs, dogs who know what's going on.

825
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:38,280


826
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:38,700
And this time you know.

827
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:47,980
I lack, you know, maybe this subgenius stuff that we've been getting involved in.

828
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,140
Maybe.

829
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,660
Listen, Bob.

830
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,560
Bob, are you in here?

831
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,100
No.

832
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,340
Bob.

833
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,240
Where's Bob?

834
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,160
Are you here, Bob?

835
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,080
No, I don't think Bob's here.

836
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,800
Where else, Bob?

837
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,880
I can't find Bob anywhere.

838
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,040
Can you hear me?

839
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,680
Oh, Bob.

840
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,520
Dr. Drummond, can you hear me?

841
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,260
Dr. Drummond's in a special room.

842
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,620
Oh, the great stinking Bob-o.

843
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,700
Oh, Bob.

844
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,480
Oh, Bob.

845
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,240
I need some money.

846
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:23,980
I need some slack.

847
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:24,640
Oh, Bob.

848
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,660
Bob, I need some money.

849
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,180
Give me food.

850
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,000
Give me some money, Bob.

851
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,000
Oh, Bob.

852
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,780
Oh, Bob.

853
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,280
Bob.

854
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,180
Bob.

855
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,640
Bob.

856
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,160
Bob.

857
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,160
Bob.

858
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,780
Bob.

859
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:50,840
Bob.

860
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:50,840


861
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:50,840


862
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:50,840


863
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:50,840


864
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,700
Bob's my friend.

865
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:53,660
Bob.

866
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,740
Thanks for being my friend, Bob.

867
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,060
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere.

868
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,500
Where are we going, Bob?

869
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,540
Bob.

870
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:06,780
Bob.

871
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,780
Is he waiting there for me?

872
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,600
Oh, he's not waiting anymore.

873
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,820
Did he go up and go home?

874
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,320
Bob went to vote.

875
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,840
He went to vote?

876
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,720
He'll be back shortly.

877
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,300
Oh, okay.

878
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,900
In the white form.

879
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,080
A donut.

880
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,680
Bob left you a donut, Bob.

881
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,100
That's what's waiting for you, is a donut.

882
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,520
Bob can stop the aliens from killing me.

883
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,620
Yeah.

884
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:36,940
I...

885
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:43,820
Bob can save me, but will he?

886
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,960
Well, no problem.

887
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,580
Don't count on it, Bob.

888
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,380
Well, I mean, yeah, any problem.

889
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,060
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

890
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,880
He can have some money or not.

891
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,280
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

892
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:50,800
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

893
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,620
Bob's $15.

894
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:52,360
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

895
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:52,880
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.

896
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,620
Well, okay.

897
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,460
He'll save you, Bob.

898
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,580
Don't worry.

899
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,420
What is waiting there for me?

900
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,220
Bye.

901
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,780
Oh, the Bobmobile.

902
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,660
Okay, the Bobmobile, the Bobmobile.

903
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,220
Let's all go riding in the Bobmobile.

904
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,060
You don't need gas in the Bobmobile.

905
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,760
Oh, the wonderful, wonderful Bobmobile.

906
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,020
You don't need no gas.

907
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,020
You don't need no...

908
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,720
You don't need no money when you're in the Bobmobile.

909
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,760
When you're in...

910
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:30,820
Hey.

911
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,360
Look, up over the car.

912
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,080
They're back again.

913
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,080


914
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,580
Oh, Bob.

915
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,620
Hey, Bob.

916
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,100
Hey, Bob.

917
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,300
Oh, Bob.

918
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,260
Hey, Bob.

919
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:45,800
Hey, Bob.

920
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,140
Bob, Bob.

921
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:47,940
Bob, Bob.

922
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,340
I'm ready.

923
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:53,620
Oh.

924
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,600
Oh, I'm starting to get slack in my feet.

925
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,920
Oh, they're shuffling out from underneath me.

926
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,940
Oh, Bob.

927
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,100
Oh, Bob.

928
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:10,800
Bob, Bob.

929
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,600
Bob, Bob.

930
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,300
Bob, Bob.

931
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:14,460
Bob, Bob.

932
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:14,800
Don't run.

933
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,220
Bob, don't run away.

934
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,920
Here's my dollar.

935
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:19,980
Come on back.

936
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,140
I want you to stay and stay.

937
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,460
Oh, Bob, Bob, Bob.

938
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,860
What's wrong?

939
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,880
What'd I do?

940
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,100
You mean you want two more dollars?

941
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,240
Two more dollars?

942
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,180
Okay, Bob, here's two more dollars.

943
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,100
Oh.

944
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,600
Wow.

945
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,440
Wow, I suddenly feel...

946
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,180
I feel great.

947
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,940
I feel like...

948
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,620
I can see through all the women's clothing.

949
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,140
I can.

950
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,540
Look out the window.

951
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,980
Them girls are all naked.

952
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,480
It's Bob.

953
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:02,880
Right?

954
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,280
We can sit here and talk about...

955
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:05,820
You know.

956
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,920
It's here.

957
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,380
He's...

958
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,360
It's Bob.

959
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,680
That's why you need to send us money.

960
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,060
Here at Subgenius Church.

961
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,120
It's Bob.

962
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,400
He can work miracles in your life.

963
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:19,980
He can bring...

964
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:20,460
And money.

965
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,100
Send us money.

966
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,100
He can bring you love.

967
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,540
He can...

968
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,080
And, of course, the molecular dispensation,

969
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:32,000
which comes from the spewing diodes

970
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,340
embalmed in our brain cells

971
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,060
through the Bob's cell.

972
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:36,060


973
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,320
Surgery and Dob's tan,

974
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,900
of which we've all gone through.

975
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,420
Kill Bob.

976
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:41,940
Braise the lard.

977
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,320
Kill me.

978
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,780
Braise the lard.

979
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,500
Shoot Bob.

980
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,100
I don't believe there is a Bob.

981
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:51,620
Sometimes we...

982
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,100
If there was, he wouldn't be so cool.

983
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,960
Dob is...

984
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,820
Dob's 80.

985
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,760
If there's not a Bob, then...

986
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,040
Then, why are you here?

987
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,100
I can explain life if there's no Bob.

988
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,140
Ha ha ha ha!

989
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,500
Can I ask you...

990
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,500
Pick a symbol, any symbol.

991
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,540
How about Bob?

992
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,640
I'm starting.

993
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,740
It's Bobby.

994
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,000
Bobby Dodds?

995
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,360
Bobby Dodds.

996
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,480
I remember Bobby Dob...

997
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,800
Bob's, Dob's.

998
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,820
Bobby Dob's when he was a boy.

999
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,040
Bobby Dobbs.

1000
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,540
Bobby Dobbs.

1001
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:24,600
Bobby Dobbs.

1002
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,020
Little Bobby Dobbs.

1003
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:27,960
Little Bobby Dobbs.

1004
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,100
Where did he grow up?

1005
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,120
Right here on the main street.

1006
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:32,940
Where's Bobby Dobbs?

1007
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,060
I knew Bobby Dobbs when he used to cut the grass off.

1008
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:36,060


1009
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:36,060


1010
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,520
in front of the drugstore, and he had a part-time job in Vietnam

1011
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,060
long before any of us even knew how to say the word.

1012
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:46,580
Oh, well, that's just the way Bobby Downs grew up.

1013
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,260
Of course, he grew up in a small town in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia.

1014
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,380
Nobody knows that, actually, but it was Stanton, Virginia,

1015
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,120
that Bobby Downs grew up in,

1016
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,500
where his father owned an antique store

1017
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,680
and sold half-burned uniforms and ancient rusty farm implements

1018
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,140
as tourist attractions.

1019
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,180
Hi, Daddy.

1020
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,320
Here's Bobby now.

1021
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,520
What's happening today?

1022
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,560
There's Bobby Downs.

1023
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,700
How'd he get so hit?

1024
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,760
We have these ancient holograms of Bobby Downs, the way he was,

1025
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,160
asking how the things are the way they is now.

1026
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,300
What did you do in the war, Daddy?

1027
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,160
Bobby Downs!

1028
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,140
There are no answers.

1029
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,700
So he thought for himself.

1030
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,160
Bobby Downs.

1031
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:49,880
Bobby Downs was looking for a drug, some kind of transformation.

1032
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,300
I think I understand.

1033
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:54,320
Yeah, sure.

1034
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,560
Well, no, maybe not.

1035
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,500
Bobby Downs figured it out for himself.

1036
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:01,400
Oh, his budget is sitting around.

1037
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,420
Yeah, that's it.

1038
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:03,540
Thinking.

1039
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,320
Bobby Downs.

1040
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:06,700
Yeah, sure.

1041
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,920
Bobby Downs.

1042
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,680
Bobby Downs.

1043
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,960
He's sitting around.

1044
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,280
I got it.

1045
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,800
Hey, I know.

1046
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,580
I got it.

1047
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:15,320
No.

1048
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,240
He got it.

1049
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,840
No, he didn't get it.

1050
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,680
He got it.

1051
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,660
No, he didn't get it.

1052
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:20,540
That's it.

1053
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,840
Bobby Downs is sitting around thinking.

1054
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,820
It's not that.

1055
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,680
It must be.

1056
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:32,380
As he got a little older, he decided his name was too long.

1057
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,200
He wanted to have some dignity.

1058
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,200
He knew his character and personality, so he named himself Bob.

1059
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,200
He said, he said, we understand.

1060
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,960
We know what's going on.

1061
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,840
And he convinced people.

1062
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:57,540
And then a voice came to Bobby Downs one day.

1063
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:58,700
Bobby.

1064
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,220
He said, you really think you know what's going on?

1065
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,000
Yeah.

1066
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:04,640
Hey, Art.

1067
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:04,900
Art.

1068
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,660
Oh, here you go.

1069
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:05,980
Oh.

1070
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:06,460
Oh.

1071
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:07,220
He said.

1072
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:08,540
Who is that?

1073
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,080
What?

1074
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:09,640
Hello?

1075
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:10,300
Oh.

1076
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:10,720
Oh.

1077
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:11,340
Oh.

1078
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:13,420
Bobby Downs.

1079
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:14,600
What do you know?

1080
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,100
Hey, it's dark in here.

1081
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,520
I don't see anything.

1082
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:20,800
I don't hear anything.

1083
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,000
Oh.

1084
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,020
Bobby Downs.

1085
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:24,980
But I think.

1086
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:25,740
Bobby Downs.

1087
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,000
I understand.

1088
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,040
Bobby Downs.

1089
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,120
Bobby Downs.

1090
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:29,980
He's getting his voice right now.

1091
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,140
I know what it's all about.

1092
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,620
This is where his voice sounded like.

1093
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,080
Bobby Downs.

1094
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,160
This is where it's getting light.

1095
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,700
Here it's happening now.

1096
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,480
It's the universe out there.

1097
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,300
That's what it is.

1098
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,000
Bobby Downs.

1099
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,000


1100
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,840
Bobby Downs.

1101
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:42,960
Bobby Downs.

1102
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,740
And here I am.

1103
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,900
Sitting in the middle of it.

1104
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,160
To you.

1105
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,140
To you.

1106
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:48,700
Yes.

1107
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,240
Yes, folks.

1108
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,720
He's really.

1109
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,240
Bobby Downs.

1110
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,180
Bobby Downs.

1111
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,640
To you.

1112
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,260
Bobby Downs.

1113
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,860
Bobby Downs.

1114
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:01,480
Now.

1115
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,380
Bobby Downs.

1116
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,120
Bobby Downs.

1117
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,360
Bobby Downs.

1118
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,980
Bobby Downs.

1119
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,080
Bobby Downs.

1120
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:20,220
Yes.

1121
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,940
Bobby Downs.

1122
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:30,360
Three.

1123
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:30,480


1124
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:30,700
Bobby Downs.

1125
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:30,700


1126
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:30,700


1127
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:30,700


1128
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,340
Bobby Downs.

1129
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,740
Bobby Downs.

1130
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,100
Bobby Downs.

1131
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:34,100


1132
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:34,100


1133
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:34,100


1134
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:34,100


1135
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:34,100


1136
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:34,100


1137
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:34,100


1138
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:34,100


1139
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:34,100


1140
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,820
Where were you during the war, Daddy?

1141
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,320
It's time to wake up, Bob.

1142
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,960
It's time to get up.

1143
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,980
Bobby Dobbs, this is your wake-up service.

1144
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:06,520
That's right.

1145
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,420
Bobby Dobbs.

1146
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,440
Are you asleep under there?

1147
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,260
Hey, your hair's on fire.

1148
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:11,640
Hey.

1149
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,420
Hey, police are coming.

1150
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,740
Better get up right now.

1151
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,200
The cops are coming, man.

1152
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,040
They're going to beat you up with brass knuckles and baseball bats.

1153
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,140
Hey, your hair's on fire.

1154
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,560
Friends, I want to talk to you today about something that I'm sure is close

1155
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,020
to everyone.

1156
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:32,860
It's hard to mind.

1157
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:40,820
You might not be living up to or be the man or lady, woman you should be.

1158
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,080
And that subject, you might have guessed it by now, but that subject is Bob.

1159
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,380
A man came to me.

1160
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,440
He said, my life is empty.

1161
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,200
I said, why?

1162
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:55,920
Why is it?

1163
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,520
It's not because my wife left me.

1164
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,440
No, it's not because my car broke down.

1165
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,140
It's not because I'm fixing to be evicted.

1166
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,180
It's not because I'm getting fired from my job.

1167
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:07,280
It's because I don't have Bob in my life.

1168
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,080
And I talked to that man.

1169
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,680
And I saved that man that night.

1170
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,220
I showed him the way of Bob.

1171
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:18,280
Oh, Mr. Bob Dobbs.

1172
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,100
Where are you in this dark hole?

1173
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,520
This dark hole of humanity.

1174
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,040
Oh, Bob.

1175
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:27,960
Oh, Bob.

1176
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,960
Somewhere back here in the attitude.

1177
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,300
The secrets of the...

1178
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:32,700
The universe.

1179
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:50,360
Somewhere in this slimy, slimy hole that we call the top of the subgenius conclave meeting hall.

1180
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,200
This is the pink boys.

1181
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,800
This is the battleground.

1182
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,180
Oh, Bob.

1183
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:12,020
Oh, who are you on your organ, Bob?

1184
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,500
And what a big organ you got.

1185
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,000
But friends, I get up in the morning and there's just like this electricity that just shoots through me.

1186
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,320
And I say, praise Bob.

1187
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,960
And you can feel it, man.

1188
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:23,560
You can feel that.

1189
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,180
Was that him running around over there?

1190
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,160
Did anyone want to see Bob?

1191
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,520
I just want to say, praise Bob.

1192
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,520
Don't you think he's the greatest sterno?

1193
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,460
Bob? Praise Bob.

1194
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,120
Sterno said praise Bob. I don't know if you hear. But everything comes

1195
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:44,020
from Bob and it's just so beautiful. I just want to

1196
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:48,280
turn everyone in the world on to Bob. And I'm not

1197
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,100
sure, ma'am. I don't know, ma'am. I seen the pretty pictures

1198
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:56,180
one time. But you think Bob might give me those

1199
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:59,060
pretty pictures if I vaporize Smith and Jones?

1200
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,800
I don't know, man.

1201
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,840
No, it's not here. Look at me. Do you live on a farm?

1202
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,180
Come here. Something wrong.

1203
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,060
Seem like I see you on a farm.

1204
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,860
Now, don't worry. I mean, I always, I feel my way through sometimes.

1205
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,200
When God starts, when it's the Holy Ghost, you don't have to worry about it. Just relax.

1206
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,300
I know I'll get tired after. I know I'll get tired.

1207
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,520
No, I know what I'm doing. Praise God. I may stumble around

1208
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,140
and feel around, but I'll come out all right.

1209
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,640
I'm a girl about the gift of the Spirit.

1210
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:07,100
But I see something about a farm, Woody.

1211
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,020
I'm on a farm.

1212
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:09,760
You was what?

1213
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,440
Praise God.

1214
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,620
Praise God.

1215
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:11,900
Farm.

1216
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,380
But you don't live on one now?

1217
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,740
Still something about a farm. What's a farm?

1218
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:21,600
Huh?

1219
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:28,480
Because you look like a farmer to me.

1220
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:29,860
Huh?

1221
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:32,800
What?

1222
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:37,140
The name what? What does it mean?

1223
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,240
Farmer is your name.

1224
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,580
What is your name?

1225
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:44,360
May Farmer.

1226
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,200
May Farmer. Farmer. Oh, hallelujah.

1227
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,140
Oh, God.

1228
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:51,920
He knew her name.

1229
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,240
May Farmer.

1230
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,920
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

1231
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,740
Jesus stole her life.

1232
00:53:59,060 --> 00:53:59,780
He knew her life.

1233
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,600
I know Jesus.

1234
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,200
I know Jesus is alive.

1235
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,200
He tells me her name.

1236
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,660
Like I say, I'll talk to Bob on the phone about your problems.

1237
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:14,460
If you have any special needs, we can always supply you with anointing oils.

1238
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,980
Yes, we have special anointing oils.

1239
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:17,460
And we can...

1240
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,160
You can...

1241
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:24,120
Just for a few dollars more, friends, only a few dollars more to that miracle box number,

1242
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:28,920
we can let you come to visit us at the special retreat.

1243
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:33,020
At Dobbs Town and where you can get landscapes.

1244
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:40,260
And Dr. Drummond and all his little friends from the special places will open up your third nostril

1245
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:46,140
and make it where you can pick up on the strange liquid vibrations that are all around us in the air.

1246
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,380
I think I can get a whiff of them now, friend.

1247
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,280
Yes, I can tell there's...

1248
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,120
Oh, Pastor Naked.

1249
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,380
No one knows what happened to him.

1250
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,240
He just disappeared in a burst of smoke a little while ago.

1251
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,940
But people didn't even get excited.

1252
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:03,580
They didn't even jump up and down because they're so used to seeing it happen in front of the tape recorders

1253
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:07,640
and all the microphones that we have here at the foundation.

1254
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:08,860
Hallelujah, friend.

1255
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:14,340
Oh, can you say anything about what Bob has done for you, my dear sister?

1256
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,280
That's Bob.

1257
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,560
I can say, I can say, baby.

1258
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:24,920
Oh, Bob's working miracles night and day.

1259
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,120
I can say, baby.

1260
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,120
Baby.

1261
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:29,540
They call him Bob.

1262
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:34,280
And I think, I think I can try to, I can pick up what your name is.

1263
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:34,520
Yes.

1264
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,200
You've never met me before, right?

1265
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,060
And you've never been into this temple, right?

1266
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,120
That's right.

1267
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,260
And this is true, friend.

1268
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:41,680
This woman has never met me.

1269
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,560
And she doesn't know any of my employees or any of the other people at the foundation.

1270
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:47,920
And I think I'm getting a picture.

1271
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:48,980
I'm getting an image in my head.

1272
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,280
I see a, I see a farm.

1273
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:54,580
Yes, I see a farm, a little, little rooster on top of a house.

1274
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,720
And what is it?

1275
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:56,920
Wait, the farm.

1276
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,700
Are you a farmer?

1277
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:58,800
Close.

1278
00:55:58,940 --> 00:55:59,640
Close?

1279
00:55:59,680 --> 00:55:59,780
Close?

1280
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,180
What, what, what, what, what, what, what is your name?

1281
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,600
What, what, what, what, what, what, what is your name?

1282
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:06,460
Farm?

1283
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:08,160
She said yes.

1284
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,000
Friend, her name is Farm.

1285
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:11,420
She said yes.

1286
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,680
God, you know what I'm talking about.

1287
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,540
I'm telling you.

1288
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:15,340
God.

1289
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,800
I've got an analyst now.

1290
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,180
Yeah, that's Becky Box.

1291
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,140
You can't steal that.

1292
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,200
I think so.

1293
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,820
But you know what I think we ought to do?

1294
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:29,680
Is just rent.

1295
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,060
We ought to have our open.

1296
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:38,620
We ought to open a damn lab of subgenius analysis shop back here and do counseling.

1297
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,880
You know, we can get a license to counsel in a subgenius fashion.

1298
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,040
Can you do that?

1299
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,060
Uh, I don't know.

1300
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,880
Well, we can do, hell, they do palm reading.

1301
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:52,880
Here.

1302
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,920
They do, you know, astrology readings.

1303
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,720
We can come back here and do mental life transfer readings.

1304
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,660
Do them really.

1305
00:56:59,180 --> 00:56:59,660
Spectacularly.

1306
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,040
So it's worth people's $10 that we charge.

1307
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:02,300
Yeah.

1308
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:02,900
Even if they.

1309
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,240
I mean, we flop around on the floor.

1310
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,160
We speak in tongues.

1311
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:07,480
The voice of their good relatives comes through.

1312
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,280
This is granny.

1313
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:10,600
I hope you did well.

1314
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,660
It's beautiful here.

1315
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:15,600
There's music and soft clothing and tight shoes.

1316
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,100
This is a place where all of us live together.

1317
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,240
Happy and free.

1318
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:26,160
I just spoke to Sigmund Freud about your problem.

1319
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,160
And he says, you can quit.

1320
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:28,660
If you're.

1321
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:28,880
I think.

1322
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,160
In order to change you or give you a meal or acutally'elate the devil, just try.

1323
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,020
Or just try.

1324
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,080
prudently because it's me on cake rock.

1325
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,080
And in Friday night, fame.

1326
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:47,080


1327
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:47,080


1328
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:47,320
Well.

1329
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,200
Rottenamental pourления malolен Bur 240.

1330
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,920
We got this film call it,Tsign Up, made fun of you.

1331
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,960
Take me if u need it.

1332
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,380
Put me in a box with a good little phone

1333
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,420
Pink boy, never gonna grow up

1334
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:10,480
Pink boy, think I'm gonna grow up

1335
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,360
Pink boy, you're the kind of guy

1336
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:17,140
You can bring it down, but you gotta find the man

1337
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:24,180
Oh boy, you are the man

1338
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:27,940
You're the man who knows the all, the answer

1339
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:36,820
So it seems at least that's what Doug and Follow keep telling us

1340
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,220
Well, maybe I could be

1341
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,980
If the string is right here

1342
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,920
And I'm not, can't fall

1343
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:24,160
If the string is right here

1344
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:45,380
If the string is right here
