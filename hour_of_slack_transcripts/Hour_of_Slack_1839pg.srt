1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,380
Bob?

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:03,960
Bob?

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,480
Bob?

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,780
If you happen to tune in within the last few minutes and you are wondering about what's going on,

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,740
we'd like to tell you that this is a program about...

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,000
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,920
We want to pry into people's private lives to record anything that is really none of our business.

8
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,780
As you can see on the large screen behind me,

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,880
we're keeping track of things on one of our many manned space stations now in orbit,

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,420
while the small screens below show other activities being monitored by mission control.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,940
I'll have them repeat it on the upper screens for you also.

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,020
SSL, this is instrumentation.

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:50,860
Roger.

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,780
SVO, start port recorders and TV video tape.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,200
Record.

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:55,860
Roll call.

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,840
Ah, yes, dear friends.

18
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:08,620
Welcome to hour of slot number 1839.

19
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,040
And I'm not sure exactly what all's going to be on this one,

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,580
except there may be a lot of me talking.

21
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,980
Reading, actually.

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,800
Because I came home from X-Day,

23
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,320
missing something I had sort of expected to have.

24
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,720
I have a lot.

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,240
In fact, I have too much.

26
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,360
And that makes the editing trickier.

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,360
And I'm behind and late.

28
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:48,300
So I don't know what we're going to do tonight or today or this morning or wherever you are.

29
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,580
But I do know this.

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,280
Stock up and save.

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,140
Friend, morality can be quantified.

32
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,820
Pay Bob to show you how.

33
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,400
Read the pamphlet.

34
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,680
Study it.

35
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,440
Memorize it.

36
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:13,760
You'll wonder aloud how such priceless wisdom can be sold openly, legally, and all for less than $2.

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,200
Tell your friends and family about your slack until their ears bleed.

38
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,780
And then...

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,980
That's from the Dobbs Town Mirror.

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,640
And now this.

41
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,040
The Lone Ranger

42
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,300
The Lone Ranger

43
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,920
The Lone Ranger

44
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,660
The Lone Ranger

45
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,340
The Lone Ranger

46
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,880
The Lone Ranger

47
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,700
The Lone Ranger

48
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,300
The Lone Ranger

49
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,960
The Lone Ranger

50
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,780
The Lone Ranger

51
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,740
Mayonnaise!

52
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,020
Potato salad is so rich and nourishing and flavorful when you use best foods, whole egg mayonnaise.

53
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,680
Mayonnaise!

54
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,360
Mayonnaise!

55
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,180
They covered me in mayonnaise, then they ate my bones.

56
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:23,780


57
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:33,080
Forearms streaked with junky veins, just like the rolling stones.

58
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:41,220
Syringes dangling from their wrists and from their pubic zone.

59
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:48,860
Their push cut rims with razor blades and human waist unknown.

60
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,640
They cover me in mayonnaise.

61
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:54,880
Mayonnaise!

62
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,080
So they can eat my bones.

63
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,140
Mayonnaise!

64
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,680
Mayonnaise!

65
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:22,400
They covered me in mayonnaise, then they ate my bones.

66
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,080
The bumblebees caress my skull

67
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,220
The queen protects her drones

68
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,300
She moistens them with jelly paste

69
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,940
Until they're fully grown

70
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,980
They penetrate my tender flesh

71
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,420
Ignore my pleading moans

72
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,040
And torture me with mayonnaise

73
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,900
Before they eat my bones

74
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,180
They torture me with mayonnaise

75
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,360
So they can eat my bones

76
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:50,400
So they can eat my bones

77
00:05:50,420 --> 00:06:04,400
They torture me with mayonnaise

78
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,780
So they can eat my bones

79
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,080
They torture me with mayonnaise

80
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,440
Until they eat my bones

81
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:30,860
Until they eat my bones

82
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,640
Until they eat my bones

83
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,700
Until they eat my bones

84
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,640
They'd be off?

85
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,200
Heck, I even hate myself sometimes.

86
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,020
Yet we're all still subgenius.

87
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,480
But maybe you'd rather just get along.

88
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,100
Hey, what's that?

89
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,420
Bob! Bob! Bob!

90
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,320
Are you hurt?

91
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,420
Bob! Bob!

92
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,080
Hi.

93
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,180
You faker.

94
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,440
Steve, you know what this is, don't you?

95
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,860
It's a time-space warp.

96
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,840
I'm not sure I know exactly what that is.

97
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,520
I don't suppose anybody really does.

98
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,720
We've seen some strange things tonight.

99
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,120
Strange creatures that we know don't belong on our planet.

100
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,340
God only knows where they came from.

101
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,300
Jenny and Beth!

102
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,480
The Vortex took them.

103
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:49,900
Just...

104
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,400
Just...

105
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,400
Just took them away.

106
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,040
Oh, yes, dear friends.

107
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:09,220
And now we're going to read from a document that is, in fact, a comic book, one might say.

108
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,520
One might have once called such a document a comic book.

109
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,220
We can discuss the first dimension.

110
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,960
The first dimension is the second dimension.

111
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,960
The second dimension is widely known.

112
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,740
And the third dimension has been studied in depth.

113
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,040
Yet there exists a realm beyond.

114
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,380
A world 65 light-years east of nowhere.

115
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,140
There it is, just ahead.

116
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,460
A dominion of sight and sound.

117
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,220
A universe that twitches and howls in three-quarters time.

118
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,540
A place we know as...

119
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,180
Swonk.

120
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,900
Yes, Swonk.

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,460
Where reality peaks at 3.14 in the afternoon with such clarity and sharpness you'd think it would shatter.

122
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,780
Where traffic signals radiate black light.

123
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,420
Where the dogs of war battle apes of wrath.

124
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,060
This is Swonk.

125
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,320
And, dear friends, Swonk is a comic book.

126
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,780
Or a magazine.

127
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,100
Or a collection of comics.

128
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,080
Originally published.

129
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,680
In the Arizona Daily a long time ago.

130
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,100
It's by Greg Petics who wrote these things.

131
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,520
And Reverend Chris Silla who sent me this copy of this collection.

132
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,080
And even though it's a comic book with drawings, I'm going to read some of the cool writing from it.

133
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,760
Because it's cool writing.

134
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,360
And some of them...

135
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,400
Well, I can describe the drawings.

136
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,060
And I'll skip the ones I've written.

137
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,060


138
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,060


139
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,120
And I'll just write the ones where I can't.

140
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,960
Here's a short one.

141
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,460
And they're all short.

142
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,120
After I dropped out of college, I worked at a grocery store in upstate New York.

143
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,640
One day I was looking for price stickers near the register.

144
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,020
And I saw something strange.

145
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:17,820
And it shows the buttons on the register such as tax, return, angel override, void.

146
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,960
Angel override?

147
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,040
What? Angel override?

148
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,240
Maybe this was the silent alarm of the apocalypse.

149
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,200
The glowing red bat phone to God.

150
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,660
One touch would summon an army of angels.

151
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,120
Jehovah's howling commandos sliding down from heaven on fire poles of pure light.

152
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:42,760
Dodging stun pumpkins while their M16 harp rifles spat out clean and holy death.

153
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,740
Boy, there's a great picture of the apocalypse happening there.

154
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,600
Then again, maybe not.

155
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,280
There's only one button I have faith in.

156
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:59,620
And it shows a finger pushing the cash register button that reads void.

157
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:17,560
And here's one panel in which we see a psychosomatic hunchback ascends to the papal throne on a platform of sacramental bourbon and scantily clad altar boys.

158
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,580
Displeasing the leader.

159
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,780
But it's not.

160
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,620
What?

161
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,000
Who do we see?

162
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,000


163
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,000


164
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,600
digestive system st intention?

165
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,360
I don't know.

166
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:41,580
Dancing.

167
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:49,260
atz waiting room what the fuck is the fucking last line on the loudspeaker?

168
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:49,560
Poor virgin.

169
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,160
and somewhat in style,

170
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,320
but also very, very different.

171
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,200
Swonk.

172
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,980
Bjork's stork forks the pork,

173
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,620
but Hank's dank tank stank.

174
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,540
Meanwhile, Bob's job selling fobs to mobs

175
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,460
and hobnobbing with snobs

176
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,300
makes Rob's blob sob.

177
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,960
And such a sad picture of Rob's blob sobbing

178
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,040
with tears running into the box of five-cent apples.

179
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,740
Wherever you are, however you are,

180
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,560
this is the BBBB.

181
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,460
BBBB.

182
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,360
Today, the U.S. Senate has been tortured

183
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,900
and torturing prisoners.

184
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,620
BBBBB news.

185
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,620
The United States has said that it's bad.

186
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,040
An Iraqi deputy interior minister

187
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,900
had been paralyzed by three people in Hunan province.

188
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,560
Others had had their skin peeled off

189
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,840
during the BBBBB.

190
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,740
The French parliament has approved violent unrest

191
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,700
in a number of French cities and towns.

192
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,860
The interior minister told parliament

193
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,220
that he was beaten and stabbed in the capital, Tunis.

194
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,360
The Tunisian government has denied

195
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,860
that it was behind the organized United Nations attack.

196
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:15,880
On Wednesday,

197
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,480
BBBBB.

198
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,280
China says it's producing more than 100 million doses of bird flu

199
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,260
and is producing more than 14 billion human deaths

200
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,460
from bird flu in a day.

201
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,140
BBBBB.

202
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,440
The U.S. government's announced it intends

203
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,440
to take the grisly interior secretary, Gal Norton,

204
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,740
off its list of endangered secretaries.

205
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,360
BBBBB.

206
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,480
Look at that caveman go.

207
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,480
Plato's theory of forms was an explanation of universals,

208
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,560
perceived laws of nature,

209
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,340
BBBBB.

210
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,420
such as animals giving birth to animals like themselves, etc.

211
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,920
Plato's theory is that there's a form

212
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,300
or ideal version of all things

213
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,380
and physical forms are imperfect emanations of it.

214
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,940
There's a perfect ideal human ideal

215
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,760
that physical humans are imperfect emanations of.

216
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,320
It makes just as much sense to say

217
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,340
that there are even less perfect emanations below us

218
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,260
and even more perfect ones

219
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,340
above the human.

220
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,340


221
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,340


222
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,340


223
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:15,340


224
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,640
The ideal we perceive.

225
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,780
Otherwise, you're in that familiar bait-and-switch of

226
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,800
everything has a cause

227
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,300
except that one thing.

228
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,000
And now this.

229
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,460
Now won't you dig?

230
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,820
Daddy's like, now won't you dig?

231
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,200
Now if you wanna hear some boogie

232
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,320
that I'm gonna play

233
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,840
Now that it's just an old piano

234
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,460
And I got face down

235
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,740
The drummer man has his eight feet of lane

236
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,140
Now I guess you remember slackin' old beat me?

237
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:45,620
Daddy Wayne

238
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,180
Mother sellin' chicken fried in bacon grease

239
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,740
Let us walk along slack down the road of peace

240
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,920
Let's me and you walk on down the road of peace, slack

241
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,660
Don't step on my feet, man

242
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,480
You know that's gonna hurt

243
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,080
I'm sorry, Wayne, I didn't mean to...

244
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,360
Be alright down the road of peace

245
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,660
Dig this, Fred, this is crazy!

246
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,820
Dig dig dig dig

247
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,820
Dig dig dig dig

248
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,480
Woo!

249
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,620
Woo!

250
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,100
Woo!

251
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,120
Woo!

252
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,380
Woo!

253
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,460
Be alright down the road of peace

254
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,760
Watch this Snatch Base, man!

255
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,680
Everybody wants to know, what the hell happened to X-Day?

256
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:38,520
For 45 years, Bob said that the world was gonna end at 7am on July 5th, 1998, and he's

257
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,720
still saying it!

258
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,080
Even the normals wanna see the end of the world.

259
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,100
They're muskin' for it.

260
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:51,660
Everybody secretly hankers for that Judgment Day porn in which their enemies fry and they,

261
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,220
of course, are spared.

262
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,820
Every other Hollywood blockbuster has some movie star saving the threatened world by

263
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,280
using his muscles and going,

264
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,840
AHHHHHHHHH!

265
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,580
Plus, you have your Heaven's Gate and your Jonestowns and your Waco's, where some little

266
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,480
band of weirdos manages to make the world end, at least for themselves.

267
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,980
Then there was...

268
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,900
the Y2K bug.

269
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:17,800
Remember that?

270
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,340
The pin kooks were all runnin' around like ninnies, fretting that their precious ATMs

271
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:29,740
and other false slack doohickeys would shut down, crash, fail to reboot.

272
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,280
They should be so lucky!

273
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:41,700
The day the con calendars, called July 5th, 1998, came, and no immediately discernible

274
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,980
world cataclysm occurred...

275
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,880
What a disappointment!

276
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,100
Oh, people made fun of the subgenie.

277
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,560
They mocked our serious beliefs.

278
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,060
But did we care?

279
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,800
Hell no!

280
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,660
We're religious nuts!

281
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,900
Did the Jehovah's Witnesses quit coming to your door just because the end of the world

282
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,280
fizzled out six or seven times in a row?

283
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,940
Did the Scientologists stop believing in L. Ron Hubbard?

284
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:12,960
Are we going to let the Jehovah's Witnesses or the Scientologists out kook us?

285
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:22,440
Ex-day might not come for the next 200 Julys straight, but the true subgeniuses will maintain

286
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,520
unquestioning faith in Bob's word and prophecy.

287
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:32,540
If Dobbs says the world ends July 5th, 1998, then that is what will happen!

288
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:40,340
The only thing proved by the events of, quote, July 5th, 1998, is that we have no idea what

289
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,460
year this really is.

290
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,940
And that's not the end of the world.

291
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:50,840
At 7.15 on 7.598, upon closer inspection of the original prophetic memo from Dobbs,

292
00:17:50,920 --> 00:18:00,040
we encountered the 8661 quandary, the so-called upside-down bar napkin theory.

293
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,540
The subgenii at large were not exactly overjoyed by the idea that somebody had repaired a torn

294
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:12,920
memo by placing part of it upside down, and that we might have over 6,000 years to wait.

295
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:12,920


296
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,180
Before we get the immortality we paid $30 for.

297
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,680
But that's just one theory.

298
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,760
I've been telling and telling you people, hollow earth.

299
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,840
Everything turned inside out.

300
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,920
All the stuff that was on the inside is on the outside.

301
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:37,300
Holes at the poles seal up with Jehovah One and all pinks inside, where it gets to eat them forever.

302
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,000
New outside looks exactly like old outside.

303
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,560
But pinks are replaced by identical flesh robots.

304
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:53,900
When we return after a thousand year pleasure cruise, we're given new flesh robot bodies exactly like the ones we lost on July 5th, 1998.

305
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:03,300
Our memories are wiped back to X minus one, and we live out our lives exactly as we would have if X Day had never happened.

306
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,700
I remember from last time.

307
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,240
Well, that's what Nenslow predicted.

308
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,180
And for all we know, it came true.

309
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:24,880
Dr. Howell, besieged by whimpering gimme bobs complaining about the post-X Day world, shared this doctrinal rebuke with the poor wandering livestock.

310
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,740
Dear seeker, please calm yourself.

311
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,540
It's not the end of the world.

312
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:37,680
The official line is a tissue of flapdoodle involving a misreading of the launch date as scrawled by Bob himself.

313
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,580
On the back of an envelope.

314
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:40,760
The items of the issue are not here.

315
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:40,760


316
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:40,760


317
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:40,760


318
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:40,760


319
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:40,760


320
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:40,760


321
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:40,760


322
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:48,280
Steng read the year upside down, so that the year 8,661 AD was thought by the scribe to

323
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,760
be 18 c 20 go down eight thousand six sixty one a d eroys thought by the scribe to b

324
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,260
19 c 29 displayed by the scribe to be in twenty eight.

325
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,620
This would have the effect of giving the church more time.

326
00:19:52,760 --> 00:20:07,560
To accomplish it's mission.

327
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,580
rorr.

328
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:14,480
you awake? In a twinkling of Bob's eye, the faithful, which I trust includes you, were caught

329
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:21,220
up in the clouds, in the so-called saucers, and returned in time for breakfast. All predicted

330
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:28,480
changes are happening or will happen, not according to human standards of time, but rather in accordance

331
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:36,820
with the movements, whether in epicycles or quanta, of the cosmic clock, which may only be read by

332
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:43,840
superhuman optic or other sensory organs. A religion that could be completely comprehended

333
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:51,180
and fully interpreted would be a toy, fit to be encapsulated and folded up to be put in one's

334
00:20:51,180 --> 00:21:00,480
pocket. But behold, we show you a mystery. Isn't it universally accepted that one of the few things

335
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,760
we do know about the aliens is that when they abduct you,

336
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,540
they

337
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:06,800
are

338
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,140
always put you back? That the abductees do not immediately remember the details?

339
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,960
What in the name of Whitley Stryber were you people expecting? Without springing for a

340
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,080
conspiracy psychiatrist, look back, recollect in tranquility, if you will,

341
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:28,140
dare to disturb with a ripple of self-inquiry the deep pool of your unconscious memory.

342
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:36,740
Now then, are you sure you can completely account for your activities at 7 a.m.?

343
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:42,720
On July 5th, 1998? Austerely yours, Dr. Howland Owl.

344
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:50,240
Others insist that X-Day worked out, but only for Bob. We know that Bob makes a million dollars

345
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:57,820
every time he screws up. In 1998, we had 10,000 dues-paying subgenius ministers that felt Bob

346
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:03,620
screwed him big time. That's 10,000 screw-ups, 10 times one million dollars per screw-up,

347
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,700
or 10 billion dollars.

348
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,860
That's how much Bob stood to lose should X-Day succeed.

349
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:17,860
Maybe a delay of X-Day was engineered by Dobbs after he convinced his customers for this

350
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:23,560
galactic drug deal, the Elder Gods, that he could brew up an even more pure grade of the

351
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:29,780
drug in question, that being human soul, given a little more time. With Bob's cultivation

352
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:35,000
of the church, he was providing enough variation in the additives to keep them wanting more.

353
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:41,760
On July 3rd, 1998, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon related this parable.

354
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:50,060
Two bulls, an old one and a young one are standing on a hilltop, looking at a herd of cows in

355
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:56,060
the valley below. The young bull says, hey pops, let's run down these on some of them

356
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:04,980
cows. The old bull replies, no, let's walk down there and sunbub all of them cows. The

357
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:04,980


358
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:04,980


359
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:04,980


360
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:04,980


361
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:13,680
those cows. So maybe that's what Dobbs is really up to with this rescheduling. And friends, there

362
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:23,260
are many more theories. It was all just a joke theory, the total recall theory, and there's the

363
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:30,100
description of what really happened at Brushwood by Onan, which is a whole other story. But

364
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:41,300
you make me happy when I am blue. Too low. 1-800-1961. I'm acting just like an animal.

365
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:49,540
There's all the time I need and all the time I want. Ample. Antithesis. Are you hungry? Are you

366
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,100
in good hands?

367
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,660
I'm hungry.

368
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,540
Ashes of a dead world. And he moved an entire community back into the dark ages.

369
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:26,260
Better blood. Bob called me. I sing the body electric. I sing the body electric. I sing the

370
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,340
body electric. I sing the body electric.

371
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:36,140
Burn up. But I made love. I can't even play Perry Como. Chip off the old block. Chip off the old

372
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:42,260
block. Come on out. Come. A dimension of mind. Don't make any noise when the music's playing.

373
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:52,020
Don't paint the sun anymore. Don't paint the sun anymore. Don't touch. Don't touch my tool.

374
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,220
Depths paid. Listening to someone talk about who or what they love,

375
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,080
is a very important part of the story. It's a very important part of the story. It's a very

376
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,940
important part of the story. It's a very important part of the story. Isn't that a pleasure, no matter

377
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:08,640
who the who is or what the what is? Listening to someone talk about who or what you are supposed to

378
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:18,300
love? Mixed bag, eh? Except when it's the church of the subgenius. Everybody likes, dislikes,

379
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:28,840
is indifferent to, or is ignorant of Bob. And that's a fact. Oh, thank you, the Rudy Schwartz

380
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,060
Project for the back.

381
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:37,600
Background music, which is called, uh, well, the album is called Frop Music. And now this.

382
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,160
The men in white picked him up yesterday. With the nuts and the squirrels, ha ha.

383
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:58,420
Oh, and then the days got worse. And then the days got worse. Oh, at last they let me out.

384
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,300
He needs to pray.

385
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,060
Oh, yes, I'm going to take me away. Ha ha.

386
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:02,460
He.

387
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,720
We're sitting in a

388
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,400
The funny farm where life is

389
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,420
And all the time. And you'll be

390
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,500
Stay and play with my new friend.

391
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,800
I'm normal. I'm okay.

392
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,480
Where the people all smile while I

393
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,500
But this

394
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,640
Hey, hi there.

395
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,520
You would make me flip my lid.

396
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,440
It was a joke and so you

397
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,600
Didn't you the day you swore you'd all

398
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,260
Ha ha.

399
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:28,960
Ha ha.

400
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:28,960


401
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,060
They're coming to take me away.

402
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,800
Oh, hee hee. Ha ha.

403
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,460
To the bay.

404
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,480
Six milliamps in a discuser view.

405
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,040
I'm mad.

406
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,500
And happy they took you away. Ha ha.

407
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,140
Oh, no.

408
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,600
Or damn, and I spread rumors at stuff.

409
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,440
You and how I should cut my hair.

410
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,420
Look upon all them tom-dom-dom-dom.

411
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,520
And you're right. I am making friends. You.

412
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,560
I cooked you food. I

413
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,100
And that gives me the

414
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,580
Who's next?

415
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:52,840
Yeah.

416
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,440
Losing you would surely make me

417
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,720
And they're coming to take me.

418
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,800
Ha ha.

419
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,900
Push to sow the coffee.

420
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,200
Ha ha.

421
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,460
Well, you just

422
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,320
You'll get just what you deserve.

423
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,760
Where's trees and grass?

424
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,700
And I don't

425
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,560
Just my thumbs and feed my lizard.

426
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,700
To drive me sane.

427
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,600
He he.

428
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,520
All of this ha ha ha hee hee.

429
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,400
Here to you and that's the day.

430
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,100
Some men in a green white coat.

431
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:18,640
Look up.

432
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,260
And

433
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:20,440
They're coming.

434
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,860
Where life was ludicrous all the time.

435
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,980
Ha ha ha.

436
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:26,740
And

437
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,440
They're coming to take me away.

438
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,280
Ha ha ha.

439
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:29,300


440
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:29,700


441
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,140
Oh.

442
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,380
And flowers and chirping birds and

443
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,600
They're a crew who sleep and smile and twiddle their

444
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,220
On the wall.

445
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
Ha ha ha.

446
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,320
Big and tough.

447
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:45,840
At the start of every disaster movie there's a scientist being ignored and or a scientist being heated.

448
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,540
But that's what disaster movies are for.

449
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,020
Disaster.

450
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,240
If you're making movies in your head, and most of us do, make the ones you want to see.

451
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,480
That might be a disaster movie.

452
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,440
But it might be some other kind of movie.

453
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,480
See what other genres are available in your mind.

454
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:11,680
When I don't have my head stuck in a black hole, I always listen to the hour of slack.

455
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,180
Because it makes me laugh and I like to laugh.

456
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,340
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

457
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,340
In Bedlam Cathedral, organ grinders float polkas up to the vaulting.

458
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,940
While a chorus of hee nuns speak in tongues.

459
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:32,220
Behold the high pope of insanity drooling into the sacred clemato.

460
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:39,900
Preaching the oral Torah of ghost stories, knock knock jokes, and Paul's letters to the penthouse forum.

461
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:45,760
This is the chapel of madness where the Holy Trinity goes nyuk nyuk nyuk.

462
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,040
Spam transubstantiates into the flesh of Liberace.

463
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,200
And one plus one plus one equals one.

464
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,860
Here's one in the EC style.

465
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:10,780
Greetings my fellow parishioners, and welcome to the catacombs of Rome.

466
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:19,940
I'm your faithful storyteller, the sub-pope, caretaker of the Catholic Church's forbidden library of pornography and apocrypha.

467
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,440
I call this little yarn, Rubbed Raw.

468
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:36,000
The USS Nazarene, recon ship for the church's first interstellar crusade, streaks through space in search of souls to convert.

469
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,700
The mother superior was deathly afraid of star travel.

470
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,440
So afraid that her praying became almost ungodly.

471
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,020
Oh please God don't let me die here. Please God don't let me die.

472
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:52,480
Look at her, the way she obsessively rubs those rosary beads. It's inhuman.

473
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:57,400
The space papists finally arrive at Pius XII.

474
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:04,560
Look! Crucifixes as tall as skyscrapers! Steeples that reach the clouds! Could it be possible?

475
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,860
Wait, wait, what's that up ahead?

476
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:12,720
Jesus, Mary and Joseph, it's freakin' huge! Oh God, no, no!

477
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:21,160
The giant creature cracks open the ship, decapitates the crew, and strings their heads on a long cable.

478
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:27,700
It bellows in a strange tongue as it rubs the mother superior's skull between its fingers.

479
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:33,780
And as everything goes black, she realizes what the alien is doing.

480
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,640
It is praying.

481
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:42,980
Well, sister, how does it feel to have someone praying on you?

482
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,700
Amen.

483
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,160
And the monster...

484
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:55,260
Monster, or as saying, Spa Fon Squachant.

485
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,880
Which is...

486
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:04,100
Secret comic book code alien talk from the olden days.

487
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,280
And you know, let me say this.

488
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,360
His number is 13013.

489
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,660
And he also has an email address.

490
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,760
It's dub, uh, at dub, duh, dot, org.

491
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,680
That's dub, uh, at dub, duh, dot, org.

492
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,380
And that's all well and good.

493
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:33,280
But here, then, is the story of the 26th X-Day drill previously called 24 X-Day, quote, 2021, unquote.

494
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,700
This is my story of what I just did last week.

495
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,460
And how it came about.

496
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:50,140
This beautiful young subgenius named Reverend Exanthea Octoshroom started suggesting that the alien was a monster.

497
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,140


498
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,140


499
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,140


500
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,140


501
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,140


502
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:59,500
Suggesting to me, way back in the days of Myspace, that we hold an event at the Land of the Lakes, Florida nudist resort owned by her and her dad.

503
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,320
Oh, nothing happened for many years.

504
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:19,320
Then, in 2019, Exanthea visited us at Stang Ranch in person and amazed me at how together she was despite her jaw-dropping good looks.

505
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:29,820
She's a professional model as well as a hardworking art bum like myself and a fossil collector and nudist resort owner.

506
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:40,700
In 2020, I started letting people know that for a bunch of reasons I was having to retire from running X-Day at Wisteria or anywhere else.

507
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:48,000
Dr. Argus Fox, Fid Chooley, Reverend Pease, and a few others heard that as a clarion call.

508
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,300
And that's what we're here for.

509
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:56,320
They visited the resort and the next thing I knew they'd bought me a plane ticket to 24X Day at Land of Id.

510
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,440
Promising me fine health food.

511
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,660
Turned out to be all McDonald's.

512
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,020
Because they just got too busy.

513
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:11,520
And they even hired a subgenius Uber driver, our friend Reverend Nugget, to take me to and from the airports.

514
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,960
How could I say no?

515
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,540
They also offered Philo and he said no.

516
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,160
So they called Dr. Howe.

517
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,100
Who is up for any program.

518
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:30,600
And despite some challenging thunderstorms, which are typical of any X-Day drill, the event went great.

519
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,280
Largely because the venue, Land of Id, is perfect for our purposes.

520
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:42,940
Flush toilets, a pristine swimming pool, indoor clubhouses, covered stage, and it's in town.

521
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:47,100
No more 45 minute drives for beer, cigarettes, and hot dogs.

522
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,960
It's a huge supermarket five minutes away.

523
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,820
The turnout was like the last several drills at Wisteria in Ohio.

524
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,460
Only about 40 people.

525
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,500
Many of them were new to me and some were local Floridians.

526
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,640
But I was astounded how many came from far away.

527
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,520
Like the band Rubik's Cube from Pennsylvania.

528
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:15,580
They're veterans of X-Day, Ohio and New York X-Day since Lord Rockstar was about 15.

529
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,080
Because he's a rock star.

530
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,100
He's the son of old Reverend St. Fultimus X. Mortis.

531
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:30,080
Reverend Negative and Reverend Katana 007 of the band Sub-G Kids came from, I think, Indiana.

532
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,900
They got engaged on the way there.

533
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:39,040
And I married him on July 4th after their performance.

534
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,320
Or maybe before the... I don't remember.

535
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,940
Lord Ferg came.

536
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,600
Also, I think, from Indiana.

537
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,560
With a house trailer.

538
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,700
Which came in really handy for our great preacher, Papa Joe Mama.

539
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,800
Who had his little daughters with him.

540
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,480
And he did not let them see his performances.

541
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,660
Or much of anything else.

542
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:07,340
Lord Ferg's been a huge help in every way at X-Day going back to the Brushwood days.

543
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,440
Also super helpful were Reverend Aster, the wife of Fox.

544
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,740
I married them too.

545
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,780
Many drills back.

546
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,560
She was kind of the mom of this drill.

547
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:27,380
Reverend Walter Cosmack was once again another great help and supplier of the coolest art gizmos and art robots.

548
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,700
A new person who helped a lot was Reverend Dirty Instigator.

549
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,240
She was one of the few subgeniuses who was actually nude most of the time.

550
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,040
Luckily, she's young and healthy.

551
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,820
And we had the cleanest.

552
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,800
Bobtism of all time.

553
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:49,100
For the land of Id has a swimming pool.

554
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,160
A really nice one.

555
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,800
No more water spiders, leeches, or mystery moss.

556
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,080
And no old sequoia either.

557
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,580
But that just means nobody had to be sacrificed this year.

558
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,400
Every day there were radio shows during the day.

559
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,880
Some with boring old pros like Dr. Howell, Papa Joe, and myself.

560
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,500
Some with highly excited rank amateurs.

561
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,700
Some with modern podcaster baiters like the Time for the Show Boys.

562
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,720
There was an Ask Dr. Howell show.

563
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,760
And there were so many bands that I'm still trying to sort out their names as well as my recordings.

564
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,180
Apparently I'm the only person whose recordings weren't destroyed by the rain.

565
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,120
Unfortunately, mine are all from my phone or my little ambient location recorder.

566
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:42,000
The line recordings that we wanted most got drowned on the last night.

567
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,180
And the roughness of my recordings means longer editing and tweaking time.

568
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,680
So getting the good bits out on this show may happen gradually.

569
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,260
An excellent bob dummy was burned on the last night.

570
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,840
The head was provided by Hel Swami Satellite Weavers who made the best bob sculpt.

571
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,920
And can make plastic masks from it.

572
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,940
Under that plastic mask was a skull.

573
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,940
In theory, the fire would melt the plastic face to reveal the skull.

574
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,980
A la the Melting Face.

575
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:11,980


576
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,500
A melting Nazi face in Indiana Jones.

577
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,420
Sadly, the body of the dummy,

578
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,880
was sitting up in a chair, was spineless.

579
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,380
And it flopped forward during the burn.

580
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,060
So the skull reveal never happened.

581
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,880
Still, it was a bob burn him.

582
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,080
Burn him. Burn him. Fire!

583
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,920
I haven't a flashlight?

584
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:46,100
Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him!

585
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,020
Bob on fire!

586
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,800
Uh oh! He's caught on fire!

587
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,440
His suit blazer is ablaze!

588
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,200
His lap is hot. Hot lap of Bob.

589
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:01,200


590
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,240
take that bob!

591
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,960
burn in hell pink boy!

592
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:04,920
kill.

593
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,700
Bob.

594
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,700
kill.

595
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,660
bob.

596
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,620
kill.

597
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,580
bob.

598
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,480
kill.

599
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,340
bob.

600
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,120
kill.

601
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:12,980
bob.

602
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:13,780
kill.

603
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,640
fab.

604
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,740
kill.

605
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,400
bob.

606
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,080
kill.

607
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,380
killed.

608
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,240
Kill Bob! Kill Bob!

609
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,980
Kill Bob! Kill Bob!

610
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,460
Kill Bob! Kill Bob!

611
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,200
Oh, he's smoking now!

612
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,700
Oh, look at that!

613
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,420
Look at the collar there, Bob!

614
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,340
Hey, Bob! Do you got a lighter?

615
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,700
Where's the hot dogs?

616
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,440
There goes the pipe.

617
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,120
The pipe is hanging.

618
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,840
He's about to let go.

619
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,260
That's it, man, when the pipe falls.

620
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,180
The pipe!

621
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,060
The pipe!

622
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,400
The pipe!

623
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,040
My God, it's like his

624
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,160
face is just melting off

625
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,220
of that stupid, thick, bonehead

626
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,180
skull of his.

627
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,840
Sick. Sick,

628
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,060
sick, sick.

629
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,480
This is just a sick,

630
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,120
sick spectacle.

631
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,140
I can't believe it. Oh my God,

632
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,540
look at that. Oh, no!

633
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,860
That's it.

634
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,740
Kill Bob! Kill Bob!

635
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,020
Kill Bob! Kill Bob!

636
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,040
Kill Bob! Kill Bob!

637
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,020
Kill Bob!

638
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,400
Oh, God!

639
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:20,700


640
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,520
Oh, God!

641
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,200
Oh, God!

642
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,080
Oh, God!

643
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,700
I need a rag.

644
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,380
Oh, God!

645
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,000
To Bob, man!

646
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,500
What a

647
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,580
nightmarish

648
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,940
spectacle.

649
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,000
I just stand there staring at the

650
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,680
burning of Bob.

651
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,940
I want to hear some Kill Bob!

652
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,600
and watch people run around that room.

653
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,860
Who knows, there's no pagans around to be drumming

654
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,000
and, you know,

655
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,940
celebrating, everybody stripping

656
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,000
their clothes off and dancing

657
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,120
around the damn thing.

658
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,640
Bill Dibbs! Bill Dibbs! Bill Dibbs!

659
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,060
Bill Dibbs! Bill Dibbs! Bill Dibbs!

660
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,740
You kind of need the pagans sometimes.

661
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,380
We got him!

662
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,880
We finally got that bastard. We killed Bob.

663
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:09,640
Again.

664
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,980
There doesn't seem to be anything left of him in here.

665
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,200
Well, I can't wait for the sausage to come.

666
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,180
Reverend Stang?

667
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,400
I know we're kind of bonded by a murder now,

668
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,840
but let's just

669
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,080
make sure we don't call

670
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,980
the cops, guys.

671
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,500
No, when you have a problem and you call the cops,

672
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,200
as Chicken John said,

673
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,300
then you have a problem

674
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,360
and the cops.

675
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,160
Well, now that we're bonded forever by this

676
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,000
murder, we have to take a

677
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,860
blood vow. No, we don't.

678
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,820
No? Isn't that how it goes?

679
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,220
No, we just don't

680
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,020
advertise it.

681
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,800
Smart move.

682
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:47,980
Smart play.

683
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,800
Proof that Bob does not

684
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,040
just quit. He gets fired.

685
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,880
You're fired, Bob.

686
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,680
Remember,

687
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,720
people watch the line of drinking

688
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,860
to make sure you have alcohol and fire

689
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,820
on every level of your home.

690
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,120
Remember, if someone in your household

691
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,040
smokes or is under the influence of fire,

692
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,000
you must be aware of Ontario.

693
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,120
Remember,

694
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,240
I'm a dangerous drinker.

695
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,260
Remember, there's more to responsible drinking

696
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,840
than alcohol and fire

697
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,320
on every level of your home.

698
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,280
Orange Blossom Brewery

699
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,560
donated 50

700
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:23,980
cases

701
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,540
of beer.

702
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,220
They arrived on Friday and we were

703
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,800
down to only 10 cases by Monday.

704
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,800
Miraculously, no one

705
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,940
was hurt or had to be dragged out of the road

706
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,700
by me. Simply amazing.

707
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,860
One reason may be

708
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,600
that it was all IPA

709
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,720
beer, specifically

710
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,240
back in the day IPA.

711
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,960
And many people can't

712
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,020
handle the bitter taste of IPAs.

713
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,100
I love them, but

714
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,180
as a good role model, I didn't

715
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,060
ever get

716
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,000
very drunk.

717
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,420
Crap, that's the one we got.

718
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,100
It's the only one they had, dude.

719
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,220
Orange Blossom Brewing

720
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,900
back in the

721
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,200
day IPA.

722
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,140
Stang, you should come see this.

723
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,200
Oh my god.

724
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,760
Orange Blossom Special.

725
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,720
Oh, this is dangerous.

726
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,940
This is an accident waiting

727
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,460
to happen.

728
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,440
This is suicide.

729
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,860
This is Jonestown.

730
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,640
This is fucking Heaven's Gate all over again.

731
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:28,880
You guys are nuts.

732
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,380
I thought we were a different UFO cult.

733
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,780
There's only going to be about

734
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,860
40 people here.

735
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,140
This just gives me a feeling

736
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,140
of utter horror

737
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,640
and fear.

738
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,960
Well, that's why I brought you here.

739
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,040
I'm so glad this didn't happen.

740
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,600
What happened under my watch?

741
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,740
I fear the vomit.

742
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,840
I fear the

743
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,060
bodies in the road.

744
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,980
They're not dead,

745
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,060
but they'll feel that way

746
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,740
the next day.

747
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,180
Mom and puke.

748
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,940
Mom and puke.

749
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,020
You guys are all going to end up like me in hell.

750
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,940
Amazing Orange Blossom.

751
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,060
Broken back.

752
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,120
Yep, that's a lot of beer.

753
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,040
How I began my career

754
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,040


755
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,040
as an alcoholic.

756
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,780
Many people take years to fall

757
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,920
under the spell of John Barleycorn.

758
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,820
But here at the Church of the Subgenius

759
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,960
we have our accelerated program

760
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,120
of inebriation

761
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,720
for the Enlightened.

762
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,780
Which I will now initiate.

763
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,000
I also spent about every

764
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,940
other hour inside Reverend

765
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,140
Exanthea's house, which has a sea

766
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,940
and also is

767
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,100
a lot like my house since she's also

768
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,040
a fossil hunter and a connoisseur

769
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,020
of crazy art and antique

770
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,620
furniture and weird decoration.

771
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,880
Including her own

772
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,080
excellent sexy sci-fi

773
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,140
surrealist paintings shown here

774
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,280
on slide three.

775
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,140
I was treated like a king

776
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,780
when I wasn't getting ball busted

777
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,320
for being a high muckamuck.

778
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,000
The Bulldotta auction was full of

779
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,940
killer stuff. I got some

780
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,260
rare Doc Savage reprints

781
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,820
and a 2020

782
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,100
election chess set

783
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,860
that has to be seen

784
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:17,800
to be believed.

785
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,300
And my old pal Papa Joe Mama

786
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,480
had action figures made

787
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,520
of him and me.

788
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,460
They don't look anything like either of us really

789
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:29,040
but hey, you know, at least we have action figures.

790
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,880
Friends, I have to

791
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,360
drop in and mention that

792
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,940
those action figures

793
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,020
are not available.

794
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,920
They were banned from stores

795
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,700
after protests by the

796
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,240
National Union of Teachers and Nurses.

797
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,100
How about that?

798
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,960
And a new

799
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,540
guy, Reverend Grindstaff brought

800
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,040
dozens of Dobbshead spin art

801
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,620
paintings that a lot of people bought.

802
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,980
And he was a new guy who

803
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,920
seemed to quickly make friends with everybody

804
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,040
and there were a lot of new guys. He made a lot

805
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,060
of new friends. And when I say

806
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,680
guys, I mean ladies

807
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,880
as well. That's

808
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,980
kind of, sort of what X-Day drills

809
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,980
are good for. Standing around

810
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,840
in the road talking. That's

811
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,520
my favorite part.

812
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,980
Although a lot of us

813
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,960
old timers missed a lot

814
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,500
of fellow old timers like

815
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,560
Reverend Susie the Flusie, Reverend

816
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,700
Fight C. Taj, the amino

817
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,920
acids, the circus

818
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,820
apocalypse clowns on drugs,

819
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,560
Potter and Petal

820
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,920
Nostril, Philo, and

821
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,000
also everyone who died

822
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,860
such as Reverend

823
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,960
Heathen and Dr. Dart just to name

824
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,840
a very few.

825
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,040
On the last day, Tropical Storm

826
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,940
Elsa was bearing down on Tampa

827
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,920
and I basically got the last

828
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,300
flight out to Dallas.

829
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:47,980
Because the airport closed

830
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,300
three hours after we took off.

831
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,420
Awaiting me at home

832
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,760
were a ton of

833
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,440
orders to fill including 16

834
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,440
memberships bought between July

835
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,200
1st and July 5th.

836
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,340
That happens every X-Day drill.

837
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,660
Are these people smart?

838
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,460
Or superstitious?

839
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Or both?

840
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:10,380
Because

841
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,840
they're held at campgrounds instead

842
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,260
of in motels, every

843
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,840
X-Day drill presents

844
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,700
some kind of terrifying

845
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,120
and inspiring

846
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,380
miracle of nature.

847
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,960
And those are always my favorite

848
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,540
parts of the drills because

849
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,900
I love nature.

850
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,500
When the

851
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,660
rain started drenching everything

852
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,460
the first day the miracle happened.

853
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:36,860
Suddenly there were walking

854
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,900
catfish all over

855
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,480
the yards and porches.

856
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,300
The whole resort.

857
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,520
I mean everywhere.

858
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,980
There are these smallish black

859
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,220
stinking catfish

860
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,720
that drag themselves by their front

861
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,700
fins out of the big

862
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,820
central pond looking for

863
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,640
new bodies of water and

864
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,980
bodies of new spouses.

865
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,660
I loved it.

866
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,180
It was so weird for me.

867
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,360
I come from a dry, dry

868
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,400
land. But here fish

869
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,680
rained from the sky and

870
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,620
walked upon the land.

871
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,880
Signs in the heavens and signs

872
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,740
in the earth. It had to be the real

873
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,160
X-Day. Or at least

874
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:17,300
the real X-Day.

875
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,240
I spent an hour helping

876
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,980
Xanthia clear them from her

877
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,380
big enclosed porch which has

878
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,300
its own little pond. And I ran

879
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,740
around helping all the employees

880
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,380
and residents carry the stranded

881
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,700
ones back to the pond lest they

882
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,200
dry out and stink later before

883
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,020
they got wherever they were going.

884
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,420
I mean they stink bad enough

885
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,900
when they're still alive.

886
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,320
Anyway friends let me close

887
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,820
by saluting my new fellow

888
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,340
victims of Devival Host Syndrome.

889
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:48,700
Not that many people have had it.

890
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,360
But here's some new ones

891
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,540
that lived through it.

892
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,820
Dr. Argus Fox, Reverend

893
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,440
Fid Chooley, and

894
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,900
Reverend Pease. And Reverend

895
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,840
Xanthia. They

896
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,640
saved X-Day.

897
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:04,760
Praise

898
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:06,360
them. And praise

899
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,820
that man Bob. And

900
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,880
thanks to CyberChump

901
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,860
for the background music which is

902
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,080
from their CD called

903
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,640
The Construction of Things.

904
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:44,980
And I'll see you guys

905
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:45,060
in the next video.

906
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:45,220
Peace.

907
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,000
FAIL

908
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:23,380
Collages have been by Norell Preff and also Lee Murr.

909
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,960
Incidentally, I got some good news.

910
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:30,440
The recordings from X-Day that I was hoping for came through.

911
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:34,440
The rain did not destroy everything after all.

912
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:40,420
But next, well, you know how sometimes the only way to get rid of a maddening earworm

913
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,580
is to foist it onto others and infect them with it?

914
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:48,400
Well, that's what I'm about to do to you with this song by the Swingin' Love Corpses.

915
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:53,200
It's one of my favorite songs of all time, but I was never satisfied with the recording,

916
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,280
which is from a cassette of a VHS tape.

917
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:02,480
But I worked it over with my magic compression and normalizing tools and just with magic.

918
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:07,260
And either I've ruined it because I'm, after all, partially deaf

919
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,900
and have no business attempting to sweeten sound,

920
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:13,020
or I actually did make it sharper and clearer.

921
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:17,300
Hopefully, it's still the worst best brain worm ever.

922
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,080
It's unusual for a Swingin' Love Corpses song because it's not by either of the Drummond brothers,

923
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,720
but by their cousin, guitarist Ray Hay.

924
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,940
Remember how earlier I said I loved nature?

925
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,860
I said that because I knew I'd end with this.

926
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,800
Here's nature.

927
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,760
I hate it.

928
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,920
Oh, this music in the background, by the way, is cyberpunk.

929
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:43,980
Superchunk.

930
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:13,560
gonna turn up this zone

931
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:13,560


932
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:13,560


933
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:13,560


934
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:13,560


935
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:13,560


936
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:13,560


937
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:13,560


938
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:13,560


939
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:13,560


940
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:13,560


941
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:25,240
Well, it's been a while since time began

942
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:29,900
A bad struggle against nature, forcing nature against man

943
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,820
Tectonic fate, movement is imperfect sand

944
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:38,020
Nature has the power, nature has the upper hand

945
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:41,440
Nature! I hate it!

946
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,520
Nature! I hate it!

947
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,300
Nature! I hate it!

948
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,240
Well, the forces of nature come in many degrees

949
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:00,800
Maybe a forest fire, plague or killer bees

950
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,040
It may be an earthquake or maybe typhoon

951
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,920
Tornadoes, volcanoes, rains and monsoons

952
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,140
Nature!

953
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,680
I hate it!

954
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,360
Nature!

955
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,700
I hate it!

956
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,100
In the baby's dioxide

957
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,060
Ludicrous

958
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,820
Wipe out a whole species

959
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,120
Harder to make you feel

960
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,020
Guard your hole in the earth

961
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,160
Fill that hole with plastic

962
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:41,420
And you'll see the world in your eyes

963
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,220
The way we treat our planet

964
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:49,280
Wondered that it's bad

965
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:56,020
The way we treat our planet

966
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:57,020
The way we treat our planet

967
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:57,020


968
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,820
The way we treat our planet

969
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:01,040
Wondered that it's bad

970
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,040


971
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,620
Wondered that it's bad

972
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:02,620


973
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:02,620


974
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:02,620


975
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:10,040
Well, it's all ours

976
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:10,140
Well, it's all ours

977
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,200
Men die

978
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:11,200


979
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:11,420
Men die

980
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:22,540
Thank you.

981
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,300
Thank you.

982
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:14,840
Thank you.

983
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,400
Thank you.

984
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,240
Thank you.

985
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:31,420
Thank you.

986
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:36,600
I don't want to get off the stage.

987
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,900
Who told me to get off the stage?

988
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,100
Am I just paranoid?

989
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,360
Rationing reason?

990
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,540
You can't think that.

991
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,740
What if everybody thought like you do?

992
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,120
That's what some people say.

993
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:00,180
Friend, the evidence is clear that not everybody thinks like I do.

994
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:03,660
You can pick your battles and you can pick your friend's nose,

995
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:08,400
but picking your battles is better than letting a nosy friend pick them for you.

996
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,280
Thank you.

997
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,000
I support my thinking far less.

998
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,860
About what people support, including myself.

999
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,260
Heck, is some other people.

1000
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:24,820
Thank you, Uncle Dr. Onan Canabite, for the Dobstown Mirror.

1001
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,180
I'm falling.

1002
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:38,540
And I can't get up.

1003
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,640
Calling Dr. Howard.

1004
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,580
Dr. Fine.

1005
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,580
Dr. Howard.

1006
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,560
No, I'm a doctor, not a mechanic.

1007
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,840
We're losing potency in our antimatter pod.

1008
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,960
Our mind is growing.

1009
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,600
I can feel it.

1010
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,660
You see?

1011
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,400
You see?

1012
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:53,860
You're stupid minds.

1013
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:54,820
Stupid.

1014
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,520
Stupid.

1015
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,700
Mark it with a T.

1016
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:05,860
There are any number of popular ethical thinkers who are now forgotten

1017
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,960
because they said things like,

1018
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,920
do not turn to bitterness because an object,

1019
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,160
you covet, is unobtainable.

1020
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,560
But here we are, all these centuries later,

1021
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,980
still repeating the jokes of the funny animal stories of Aesop.

1022
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:26,920
I say, sour grapes, and you know what that means.

1023
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,600
But animals can't talk.

1024
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:35,880
Is that too smart for your own good 1990s atheistic attitude

1025
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,840
that assures alienating the audience?

1026
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:42,500
And that's a whole bunch of Aes there

1027
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:46,700
from the hole called the Dobstown Mirror,

1028
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,140
about which you may learn more

1029
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:53,780
if I can find the inside front page.

1030
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:58,080
Go ahead, I'll fold it up.

1031
00:57:59,660 --> 00:57:59,780
Yeah.

Columbus, Indiana.

4-7-2-0-2.

1057
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,120
Yes, that really is P.O. Box 3.

1058
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:52,520
And Bob's P.O. Box really is not Box 808,

1059
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,320
as much as I would like it to be.

1060
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:59,260
It's P.O. Box 807,

Thank you.

00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:08,700
Thank you.

1064
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:08,740

and to Dr. Onan Canobite for all of that stuff I read.

1079
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,860
For you see, friends, as it says in Prescriptures 55-58,

1080
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,720
the devil cannot seize up a bald man by the hair,

1081
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:31,160
but God will put food in the beard of a man.

1082
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,300
Pretty cool, huh?

1083
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:39,740
Thank you.
