1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
What you are hearing is not a test.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,460
There is a need, brothers and sisters.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:11,800
A need for you to get off your lazy ass and fucking donate to this goddamn station.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:19,180
I am sick and tired of you dear listeners who continue to sit idly by in your car,

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:27,540
your living room, your bedroom, your stateroom, your panic room, and just listen.

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,040
Listen, this shit ain't free folks.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,640
So how about you just skip that tall, half skinny, half 1% extra hot shot split quad shot latte with whip.

8
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,860
Or maybe just skip that lunch date with the cutie from the typing pool.

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,640
After all, it's only going to lead to heartbreak.

10
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:51,160
And spend that money now, right now, on something that will never give you up,

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,020
and will never let you down, and will never run around and desert you.

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,460
Because this...

13
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,260
This station will never make you cry.

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,160
They will never say goodbye.

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,360
And they will never tell a lie and hurt you.

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,860
So call the WCSB Cleveland Pledge Line.

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,960
216-687-6900

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,200
That number once again is 216-687-6900

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,040
With your donations now.

20
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,840
Credit card pledges may be made online at WCSB.org

21
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,700
This plea for cash has been brought to you by

22
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,120
The Soul Genius.

23
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,680

We areという and working.

27
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:49,800
Thank you.

28
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,020
Imagine an instructional tape that produces gobs and gobs of money!

29
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,120
Quickly, easily, and effortlessly!

30
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,880
It's like a faucet you can't fix!

31
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,820
Gushing and spewing a never-ending constant flow of cash money!

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,600
Multiple streams of income!

33
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,260
This is the key to your financial future.

34
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,900
Say goodbye to your day job and live your dreams.

35
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,480
Getting started is really easy!

36
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,600
You're gonna get drunk, take lots of pills, and have sex!

37
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,620
All the time!

38
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,460
I was broke and living at the YMCA six months ago.

39
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,800
The one right down here down the street.

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,540
Now just look at me. I'm living large.

41
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,320
Six-figure income? We've done it!

42
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,500
We're gonna teach you how to be in a band!

43
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,900
Lose weight and make money!

44
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,240
Push, play, and get rich!

45
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:11,120
Have you ever dreamed of playing a wicked guitar solo under the spotlight in front of thousands of screaming chicks?

46
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,280
Keep dreaming!

47
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,600
Chances are, you'll never play like that.

48
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,380
And if you do, chances are, you'll never make any money doing it.

49
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:18,980
This is Wes.

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,840
And I'm Bob.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,040
And we're here to tell you that

52
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,200
people don't care about guitar solos anymore!

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,000
What we're going to focus on in today's lesson is

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,120
how to fake it in almost any situation.

55
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,900
It's easier than you might think.

56
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,740
We'll also cover

57
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,280
how to break a string.

58
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,320
As well as

59
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,740
how to piss off your singer with some really cool noises.

60
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,740
First off, let's go over some fundamentals.

61
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,880
You'll need a guitar.

62
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,340
And it will need to be in tune.

63
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,420
If your act sounds like this...

64
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,140
...

65
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,520
...

66
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,380
...

67
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,560
...

68
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:48,560


69
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:48,560


70
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:48,560


71
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:48,560


72
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:48,560


73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:48,560


74
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:48,560


75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:48,560


76
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:48,560


77
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:48,560


78
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:48,560


79
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:48,560


80
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:48,560


81
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:48,560


82
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:48,560


83
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:49,820
...

84
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:49,820


85
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,320
...

86
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


87
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


88
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


89
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


90
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


91
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


92
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


93
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


94
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


95
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


96
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


97
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


98
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


99
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


100
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


101
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


102
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


103
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


104
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


105
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,320


106
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,080
Let's move on.

107
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,980
It's showtime.

108
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,620
Your band hits the stage.

109
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,620
You've had way too much to drink.

110
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,060
And you forget how the song goes.

111
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,740
Hey, Wes.

112
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,420
Some of us do that even when we're sober.

113
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,680
Well, in either case, the thing not to do is panic.

114
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,560
Odds are good that no one has ever even heard your music.

115
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,720
So, you can fake it.

116
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,720
Most people are stupid anyway.

117
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,520
They'll never suspect a thing.

118
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,080
The same applies to wrong notes.

119
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,720
They'll think you meant to do it.

120
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,820
It's also a good idea to keep a can of Spritz on your amp

121
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,960
so you can tease your hair while you fake it.

122
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,940
It's very important to look good,

123
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,880
even if you can't play very well.

124
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,860
Breaking a string comes pretty easy

125
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,600
if you beat the shit out of your guitar.

126
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,960
Don't bother to clean or baby your guitar

127
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,260
if you're just gonna throw it at the drum set at the end of the show.

128
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,820
Expensive guitars are pointless.

129
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,480
Korean-made Yamahoos and Ivanhads take abuse well

130
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,840
and are good for spare parts.

131
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,920
You can break up to five strings at a time and still play.

132
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,160
Just imagine dazzling your fans

133
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,740
as you recite

134
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,280
There are various noises that you can make with a guitar.

135
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,280
A wide array of sounds that you can use

136
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,820
to irritate domestic household pets.

137
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,420
The police.

138
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,380
And of all people,

139
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,760
the guy who sings in your band.

140
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,620
Stop it.

141
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,540
Hey, stop that.

142
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,300
It's my turn.

143
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,940
Man, shut up, punk.

144
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,440
Among other techniques, I like to make a guitar

145
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,960
squeal like a pig.

146
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,680
That's all we have time for today, kiddos.

147
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,140
I hope you found today's lesson enlightening and inspirational.

148
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,420
We welcome your letters.

149
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,100
Because we usually steal ideas from them.

150
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,640
Until next time, this is Wes.

151
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,300
And I'm Bob.

152
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,880
Stay hard and petty.

153
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,900
Rude and rude.

154
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,040
Smooth in the noose.

155
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,920
Fucking patood.

156
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,880
Buy our next lesson

157
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,040
or we'll come around and screw you.

158
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,360
Oh, lady.

159
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,000
Oh.

160
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,160
From Fort Lauderdale, Florida

161
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,680
to Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

162
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,340
Now, the man who will be damned.

163
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,780
Come on, let's get Bob up here.

164
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,960
Come on, Bob.

165
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,660
Where's Bob?

166
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,780
Bob, come on, Bob.

167
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,320
Come on, Bob.

168
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,860
Have a seat, Bob.

169
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,080
Have a glass of water.

170
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,100
Now, this could not have been your objective.

171
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,260
Did you want to do this, Bob?

172
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:22,780
Yes.

173
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,280
Bob?

174
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,260
Bob.

175
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,220
Bob?

176
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,180
Bob.

177
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,100
Bob, isn't it?

178
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,740
That is correct.

179
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,040
Oh, boy.

180
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,160
You're smarter than the average guy.

181
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,160
And, Bob, give me one good reason.

182
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,120
We, 23, did you mean to come?

183
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,920
We stopped real time.

184
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,300
No.

185
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,400
Well, there is no real time.

186
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:39,820
Very true.

187
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,500
That is very true.

188
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:40,880
All right, Bob.

189
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,960
Did you have something going on?

190
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,420
Yes, we have.

191
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,980
Oh, you are.

192
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,540
Yes.

193
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,060
You escaped.

194
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,840
That is true.

195
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,840
Yeah, for your verb.

196
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,400
Yeah.

197
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,620
What field are you in?

198
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,300
I work for a profit.

199
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,220
So there's not a lot of money to make.

200
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,100
But I work in a unique field.

201
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,200
I work on people.

202
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,060
That's fantastic.

203
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,280
It's incredible.

204
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:00,940
Yes.

205
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,540
Yeah, yeah.

206
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,440
Bob, you know, this works.

207
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,000
Someone out there plays along with you.

208
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,020
I have no idea.

209
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,500
Spleen is exactly right.

210
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,720
No.

211
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,560
Oh, okay.

212
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,520
Yeah, see?

213
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:11,860
See?

214
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,520
Okay.

215
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,120
Wow.

216
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,440
Bob, this is Bob.

217
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,540
Hey, Bob.

218
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,140
Hi, Bob.

219
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,120
I'm good.

220
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,420
Yeah.

221
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,260
Same here.

222
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,060
Okay, excellent.

223
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,140
And they're a brain trust.

224
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:22,940
Science.

225
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,900
Science it is.

226
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,540
All right.

227
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,420
Who just had its south polar region blasted?

228
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,320
Bob.

229
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,300
Boy.

230
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,520
That was really good.

231
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:38,980
So, okay.

232
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,000
Bob.

233
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,160
Bob.

234
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,460
Why would anyone pay?

235
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,040
Is the question.

236
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,180
And the answer?

237
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,440
You got it, Bob?

238
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,980
Current events.

239
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,160
Yeah, I'm way off on that.

240
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:49,460
Yeah.

241
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,640
Because it would put somebody on top of Marilyn Monroe.

242
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,320
That's exactly right.

243
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:56,820
Yes.

244
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,140
Wow.

245
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,160
Let's go with people.

246
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,860
People.

247
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,480
Garbage disposal.

248
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,160
Toilet.

249
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,640
Base.

250
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,960
That we've.

251
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:03,520
All right.

252
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,820
I'm not sure.

253
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,240
So I'll go along with Bob.

254
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:08,660
Yes.

255
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,240
Oh, boy.

256
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,760
That was too easy.

257
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,060
They won.

258
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:12,980
Congratulations.

259
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,760
Yes.

260
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,240
Bob, you're going to put the fun and elegance back into its most unsavory aspect by eliminating

261
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,860
painlessly with a new and remarkably revolutionary poopy pet waste paper doll kit.

262
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,280
That's amazing.

263
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,980
Then they book the poopy wars by a handsome briefcase bag.

264
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,680
The party game including the fun and elegant peripatetic Bob bobblehead.

265
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,340
Bob, I know you're on vacation and walking the dog, but if you couldn't vacation with

266
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,980
the president this year, at least you have the next one.

267
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,200
And you could have used these.

268
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,200


269
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,200


270
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,200


271
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,200


272
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,200


273
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,200


274
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,420
This is the best thing.

275
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,100
The My Barack Obama, pooping Barack Obama.

276
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:43,700
Keychain.

277
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,620
Why'd it just turn between five neighborhoods, out in the issue with the pig from Iowa.

278
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:47,820
Congratulations.

279
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,040
Oh, there you go.

280
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,100
You really cleaned.

281
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,380
Can we count on that, though?

282
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,260
I mean, can we really.

283
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,760
Count on it.

284
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,800
That is a definite ransacking.

285
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,180


286
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,400
development in the direction that it's going unless several other things happen.

287
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,900
For example, if the power suddenly runs out.

288
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,700
And if the power runs out, that changes all these things just a little bit.

289
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,480
The curves are all different.

290
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
No, no, that's not it.

291
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,020
Very funny.

292
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,000
Some wayward fancies.

293
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,020
In this cloud-spinning fairy castle.

294
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,220
It's a cream-by-cloud cuckoo land.

295
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,400
So you think this is evidence of...

296
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,940
A Vulcan cuckoo time.

297
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,880
I see.

298
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,020
Yes, a fooling paradise.

299
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,360
I would be inclined to agree with you.

300
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,340
I think we should build a survey and give it to our constituents

301
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,620
and ask them if we should put together a task force to explore this.

302
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,840
But then it also might have its nobility, its elements of being a utopia.

303
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,120
If implausible and impractical, at least it means well and it's not.

304
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,840
If we don't get their funds and spend them exploring this concept,

305
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,200
we're just missing a golden opportunity.

306
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,700
We had two bags of grass, 75 pellets of mescaline,

307
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,040
five sheets of high-powered water acid,

308
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,780
a salt shaker half full of cocaine,

309
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,160
and a whole galaxy of upers, downers, screamers, lappers.

310
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:21,780
What a rum.

311
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,740
A line of law either.

312
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,420
Two dozen ambers.

313
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,920
Why don't you get locked into a serious...

314
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:28,940
drug collection?

315
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,040
The tendency is to push it as far as you can.

316
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,320
Ruppers.

317
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,260
Downers.

318
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,340
Screamers.

319
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,500
Ruppers.

320
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,160
Ruppers.

321
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,680
Downers.

322
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,440
Screamers.

323
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,520
Ruppers.

324
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,500
Ruppers.

325
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:43,540
Downers.

326
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,580
Screamers.

327
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:44,700
Oh, yeah.

328
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,740
Oh, yeah.

329
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,120
I'm flying too boody.

330
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,380
This shit's for you, buddy.

331
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,740
Generals gathered in their masses.

332
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,780
Just like witches at black masses.

333
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:56,960
Yeah.

334
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,980
Evil minds that plot destruction.

335
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,980
Sorcerer of death's construction.

336
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,140
In the fields, the body's burning.

337
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,300
And the war machine keeps turning.

338
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,260
Well, I'm afraid of death and hate.

339
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,580
Too much time.

340
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,740
Poisoning their brainwashed minds.

341
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,260
Oh, Lord, yeah.

342
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,340
Oh, Lord, yeah.

343
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,520
Oh, Lord, yeah.

344
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,760
Oh, Lord, yeah.

345
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,820
Oh, Lord, yeah.

346
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,460
Hey, you know how...

347
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,280
Now in darkness, world stops turning.

348
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,380
Ashes where their body's burning.

349
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,320
No more war pigs out the power.

350
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,540
And the god of stop the hour.

351
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,660
Day of judgment.

352
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,200
God of justice.

353
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:58,200


354
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:58,680
It's calling.

355
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,960
Underneath the wall, it's calling.

356
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,820
Hey, well, I'm the fool.

357
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,860
There you pass, it's all the same.

358
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,940
Satan's up and gets his way.

359
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,020
Hey, well, I'm the fool.

360
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,920
Oh, Lord, yeah.

361
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,100
Oh, Lord, yeah.

362
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,220
Oh, Lord, yeah.

363
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,460
Oh, Lord, yeah.

364
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,560
Oh, Lord, yeah.

365
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,600
Oh, Lord, yeah.

366
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,260
Registration and swag are now closed.

367
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,380
Right.

368
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,460
At 1 p.m. tomorrow, they will reopen.

369
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,100
On the other hand, friends,

370
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,140
if you get really drunk or high on something

371
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,780
and suddenly decide you have to have

372
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,120
a certain $100 worth of subgenius

373
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,400
crap, feel quite free

374
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,440
to approach me

375
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,360
specifically.

376
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,780
I will unlock

377
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,580
whatever needs to be unlocked

378
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,400
and take your money.

379
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,860
That's right, folks.

380
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,740
In fact, we've got a lot of swag here

381
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,220
that hasn't even been set out

382
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,680
because it hasn't been priced yet.

383
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,740
Just approach Honest Ivan Stang

384
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,940
and put in your bid and see how far

385
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,540
that gets you.

386
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,640
Honest Ivan Swag Shack.

387
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,560
That's us, friends.

388
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,100
Honest Ivan.

389
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,100


390
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,640
Honest Ivan's Swag Shack.

391
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,980
Because tonight is a pledge drive night

392
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,460
for those listening live on WCSB.

393
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,480
And even for those who are not listening to WCSB

394
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,160
but to one of our sister stations weeks later,

395
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,260
you can still...

396
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,720
It all still applies,

397
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,020
except for the phone numbers

398
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,820
and the premiums

399
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,480
and the credits.

400
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,360
And...

401
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,300
which are,

402
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,780
from the beginning of the show,

403
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,320
praise Reverend

404
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,620
Frodis Suds

405
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,660
Pasha,

406
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,680
who, besides doing tons of great graphics

407
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,240
and great music

408
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,720
lately,

409
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,800
whipped out that WCSB pledge

410
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,780
thing at the very beginning

411
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,460
with the funnily cut cuss words.

412
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,940
Thanks to a new contributor

413
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,100
for the

414
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,460
How to Be in a Band

415
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,480
late night infomercial.

416
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,700
That was by Reverend Dub Diablo

417
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,660
of the Subgenius Bait Shop.

418
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,080
The Bob Show collage

419
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,460
was by Reverend Dr. Royal Decapitator.

420
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,640
We heard Philodrummon, Dr. Howell

421
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,560
and Puzzling Evidence

422
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,680
on the Puzzling Evidence Show

423
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,020
from Puzzling Evidence.

424
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,080
KPFA in Berkeley

425
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,000
at kpfa.org

426
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,220
or quiveringbrain.com.

427
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,080
And we're going to have a little bit of a break.

428
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,080


429
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,080


430
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,860
And a live recording from X-Day

431
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,040
of the Evolution Control Committee

432
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,000
and the Subgenius Podcast folks,

433
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,140
Ministry of Slack,

434
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,580
doing that mashup of War Pigs.

435
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,400
And the last little bit

436
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,860
about the Swag Shack

437
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,880
was also at

438
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,280
14X Day, our annual event.

439
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,280
Which, by the way,

440
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
I just put a bunch

441
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,100
of stuff on my YouTube

442
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,940
channel.

443
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,820
That's youtube.com

444
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,860
Rev.

445
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,780
Stang.

446
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,980
All lower case.

447
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,040
Rev. Stang.

448
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,500
You can go there and see

449
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,080
all of 14X Day

450
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,180
in 11.5 minutes.

451
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,260
And I also just put up

452
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,360
some footage

453
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,340
at the very end of

454
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,700
Evolution Control Committee's

455
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,060
concert at X-Day

456
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,680
where he's doing this great

457
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,680
preaching kind of routine.

458
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,320
And his beautiful wife

459
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,240
is go-go dancing.

460
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,000
Trademark Gunderson.

461
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,200
And this is of most importance

462
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,440
to WCSB listeners.

463
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,080
I edited our movies

464
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,160
of the WCSB

465
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,700
annual Masquerade Ball

466
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,860
that was last weekend.

467
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,120
I may have mentioned that I put the pictures up.

468
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,140
But now there is

469
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,000
a movie up, a movie of

470
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,080
the rare appearance of J.R.

471
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,320
Bob Dobbs. It's about a 10-minute movie.

472
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,260
It shows little clips

473
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,040
of all of the bands and a whole lot of

474
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,480
funny costumes.

475
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,420
And Bob himself

476
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,660
is very, very

477
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,200
strangely represented.

478
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,820
I mean, I'm not sure if it was really Bob.

479
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,820
His skin seemed

480
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,340
unusually smooth

481
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,760
and his face is all floppy.

482
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,760
It's like his bones

483
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,780
aged, but his skin didn't.

484
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,700
It's very...

485
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,600
I mean, his hand gestures are...

486
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,060
You can see it at,

487
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,440
well, as I say, the Rev. Stang

488
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,240
channel on YouTube.

489
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,280
But also,

490
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,440
tinyearl.com

491
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,580
slash WCSB

492
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,800
2, numeral 2.

493
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,640
tinyearl

494
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,480
that's T-I-N-Y

495
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,180
U-R-L dot com

496
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,000
WCSB 2.

497
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,520
The slash between

498
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,980
this com and WCSB

499
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,040
numeral 2.

500
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,880
And it's a pretty funny movie,

501
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,320
actually.

502
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,020
Puzzling.

503
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,400
Very puzzling and strange.

504
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,060
You can see your...

505
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,320
All the other WCSB

506
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,660
DJs and bands and so forth.

507
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,680
But you won't know who they are

508
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,900
because they all have masks on.

509
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,820
And once again,

510
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,220
friends,

511
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,320
feed the Stangs.

512
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,440
Feed the station

513
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,560
by calling and pledging.

514
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
You can talk to Princess We Are Doe.

515
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,120
That's why she's not laughing

516
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,820
in the background.

517
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,940
She's taking calls.

518
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,080
Or you can talk to Dr. Sinister,

519
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,180
who also appears in that movie

520
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,900
I just plugged.

521
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,540
And all you have to do is call

522
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,600
the station

523
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,800
and pledge your

524
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,440
faith.

525
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,000
The number?

526
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,700
6900

527
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,040
or more

528
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,720
easily remembered

529
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,740
6900

530
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:17,920
6900

531
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,500
Friends, I'd love to do pledge drive shows

532
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,580
because this is the only time we get to act like

533
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,140
real preachers and

534
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,460
try to bleed you for

535
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,600
every last penny you can spare.

536
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,000
And even pennies that you can't spare.

537
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:31,540
Here, look.

538
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,600
That's how many we've got so far.

539
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,880
That was all I could spare.

540
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,080
It's about five pennies.

541
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,460
Here, that little jar, collection jar.

542
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,620
I'm expecting

543
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,260
other co-hosts

544
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,140
to join me

545
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,920
any minute now.

546
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,940
But I should take this time...

547
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,940
Oh, I've come to...

548
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,800
Funny is, speak of the devil.

549
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,540
I am not the devil

550
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,020
of which you speak.

551
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,620
I am a devil of a distant world

552
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,700
unfamiliar to you.

553
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,760
The devil of the planet details.

554
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,080
The devil is in

555
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,860
the details.

556
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,160
Hiding his woolly horns

557
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,040
hoping not to be seen.

558
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,780
I wouldn't say that.

559
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,840
He's probably hoping to be voted for

560
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,040
in the upcoming elections.

561
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,960
Well, he's running in every party.

562
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,180
Right, he does.

563
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,420
That's how it works, man.

564
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,640
Thank goodness.

565
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,240
No matter who you vote for,

566
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,020
just by the fact that they're running for office,

567
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,160
it must be the devil.

568
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,960
Because who else would do a thing like that?

569
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,920
A crew of sociopaths

570
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,320
with an interest in gaining a lot of money

571
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,300
without having to do anything.

572
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,760
Well, that includes most subgeniuses, too.

573
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,200
But they don't have supernatural powers

574
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,100
until after they've

575
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,180
pledged

576
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,440
to WCSB.

577
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,020
I think it's one of the...

578
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,160
Which I can say,

579
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,100
I can't say what they would have to pledge

580
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,300
to the church as subgenius.

581
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,820
Probably their undying fealty

582
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,400
or their unbeknownst fealty, perhaps.

583
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,540
But anybody who would pledge

584
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,020
to WCSB,

585
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,400
to me, would be

586
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,540
one of the most wonderful people

587
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,600
in the entire world.

588
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,980
And we'll read their names out on the air, too.

589
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,720
I might want to break it up a little bit.

590
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,780
But I think of each and every contributor

591
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,400
out there

592
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,020
who's donated more than just their time and efforts

593
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,400
like this.

594
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:25,400


595
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,980
Like we and everybody who's

596
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,460
running phones and doing things.

597
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,620
I'm talking about the people

598
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,520
who come up with some money.

599
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,900
It's true.

600
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,340
They help more than anyone.

601
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,020
And what do they help with?

602
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,240
Why the station needs to update our website?

603
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,300
One last push.

604
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,300
It's more expensive than we thought.

605
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,160
We'll be archiving the shows.

606
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,760
Every show will be on for like a week or more

607
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,460
that you can download.

608
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,960
Although you can download this show,

609
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,240
of course, at subgenius.com.

610
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,880
You can download the last

611
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,160
1,332 shows.

612
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,200
This one is show number

613
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,820
1,333.

614
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,220
333 is the number of the anti-Bob, friends.

615
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,540
You're not going to let the anti-Bob win now,

616
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:09,880
are you?

617
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,000
No.

618
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,160
999 is the number of Bob

619
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,680
and of Herman Cain,

620
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,100
who may well be the

621
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,220
anti-Christ.

622
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,620
Some subgeniuses really want Herman Cain

623
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,800
to get elected because it would be so funny.

624
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,380
And it would be so funny.

625
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,560
It would drive, it would finally tip everything.

626
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,800
It would push things far enough

627
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,980
that there might be real serious,

628
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,300
serious change.

629
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,520
Not because of him, as a reaction to him.

630
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,560
Speaking of serious change,

631
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,920
as a reaction to Cain.

632
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,520
Listen to this serious change in this little jar.

633
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,320
There's five pennies in here.

634
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,380
Is that all we've been pledged so far?

635
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,860
Then that's my five pennies.

636
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,740
The sad thing is the previous show,

637
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,180
the guy came in here and took his change out.

638
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,220
Oh, man.

639
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,360
You know, he had to,

640
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,560
he used his own change as a sound effect.

641
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,520
Huh.

642
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,460
Hope and change.

643
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,160
That's the kind of change we're looking for, friends.

644
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,020
Oh, let me tell these folks

645
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,400
what they can get for their change.

646
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,460
Oh, they get plenty.

647
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,100
Yes, they do, actually.

648
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,960
For a mere $15.

649
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,680
I remember when it used to be a mere $5,

650
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,280
but $5 is like a penny now.

651
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,500
You can buy a piece of gum

652
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,880
or a small cup of plain coffee for five bucks.

653
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,380
For $15, friends,

654
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,440
why, there's a few VHS tapes

655
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,320
with these titles that I wrote down

656
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,560
because I like the titles.

657
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,400
Earth vs. the Spider.

658
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,920
Girlfriend from Hell.

659
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,020
And I know that you know about that one, friend,

660
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,340
even if you never saw the movie.

661
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,280
It's great stuff.

662
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,620
Incredible, incredible, incredible.

663
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,020
Martians Go Home.

664
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,100
Oh, yeah.

665
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,140
Reptilian.

666
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,020
That's the biography of George W. Bush, I think.

667
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,680
Yeah.

668
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,940
Things to Come,

669
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,360
screenplay by St. H.G. Bush.

670
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,400
Well, it's not to be confused

671
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,260
with the porno film Things to Come.

672
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,660
And here's the subgenius premium.

673
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,140
This is what everybody's been waiting for.

674
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,020
You know, every now and then

675
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,860
we do these triple X shows

676
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,960
that you can't hear on the radio

677
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,240
that we only put on the intranet.

678
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,740
Your ears would burn.

679
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,760
Well, for a $15 pledge,

680
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,080
your subgenius premium

681
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,240
is one subgenius triple X rated show.

682
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,400
My favorite recent one.

683
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,520
We did three recently.

684
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,380
And for your $20 pledge and up,

685
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,800
you get two of those.

686
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,240
And for $30,

687
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,960
you get three, three X shows.

688
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,820
Plus, in every case,

689
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,280
you get the famous

690
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,260
I'm Mad 2 Bob bumper sticker

691
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,980
as seen this week on Rachel Maddow's show.

692
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,920
Did you know that Rachel Maddow

693
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,160
mentioned us the other night on her show?

694
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,400
She has before even, too.

695
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,660
Well, she was,

696
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,240
she was explaining that

697
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,160
she considers Herman Cain

698
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,760
to be performance art.

699
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,940
She had pretty good reasons

700
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,140
behind that, too.

701
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,720
Much speculation is going in that direction

702
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,980
that he's perhaps a,

703
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,620
he's a form of performance art.

704
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,400
Yeah, an artist.

705
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,740
And he can't believe

706
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,280
that it's gotten this far.

707
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,260
You know, he thought it was,

708
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,580
he did it as a joke

709
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,940
and now he's going, oh my God.

710
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,300
Well, he did it for a few dollars,

711
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,380
more than a joke, but.

712
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,580
So, but yes, anyway,

713
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,580
you can, you can get your famous

714
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,660
I'm Mad 2 Bob bumper sticker

715
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,200
as seen on Rachel Maddow's show

716
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,520
to illustrate, for some reason,

717
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,680
she used that to illustrate

718
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,400
what performance art is about.

719
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,660
You got me.

720
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,320
Yeah, where does,

721
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,260
how does she know?

722
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,140
Why is she an authority?

723
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,300
And I know when she,

724
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,800
she grew up in San Francisco.

725
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,000
Pardon?

726
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,740
She grew up in San Francisco

727
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,460
where we were cool.

728
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,080
Oh, went to Design College of Art.

729
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,480
We were cool there.

730
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,020
Oh.

731
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,900
We were the coolest thing

732
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,520
in San Francisco in 1984.

733
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,840
They, they were too pretty cool.

734
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,680
They had, you know,

735
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,380
weird looking hair

736
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,260
and stuff like that

737
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,040
and their noses were,

738
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,280
they had like rings

739
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,400
in their noses and things

740
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
and their eyelids

741
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,520
and they're, they're funny.

742
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,540
They're fun to look at.

743
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,540
That's so 2009.

744
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:08,940
Really?

745
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,600
Yeah.

746
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,560
They were way ahead of their,

747
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,280
they were like 15.

748
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,320
That's how old people

749
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,700
try to look young now.

750
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,480
Yeah.

751
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,220
They get body piercings.

752
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,000
I hate that.

753
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,300
I hate to see a man like

754
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,240
about 72 years of age

755
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,920
with his body

756
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,640
like the illustrated,

757
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,280
man,

758
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,000
just covered with tattoos

759
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,700
and he's showing them off

760
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,720
on a porch

761
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,820
while he's drinking a beer,

762
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,160
you know?

763
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,580
Well, it's cool if he got them

764
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,440
when he was 30 years old

765
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,940
in prison or in the Navy,

766
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,660
but if he went to the mall

767
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,600
and just got them

768
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
so he'd be in

769
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,320
with the in crowd,

770
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,540
it's like when sportscasters

771
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,140
in the early 70s

772
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,780
started having long hair.

773
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,540
Yeah.

774
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,700
You know, longish,

775
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,680
styled, hippie.

776
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,640
It was like hippie hair,

777
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,320
but the kind you pay for.

778
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,140
Yeah, like what they used to do

779
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,000
with their nasal hair.

780
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,600
Make them look like

781
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,820
a little mustache and stuff,

782
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,060
but not quite, you know,

783
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,320
not quite a Hitler mustache.

784
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,520
You wouldn't want to stand

785
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,560
on that side of the fence

786
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,420
because the chickens

787
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,260
are over there.

788
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,480
A gentleman of age like us

789
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,180
should, besides calling

790
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,360
the station and pledging it,

791
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,180
I figure a feller should

792
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,060
wear his hair like he wanted to

793
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,980
in high school,

794
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,760
but they wouldn't let him,

795
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,300
which is why you and Dr. Howell

796
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,400
wear those ducktail

797
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,380
juvenile delinquent hairdos

798
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,480
and I have that

799
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,680
Grateful Dead bass player hairdo.

800
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,440
That could be the reason,

801
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,280
but I don't know if the

802
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,180
data set you're working with

803
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,520
could be called

804
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,380
totally reliable.

805
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,720
Some people have claimed

806
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,640
that the reasons why

807
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,760
our heads are all different

808
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,140
is because the magnetosphere

809
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,740
and the different vibrations

810
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,840
of our scouts

811
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,480
and the different noises

812
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,200
that they make

813
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,460
in the middle of the night.

814
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,560
To quote a dead guy,

815
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,140
my new forehead is great.

816
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,820
You can hardly hear the buzzing.

817
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,080
Get this, friends,

818
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,980
for $20,

819
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,520
you get two subgenius

820
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,300
XX rated shows.

821
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,700
Now these aren't

822
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,160
like one big track.

823
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,480
These are CDs

824
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,800
with like 30 to 50

825
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,820
separate tracks.

826
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:02,940
So you can play

827
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,260
just Sarah Palin

828
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,120
peep juice,

829
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:06,960
for instance,

830
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,460
by Rudy Schwartz Project

831
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,180
and so forth.

832
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,240
But you can also get

833
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,800
CDs,

834
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,360
and I'm just going to read off

835
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,260
the names.

836
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,160
There's a zillion CDs

837
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,000
here,

838
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,980
but I'm going to read off

839
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,060
the names of the bands

840
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:21,980
that I know.

841
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,920
And just that alone

842
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,920
will be big,

843
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,480
big,

844
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,920
big deal for me.

845
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,580
Like, for instance,

846
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,660
Negative Land,

847
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,460
a big 10-8 place.

848
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,060
One of,

849
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,660
a truly classic

850
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,400
album of collage editing.

851
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,980
Just astounding.

852
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,840
They were the

853
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,860
maestros of the art.

854
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,940
They were the originators

855
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,700
of the form that,

856
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,700
not the originators,

857
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,520
the form which goes

858
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,060
all the way back,

859
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,600
never mind.

860
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,540
But yes.

861
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,580
Yeah, they're very influential

862
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,080
and they played,

863
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,960
they played,

864
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:51,960


865
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:51,960


866
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:51,960


867
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:51,960


868
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:51,960


869
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:51,960


870
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:51,960


871
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:51,960


872
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:51,960


873
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,940
their second live gig

874
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,100
was opening for

875
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,380
Church of the Subgenius

876
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,680
the night Bob was shot

877
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,520
in 1984.

878
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,420
And Mark Hosler

879
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,700
handed me that album,

880
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,720
the LP,

881
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,260
and he said,

882
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
I wish I could show you

883
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,100
the reel-to-reel master

884
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,740
of this.

885
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,700
He says it was

886
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,700
edited with splicing tape

887
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,080
and he goes,

888
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,880
in some places,

889
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,160
the splicing tape

890
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,160
is up to five layers deep.

891
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,900
So the master

892
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,640
has a very weird look to it.

893
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,600
There's a CD available

894
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,540
for your $20 pledge

895
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,500
of,

896
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,140
by Zero Defects,

897
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,960
who played it last X-Day.

898
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,440
The Billy Nair Show album,

899
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,860
American Astronaut,

900
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,380
they also played it X-Day

901
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,340
a few years ago.

902
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,280
Poopy Necropondy,

903
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,580
his CD,

904
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,880
We're All Going to Tax You,

905
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,380
we see him every year

906
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,500
at the devotional.

907
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,300
GWAR,

908
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,140
GWAR's album,

909
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,080
Beyond Hell.

910
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,660
Didn't the GWAR just,

911
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,900
did the GWAR just die?

912
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,360
Yeah, the guitar player,

913
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,940
who was not the guitar player

914
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,520
I knew,

915
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,880
Flatus Maximus,

916
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,560
the latest.

917
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:54,880
You know,

918
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,140
there's been so many beefcakes

919
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,020
and so many Flatus Maximuses.

920
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,800
The subgenius was the one

921
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,500
named the Sexecutioner.

922
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,880
I actually opened for GWAR

923
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,340
very,

924
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,000
for like five shows

925
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,240
before they,

926
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,200
we all realized that

927
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,940
GWAR fans weren't into

928
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,780
spoken word,

929
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,660
no matter how sexy.

930
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,140
They were just plain mean.

931
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,160
Yeah, yeah.

932
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,360
They wanted to see

933
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,880
Fly Menstra, High Menstrus,

934
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,480
and her enormous opening,

935
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,420
shoot out a baby

936
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,400
and dump stage blood on them.

937
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:24,660
I don't blame them.

938
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,040
You did not want somebody saying

939
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,080
what you were saying.

940
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,820
Praise Bob.

941
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,840
No, I had to change.

942
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,880
What in the hell

943
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,200
do you think you're doing?

944
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,240
But we parted friends.

945
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,060
Odorous couldn't believe

946
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,400
we weren't going to sue him.

947
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,060
He goes,

948
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,820
but everybody that we kick off

949
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,980
of our tour sues us.

950
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:41,880
And we went,

951
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,280
you're not kicking us off.

952
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,520
We're leaving.

953
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,880
We can't handle this.

954
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,560
This is too much stress.

955
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,480
We didn't have that.

956
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,580
We're not kicking off

957
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:52,740
this tour sues us.

958
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,660
We're not kicking off

959
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:53,660


960
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:53,660


961
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:53,660


962
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,260
I was actually getting paid

963
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,220
more than he was.

964
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,240
And he had to wear

965
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,140
that heavy outfit

966
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,180
for two hours.

967
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,760
Oh, Kirkendall Void,

968
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,420
Cleveland local band.

969
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,120
Their CD, Graveyard of Go-Go.

970
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,480
I've tried to get them at X Day.

971
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,960
The Homo Stupids.

972
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,660
I don't know them,

973
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,600
but I love the name.

974
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,860
Grateful Dead.

975
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,820
I've heard of them.

976
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,140
KMFDM.

977
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,880
I've heard of them.

978
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:20,900
Neurosis.

979
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,800
Was on that GWAR tour.

980
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,200
Willie Nelson,

981
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,240
I've heard of.

982
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,420
Nucleon,

983
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,220
a local band that I saw.

984
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,900
And that's all the,

985
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,240
out of the list of,

986
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,680
I swear there must be

987
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,480
a thousand CDs

988
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,460
you can get for your,

989
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,460
one for your 20 buck pledge.

990
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,560
And I didn't,

991
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,600
I don't recognize

992
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,040
any of those band names

993
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,920
because I'm old.

994
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:42,880
However,

995
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,040
I should mention the music

996
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,180
in the background tonight

997
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,440
because I'm going to have

998
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,460
to cut this all up

999
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,620
for other stations.

1000
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,020
I'm playing this weird,

1001
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,140
avant-garde compositions

1002
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,420
by Halim El-Dab.

1003
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:56,800
Oh.

1004
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,140
This is all,

1005
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,840
all from his album

1006
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,360
Musical Compositions

1007
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,160
Through the Year,

1008
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,540
which started with one

1009
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,600
from 2006,

1010
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,380
but let's see,

1011
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,180
where are we at now?

1012
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,360
Track three.

1013
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,820
This is The Quest,

1014
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,000
also 2006,

1015
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,900
but a lot of these

1016
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,400
are from like the 40s.

1017
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,940
1973,

1018
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,280
1961,

1019
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,340
1952.

1020
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,120
Well,

1021
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:21,400
Halim,

1022
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,340
Halim is about 95 years old.

1023
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,640
He's a personal friend.

1024
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,580
I can't say he's a close

1025
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,380
personal friend,

1026
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,320
unfortunately,

1027
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,200
because I don't know him

1028
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,640
that well,

1029
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,320
but I see him a couple of times

1030
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,620
a year at Starwood

1031
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,200
and other places

1032
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,960
and he's a professor

1033
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,720
at Kent State

1034
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,840
and a composer.

1035
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,040
And he's an extremely hip cat.

1036
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,700
He is the hippest cat.

1037
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,780
He's like my hero

1038
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,240
in terms of just having a life.

1039
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,060
If I can be as spry

1040
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,380
as I can be,

1041
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:51,380


1042
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,900
and good vibe projecting

1043
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,780
as Halim El-Dab.

1044
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,160
Still playing drums.

1045
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,260
Well, I'll never do that.

1046
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,440
But if I can still,

1047
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,660
I'll still be,

1048
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,680
they'll still be hauling me out on stage.

1049
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,140
And I'll go,

1050
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,520
repent,

1051
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,300
quit your job,

1052
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,280
slack off.

1053
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,740
While you still remember how to.

1054
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,100
While you still remember the words.

1055
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,680
Mark my words.

1056
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,060
Okay, let's see.

1057
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,180
What else can we hit them up with?

1058
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,020
Before I play music.

1059
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,280
Sounds Bernard Harmon-ish

1060
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,040
now in the background.

1061
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,000
It sounds all kinds of ways.

1062
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,300
Halim has,

1063
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,200
he can do anything.

1064
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,260
He can do a flabby prelude

1065
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,580
by A12 as a dunder.

1066
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,200
Yeah, he's a real composer.

1067
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,060
He doesn't just like,

1068
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,880
he doesn't do it like we do.

1069
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,300
Yeah.

1070
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,640
He writes it all down.

1071
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,120
with the chef

1072
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,220
until he attacks us

1073
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,120
with a meat cleaver.

1074
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,040
Friends, for your $25,

1075
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,560
$25 pledge,

1076
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,060
you get three triple X subgenius shows

1077
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,080
and a Bob Bumper sticker.

1078
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,040
You could get the X-Men Origins book.

1079
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:58,860
Wow.

1080
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,340
Many subgeniuses are X people,

1081
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,000
X-day people,

1082
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,040
and also X-humans,

1083
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,240
X-intelligence,

1084
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,860
X-geniuses,

1085
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
X-ists,

1086
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,680
existentialists.

1087
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,300
And look at,

1088
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
oh, why look,

1089
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,360
speaking of existentialists

1090
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,220
and so forth,

1091
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,080
here's some of our pledgers.

1092
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,260
The great Reverend Rock Roswell

1093
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,100
pledged,

1094
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,980
and he's getting the VHS tapes

1095
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,740
of Evolution,

1096
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,880
which is actually kind of a cute movie,

1097
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,920
and Things to Come,

1098
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,100
which is a classic movie.

1099
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,700
Dr. Dark,

1100
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,760
who shows movies at X-Day,

1101
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,140
he's getting him

1102
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,060
the Georgetown restaurant certificate.

1103
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,120
So what an odd amount he donated.

1104
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,680
Wow.

1105
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,940
Oh, I get it.

1106
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,500
Five, six, seven, eight.

1107
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,720
$5,678.

1108
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,200
No, not really, friends.

1109
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,520
Here's, here's,

1110
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,020
that's it.

1111
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,420
And Little,

1112
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,840
no, Elton Lytle,

1113
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,700
or Lytle.

1114
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,720
Lytle?

1115
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,640
Or, yeah.

1116
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,440
Elton Lytler?

1117
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,500
Elton Lytle.

1118
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,720
Or Lytley, I suppose it could be.

1119
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,500
Little Lytley Elton.

1120
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,860
I suppose.

1121
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,980
Maybe he's wearing a fancy outfit.

1122
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,100
No, it is,

1123
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,820
for his,

1124
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,400
for his,

1125
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,780
$25 pledge,

1126
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,640
he's getting the,

1127
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,900
the X-rated Hours of Slack

1128
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,840
and the 35th anniversary

1129
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,880
of WCSB t-shirt.

1130
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,940
This station has been around

1131
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,660
for 35 years.

1132
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,820
The Hour of Slack

1133
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,620
has been on it

1134
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,360
for probably almost 25

1135
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,520
of those years.

1136
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,820
But not quite that,

1137
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,900
more like 20, I guess.

1138
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,800
And you've been around here since,

1139
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,860
I mean, when did you

1140
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,800
and Chaz

1141
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,340
and Path,

1142
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,480
Psychopath find you?

1143
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:49,860
Understar.

1144
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,440
Chaz and I were making noises

1145
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,480
in 1980s.

1146
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,080
Right.

1147
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:55,460
Six.

1148
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,780
And then Psychopath

1149
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,440
Render came up in 1987.

1150
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:00,600
Man.

1151
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,860
I guess that means I'm 143 years old.

1152
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,120
But I just think of a wonderful place

1153
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,840
like WCSB that harbors and shelters old,

1154
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,480
you know, lunatics and crazy people

1155
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,280
that wouldn't have any other place to go.

1156
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,020
And why we can think of it,

1157
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,080
say, like a political movement, perhaps.

1158
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,220
Like, like Occupy Wall Street would be like,

1159
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,460
Occupy your wall street.

1160
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:19,680
Occupy your mind.

1161
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,640
How do you want to occupy your mind

1162
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,080
with quality stuff

1163
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,380
that challenges your mind

1164
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,100
or the banal drivel

1165
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,180
that you're exposed to?

1166
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,780
Let the hour of Slack

1167
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,340
occupy your mind.

1168
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,900
Dave, we got some inspiring letters

1169
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,680
from people.

1170
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,980
Remember when we had our

1171
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,840
secret pledge drive

1172
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,000
that we couldn't talk about

1173
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
on the public radio,

1174
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,900
but only on the internet radio?

1175
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,820
Mm-hmm.

1176
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,660
I got some letters

1177
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,480
of people who had never,

1178
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,000
you know,

1179
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,380
they didn't want to say

1180
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,200
how much they liked us

1181
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,800
because they figured people

1182
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,560
were kissing our butts all the time

1183
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,900
and constantly throwing money at us,

1184
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,820
which turned,

1185
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,640
I had to finally admit,

1186
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,300
wasn't actually true.

1187
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:02,920
Yeah.

1188
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,640
But this,

1189
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,940
here's a person

1190
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,380
who says,

1191
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,780
I don't know what else to say

1192
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,860
other than to tell you

1193
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,420
that I think you are a hero.

1194
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,960
Only a hero like you

1195
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,480
could take the absolute drudgery of life,

1196
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,600
which these days

1197
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,400
has become pretty unbearable.

1198
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,320
For the regular work-a-day Morlock

1199
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,280
and turn it into comedy.

1200
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,420
You look at the oblivion

1201
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,000
and doom of modern living

1202
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,820
and you laugh in the face

1203
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,940
of its futility

1204
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,720
while most of us only live

1205
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,700
as closet rebels,

1206
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,940
living our lives

1207
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,780
of quiet desperation

1208
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,740
to the sounds of laugh tracks

1209
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,220
or American Idol.

1210
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,860
Most of us line up

1211
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,140
and take what we're given,

1212
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,140
but you are someone

1213
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,160
who stood up

1214
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,880
and then did something original

1215
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,420
and amazing.

1216
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,920
You made a whole religion

1217
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,340
out of the subconscious anger

1218
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,140
many of us feel

1219
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,160
when faced with the reality

1220
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,020
of everyday life.

1221
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,920
For that, you're my hero.

1222
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,360
Oh, he's talking to Bob,

1223
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,120
not me.

1224
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,560
No, he's talking to you

1225
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,980
and that's why I'd like to use that

1226
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,560
in my resume

1227
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,480
and I can't.

1228
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,100
That's disgusting.

1229
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:01,920
I mean, it's beautiful.

1230
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,460
You can.

1231
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,240
Go ahead and do it.

1232
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,860
And he also taped a penny.

1233
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,420
But I didn't invent the religion.

1234
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:05,840
You did.

1235
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:06,960
I mean, Bob did.

1236
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,180
The letter I'm holding

1237
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,900
has a penny taped to it.

1238
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,240
I'm going to pull it off

1239
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,140
and I'm going to donate that

1240
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,380
to WCSB right now.

1241
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,080
There it is.

1242
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,800
There's another penny.

1243
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,680
Six cents now.

1244
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,500
Amen and hallelujah.

1245
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,300
Praise Bob.

1246
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,060
Now, here's a...

1247
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,080
Another penny in the coffer.

1248
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,020
Another tithing gone down.

1249
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

1250
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,600
it's time to give, give, give.

1251
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,120
Empty your wallets freely.

1252
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,500
Pull them out of your pants.

1253
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,460
No, not that.

1254
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,080
Stand back.

1255
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,740
Get away from me.

1256
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,780
Let me find one that mentions...

1257
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,160
Oh, here's one that mentions you, Dave.

1258
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:35,940
You'll like this one.

1259
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,200
This is from Reverend Hoosier Dada.

1260
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,080
Although you are a younger man than I,

1261
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,280
even the venerable Dr. Howell

1262
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,520
is not older than I.

1263
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,920
Lonesome cowboy Dave,

1264
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,840
who can say?

1265
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,320
Certainly not your child bride, we.

1266
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,560
Your grasp of the heritage of my youth,

1267
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,140
Forrest J. Ackerman et al.,

1268
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,960
interbred with the shape of things to come.

1269
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,060
There's things to come again.

1270
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,960
Jonathan Colton et al.,

1271
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,020
as a mainstay of my internal life.

1272
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,460
You are the ringmaster of a weekly circus

1273
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,080
with acts which are beyond legal.

1274
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,280
I mean, beyond anything

1275
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,140
I would have thought to seek out,

1276
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,420
let alone find.

1277
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,060
Thank you for bringing the collages

1278
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,760
and songs together under one tent.

1279
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,140
Listening to you and Dave and Howell and we

1280
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,200
note the alphabetization to avoid a hierarchy.

1281
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,120
Yeah, he was already formatted in

1282
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,140
when he didn't, you know,

1283
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:32,900
and he forgot to...

1284
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,480
Oh, brave new world that has such people in it.

1285
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,920
People, yeah, people, sure.

1286
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,720
But this.

1287
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,000
By this time, you've either received

1288
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,160
the woefully inadequate love offering

1289
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,900
I sent to the heights of Cleveland

1290
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,000
on Friday last,

1291
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,040
or some unseemly,

1292
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,840
unseen hand has claimed it for its master.

1293
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,100
But as the Joker has taught me,

1294
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,600
any attempt to control things is pathetic.

1295
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,240
So I can only surf the luck plane,

1296
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,640
enjoy the ride,

1297
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,480
and hope your own red light

1298
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,480
claimed the cash as intended.

1299
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,880
Want to know how I got these scars?

1300
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,020
It will be beyond sad

1301
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,880
when the last hour of slack fades into silence.

1302
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,240
But let us not dwell on the coming darkness.

1303
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,280
To paraphrase John Carter of Mars,

1304
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,420
we will live.

1305
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,240
Man.

1306
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,240
And this person married his own son

1307
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,860
and daughter-in-law last year

1308
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,540
and is within days of being a grandpa.

1309
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,720
He married both...

1310
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,180
He married his own son.

1311
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,800
How can you marry your own...

1312
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,740
I mean...

1313
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,200
I know, I know, that's sick.

1314
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,700
Let's see.

1315
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,200
They don't like to hang around that much

1316
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,060
to begin with.

1317
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,220
Here's someone who misunderstands.

1318
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,480
You put so much work into it.

1319
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,160
The sound collages you make,

1320
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:48,380
like...

1321
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,640
See, that's why I give the credits.

1322
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,820
Most of those collages are made by other people.

1323
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,640
I collage the whole show together.

1324
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,740
But that's only 30 pieces,

1325
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,120
not 30 million pieces

1326
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,680
like Susie the Flusie collage.

1327
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,880
Well, you are like...

1328
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,260
What's his name?

1329
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,660
The excellent corp of the French bulldog.

1330
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,420
That's of the late 1930s.

1331
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,060
Yeah, I know. Old-fashioned.

1332
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,340
No, no.

1333
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,100
You know what it is

1334
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,160
to be a BS-er

1335
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:17,840
and a dada.

1336
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,080
In short, I love Bob.

1337
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,340
He says we do humor.

1338
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,160
The underground music is always fun.

1339
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,100
Your wit and humor

1340
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,820
is tip-top to the point

1341
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,100
I repeat it a lot to friends.

1342
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:31,740
Wow.

1343
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,660
In a near-bit-hack way.

1344
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,100
I love Bob and the church.

1345
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,260
Being a member is fun

1346
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,960
as I confuse many pinks with my ramblings.

1347
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,680
Yet always the best

1348
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,420
is to listen to the subgenius radio shows.

1349
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,360
Keep it going, brother.

1350
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,500
My donation is $6.66.

1351
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,140
To start.

1352
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,280
Unfortunately, that wasn't hundreds of dollars.

1353
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,040
I want you to mention this on the air

1354
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,200
in a challenge

1355
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,580
for every church member to match it.

1356
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,960
Match that $6.66.

1357
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,580
It's under my slave human name of...

1358
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,100
Please use my title under Bob

1359
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,440
of Emperor Pope Wagner XVII

1360
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,940
in your possible shout-out to me.

1361
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,400
And there it was.

1362
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,420
That was the shout-out.

1363
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,000
Wow.

1364
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,860
Well, I think then that should be

1365
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,080
what we should ask.

1366
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,180
Everybody out there

1367
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,680
in the Burg of Clee,

1368
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,640
in the land of Clee,

1369
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,060
is to come up with 666.

1370
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,180
And if we could get perhaps

1371
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,080
666 people

1372
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,040
to pledge $6.66

1373
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,940
or $66.06

1374
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,060
to the WCSB.

1375
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,720
That's the SDSC.

1376
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,080
6900, by the way,

1377
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,300
if you'd like to start right now

1378
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,740
before anything happens.

1379
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,180
Because time has a way

1380
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,960
of making things quicken.

1381
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,040
As things are imminent right now,

1382
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,500
the entire, not only this station,

1383
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,420
but the whole east side of town

1384
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,180
could explode or be vaporized

1385
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,060
just like that.

1386
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:55,640
Right.

1387
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,400
And we wouldn't need...

1388
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,020
Well, never mind.

1389
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,580
You never know when this will be

1390
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,920
the last hour of slack you'd ever hear.

1391
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,500
And it'll be because of...

1392
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,140
Or the other great shows on this station.

1393
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:05,960
Yeah, the last time you listen

1394
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,080
to African Abstract or Synesthesia

1395
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,760
or it just goes on.

1396
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,960
The Charleston show is...

1397
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,580
I'm looking through the window.

1398
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,820
Synesthesia is...

1399
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,660
They're all famous.

1400
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,980
Princess, we sit in there

1401
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,000
reading Anathem.

1402
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,880
And what's Dr. Sinister doing?

1403
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,920
Oh, he's playing pocket pool.

1404
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,140
That's what they always do.

1405
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:23,600
Yep.

1406
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,040
Waiting for a phone call.

1407
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,280
Friends, damn it.

1408
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,060
Now, if you folks ain't gonna call in,

1409
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:28,660
I'm just...

1410
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,020
I'm not gonna put up with it.

1411
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,280
They don't cut no ice with me.

1412
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,340
Oh, Dr. Sinister did just get a call.

1413
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,880
He did get a call.

1414
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,920
Have we got six calls?

1415
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,220
He's playing pocket pool

1416
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,560
while taking a call.

1417
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,280
Oh, and Princess,

1418
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,500
we just grabbed the phone.

1419
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,900
So it's...

1420
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,900
But there's...

1421
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,920
Now, I want the kids...

1422
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:46,980
The power of my brain.

1423
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:46,980


1424
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:46,980


1425
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:46,980


1426
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,600
Get them phone lines going.

1427
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,560
They can hear me all the way

1428
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,600
to the back of the amphitheater.

1429
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,700
They knew that Carthage

1430
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,660
must be burned.

1431
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,220
And that means that

1432
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,500
it must pledge now.

1433
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,760
Friends, I've had it.

1434
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,220
I'm gonna...

1435
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,300
I'm so...

1436
00:42:59,300 --> 00:42:59,920
I'm...

1437
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,660
I'm driven to play

1438
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,000
a song we played

1439
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
just two weeks ago.

1440
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,880
You'll love it, though.

1441
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,320
It's beautiful.

1442
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,920
It is beautiful.

1443
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,040
I'm going to play this song

1444
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,300
called Feed the Stangs.

1445
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,980
It was written by Pope...

1446
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,520
and sung by

1447
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,980
Popes Pontiera Evacuator.

1448
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,540
Who is seen

1449
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,300
topless in that YouTube movie

1450
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,620
I discussed earlier

1451
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:23,840
before you called in, Dave.

1452
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,420
That doesn't mean that

1453
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,640
she's exposing her breasts.

1454
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,500
That means that

1455
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,060
the top of her body is gone.

1456
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,180
Well, it's...

1457
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,500
You know, actually, Dave,

1458
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,520
yesterday I spent

1459
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,920
hours putting little black bars

1460
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,820
over

1461
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,000
breastages and peni

1462
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,160
of subgeniuses

1463
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,180
at X Day.

1464
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,080
Movies.

1465
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,500
The pictures of them.

1466
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,760
Okay, but you were

1467
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,580
continuing that you were

1468
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,620
doing that a long time

1469
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,760
meant that there was a lot

1470
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,060
to cover up, so to speak.

1471
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:52,540
There was.

1472
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,800
And you can see that

1473
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,500
on YouTube

1474
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,640
slash RevStang

1475
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,420
14X Day

1476
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,840
in 11.5 minutes.

1477
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,620
But I'm gonna play

1478
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,460
this song here, Dave.

1479
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,120
I'm gonna pot you and me down,

1480
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:04,560
okay?

1481
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,400
I love this song.

1482
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,300
And we're gonna play this.

1483
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,640
And also, the orchestration

1484
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,360
on this is by Reverend Sud Shaw.

1485
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,500
Feed the Stangs.

1486
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,040
Each day to a mysterious stage

1487
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:24,880
The little old Ivan Stang tries

1488
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,260
In his own special way

1489
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:33,480
To the Yeti he calls

1490
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,980
Come by my table of swag

1491
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,980
Come feed my little wife

1492
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,940
Show her you care

1493
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:52,820
And you'll be glad if you do

1494
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,140
My grandkids are hungry

1495
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,120
Our house is so bare

1496
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,740
All it takes is money

1497
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,600
From you

1498
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,960
Feed the Stangs

1499
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,760
Money for swag

1500
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:25,440
Money, money, money for swag

1501
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,260
Feed the Stangs

1502
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,380
That's what he cries

1503
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,660
Warm overhead

1504
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:39,460
Space ships fill the skies

1505
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:44,480
In Wisteria, campground Bob dies

1506
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:44,940
In the dark, the sun is shining

1507
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:44,940


1508
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:44,940


1509
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,300
He hopes in his midlands

1510
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:50,060
Look down at the Yeti hide

1511
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:55,420
And though you can't see it

1512
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,040
You know that he's smiling

1513
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,480
Each time that you give

1514
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,420
Thirty-five

1515
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,320
No, his words are simple

1516
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,940
And few

1517
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,900
Listen, listen

1518
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,440
He's calling to you

1519
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,700
Feed the Stangs

1520
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,340
Money for swag

1521
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:39,440
Money, money, money for swag

1522
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,300
What the hell do you think this is?

1523
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:43,760
You're a little woman

1524
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,400
Dragging your butt through the day

1525
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,360
Time for the hit and all of the guilt

1526
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,780
But none of the sex

1527
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:56,240
There is a simple answer, dear friend

1528
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,700
A glowing beacon of slack

1529
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,120
Amidst the turmoil that lurks

1530
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,300
It's J.O. Bob Dawgs

1531
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,240
And his mighty Church of the Subgenius

1532
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:13,280
No, his words are simple

1533
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,420
And few

1534
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:19,780
Listen, listen

1535
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:23,420
He's calling to you

1536
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,840
Feed the Stangs

1537
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,200
Money for swag

1538
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:43,260
Money, money, money for swag

1539
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:43,260


1540
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:43,260


1541
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,120
Money for swag

1542
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,360
Repent, quit your job

1543
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,700
Slack off and praise Bob!

1544
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,220
Got anything?

1545
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,500
Nah.

1546
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,980
Laying down, eh?

1547
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,300
Did you get anything?

1548
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:09,860
No.

1549
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,260
Oh, slacker.

1550
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,080
Wait a minute.

1551
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,240
Did you get anything?

1552
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:16,640
Yeah, did you?

1553
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,400
No.

1554
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,860
Does that make any difference?

1555
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,040
I guess it's come around.

1556
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,020
Bob, and some of you are saying, who's Bob?

1557
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:24,620
Well, you'll learn.

1558
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,380
But I want to talk to Bob about some stuff.

1559
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,420
1845-59-0338.

1560
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,140
Can you imagine the checks Bob gets?

1561
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:33,260
I got a name.

1562
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,880
Here's another check.

1563
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:40,520
They're going to open up the gates to the great Bob that I'm entitled to.

1564
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,600
Who I think is a myth that I'm entitled to.

1565
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,340
And I think it's guys like Bob.

1566
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,140
Because, I mean, Bob works.

1567
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,240
Actually, Bob slacks off and we work.

1568
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:51,940
Mostly.

1569
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:53,560
Sort of.

1570
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,840
Parts of us work.

1571
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,540
Some parts just sort of work and leak a bit.

1572
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,560
Some parts are even, yes, they're leaking.

1573
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,140
Reverend Decapitator did that last little Bob works thing.

1574
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,080
It was very lovely.

1575
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,900
When we get off the air of puzzling evidence,

1576
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,300
famous ancient.

1577
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,600
Collage will play.

1578
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:17,040
But there's somebody listening from Korea right now.

1579
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:17,880
It says.

1580
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:21,420
They can send us their Korean dollars.

1581
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,820
Or yuan or whatever they're called.

1582
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,300
I forgot.

1583
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,920
The Korean person just donated.

1584
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,060
Wow, that's beautiful.

1585
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:29,720
And here's the Reverend.

1586
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,700
Oh, that's Bishop Stick.

1587
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:40,500
Bishop Stick is playing on the 14X day in 11.5 minutes.

1588
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,620
Video that I just put on YouTube.

1589
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,240
And Princess Wee and Priestess Pisces are singing on that.

1590
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,700
But that's not what's happening in the background right now.

1591
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:56,080
No, in the background, it's still Halim El-Dab jamming away.

1592
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,680
That's in the audio background.

1593
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:03,860
But in the visual background, there are a few elves dancing around the little fire they've created right in the middle of the studio.

1594
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,740
As a form of television for the blind.

1595
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,660
That's another thing you're not supposed to say.

1596
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,120
Because the fire department.

1597
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:10,420
Okay.

1598
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,200
Well, the fire department.

1599
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,240
Actually, the fire department was here a little while ago.

1600
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,080
Yeah, they were the actual artists.

1601
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,260
No, they came in to donate.

1602
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,380
Put their fire hats out and their boots on.

1603
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,420
Now, even if you hear this on the internet, you can go to WCSB.org.

1604
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:31,740
And that's the only way you can pay with a credit card or PayPal.

1605
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,360
Because the callers here can't tell Princess Wee.

1606
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,360
Just went to get another call.

1607
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,280
The callers here can't.

1608
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,120
We can't take credit cards.

1609
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,540
At the station.

1610
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:46,560
Except by web at WCSB.org.

1611
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:52,300
And for those on the web who are perhaps in a distant land, or maybe just another state,

1612
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:55,320
they can remember that the area code is 216.

1613
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,460
But see, I have to cut these for...

1614
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,820
I'll still run, even though it's like a pledge drive for this specific station,

1615
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:07,020
I'm still going to chop it up and send it to other stations.

1616
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,680
Because most of them have pledge drives too.

1617
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,120
And even if they don't, I don't care.

1618
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:16,140
I don't care whether it's efficient or makes any sense.

1619
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,060
It's what religions do.

1620
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,360
I called Pappy on the way up to the station.

1621
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,380
He said, that's the way most ecclesiastical people work.

1622
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,660
They guilt trip you into giving money.

1623
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:29,700
That's it.

1624
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:35,200
See, from those older folks, we get all of our erstwhile erudite beginnings,

1625
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:38,560
our somnolent little small animals.

1626
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,200
That we...

1627
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:39,660
You...

1628
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:39,660


1629
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,060
Well, especially...

1630
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,060
That sometimes we have to carry all the way over the...

1631
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,440
But that's where I get my ideas from, is from the elders of the tribe.

1632
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,480
When I can.

1633
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,440
Sometimes they just bother me and throw me out of the tippy.

1634
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,500
I'm descended from at least five preachers.

1635
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,600
And all of them were heretics on some level or another.

1636
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,400
Pappy...

1637
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,280
In fact, Pappy's not a preacher.

1638
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,940
He was a lawyer, which is bad.

1639
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,640
But he preaches nonetheless.

1640
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,980
He preaches doubt.

1641
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,080
He's a Methodist church in Stanksville, in Stanks County, Texas.

1642
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:14,800
So...

1643
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,200
And he truly does.

1644
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,580
He must be very, very, very, very sad.

1645
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,600
No, that's the wrong word.

1646
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,320
Forget it.

1647
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:26,580
I was going to provide some descriptive color, and I just...

1648
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,000
Never mind.

1649
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:32,060
And that's why to fulfill yourself in at least the smallest way you can as a human being,

1650
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:37,460
because we live and die, is to send your pledge to...

1651
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,540
Well, this number is the number to call.

1652
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,280
To make a pledge.

1653
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,980
687-99-6.

1654
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:46,280
And you'll probably get a shot glass and a punch in the mouth from WCSB.

1655
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:51,880
And with that, I'm going to put back on...

1656
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,200
You know, I never used any of my old pledge drive all-purpose stuff.

1657
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,500
And I'm not going to.

1658
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,760
I'm just going to put on...

1659
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,220
I'm going to put you on, friends.

1660
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,460
I'm going to put on The Harvest by Puzzling Evidence.

1661
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,840
Dave, thank you for calling.

1662
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,620
It's now show overtime.

1663
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:14,020
And I hope you haven't stained your pants in your desire, your fervent desire,

1664
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,120
to wake those ruffians out there who just don't want to pledge.

1665
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:19,740
I'm sorry.

1666
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,540
We're all so terribly sorry.

1667
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,000
And now, Puzzling Evidence.

1668
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,340
But one doesn't listen wrong before a little warning signal goes off inside that says,

1669
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:30,920
Watch out.

1670
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,460
Sometimes it's hard to pinpoint the precise error.

1671
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:38,940
But the language, the pure language of heaven,

1672
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:40,040
is missing.

1673
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,440
Something says, look out.

1674
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,540
This guy is fishy.

1675
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:47,320
Cultist or someone with his theological wires crossed.

1676
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,780
It's almost like listening to someone who knows only a few words of English,

1677
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:54,320
but soon they're rattling off in a completely unknown language

1678
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:58,220
when they haven't even been to kindergarten spiritually.

1679
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,140
We eat more, drink more, play more,

1680
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:04,980
and do less to earn a good living than any other people in history.

1681
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,140
We have at our fingertips the world's greatest music.

1682
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:09,640
And I might...

1683
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,680
I might add a lot of its worst,

1684
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,940
else the cultists would have no following.

1685
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,280
We are a people grasping nervously,

1686
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:17,420
sometimes almost hysterically for more.

1687
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:21,180
I know that I know that I know that I know that I know

1688
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,600
that I know that I know.

1689
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,300
Whenever we read the obscene stories,

1690
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,940
the voluptuous debaucheries,

1691
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,820
the cruel and torturous executions,

1692
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,040
it would be more consistent to call it the word of a demon.

1693
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,500
There are little eyes upon you,

1694
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,760
and they're watching night and day.

1695
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:40,820
There are little eyes upon you,

1696
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:40,820


1697
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:40,820


1698
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:40,820


1699
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,380
With a vocal and activist minority

1700
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:47,080
ready apparently to burn a bomber's seal of kills for more.

1701
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:50,840
And most, incidentally, are in their teens or their twenties.

1702
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,780
And that's Washington people, I'll tell you that.

1703
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,460
They dwelled in caves, not high-rise apartments.

1704
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,240
They may not have found a key to affluence,

1705
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,520
but they found...

1706
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,540
an endless supply of dope,

1707
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,120
uninhibited sex,

1708
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,640
an endless supply of money,

1709
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,300
free access to a distillery, I suppose.

1710
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,620
Ah, yes, the harlot.

1711
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,940
You can count on that.

1712
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,140
Or kill for more.

1713
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:26,620
Why, friends, we could feed another nation with our garbage.

1714
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,400
What more than a space hogger on Earth?

1715
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,640
Is the church of geniuses?

1716
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:34,380
I don't know.

1717
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:38,220
But how many of you are really genuinely intelligent?

1718
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:39,620
Thanks.

1719
00:55:39,640 --> 00:56:09,620
Otherwise if you would believe,

1720
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:09,620


1721
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:09,620


1722
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:09,620


1723
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:09,620


1724
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:09,620


1725
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:09,620


1726
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:17,880
I mean, it is so ironic because some of these false preachers can raise millions and millions of dollars.

1727
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,840
No problem there.

1728
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,400
Well, I tell you what, I challenge you, Jim Swaggart.

1729
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,460
I challenge you, Jim Baker.

1730
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,500
I challenge you, Oral Roberts.

1731
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,180
You see this hand here?

1732
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,420
You see this hand in front of me, Mr. Jim Baker?

1733
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:35,640
This is called the claw, and it's got the power of dogs in it.

1734
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:41,260
And I challenge you to show your ugly face here at this radio station and come forward.

1735
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:42,040
Go ahead.

1736
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,160
Come forward with all your millions.

1737
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,580
I'm ready to have a match without rules.

1738
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:48,940
No rules at all.

1739
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,360
One will survive.

1740
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,200
One only.

1741
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:59,160
One minister will leave the match still breathing if one of you goody-goody preachers has the guts to show up.

1742
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,720
Ah, yes.

1743
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,040
I'm sitting here drinking some Texas Select beer.

1744
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:05,540
Fran.

1745
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:05,860
Beer!

1746
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,840
You hear that, Jimmy Swaggart?

1747
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:13,120
You don't drink beer, oh no, or smoke on froth because you don't know the power of these herbs.

1748
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,300
I challenge any minister do-gooder out there to show up.

1749
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:22,600
All of you, with all your TV shows and all your bought-off politicians, your paid-off judges.

1750
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:27,740
Do any trick you want, but I got the claw, I got the power of Bob and the power of Texas Select.

1751
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,800
And you, my friend listener, has the power to call.

1752
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,500
This station.

1753
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:31,640
This station.

1754
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:35,660
Do it.

1755
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,200
Do it.

1756
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:36,620
Do it.

1757
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,500
The times, the end times get closer and closer every minute.

1758
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:45,460
Imagine some guy or some gal driving around out there.

1759
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:50,320
They're tired of listening to the same old music on their conspiracy radio show.

1760
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,540
So they try switching channels and they come upon this.

1761
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:57,680
They hear these voices talking and they think, now what is this?

1762
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,300
A talk show?

1763
00:57:58,500 --> 00:57:59,460
A church show?

1764
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,020
A comedy?

1765
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,380
I mean, oh my God.

1766
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,380
Are these people serious?

1767
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,420
It's too developed to be a joke.

1768
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,060
Should I kill them?

1769
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:08,020
No, not that part of it.

1770
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:11,720
You know, the part where everybody, you know, liked each other and everybody had the same house

1771
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:17,280
and everybody thought the same things and everybody seemed to be on the same page except for the them.

1772
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,320
Whoever they might have been then, there's always been a them.

1773
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:27,340
And it dawned on me that these people are just so frightened that everybody is frightened.

1774
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,780
Everybody completely whack job church.

1775
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,140
I don't quite understand it.

1776
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:41,900
You know, once you get talking to Bob for a little while, he started, you know, dropping words like World War III, destroy the church, programmable priests.

1777
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,180
The world is going to end.

1778
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:43,960
The Federal Reserve.

1779
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,680
I mean, he was hitting all the buzz points and who's going to want to go to that church.

1780
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:54,480
And then he got sort of confused in the genetically designed Federal World War III and Iran reserve system diseases.

1781
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,900
But for some reason, I just let him keep talking.

1782
00:58:58,620 --> 00:59:01,280
Bob challenges people to be tolerant of change.

1783
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:08,680
And apocalyptic visions and challenges people to try to be accepting of a big fiery mess.

1784
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:21,360
If you're going to honor the idea of genetically designed nuclear democracy bombs flying everywhere by the big they that they distribute in order to kill off the three billion people that are necessary to balance out the population.

1785
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,360
Do you need to cry?

1786
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,440
You need to have a good cry, don't you?

1787
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:26,980
Why are you so afraid, little man?

1788
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:28,780
You know what?

1789
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,260
You know, Bob from the office.

1790
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,180
That guy.

1791
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,200
You eat lunch with every day.

1792
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,860
I just found out he's such a good guy.

1793
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,240
That's that's I can't even I don't even know what to do with that.

1794
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:43,160
But if you have a problem with Bob, then you have to learn how to be a big fiery mess.

1795
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,000
And that's that.

1796
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,160
Sire, there is no more money.

1797
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,640
We gotta get some money.

1798
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,920
That dirty Turkish harker back.

1799
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:52,720
Black and rotten.

1800
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,780
Philip Buckaburton.

1801
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:55,080
Perkaluma Burton.

1802
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,140
Don't you watch tonight.

1803
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,940
Oh, B.O.B.

1804
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,360
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1805
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:07,660
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1806
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:12,720
And not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1807
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:27,280
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you, you should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages.

1808
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:30,660
And help out financially as best you can.

1809
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:34,980
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty.

1810
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:38,640
And we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1811
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:41,580
But some of you still have jobs.

1812
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,880
Even five bucks makes a big difference.

1813
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:48,480
Even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1814
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,860
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1815
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:59,380
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay dogs.

1816
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,360
We also...

1817
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:05,160
We also take checks and money orders to Subgenius Foundation.

1818
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:17,640
P.O. Box 181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1819
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:22,860
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1820
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:47,820
Suspects described as outright compensation for several requests received by bar while receiving running-edge bâruts from the local Customs Office.

1822

01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:01,340


1828
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:01,800
Kill me!
