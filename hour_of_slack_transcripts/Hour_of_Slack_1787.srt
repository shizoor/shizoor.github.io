1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,420
Who's there?

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,240
The subgenius, the power of...

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,060
SWAG!

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,260
Now I know all about everything.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,320
What? Yeah, yeah, yep, yeah, yeah!

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,660
I named a man about a story by Stoomson Tilly Ted

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,160
Mermaid found a cub, his fur like a deer bound

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,620
And then some dad cute, he wish they won food

9
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:36,260
And Groob and Blubbubble come and grab the groom of two

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,240
Thank-ly-mer!

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,740
Oh yes dear friends, we're going to 23X Day

12
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,760
Right in our own homes!

13
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,960
And much of this episode is the first hour of the first day

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,540
Of the first X Day that was held entirely online

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,580
By teleconferencing

16
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,240
And it started this way

17
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,020
On July 5th, 1998, 7 AM

18
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,320
When we all have hangovers

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,300
Wotan's judgment will take place in the form of what the pre-scriptures call

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,260
The Advent of the Angelic Host

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,420
Like any other prophet, Bob preaches about the end of the world

22
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,200
Only his predictions are just a little different

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,260
July 5th, 1998

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,160
At 7 AM to be exact

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,040
The men from Planet X, as the news media will call them

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,040
Will arrive to rupture the subgeniuses

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,020
The true believer subgeniuses

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,680
Up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,940
And believe it or not, plenty of people

30
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,640
4,000 of them so far and more every day

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,800
Have already joined up

32
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,080
Suddenly the joke has become serious

33
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,380
And profitable

34
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,720
Your standard religious rip-off, right?

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,320
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?

36
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,620
Dear Bob, it's time to close my eyes

37
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,680
Remember now

38
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,960
It's no surprise

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,000
If I should be found dead someday

40
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,720
I'll think that you were in the way

41
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,480
Oh, gimme Bob

42
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,340
Confusing that face

43
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,460
With my own

44
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,940
Can't remember my place

45
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,700
Bob's role on this planet

46
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,680
High profit, little return

47
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,280
Is to see that the Earth is not sold

48
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,600
On that glorious or terrible day

49
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,500
We call X-Day in 1990

50
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,720
What year?

51
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,340
I didn't say what year it is

52
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,080
Oh no

53
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,080
Nineteen something

54
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,580
I haven't had my hearing aids on all day

55
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,180
So you forgot what he said?

56
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,020
Yeah, I actually

57
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,580
I'm gonna run get them in a second

58
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,520
They're nearby, next to my bed but

59
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,980
I had to go to the

60
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,960
Get a CAT scan this morning

61
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,580
In the next town over

62
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,180
And I got there

63
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,380
I realized I don't have my

64
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,120
Ear bones

65
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,060
And everybody's wearing masks

66
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,940
So everything sounds like

67
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,340
Vrrr, vrrr, vrrr, vrrr

68
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,360
That can be rather disconcerting

69
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,080
Yeah, I'm gonna go get my hearing aids

70
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,460
You guys

71
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,600
Reverend John Shirley has his hand up

72
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,320
Let me pull John in for you

73
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,520
So's Modemac

74
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,740
Actually, for all we know, everybody is

75
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,000
But this is the very first show

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,500
So we have to stick with that

77
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,680
We're professionals for the first twenty minutes

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,740
Oh, well, that's

79
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,180
That's

80
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,680
Man, I should

81
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,880
I should step back

82
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,940
Cause I'm

83
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,120
You're the only one who really knows what he's doing

84
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,640
Hey, John Shirley

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,760
Let me see if I can assist you here

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,320
He's down there

87
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,400
I asked him to start his video

88
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,200
There we go

89
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,840
And I'm going to ask him to unmute

90
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,660
It's funny to ask a mutant to unmute

91
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,200
Right

92
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,580
Unmute

93
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,160
I never thought of it that way

94
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,360
What you

95
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,420
Mutate can't

96
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,600
I can't unmute

97
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,880
I'm mutated

98
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,240
I'm unmutated

99
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,500
How am I gonna unmute?

100
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,820
Mutate can't

101
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,900
If you want that raise, son

102
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,060
You're gonna have to unmute

103
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,380
I tried, I tried

104
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,560
I really did, too, man

105
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:16,800
I

106
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,080
There was a period in my life

107
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,340
When I tried to unmute several times

108
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,940
Yeah, me too

109
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,540
When I was twelve

110
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,100
I burned all the comic books

111
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,980
That I had drawn in elementary school

112
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,800
To prove to myself that I wasn't gonna be a weirdo anymore

113
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Did it work?

114
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,380
One time I quit smoking pot

115
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,360
To prove I could quit smoking pot

116
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,380
And once that happened

117
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,880
I started smoking pot again

118
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,120
I proved I could do it

119
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,140
You know?

120
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,540
That was my only point

121
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,620
After a certain point, you know

122
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,100
You realize you can't unmute

123
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,360
And

124
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,080
But you can wear the masks of insanity

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,100
Which was Philo's way of saying

126
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,720
You have to act normal

127
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,720
Or you have to act like a dumb shit

128
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,980
There's also the asks of insanity

129
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,820
Where you just go up to people

130
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,620
And you ask them the question that

131
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,900
Will set them off

132
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,560
So then they can do all the talking and

133
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,420
They'll think you're a good listener

134
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,860
And you're real clever and sympathetic

135
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,900
That has worked for me

136
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,320
That would be insane

137
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,860
I've got standing invitations

138
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,960
To several famous people's houses

139
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,500
Because I listen to their wives

140
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,800
Without opening my mouth once for a whole hour

141
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,400
So that they didn't have to listen to her

142
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,760
Well, it was that the wife wasn't used to anybody

143
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,940
Listening

144
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,780
While they jabbered

145
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,420
And I didn't have anything better to do

146
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,080
I was trapped

147
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,540
I put these crystals on my PowerPoints

148
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,540
It's a messenger, hold on

149
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,620
I was going, where'd Motormat go?

150
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,520
And then I realized, oh, he's on the page

151
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,220
I wasn't expecting him to be

152
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:03,580
Phil's HR

153
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,140
Well, you can teach us how to cook

154
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,180
If it gets really boring

155
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,300
People can learn stuff on a seminar like this

156
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,280
What kind of things can they learn, Dr. Drummond?

157
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,620
There's one of those asks

158
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
There's a long tradition of the story of the

159
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,220
Straight man in a comedy troupe

160
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,780
But we're not limited to just the straight man

161
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,120
We can have a whole troupe of just straight men

162
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,500
Also hate men

163
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,360
It's good to have the straight man be

164
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,040
Just everyone on the street that you happen to encounter

165
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,560
That's your straight man

166
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,820
Or your boss

167
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,500
Or your boss

168
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,180
Your boss is actually the butt of your humor

169
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,180
Can you be a straight man if you're gay?

170
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,140
Reverend, there's a stigmata

171
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,140
Hi, Philo

172
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,140
Hi

173
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,040
Hi, Becky

174
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,080
Hi, Sting

175
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,840
Hey

176
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,840
We're Facebook friends

177
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,680
We are Facebook friends

178
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,460
Well, I don't have that many

179
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,300
I've only got about 200 or so friends

180
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,660
I'm real careful about that

181
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,180
I only will put on people that I either know face to face

182
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,660
Or maybe if I've known them for 25 years

183
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,400
Right

184
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,200
Oh, there's Hal

185
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,320
It's Hal

186
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,500
You have to be swimming in a canoe with him

187
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,980
Before you put him on there

188
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,040
Hal, here is the reverend

189
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,120
Hello, Hal

190
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,060
Dominique Stigmata

191
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,820
And there's

192
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,500
And that's raw eggplant to everyone

193
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,960
Raw eggplant?

194
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,580
Man, I feel special

195
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,340
Raw, says raw eggplant

196
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,700
And there's Hal with his

197
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,500
With his

198
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,320
With his sacred Ask Dr. Hal

199
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,580
Yes

200
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,280
Ascot

201
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,980
Fez

202
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,220
The Ascot Dr. Hal

203
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,560
It's a Fez

204
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,800
The Ascot

205
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,140
Fez of Dr. Hal

206
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,020
The Fez what says

207
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,440
You have your shoulder, Philo

208
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,880
Can you hear us, Dr. Hal?

209
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,320
Yes, how about me? Can you hear me?

210
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,440
We can hear you exquisitely

211
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,000
You sound wonderful

212
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,480
Well, opinions vary, but...

213
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,320
Well, it's funny how the blue screens work

214
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,040
They work fine for some of us

215
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,660
Philo is a floating head about half the time

216
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,940
Because he's a green shirt

217
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,720
You mean in life or do you mean on Zoom?

218
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,460
Both

219
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,980
John Shirley looks like the invisible man

220
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,540
About halfway through the process

221
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:40,300
With his paint wearing off

222
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,380
This is the secret

223
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,380
I'll show you

224
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,480
There, you see my green screen?

225
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,720
That's the secret

226
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,280
That's everything you need

227
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,080
Just a sheet

228
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,960
Any color really

229
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,220
Because you can match the color

230
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,440
I'm kind of liking my solarization effect

231
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,300
Even though I didn't intend it

232
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,780
I kind of like how it works

233
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,480
There's a lot of people

234
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,800
It's like a 1970s special effect

235
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,640
Since I have a green screen

236
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,440
I have a picture of what's behind it

237
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,160
On the green screen

238
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,860
Ah

239
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,800
Well, Onan has something like that too

240
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,160
I saw the picture of Onan's little special set yesterday

241
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,400
And Philo's just wearing his green screen

242
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,460
So his head ends up on these other characters' shoulders

243
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,580
He's on a statue right now

244
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,380
There we go

245
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,820
That's uncanny the way that works

246
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,300
Well, once again we're talking to the viewing audience

247
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,400
And not any kind of radio audience

248
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,660
So screw you radio listeners

249
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,200
You can't see any of this green screen stuff

250
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,360
That's what you get for not spending your 35 bucks

251
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,420
And joining the church

252
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,240
You're missing out on the mind-breaking special effects

253
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,180
Well, the other thing they're thinking is

254
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,380
Well, I don't hear any ladies' voices

255
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,400
I thought X-Day was supposed to be a bunch of topless babes

256
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,000
I thought I heard a ladies' voice

257
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,540
There's babes here

258
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,740
But they're, you know

259
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,620
They're topless

260
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,380
I could take my shirt off

261
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,320
I've got pretty good tits nowadays

262
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,060
Well, I'm gonna leave it up to Joyce

263
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,260
But I've got five bucks that say she doesn't take her shirt off

264
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,480
Oh, you're so smart!

265
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,340
I was like, I see the computer reading it

266
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,860
I love Smart Chicks, by the way

267
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,480
Can we make a song about Smart Chicks?

268
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,940
Smart chicks

269
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,080
So smart chicks

270
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,140
Give me a bad

271
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,380
Smart chicks

272
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,160
Smart chicks

273
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,280
The smarties

274
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,900
Smart chicks

275
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,460
Bravia

276
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,100
The smarties

277
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,880
Maybe contacts

278
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,540
Maybe contacts

279
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,400
Smarties

280
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,140
Smart chicks

281
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,800
Smarties

282
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,520
Smart chicks

283
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,740
Those smart girls

284
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,760
And by the way, we like smart guys, too

285
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,560
Those smart guys

286
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:09,440
Ooh

287
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,620
Going down the hallway

288
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,420
Those smart girls

289
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,540
Meeting up the wrong way

290
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,920
Those smart guys

291
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,880
Going down the hallway

292
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,700
Those smart girls

293
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,980
Better stay away

294
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,400
Those smart guys

295
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:41,400
They're out looking like they know something

296
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,720
Mm-hmm

297
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,460
It's so funny

298
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,780
Like they know something

299
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,780
Like they know something

300
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,380
Those smart guys

301
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,220
It's so cute

302
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,440
Those smart girls

303
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,680
Those smart girls

304
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,440
Now watch out for those smart girls

305
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,600
Better watch out for those smart girls

306
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Because they're all smart chicks

307
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,100
Watch out

308
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,620
For those smart chicks

309
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,960
For those smart chicks

310
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,220
Those smart guys

311
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,320
Those smart girls

312
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,040
Those smart girls

313
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,600
Those smart guys

314
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,920
Watch out

315
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,080
Always tripping the girls

316
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,580
The smart girls

317
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,300
Those smart girls

318
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,500
The smart girls

319
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,460
They don't

320
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,540
Learn more than

321
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,700
Both

322
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,560
Watch out

323
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,320
Those smart

324
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:10,720
Girls

325
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,720
You gotta watch out

326
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,180
To learn more

327
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,440
That's right

328
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,540
Learn from a motherfucker

329
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,060
They're going to learn

330
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,160
Doesn't matter if you're a guy or a girl

331
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,080
Why don't you just learn

332
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,860
From that smart girl

333
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,000
Or that smart guy

334
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,680
The subgenius kids

335
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,180
Did that song smart chicks

336
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,260
And they were

337
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,820
At x day but not singing

338
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,720
Although I think

339
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,620
They sang that during a zoom

340
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,860
Subgenius meeting

341
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,520
Which those happen every week

342
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,300
For members

343
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,720
More of the subgenius kids will be coming up

344
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,680
But now

345
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,820
Back to 23x day

346
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,660
Day one hour one

347
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,120
I'm wearing a Dallas

348
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,140
Paleontological society

349
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,120
Shirt

350
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,820
I had to go into town today

351
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,920
That has much good magic

352
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,380
You don't want to wear your

353
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,440
Bob

354
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:22,620
Bob

355
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:22,960
I'm wearing a shirt

356
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,520
Into town

357
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,460
Because the profile people

358
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,500
Come after you

359
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,340
I wore a shirt today

360
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,140
That at first glance

361
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,220
Looks astoundingly

362
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,140
Offensive

363
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,900
It's John Carpenter

364
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,360
See

365
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,240
And it's

366
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,940
It's

367
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,500
They

368
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,760
John Carpenter

369
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,100
But it's like the Carpenter

370
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,540
Yes

371
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:42,680
It's the

372
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,020
They live characters

373
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,380
See

374
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,400
Right I get it

375
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,620
Oh

376
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,440
That is pretty cool

377
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,780
I didn't realize it was the

378
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,900
They live characters

379
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,020
That's pretty cool

380
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,240
Yeah well see when I first saw the t-shirt

381
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,120
I thought they were making some bust on

382
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,840
Karen Carpenter

383
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,980
And her anorexia

384
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,920
She starved herself

385
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,040
Yeah I thought

386
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,200
I thought they were busting on that

387
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,760
And I thought it was funny for that level

388
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,480
But then I realized it was John Carpenter

389
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,880
Why not both?

390
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,140
Sure

391
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,460
Why not both?

392
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:12,820
Sure

393
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,760
But it was

394
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,040
For a second there

395
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,460
It was the darkest bit of humor

396
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,760
I'd seen in a long time

397
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,940
Go figure

398
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,820
Then they

399
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,640
They remade They Live on a budget of about 20 times greater than that and called it The Matrix

400
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,200
They Live was a great documentary

401
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,900
Haley said yes indeed

402
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,420
Expose of the Reagan administration

403
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,180
I told my kids it was a documentary

404
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,680
Stan did Wee get in?

405
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,260
Yeah where's Princess Wee?

406
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,420
I don't know

407
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,820
She's heard off screen

408
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,680
Turning in comments

409
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,800
She might have been in the movie

410
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,680
She might have been in the movie

411
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,680
With Mark Wiel climber

412
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,180
And got some

413
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,700
I've wanted to die

414
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,120
I don't know

415
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,140
I don't know

416
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:07,120
Wee putting that off

417
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,080
I've lost my hearing

418
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,080


419
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,940
A kid who had an limp

420
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:17,640
dinosaur turns into a fossil dinosaur. So there you have the question of, was there a zombie

421
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:25,420
dinosaur in between those phases? And do robots also, do robots have ghosts when they expire?

422
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,560
I'll turn that over to the panel. Do robots have ghosts? I can tell you about the dinosaurs.

423
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:37,240
I don't know about dinosaur zombies, but they definitely turn into ghosts. And as ghosts,

424
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:43,840
they're still heavy enough to leave footprints. Because along with the clear live dinosaur tracks,

425
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:51,940
I suppose could be zombie dinosaurs as degraded as they are. We also really do have ghost dinosaur

426
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:58,560
tracks. Are you referring to the article in the Prehistoric Times which said that dinosaur tracks

427
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:06,380
aren't deep enough? Did you see that particular article? What were they claiming about?

428
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,700
Well, they're the ghosts that only leave a shallow track.

429
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:16,560
Yeah, right. Well, we have tracks made by ghost dinosaurs. They're blurry.

430
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:26,020
And I used to just joke that they were ghost dinosaur tracks. Until I saw, I started noticing

431
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:32,180
in photographs that were taken during certain periods of dryness versus wetness in the creek,

432
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,520
the little depressions would become more clear if they had a little mud in them.

433
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:44,180
And I realized they probably were dinosaur tracks. They've just been exposed for a thousand years,

434
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,760
and now they're just these smudges.

435
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,300
Yes, they weather.

436
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,460
Only a thousand years?

437
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:59,980
Only a thousand years of exposure, and millions of years preserved before the time of exposure.

438
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,800
Right. The tracks at the state park, some of the oldest ones are gone now, but new ones are exposed

439
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,220
every day.

440
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,140
They're gone now, but they're still there every time there's a flood.

441
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,220
Do you think that the dinosaur ghosts actually felt pain?

442
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,660
I don't know about that, but they definitely left smudge-like tracks.

443
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,300
They might have felt existential pain.

444
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,620
What if it was wintertime, and it's cold outside, and they're having a walk, leaving their tracks?

445
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,640
They might be tiptoeing more, you know?

446
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,000
Dr. Drummond brings up the ghosts.

447
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,020
The dinosaur ghosts were pointing Sartre to one another.

448
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,540
These dinosaurs that were over here are now over there.

449
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,200
Yeah, that's the whole point.

450
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,200


451
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,200


452
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,200


453
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,200


454
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,200


455
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,380
That's the whole thing, that they go around, they float around like on giant icebergs, and

456
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,140
they visit their friends that way.

457
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:50,360
Stang, do you remember where the Chilophysis specimens from the Triassic were extracted?

458
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,820
The location, the name of the location?

459
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,200
You'll have to refresh my memory.

460
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,680
Ghost Ranch.

461
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,000
Wow.

462
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,860
Do you recall that?

463
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,820
Where all the major fossils of Chilophysis came from?

464
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,380
Coincidence?

465
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,580
Coincidence?

466
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,520
I think not.

467
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,200
There's no coincidence.

468
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,920
There's no money to be made.

469
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,500
May I say.

470
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,460
Other dinosaurs of famous reputation come from hell too.

471
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:29,000
There were many dinosaurs that had gas bags of lighter-than-air gas on their head or down their spine.

472
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,720
In their bones.

473
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,580
That helped them stand up more erect, you know?

474
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,780
They would just kind of tiptoe.

475
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:35,800


476
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,660
They would just tiptoe across the ancient world, leaving these little dainty footprints, even

477
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,560
though they were sometimes like a mile high.

478
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,840
And sometimes it was just their toes, you know?

479
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,680
And they would just eat and eat and eat and float away.

480
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:55,620
They didn't leave as many fossils, but if you can get to the moon, that's where you'll

481
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:55,820
see.

482
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,300
They wanted to.

483
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,480
They do want to get to the moon.

484
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,940
They all want to leave fossil footprints, don't we?

485
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,240
You can see that kind of stuff.

486
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,540
That's how they filmed the moon landing where the dinosaurs did it.

487
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:05,800
They did it.

488
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:05,800


489
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:05,800


490
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,460
The dinosaur fossils, yeah.

491
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,460
If you read Dr. Doolittle's adventures, you may remember that there were dinosaurs

492
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,360
on the moon when he visited it.

493
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,280
I rest my case.

494
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,760
Inevitably.

495
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,940
First, Dr. Doolittle's garden, then the sequel, Dr. Doolittle on the Moon, where a giant

496
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:30,980
moon moth comes and carries Dr. Doolittle and some of his friends to the moon, inhabited

497
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,780
by human giants and dinosaurs left over from an early age.

498
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,180
It was the early era.

499
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:46,980
Would the fact of the moon being a giant abandoned skull explain the hollow ringing sound when

500
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,760
you strike it?

501
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,260
The bell-like sound?

502
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:55,260
It's definitely hollow and it reverberates when struck, as a special experiment showed.

503
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,000
The moon does?

504
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:56,820
Yes.

505
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,820
Well, that would be of interest to H.G. Wells.

506
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,060
Well, I remember reading a comic book years ago.

507
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,360
standing in the drugstore next to my house,

508
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,200
which suggested the moon was a giant egg

509
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,520
that was about to hatch.

510
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,640
And it does in the comic book.

511
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,380
What comes out?

512
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,380
Some large griffin-like thing.

513
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,080
That wasn't a comic book.

514
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,880
That was an episode of Super Friends

515
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,980
from Saturday morning.

516
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,620
Well, you've got to feed the monster.

517
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,380
They'll put in an idea from anywhere.

518
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,500
X-Day in 1998.

519
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,020
When the men from Planet X arrive.

520
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,120
Now, it may sound ludicrous.

521
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,880
It may sound ridiculous to many believers out there.

522
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,660
Are you saying they're all nuts, all those people?

523
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,400
Maybe, yeah, maybe.

524
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,040
You once were telling me about Planet X, Dr. Morbund.

525
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,060
Evil on Planet X is more than you could think of.

526
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,600
Evil stalks them.

527
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,840
Every night and day they wait to see the evil they go through.

528
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,240
Do they come down in flying saucers?

529
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,820
Flying saucers are bearing on us.

530
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,760
We don't know what to do.

531
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,820
We're here all alone.

532
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,880
The planets are fading.

533
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,380
The blood is running.

534
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,140
The lights were fading.

535
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,880
And they stalked us one by one.

536
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,580
Today.

537
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,940
This is the Man in Black, here for the Roma Wine Company of Fresno, California.

538
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,440
Fresno!

539
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,080
Are we controlled by secret forces?

540
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,000
Do you ever get the feeling that we're being attacked?

541
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,000


542
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,760
Free will is a joke.

543
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,340
Do people think you're strange?

544
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,660
Do you?

545
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,840
Then you may be on the right track.

546
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,140
Give me slack or give me food or kill me!

547
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:52,140
Give me slack or give me food or kill me!

548
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,000
Kill me!

549
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,420
Kill me!

550
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,700
That was when Super Friends actually was going downhill.

551
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,140
I mean, it reached its peak with Challenge of the Super Friends.

552
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:13,180
And then it had a couple of seasons that were, well, less than mediocre.

553
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,520
What kind of a challenge can there be if you're super?

554
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,260
It's like Challenge of the Go-Bots.

555
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,740
The whole thing is rigged from the beginning to end.

556
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,700
It puts the media in mediocrity.

557
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,680
Yes.

558
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,900
There are many with tattoos on this.

559
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,860
Oh, I'm so sorry.

560
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,680
The radio audience can't see the cool thing.

561
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,900
There are so many cool backgrounds that many of us have.

562
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,340
Yes, you can see into subgenius sites here.

563
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:53,600
The radio audience can send away for a series of magic lantern slides to hold directly in front of the face

564
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:00,180
and then shine a Klieg light directly into the eyes, one per eye, and burn those images in.

565
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,280
Then they can see them at any time.

566
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:02,800
Yes.

567
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,000
In fact, they will never...

568
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,360
Whether they want to or not, because they'll be there forever.

569
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,200
Yes.

570
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,820
Also, it's available at no extra cost in the Church of the Subgenius.

571
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:18,260
If you would care to see the green energy demons, simply look at the sun and wait.

572
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,100
You'll see them.

573
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,640
Well, our president does that.

574
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,240
Yeah.

575
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:30,120
We can make some branding irons for the eyes, little branding irons for the eyes with images that we like on them.

576
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:31,880
You know.

577
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,580
And sear them forever with those images.

578
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,640
Oh, I mean, a lot of the younger subgeniuses did that already.

579
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,500
They have tiny bobs tattooed on their eyes backwards.

580
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,680
So it looks right to them.

581
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,520
Eyeball tattoos is a thing in prisons.

582
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,380
That's for real.

583
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:59,040
Well, is there any chance we are going to get Xanthea Octo-Torona on to discuss paleontology?

584
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,880
Is that all you can think about?

585
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,140
What did you say?

586
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,960
Paleontology.

587
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,900
Did you see the picture she posted yesterday?

588
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,620
How do you like my bob?

589
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,260
She posted a picture of how do you like my bob?

590
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,240
Well, she was posed about like this.

591
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:14,820
Yes.

592
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,760
She was climbing out of a swimming pool, stark nude.

593
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,260
She has a really good bob on the inside of her arm.

594
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:30,260
And you could see the top and bottom of her boobs, or her bobs, shall we say.

595
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,060
She's cute.

596
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:38,380
She's the one who's offered to move Ex Day to a nudist camp in Florida where she resides.

597
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,340
Yeah.

598
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:47,100
No, she and her dad own a resort in Land of the Lakes, Florida, that is also a nudist

599
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:52,520
place, and would be perfect for Ex Day, except you can't make noise all night.

600
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,560
The neighbors are a little too nearby.

601
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,960
That's okay with me, personally.

602
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,660
I'm usually in bed up the hill by the time that happens.

603
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:08,460
No, by the time we get there, the newer generation of subgeniuses will have earbuds and their own noise.

604
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,200
Is it true that good fortune comes to those who join the Church of the Subgenius?

605
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,040
Yes.

606
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,900
It actually is.

607
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,520
Absolutely.

608
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,320
Yeah, I got a visit from good fortune, for instance, because I joined the Church of the

609
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,620
Subgenius, Xanthea Akhtar Shreem came to visit me.

610
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,240
And I found out that, much to my surprise, she's really intelligent, fun.

611
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,080
Nice, subgenius-y lady.

612
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,400
And, get this, she's a fossil hunter.

613
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,760
She knows her geological periods.

614
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,040
Yeah, she does.

615
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,560
And-

616
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,840
How old do we have on here?

617
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,400
Every month.

618
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,120
I don't know, you want to check, take a roll call?

619
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,100
Who is fit for the Hall of Heroes?

620
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,240
The Hall of Heroes.

621
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,040
The Go-Goth has arrived in the attendee.

622
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,420
Yes, yeah, I'm going to pull him in.

623
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,340
Hey, the Go-Goth.

624
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,300
I got him, I got him, I got him.

625
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,680
Oh, shit, I got him.

626
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:13,400
You know, I asked him if he wanted me to pull him into the panel, and I never waited for

627
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:13,820
an answer.

628
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,720
I just said, come on in.

629
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,900
He has a presence here.

630
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,880
Yeah, come on.

631
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,440
A lettered presence.

632
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:21,920
Mono-bro.

633
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,180
I just remembered a dinosaur joke.

634
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,160
Yeah?

635
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:26,900
Please?

636
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,680
Please do tell.

637
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,040
That would be an old one.

638
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:36,280
Why do you never hear pterodactyls urinating?

639
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,400
Oh, oh, oh, why?

640
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,740
Because the P is silent.

641
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,700
Oh, oh, oh, that makes perfect sense.

642
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:53,980
Did the dinosaurs all speak a common dinosaur language, or was it straight, broken up by

643
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,820
the different geological eras, or how does that work?

644
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,820
Well, they did different species.

645
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,980
One species of dinosaur considered all the other dinosaurs to be just animals.

646
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,120
No, they spoke Esperanto.

647
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,240
Their speech was mostly motion and color.

648
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,580
It was like movements and colors with a little bit of sounds and snorts.

649
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:24,740
We know this from the, what are those historical dinosaur novels, Harry Harrison, is that him?

650
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,820
Oh, the, yes.

651
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,330
The Eden series.

652
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,510
Yeah, the Eden series.

653
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,390
Winter in Eden and so forth.

654
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,490
Were the dinosaurs intelligent in those?

655
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,850
I don't know those books.

656
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:40,390
There are intelligent saurians who keep the humans in subjugation in those books.

657
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:40,650
Cool.

658
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,410
Oh, it's really cool.

659
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,170
There's even-

660
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,430
It could only be an improvement.

661
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:45,950
There's even a scene.

662
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,330
A what scene?

663
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:55,690
The dinosaur queen adopts a little human pet and has her way with him, and when he

664
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:00,730
grows up and escapes from the dinosaurs, he can't have sex with normal looking cave

665
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,690
women, but only a hair-lipped girl.

666
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:09,770
He meets a girl with a severe, you know, cleft palate and falls-

667
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,430
He's sort of like-

668
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:15,170
She kind of reminds him of the dinosaur queen that introduced him to sex.

669
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,450
The mergue.

670
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:25,670
But they are quite advanced in their genetic science and can adapt to the environment.

671
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:25,670


672
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:31,630
They can adapt other dinosaurs into vehicles and submarines and boats and things like that.

673
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:36,790
Yeah, all their tools are actually other animals that have been genetically modified.

674
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:43,790
Their guns are lizards that shoot pellets out of their- poison pellets out of their

675
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,210
butts.

676
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:45,990
Paralyzed lizards.

677
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,490
Quite deadly.

678
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,430
Yeah.

679
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,730
Yeah, it's amazing.

680
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:55,570
And they speak with each other by motions and ducking-

681
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:55,650
Awesome.

682
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:55,650


683
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,450
And their tails come in real handy.

684
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:57,950
Right.

685
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:03,010
It makes it frustrating for a human who doesn't have a tail to try to do the postures that

686
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,490
signal certain tenses and frames.

687
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:11,890
I'm just telling Mickey that I've learned to do bee dances to tell bees where things

688
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,330
are.

689
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:14,270
You can do the waggle dance?

690
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:18,710
And we're trying to first bees, so I do these dances and I get them to come to our flowers,

691
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:23,410
but you have to do it right and make a noise and it can be learned.

692
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,570
You can't learn-

693
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:24,850
Exactly.

694
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,690
What happens if you give them the wrong directions though?

695
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:33,770
Well, actually once I did something wrong and they followed me instead of going to the

696
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:40,610
flowers and then we had a hundred bees in the house and I had to run from them and these

697
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,870
things can go wrong, but it's just don't-

698
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:44,550
I'm sure it was not you.

699
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,550
Don't get the dance wrong.

700
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:46,730
Don't get the dance wrong.

701
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,450
Otherwise, they'll feed you to the queen.

702
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,150
Sounds like a bee movement.

703
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,970
You can't run from them anyway.

704
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:51,930
They'll catch you.

705
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,210
You ever been bit by a dead bee?

706
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:54,550
No.

707
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:54,550


708
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:58,470
Ever had a beard of bees decide to sting you all at once?

709
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:00,790
When one stings, they all sting.

710
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:08,070
Regarding the dinosaurs, there is this comment by a creationist that he once asked, how

711
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:12,430
come man survived the asteroid and the dinosaurs didn't?

712
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:16,150
And somebody replied to them, social distancing.

713
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,070
They were 65 million years apart.

714
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,230
That was-

715
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,150
You don't need that microphone.

716
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:23,110
You don't want the microphone too close to your mouth.

717
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,070
It's kind of too close.

718
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,870
Sorry about that.

719
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,550
Yeah.

720
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,210
Work on that.

721
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:27,630
Okay.

722
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:33,570
Our dinosaur ancestors are still judging us for our proximity to the microphone.

723
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:43,290
Ryan Aldiss wrote a story where one insane person said that humans were derived from

724
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,370
the theropod line of dinosaurs.

725
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:51,290
There is some kind of line of procession from dinosaurs to the early primates.

726
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:51,930
They're out?

727
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:52,170
Yeah.

728
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,270
They had two eyes.

729
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,870
They got two eyes.

730
00:31:58,990 --> 00:31:59,950
That's what we call imperative anatomy.

731
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,990
Everybody has the same skeleton.

732
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:06,370
Humans and dinosaurs have the same skeleton, the same body plan.

733
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,550
Coincidence?

734
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,450
Coincidence?

735
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,050
I think not.

736
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:18,870
You're either on the insect side, the invertebrate side, or you're on the vertebrate side.

737
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,990
And if you're on the vertebrate side, you've got a pelvis, ribs, skull.

738
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:23,750
Having a bad time.

739
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,010
Two eyes, four limbs.

740
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:34,230
There was never any exception to this, except back in the weird Burgess Shale, where all

741
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:38,530
sorts of alien creatures tried to get started and did not.

742
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:43,950
Except for the ones that did and became Yeti, which became subgeniuses.

743
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:48,570
They resembled the great race that H.P.

744
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,790
Lovecraft described, in fact.

745
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:51,350
Oh, good lord.

746
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:57,330
The cone beings with the long stalk with the head on the end with multiple eyes are actually

747
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:01,470
represented by a Burgess Shale creature called Anomalocaris.

748
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,790
Burgess Shale.

749
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:07,270
Yes, the Burgess Shale is in Canada.

750
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,410
Story ideas.

751
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,710
It was about the...

752
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,870
Stephen Jay Gould wrote a book about it.

753
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:20,050
If evolution had gone slightly different, you know, we wouldn't have this division into

754
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:20,530
insects.

755
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:25,750
We'd have insects and vertebrates that we have now, but we'd have these exotic, strange,

756
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,810
utterly alien things.

757
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:32,210
When we were admiring the lady, we might be admiring her mandibles.

758
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,670
It's like a different reality.

759
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:35,710
From a safe distance.

760
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,330
Her sexy mandibles.

761
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,730
Yeah, from a safe distance.

762
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:39,050
Sexy reality.

763
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:42,610
Because in the mating process, she will bite off your head.

764
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,870
The passion is there.

765
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,710
Well that does describe Monty.

766
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:50,510


767
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,770
I don't know if it's my second or third marriages, but never mind.

768
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:53,390
Never mind.

769
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,490
Let us not dwell on the horrors.

770
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,390
Unspeakable horrors.

771
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:25,170
Everybody feels real good in Fool City.

772
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,350
Each day brings a new surprise.

773
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:35,170
Johnny came two thousand miles to Fool City.

774
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:38,350
Came to see what makes things tick.

775
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:45,150
Cut his hair and bought new clothes in Fool City.

776
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,830
Finally found his life's ambition, oh.

777
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,930
Kind of doing nothing perfectly.

778
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,350
Diniz styles so gracefully.

779
00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:01,210
His life was so delicious in Fool City.

780
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,570
Outside the Homes on the Street.

781
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,250
Don't stop for you in Wool City.

782
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,110
Someone standing in a doorway.

783
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,990
In Fool City.

784
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,130
Ah,

785
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:19,550
They open the door and check him out so casually

786
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:24,910
The music's blasting all night long in the pool city

787
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:29,210
They recognize his face so it's all right

788
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:32,990
He said to move or write the dress

789
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,430
Even though someone in a band

790
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:41,070
The others wait all night standing in the pool city

791
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,570
So hard to make the right friends

792
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,450
You might have to sell some skin

793
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,050
The nights go on forever

794
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,390
The blacks, they all hate the whites

795
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:25,550
The whites think they're tough but they're not

796
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:30,350
The boys go out with each other

797
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,410
The girls wanna be amoebas

798
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,990
If you're high, you're in the right place

799
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,550
Pool city

800
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:40,890
Animal

801
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,730
Seek out their own kind

802
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:49,510
Shake some hands and take a lunch in pool city

803
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,930
Someone's going to try and tempt you

804
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:59,550
Listen to all the brilliant bands in pool city

805
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:04,310
So be now in your bay, let it be it yourself

806
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,510
Ready the objects on the wall

807
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,010
Please let young and motherful old

808
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:10,950
So come on

809
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:11,890
And let the music play

810
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:12,390
The world is fun

811
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:13,510
Go drink

812
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,950
Snow and wine

813
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,510
And there's the nights when the day should be winning

814
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,930
Pool city

815
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:33,130
That was Danny Elfman from his So Low album.

816
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,210
That's the name of the album, So Dash Low.

817
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:40,930
I was listening to that on my way into our tiny, sleepy little town.

818
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:50,010
And I almost cried with thankfulness that I do not live in Cool City during these strange days.

819
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,370
But in its opposite, sweltering Hamlet.

820
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:55,410
Phew.

821
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,210
Phew.

822
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,650
In more ways than one.

823
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:03,610
In between, we've been hearing stuff from the old subgenius media barrage albums.

824
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:10,910
But now, frankly, I've played all this other stuff mainly to soften you up for the hard, needy, hard times.

825
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:10,910


826
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,150
I am with one, Heads and Tails.

827
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:11,230
And you are listening to Papa Joe's Nugget.

828
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,930
And I'd like to give you a nugget at the center of this episode.

829
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,390
Uh, Papa Joe Mama.

830
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:21,750
Or more properly, Father Joe Mama's new X Day rant is here.

831
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:32,030
So, strap-on your tinfoil strap-on and prepare yourself for Papa Joe's Preparation X Day 2020.

832
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:37,370
Hello friends and welcome.

833
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:43,670
The sermon tonight is entitled Revolution for Bob

834
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,650
Revolution for Bob

835
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:51,510
Because let's face it, this summer has been the summer of revolution

836
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:55,350
In fact, it really seems like the end times

837
00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:00,110
There's a worldwide plague ravaging the population

838
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,890
There's more police brutality than ever before

839
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:06,250
And we see it over and over again on TV with instant replay

840
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,190
And of course, all the riots and protests

841
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:13,390
Clashing with the man, looting various stores

842
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,830
And tearing down various statues and yada yada yada

843
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:21,610
Now, more than a faithful few have asked yours truly

844
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,130
Papa Joe, you're a bomb thrower

845
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,690
You're always preaching about hate this and hate that

846
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,390
Rise up and burn it all down

847
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:31,050
You do approve of the riots, don't you?

848
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,230
Or at very least the peaceful protests

849
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,230
Well, let's see

850
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,270
Let me answer the second question first

851
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,910
I don't do peaceful protests

852
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:44,130
I don't believe in no justice, no peace

853
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,370
I just believe in no peace

854
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,430
We've already had thousands of years of their so-called peace

855
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,670
And what has it gotten us?

856
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,250
A conspiracy, that's what

857
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,670
So don't expect me to chill out and let up

858
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,530
Just because the conspiracy throws us a bone

859
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,750
They can keep their bones

860
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,770
In fact, I'm all for throwing their bones right back at them

861
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:06,210
Starting with their skull and working our way through the bones

862
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,070
Our way right on down their weak little spines

863
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,790
To the tips of their tiny little toes

864
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:13,270
But now for the answer to the first question

865
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:17,110
Do I believe and approve in the angry riots?

866
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:20,490
The answer, dear friends, is both yes and no

867
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:25,570
I do approve of rising up and taking back that which is rightfully ours

868
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:29,850
And to use extreme prejudice in order to destroy extreme prejudice

869
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:35,010
But when I look out and see all the violence

870
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,210
All the destruction of the world

871
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:36,210


872
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:36,210


873
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:36,210


874
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,670
All the destruction and all the marching

875
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,130
I have to ask myself

876
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,490
Why?

877
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:46,950
Why didn't any of these people stand up and protest

878
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:51,190
Or fight the system in the name of Bob?

879
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:57,470
Oh sure, social justice is a good cause

880
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,270
Like the media says

881
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:02,330
Social justice is more important than social distance

882
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:05,590
So long as your justice agrees with my justice

883
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,210
And you agree with my justice

884
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:09,050
And your distance is at least an arm swing away from my fists

885
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:13,890
But there is a bigger issue than social justice, dear friends

886
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,830
There's an issue bigger than winning in November

887
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:20,070
And there's an issue bigger than curing the COVID pandemic

888
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,450
And that issue is J.R. Bob Dobbs!

889
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:28,170
For 23 years he's been waiting for us to rise up

890
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,670
And show the conspiracy bosses who the real boss really is

891
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:35,950
He spent his entire life lining up an alien armada

892
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:36,190
To rise up and show the conspiracy bosses who the real boss really is

893
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,470
And rocket all the way to this sneaking globule of dirt

894
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,650
Located in the armpit of the universe

895
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:44,170
Just to rescue us from this hell on Earth

896
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:49,830
Was he expecting too much for us to demonstrate just a little faith

897
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:53,510
That he would return and provide some fifth column resistance

898
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,170
Or outright guerrilla warfare

899
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:59,510
To make his X-Day invasion a tiny bit easier for the X's overlords?

900
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:00,710
Jesus H!

901
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:05,150
No wonder he keeps putting off the final evacuation year after year

902
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,190
It's because he's a little bit too old for that

903
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:08,630
It's bad enough that most of the sub-Gs are drunk

904
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,530
Passed out or asleep during the 7-day egg cattle call

905
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:12,190
But this year

906
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,770
Oh, this year

907
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,570
It's even worse

908
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:19,830
We're finally revolting against this system

909
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:22,950
And claiming that we're destroying the chains of oppression

910
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:26,110
And tearing down statues of colonial slave owners

911
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,790
And Civil War slave masters

912
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:28,290
But!

913
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:32,870
What about our slave owners?

914
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:34,470
Why?

915
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:34,930
Why?

916
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,130
There's no mention at all!

917
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:36,850
About them

918
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:40,790
Or their modern-day 9-to-5 rent-a-slave conspiracy

919
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:45,670
Or the daily denial of Dobbsian liberty and slack

920
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:48,630
In fact, there's no mention of Bob Dobbs in the slightest

921
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,690
It's as if he doesn't even exist

922
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,850
Oh, it makes me sad

923
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:58,910
Sad to think that on July 5th, just before 7am

924
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,230
Bob's gonna fly down in the first Reconno saucer

925
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,170
To enter our sub-orbit since this time last year

926
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:06,190
And he'll see all of us

927
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:06,670
And he'll see all the crowds

928
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,050
He'll see all the smoke

929
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:10,270
And he'll see all the tear gas and debris

930
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:11,650
And toppled statues

931
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:12,470
And he'll think

932
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,550
Finally, finally I can land this ship

933
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:20,110
And let my people go to the pleasure planet I promised all those years ago

934
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:25,330
And finally, I can release the shock troops to put this planet out of its misery

935
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,150
But then

936
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:31,010
Then as he enters NORAD's radar range

937
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:34,070
He'll start receiving TV and radio broadcasts

938
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,190
And he'll realize this is not a dream

939
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:36,190


940
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:36,990
It's not about him

941
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,310
It's about us

942
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,230
And the normals

943
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,410
And the cops

944
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:44,790
Alack

945
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:46,370
Alas

946
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,650
Imagine his pain and disappointment

947
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,590
We were so close to salvation

948
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,650
So very close

949
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:56,450
But we stopped just short of the goal line

950
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:00,490
If these puny pinks wanted to save themselves

951
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:04,410
They'd spend less time debating whether to take a knee for the national anthem

952
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:06,190
And instead would take two knees

953
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:06,770
For Bob

954
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,010
But, but, but, Bob, Bob, Bob and Joe

955
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,650
This is a good cause

956
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,950
Don't you think Bob will approve of us fighting to make Earth a better place for everyone?

957
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:17,830
No, I do not

958
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:22,090
Because Bob is not coming to Earth to make it a better place

959
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:26,650
He's coming here to take us, his chosen, to a better place

960
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:27,970
A better planet

961
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:29,870
Where none of these problems occur

962
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:32,490
Where none of this pinkness exists

963
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:36,170
And then just to make sure no pinkness infects anywhere else in the universe

964
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,930
He's going to make Earth a better place

965
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,410
By utterly destroying it

966
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:45,330
Yes, it's a dirty, Dobbsian duty

967
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,810
But someone's gotta do it

968
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,170
And whatever you do

969
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:50,050
Don't get nostalgic about it

970
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:51,390
Because Earth is dying anyway

971
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,970
Even the conspiracy scientists admit we only have a few years left regardless

972
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:59,370
At least with Bob, not everyone is neutralized

973
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:02,030
And the billions who are are put out of their misery quickly

974
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:04,730
Without all the long, drawn-out pomp and circumstance

975
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:08,670
That's showing a lot more compassion than the conspiracy ever showed us

976
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,630
When the boot was on the other foot

977
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:13,570
They always piled on the pain and suffering in slow motion

978
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,510
So they're getting much better treatment than they deserve

979
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:23,410
Of course, now the Bobbies and conspiracy collaborators are getting a little nervous

980
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:25,590
And starting to murmur and fidget

981
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:30,410
But Papa Joe, that's all supposed to be a big joke, man

982
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:31,930
You're sounding kind of serious

983
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:34,470
You're sounding like a religious fanatic

984
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:37,270
Newsflash, I am a religious fanatic

985
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:39,290
And proudly so, because I know what's at stake

986
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:42,670
You think it's a joke because we told you it's a joke

987
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:46,350
Because that's the only way we were able to pull this thing off with any element of surprise

988
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:48,010
And to stay out of prison in the meantime

989
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,710
Fine, it's a joke

990
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,270
Keep telling yourself that

991
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:53,050
And stop listening to my sermons

992
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,490
Because it's not for you

993
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:56,010
It's for the faithful

994
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,430
Those truly dedicated to Bob

995
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:01,750
Those truly dedicated and willing to die for Dobbs

996
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,710
Because nothing, nothing is more important than Bob

997
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:05,830
Than he is

998
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:07,210
Not you

999
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:08,510
Not me

1000
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:10,830
And certainly not them

1001
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,210
So don't start getting soft on the humans

1002
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:16,170
Because pink lives don't matter

1003
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:20,110
Now I'm not saying don't attend the protests

1004
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,190
And I'm not saying don't riot

1005
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:23,170
But I am saying

1006
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:26,810
If you want real everlasting change

1007
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:30,270
These little demonstrations simply won't do

1008
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:33,590
The only riots and protests that can achieve something that dramatic

1009
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,110
Are for Dobbs

1010
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:38,110
And they ain't peaceful nor pretty

1011
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:41,210
Because there's no negotiating or changing the minds of

1012
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:42,270
The conspiracy

1013
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,430
It's against their nature to compromise

1014
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,390
The only way you change them

1015
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:49,170
Is to destroy them

1016
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:51,250
They not only have the cops

1017
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,410
They have the military

1018
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,470
And the only way to destroy that

1019
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:57,250
Is with help from heaven

1020
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:59,830
Or should I say the heavens

1021
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:03,570
Because that's where Bob and his alien overlords will drop out of prison

1022
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,150
And light this candle

1023
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:09,510
It's not too late to fix our fate

1024
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:13,310
We have up until 6.59am, July 5th

1025
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:15,590
To change the future course of planet earth

1026
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:18,650
We can either keep slamming our heads against the wall

1027
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:20,990
Trying to improve a planet dying of diseases

1028
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:23,470
Climate change and social chaos

1029
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,650
Or we can jettison this bitch

1030
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:29,330
And move on to greener, not pinker pastures

1031
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:32,290
I suggest you put that proposition

1032
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:33,550
In your pipe and smile

1033
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:33,570
Or you can just go home

1034
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:33,570


1035
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:33,570


1036
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:39,850
And if you do attend any protests or riots, do it for Bob's sake.

1037
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:48,770
At least buy and wear a Bob's face chin bandana so maybe, just maybe, it will at least look like you're fighting for a cause worthy of his divine intervention.

1038
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:54,310
And we'll find out soon enough if he falls for it or not.

1039
00:47:54,450 --> 00:48:01,210
And I'll be cheering you on all the way, because I, for one, am tired of waiting.

1040
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:04,510
Here in the word of Bob, praise Bob.

1041
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:06,330
Amen.

1042
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:11,070
We're tired of your phony fireworks.

1043
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,370
Blarzel, you have earned this.

1044
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,150
Yeah.

1045
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:29,950
What about this reputed Jesus?

1046
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:33,590
Starfleet that was supposed to have shown up.

1047
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:41,990
As you see, they have just left the hangar deck at Lunar Central and have cleared the airlocks into the colony.

1048
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:45,150
The crowd of scientists and technicians are going wild.

1049
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,330
What a space ovation.

1050
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:48,750
Now let's feel another.

1051
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:54,570
Now in celebration of this great occasion, we have planned a lunar party.

1052
00:48:54,810 --> 00:49:01,110
We hope all young people throughout the solar system will join us in celebration of this great day.

1053
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:01,290
A.

1054
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:02,170
A in alpha space.

1055
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:09,890
Bob?

1056
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:13,010
Sing it, girl.

1057
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:18,110
Oh.

1058
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:18,770
Oh.

1059
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:20,690


1060
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,950
Oh.

1061
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:22,390
Oh.

1062
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:23,650
Oh.

1063
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:25,370
Oh.

1064
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,050
Oh.

1065
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:38,610
Who am I?

1066
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:45,910
Who are we Princess Cookie?

1067
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:48,650
We're us

1068
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:52,310
Are we fake? Are we real?

1069
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:55,490
Who determines what's fake and real?

1070
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:57,970
We do

1071
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:58,990
That's right!

1072
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:01,230
And we are for you

1073
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:02,870
That's right!

1074
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:05,410
We are real

1075
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:17,710
You sound so beautiful

1076
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:21,090
I tried, I tried this for you

1077
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:29,510
Ooh

1078
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:47,670
Do you want to do a real like Willis on the bus or do you remember back in the day where one person says one thing and then the other person steps in like a measure or two measures later doing the same thing?

1079
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:48,350
Around?

1080
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:49,010
Yeah

1081
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:57,470
I actually have a question about Bob for the panel. I had mentioned this a couple of few minutes ago.

1082
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:58,970
You know here we are in the middle of the night.

1083
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:04,690
In the year, in X day of the year of the great Robert Anton Wilson, X day 23.

1084
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:16,230
And is it a coincidence that the year of Ra happens to be the most end times and the most X day like year we have experienced in quite a long time?

1085
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:18,310
Synchronicity is what it is.

1086
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:26,450
The opportunity for a friendly ushering into the church of the subgenius has been extended for decades.

1087
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:28,410
Centuries some might say.

1088
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:32,850
Oh just send a dollar or go to the mall and buy that book.

1089
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:42,290
It's been easy for so long and there's still several listeners who have not joined the church of the subgenius even on their own terms.

1090
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:50,810
So we had a little talk with the Yakutismas and this year we kind of turned up the heat a little bit.

1091
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:52,710
They want to keep a distance.

1092
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:55,130
Well let's let them keep a distance.

1093
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:58,390
If they want to interact with fewer humans and more people.

1094
00:51:58,390 --> 00:51:58,390


1095
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:00,450
More of wowm existence.

1096
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:02,770
Well let's give them a taste of that.

1097
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:05,850
Well remember we don't want the humans anyway.

1098
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:10,710
We only want subgeniuses who are latently among the humans.

1099
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:15,590
Hey you guys watch this ad here because I'm getting a little residual from it.

1100
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:18,770
You're getting residuals?

1101
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:20,350
Lucky you.

1102
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:21,590
I wonder how you can do that.

1103
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:25,830
If you find yourself put off by the news.

1104
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:27,370
Just.

1105
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:30,490
Remind yourself or say to yourself.

1106
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:31,270
Ching ching.

1107
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,150
I think not.

1108
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:37,670
Not in the sense of disagreement but really I think not.

1109
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:39,530
Don't think about it.

1110
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:42,110
Don't think about these things.

1111
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:42,630
I'm not.

1112
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:43,250
They go away.

1113
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:44,550
I'm not.

1114
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:45,050
I not think.

1115
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:47,790
I think not.

1116
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:49,770
Me no think.

1117
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:55,510
Then you can get to I not and then finally just I.

1118
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:56,690
Me not.

1119
00:52:56,970 --> 00:52:57,670
I not.

1120
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:59,210
Me yeah.

1121
00:52:59,770 --> 00:52:59,770


1122
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:00,670
I not.

1123
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:00,830
Me it.

1124
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:01,310
I no.

1125
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:01,410
I know.

1126
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:01,410


1127
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:01,410


1128
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:01,410


1129
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:01,410


1130
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:01,430
I хunt.

1131
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:01,430


1132
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:01,430


1133
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:01,430


1134
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:02,050
The Arc of the Eye.

1135
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:02,050


1136
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:02,050


1137
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:02,050


1138
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,690
And then it's so long salute of the eye.

1139
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:11,910
But with the subgenius scimitar you can slice the knot as Alexander the Great did.

1140
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:17,570
Now this 23 X day and the worst year ever.

1141
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:19,190
It's not.

1142
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:19,850
This is just.

1143
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:21,210
Year period.

1144
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:33,750
Do you guys remember last year? Everybody was saying, man, 2019, this is so bad. So many people died. It's going to be better next year. Honestly, don't you remember?

1145
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:40,430
Yeah, it is worse. It can always get worse. It can always get worse.

1146
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,770
The bottom can always drop out.

1147
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:52,630
You could be in Dresden on the wrong day in World War II or Hiroshima or on the beaches of D-Day.

1148
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:58,630
You could be in the Black Death in Europe.

1149
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:01,990
Trump could be reelected.

1150
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:03,750
It's going to happen.

1151
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,530
Salvation or destruction, friends.

1152
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:09,090
Which would it be?

1153
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:10,590
That was so clear.

1154
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:12,750
That image was so clear.

1155
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:19,970
It was like, you know, it was for many people, it was a breakthrough image, I feel, that he went on and just held on.

1156
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:22,730
The Secret Service came to see me because of that image.

1157
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:24,130
Because of that image? Seriously?

1158
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:33,810
Yes, they did. Because Bob and Kennedy and Buddha and everybody are shooting at a hydra that has one arm is labeled Reagan or any president.

1159
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:35,270
Oh, I see.

1160
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:41,650
And the Secret Service did, in fact, come to my door in 1983.

1161
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:47,410
And said that they asked if I was Doug St. Clair.

1162
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:48,950
Didn't even have my whole name.

1163
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:51,530
I should have said, yeah, yeah, that's right.

1164
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:57,050
You should have said, oh, we've got a lot of crazy artists making pictures.

1165
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,370
That's just one of them.

1166
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:00,490
You ought to talk to Hal Robbins.

1167
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:01,970
I didn't make it.

1168
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:03,690
Well, the funny thing is.

1169
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:05,190
Matt Reed is me.

1170
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:06,010
No.

1171
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,330
I've seen it in a stark fist.

1172
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:10,390
Made by a great subgenius artist.

1173
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:12,490
That someone at the L.A. airport.

1174
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:15,990
Was showing to people as a takeoff on Hare Krishna.

1175
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:17,570
You know, have you heard the good news?

1176
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:22,430
They show this picture of this person called the Secret Service said they're going to kill the president.

1177
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:25,250
Well, they showed up and saw.

1178
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:30,910
Well, once they looked at my car and my shoes, they knew I wasn't a successful cult leader.

1179
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:34,390
And that's really not very good humor.

1180
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:36,130
So you shouldn't publish that again.

1181
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:39,250
And I thought, well, we probably won't.

1182
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:40,190
I see.

1183
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:42,750
However, it was already in Book of the Subgenius.

1184
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:46,590
Which one week later was reviewed by People magazine.

1185
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:49,750
And what single piece of art did they choose?

1186
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:52,130
To show to millions of people.

1187
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:53,970
But salvation or destruction.

1188
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:58,410
A week after, the Secret Service said, please don't publish that again.

1189
00:55:58,550 --> 00:55:59,730
And I went, we won't.

1190
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:00,990
People did.

1191
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:03,090
Millions saw it.

1192
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:04,530
And they actually liked it.

1193
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,430
It was one of the best reviews of the book we ever got.

1194
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,090
It was in the pinkest magazine.

1195
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:12,030
That great piece of art is by St. John Hagenbrenner.

1196
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:12,750
Yeah.

1197
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:12,970
Yes.

1198
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:13,770
Well, tell us what.

1199
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,850
Well, Swami Satellite Weavers.

1200
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:16,470
Yes.

1201
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:20,190
Reverend Stagg, I seem to remember you telling that story.

1202
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:26,110
And then you ended up saying that those Secret Service members left your house as converts

1203
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:27,390
and paid up ministers.

1204
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:29,250
Oh, that made it for a good story.

1205
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:30,490
But they didn't.

1206
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:31,690
They did not.

1207
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:32,450
That was a lie.

1208
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:33,970
Did I say that?

1209
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:35,230
Well, then you better pick up on it.

1210
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:37,110
Did you lie?

1211
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:41,910
Are you actually admitting that you may have lied to us at some time?

1212
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:46,390
He extended the information farther than the deal was supposed.

1213
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:46,670


1214
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:47,250
Exactly.

1215
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:49,550
I only said it because.

1216
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:52,510
In some alternate universe, it did happen.

1217
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:58,570
Anything a subgenius says automatically is part of our doctrine, as you know.

1218
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,870
That itself is part of our doctrine.

1219
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:05,110
This is the first Dobbs head that I've ever owned.

1220
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:07,890
I got this in 1982.

1221
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:09,790
I still have it.

1222
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:10,530
Old black guacamole.

1223
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:13,950
It's got the early address on it.

1224
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:15,850
1980 copyright.

1225
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:16,630
Black and white.

1226
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:18,290
And it's black and white.

1227
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:20,310
And I even wrote my name on it.

1228
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:21,010
The little dots.

1229
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,650
In case I had to loan it out so somebody could give it back to me later.

1230
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:26,090
Because they could just like ask.

1231
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:26,770
You were smart.

1232
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:27,550
Hey, where's the on-hand?

1233
00:57:27,590 --> 00:57:31,510
Now that's so common, you just walk up to any hipster and cut the Dobbs head tattoo

1234
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:32,270
off their skin.

1235
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:32,890
You got one.

1236
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:33,250
I do.

1237
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,150
I like that idea.

1238
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,670
And then frame it.

1239
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:40,510
It doesn't matter because then they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to get a tattoo.

1240
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:40,510


1241
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:40,510


1242
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:43,270
Then they've got a Bob shaped scar, which is what they want anyway.

1243
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:44,810
That's like the next level.

1244
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:40,350
With some secrets.

1245
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:40,490
Now we fight.

1246
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:44,910
Thank you.

1247
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,050
Thank you.

1248
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:44,590
Thank you.

1249
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:15,470
Thank you.

1250
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:46,410
Thank you.

1251
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:13,990
Thank you.

1252
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:15,770
Thank you, buddy.

1253
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:19,390
And that was the Psychoskeletons.

1254
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,310
Tomorrow's Tomato, name it that song.

1255
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:26,030
For more information, friends, check out subgenius.com.

1256
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:28,630
Yes, that's subgenius.com.

1257
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:30,210
And praise Bob.

1258
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:43,670
Bob!

1259
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:43,670


1260
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:45,710
Bob!

1261
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:48,550
Bob!

1262
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:50,130
Bob!

1263
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:50,490
Bob!

1264
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:52,250
Bob!

1265
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:52,910
Bob!

1266
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:53,250
Bob!

1267
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:54,550
Bob!

1268
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:55,850
Bob!

1269
01:01:57,230 --> 01:02:00,810
Gee, I want to try triology.

1270
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:03,390
All the kids are doing it, Mom.

1271
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:06,110
There's a Dobbs head in every bar.

1272
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:08,970
Yes, an embedded Dobbs head of soap

1273
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:10,490
inside a bar.

1274
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:12,330
A bar of translucent soap.

1275
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:15,030
You can see Bob lurking inside.

1276
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:17,030
And it tells fortunes

1277
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:19,930
as you rotate it swiftly under the water,

1278
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,750
lathering away the conspiracy smudge

1279
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:24,810
and other schmata.

1280
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:27,970
If the Dobbs head comes up at the end

1281
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:30,950
in the true perfect pipe placement position,

1282
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:32,810
you'll have good luck all day.

1283
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:34,430
If it comes up the other way,

1284
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:36,710
20 more years of winter.

1285
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:40,250
That's triologysoaps.com.

1286
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:43,390
It comes in every flavor and scent.

1287
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:44,790
That's not nonsense.

1288
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:48,310
It's almost every scent you can think of.

1289
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:50,170
And they all have funny names.

1290
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:52,490
Praise Bob.

1291
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:55,990
And praise triologysoaps.com.

1292
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:58,970

Waleedan friend.

1308
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:36,990

1309
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:40,110
