1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Let's go to the Gigolo Club over in Yancey.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,220
They've got a...

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,460
Self-genius.

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,680
Power of Slack.

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,120
I say this calls for action, and now, nip it in the bud.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,100
Ah, shut up.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,760
Ah, yes, dear friends.

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,600
This is your prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

9
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:23,420
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1,272.

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,060
And boy, howdy, have we got something different for you tonight.

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:37,160
Last July 2nd at the 13X Day Drill, there suddenly evolved an all-uber-femme live Hour of Slack panel.

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,740
Yes, an Hour of Slack featuring pretty much only female voices.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,820
At the beginning, you'll hear this shift from all men to all sexy, naughty girl voices.

14
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:56,680
The prisoners who listen to this show in Wisconsin and Georgia should really like this one.

15
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,400
These girls cuss like anything.

16
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,480
Us boys are prim and proper models of decorum compared to them.

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,660
But nonetheless, because of the estrogenized nature of this episode,

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,220
I'm not going to chop it up and fill in the lame parts with collages or songs like I normally do.

19
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:26,920
And you know, many awkward young men might really stand to gain from the advice that these ladies,

20
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,920
these ewes out as they provide a concise and yet blunt lesson in what not to do to get laid.

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,640
And so, let us go into that live show, practically uncut,

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,400
except for the billion cuss words that had to be removed from the broadcast version

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,020
as opposed to the internet podcast.

24
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,880
The church was, in fact, the sausage fest that many would rightly suspect it to be for a long time.

25
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,160
Yeah.

26
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,280
We lied our asses off.

27
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,760
We lied and we said it was a sex cult and so forth.

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,360
And you know, build it and they will come, as it were.

29
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,820
And also it helped.

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:14,720
One year I published, back when the Stark Fist was published on 100 pages of paper,

31
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:21,300
I did an issue that was deliberately as gross and offensive as I could possibly make it.

32
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,040
All my friends in San Francisco were horrified and said,

33
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,040
there's never going to be any girls in the church.

34
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,480
Now, but they were wrong.

35
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,600
Because Reverend Susie the Flusie and before her even,

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,980
crazy women like, remember Sister Mary Squared?

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,140
Anyway, you know, it was like all these dames saw that disgusting magazine

38
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,240
and thought, oh, these boys think they're so gross.

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,100
We'll show them.

40
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,740
And they did indeed.

41
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,260
And to this day, you'll hear dirtier talk on the secret recordings of the lady subgeniuses.

42
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:56,880
And you hear of them.

43
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,940
Nice, polite, glad.

44
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,400
Yeah, that's the thing, friends.

45
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,160
If you know Uberfems, you know that they're going to one-up you.

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,960
If you say something disgusting, they're going to say something even worse.

47
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,920
If you do something disgusting, hold on.

48
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,420
You're going to be puking in a few minutes.

49
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:10,900
You know what?

50
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,940
I think that's a good idea.

51
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,640
I think we should all get off this stage and let the Uberfems out here and disgust them.

52
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,180
I mean, really, I want to hear some filthy talk from the Uberfems.

53
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,260
So you want to see a subgenius version of The View up here?

54
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah.

55
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,040
I want to see.

56
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,560
The subview.

57
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,620
The underview.

58
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,480
I want to see.

59
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,180
I want to see the.

60
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,600
So you want to peek under the skirt of the church?

61
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,260
Yes.

62
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,880
The literal skirt.

63
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,820
The literal skirt.

64
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,440
The literal skirt of the church.

65
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,840
To see the under things.

66
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,720
I can see a few right there.

67
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,000
I can see a few right there.

68
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,920
Yes, we're the Uberfems in this radio show.

69
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,220
And just as we had said it, friends, we invoked the disgusting acts of the Uberfems.

70
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,540
Please report to the stage now.

71
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,160
And forward they come.

72
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,320
Here they come.

73
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,560
You have asked them, and here they come.

74
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,040
To show them as a pair.

75
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,080
So now our.

76
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,360
Pair of tits.

77
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:56,940
Right.

78
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,920
Round table discussion shifts to the panel of the Uberfems.

79
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,340
We can't have our booze, okay?

80
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,460
Oh, yes.

81
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,540
I can have my Uberman chair back now.

82
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,460
Enough male energy, eh?

83
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,420
Now let us.

84
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,040
Enough of this work.

85
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,240
I can have my Uberman chair back.

86
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:19,520
Release the divine Cythera to the ambient atmosphere.

87
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,840
Oh, God.

88
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,640
I have stage fright.

89
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:22,900
I don't know.

90
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,700
What the hell do I do?

91
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,060
Shit.

92
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,740
I'm going to drink this.

93
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,640
Ladies and gentlemen, the Uberfems.

94
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,700
I think I might just do it.

95
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,060
I might just fill up the table chewing.

96
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:31,900
Kick off the discussion.

97
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,260
You probably ought to say right now, since we're all friends here and engaging in healthful

98
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:46,620
banter, what kicks you off the most about X Day 2010 that you haven't satisfactorily

99
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,920
articulated yet?

100
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,680
There's not enough tits.

101
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,880
You think so?

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,040
Oh, hey, look, look.

103
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,660
There's some.

104
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,720
Right there.

105
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,260
There you go.

106
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:55,420
Yeah.

107
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:55,860
Ready, set, go.

108
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,040
You see, even as you are talking about the Uberfem, you're not going to get a tits.

109
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,760
I'm just articulating.

110
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,480
It gets better.

111
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,220
What else?

112
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,960
That's first in my list.

113
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,660
I have a fucking sunburn already.

114
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:06,940
Oh, that's terrible.

115
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,060
And do you have the stuff to put on it, the goo that you put on there?

116
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,320
No.

117
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,760
I didn't bring any.

118
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,280
I brought it.

119
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,420
Well, now let it be announced.

120
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,780
If anyone has the goo, Pantiera needs a little bit of it.

121
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,400
I thought this was chicks, but I'm seeing a lot of dicks.

122
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,640
Well, I'm sorry.

123
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,020
I'm not sorry.

124
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,020


125
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,020


126
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,020


127
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,020


128
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,160
I'm just trying to moderate, but I will withdraw.

129
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,880
Well, before you all get started on disgusting us all, if that is what your goal is to be,

130
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:45,340
I'd like to take a moment for those of you out here in the audience and the people listening on the radio

131
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,720
to give a little testimonial to the subgenius chicks out here and their ability to disgust people.

132
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:59,700
In that, although there are very few of them here, they have somehow convinced men that are here

133
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:07,160
that they should be drooling and lusting after mucus that flows, to lap up the mucus that flows

134
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:14,400
out of their snot cavern between their legs, just inches away from their rectums.

135
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,860
And yet, here you all are, yelling for more.

136
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,700
So, come on, girls.

137
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:20,960
Come on, girls.

138
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,120
Disgust me.

139
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:29,560
And in exchange for that, we're supposed to put your mouth around a giant sausage-looking thing

140
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,040
that squirts out yogurt that doesn't taste like yogurt at all.

141
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,900
It's not really yogurt.

142
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,800
Oh, shit, he was lying to me.

143
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,580
Fuck.

144
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,160
It's supposed to be fun, right?

145
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,640
Just pretend it's something else they said.

146
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,080
Oh, God.

147
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,880
Close your eyes and think about the sweetness.

148
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,900
Oh, God.

149
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,620
No, no.

150
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,160
No, no.

151
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,600
Actually, this is...

152
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,560
Unfortunately, the oldest one here.

153
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,860
I would love a certain other uber femme to come up here if someone, say, could stand

154
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,900
in front of the camera for a minute or stand behind the camera for a minute because I'm

155
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,740
looking at this beautiful, beautiful space princess who really, I mean...

156
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:08,980
Yeah, come on.

157
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,620
If you want to talk, boys and girls, look.

158
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,740
You have all your microphones here.

159
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,820
No, no, no.

160
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,040
You're going to sit right here.

161
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,800
You want to touch uber femme.

162
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,240
You can share one of them.

163
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,040
Your microphones are all being taken up.

164
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,480
No, they're not.

165
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,080
There's always room for the princess.

166
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,020
I like being at the podium better anyway.

167
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,580
But, you know, if you want to talk about uberfemmes throughout history,

168
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,060
and, I mean, princess, we.

169
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,700
And she's such a princess.

170
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,320
What a dreamboat.

171
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:41,080
She walks into the area, and she just glows, and she smiles,

172
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,340
and she's not at all.

173
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,020
Oh, she found something.

174
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,180
Oh.

175
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,860
It's a heart.

176
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,580
It's a heart.

177
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,500
The princess is happy.

178
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,760
The princess gave me his heart.

179
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,520
Oh.

180
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,780
And the best thing about Wee is that she's always so sweet and so wonderful

181
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,520
that when someone finally pisses her off,

182
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,900
it's the most awesomely beautiful rage anyone's ever seen.

183
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,540
Aw.

184
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,060
Thanks, Sister Pisces.

185
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,580
Aw.

186
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,720
We all just fucking love each other, you know.

187
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,460
We do.

188
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,020
We do.

189
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,720
It's so beautiful.

190
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:17,840
Fuck.

191
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,000
It's so beautiful.

192
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,000


193
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,040
And love each other.

194
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
Unless you're a bitch.

195
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,240
And then we hate you.

196
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,040
But we still love you.

197
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,120
But we still love you, yeah.

198
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,440
We love you with all our hate.

199
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,260
Well, you know, hate and love are really just a red-cut hair away from each other.

200
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,520
They really are.

201
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,260
I mean, that's just the way it is.

202
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,920
If you feel anything that strongly, it's easy to flip over to the other polarity,

203
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,720
which I guess is kind of what this is about,

204
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,760
because we are, in essence, another polarity of the common, average sausage party.

205
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,480
I mean, don't you guys have sisters?

206
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,360
You know?

207
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,240
Cousins?

208
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,940
No, the Church of the Sausage.

209
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,700
You know?

210
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,440
I mean, we're trying here.

211
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,160
We're trying.

212
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,540
How about friend girls?

213
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,820
No friend girls?

214
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,780
Friend girls?

215
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:01,980
Oh.

216
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,940
Oh, a donation has been made for the sunburned.

217
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,520
Now, that is a real gentleman.

218
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,660
The sunburned.

219
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,140
Preferring the proverbial soothing gel.

220
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,660
Yes, yes, yes.

221
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,260
And that's one thing.

222
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,000
One thing I will say I've known about uberfemmes in general

223
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,840
that is a definite interesting trait of us

224
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,140
is that we are often very sweet and very kind and very fun,

225
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,300
but then we turn on a dime and give you five cents change back.

226
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,260
And there's a reason for that.

227
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,660
Just as, you know, someone like Stang would say,

228
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,700
everyone keeps going,

229
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,740
Hey, Stang.

230
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,020
Hey, Stang.

231
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,180
Hey, Stang.

232
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,820
The same people go,

233
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,900
Hey, we.

234
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,460
Hey, we.

235
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:46,600
Hey, we.

236
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:46,900
Hey, we.

237
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,500
I want to tell you something.

238
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,000
Hey, we.

239
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,060
You look really nice.

240
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,520
Hey, we.

241
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,300
Hey, we.

242
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,360
I wanted to talk to you about this great idea I had.

243
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:52,780
Hey, we.

244
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,860
And then they go to Pantyara and go,

245
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,180
Oh, hi, Pantyara.

246
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,100
How are you?

247
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:58,720
And it's,

248
00:09:59,420 --> 00:09:59,500
Hi.

249
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,660
Hey, Pantyara.

250
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,600
Hi.

251
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,620
Hey, can I show this to you?

252
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,740
Hey, look at this.

253
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,980
Oh, my God.

254
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,480
It's such a good idea, you guys.

255
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,340
You should totally do this.

256
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,820
Oh, that one?

257
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,060
No.

258
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:14,820
No.

259
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,380
Yes.

260
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:15,660
No.

261
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:16,620
No.

262
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:16,880
No.

263
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,600
I think we should reveal to the radio listeners

264
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,500
that we are broadcasting this naked since we're at Brushwood.

265
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:23,820
I know.

266
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,380
I mean.

267
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,260
It's true.

268
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,720
So they can picture that.

269
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,820
There are no clothes on the premises.

270
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,620
No clothes allowed.

271
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,080
Awesome.

272
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,180
For the radio listeners, we are all sitting here with our.

273
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,940
Another effing stalker is what that was.

274
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,760
And rubbing together.

275
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,280
Rubbing together.

276
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,540
In the goo that has been obtained.

277
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,540
Yes.

278
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,140
Yes.

279
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,420
Yes.

280
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:46,540
Yes.

281
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,240
It's.

282
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,080
Slimy.

283
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,620
I oppose.

284
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,200
It's a special goo.

285
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,060
It's a little sticky at times.

286
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,080
Yeah.

287
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,640
Just flick it off.

288
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,520
It has an odd smell.

289
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,040
And those who are here will notice that there is a.

290
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,440
Very nicely placed tablecloth.

291
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,420
Which is concealing.

292
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,140
Any motions that could be done with.

293
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,440
Knees or feet or.

294
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,500
Hands.

295
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:07,860
Or.

296
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:08,940
Oh.

297
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,040
Oh, nevermind.

298
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,160
But anyway.

299
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,820
Anyway, you know.

300
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,280
That's for the.

301
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:15,800
That's.

302
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,000
That's.

303
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,940
It's hard to describe the action that is on the stage

304
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,780
and for the radio listeners to really understand it.

305
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,640
And, you know, it seems to be enjoyed in the audience,

306
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,140
and there's a plethora of beautiful breastises.

307
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,080
Oh, yes.

308
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,520
Beautiful breastises.

309
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,920
I'm an expert in observing beautiful breastises,

310
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,800
and there's nothing on this stage.

311
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,960
Ten in a row.

312
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,700
I'd like to say beautiful breastises blowing exposed in the breeze.

313
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,540
Yes, beautiful breastises blowing exposed in the breeze.

314
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,100
And I have an important announcement to make.

315
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,820
If you pay your $30, your breasts will grow.

316
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:55,880
Oh, yeah.

317
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,560
They've grown an entire size.

318
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,260
Yeah, there are some interesting female benefits.

319
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,580
You know, they always say have sex with a live girl.

320
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,160
I mean, that still applies if you're into that as a chick.

321
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,000
You know, it's great.

322
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,600
But, you know, there are other benefits besides, you know,

323
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,940
the pamphlets are always written, unfortunately,

324
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,460
it's a sausage party, you know.

325
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,440
It's kind of like, yeah.

326
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,940
Have sex with a live girl.

327
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,300
But, yes, a lot of interesting hormonal changes occur

328
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,500
when you pay your $30.

329
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,560
That's true.

330
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,560
I have to let you know, why is there nothing in the pamphlet

331
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,280
about once you become a subgenius woman,

332
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,740
you can pee on anybody, and it's, like, amazing,

333
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,480
and they love you, and they'll follow you with rainbows and butterflies.

334
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,120
That's just you pockets.

335
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,720
I think that's just you pockets.

336
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,280
I'm sorry.

337
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,500
I've never, you know, no.

338
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,520
I have to say about the breast thing,

339
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,040
if your breasts are already pretty big,

340
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,740
you probably shouldn't pay too much

341
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,840
because they'll be dragging on the floor.

342
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,440
Yes.

343
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,800
It hurts the nipples.

344
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,320
The weight of my breasts doubled the day I paid my $30.

345
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,500
Reverend Stang, I think anybody that has over double D breast disease

346
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,920
should get a 50% discount on ordnance in the church.

347
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,360
Right.

348
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,360
I think it should be $15.

349
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,400
You have over double D cups.

350
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,800
That's not fair because once I want them.

351
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,400
Well, when you buy them, he'll send you, no, you'll get nothing.

352
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:22,840
You lose.

353
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,060
No.

354
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,000
Sorry.

355
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,380
There's also a lot of nice legs on the stage and a lot of nice.

356
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,760
There's some booty up on the stage.

357
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,700
There's some big booty.

358
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,360
There's a lot of booty on the stage.

359
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:35,840
A lot of booty.

360
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,340
And then, of course, just the amazing beauty that these lovely ladies just emanate.

361
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,000
Booty beauty.

362
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,160
Beautiful booties.

363
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,680
And it's nice because.

364
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,320
Seriously, for those of us who have been around a little bit longer,

365
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,800
and, of course, there's people who have been much longer than I,

366
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,600
pretty much for a long time, you know,

367
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,520
the ladies' showers were always empty during X day.

368
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,020
What ladies' showers?

369
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,760
I thought we all showered together.

370
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,140
Oh, no, no.

371
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,040
As far as I can tell, none of you ever took any showers.

372
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,120
Oh, man.

373
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,300
Thanks a lot, honey.

374
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,120
Bye.

375
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,860
Wah, wah, wah.

376
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,120
We need a cat fight.

377
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:17,660
Come on.

378
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,720
Cat fight.

379
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,380
Rear.

380
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:23,060
I have an interesting subject to ask all of you.

381
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:30,040
Do any of you have any views on why it is that the Connie products in the Church of the Subgenius

382
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,880
do not sell as well as the Bob Dobbs products?

383
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,200
I have an answer.

384
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,660
Go right ahead.

385
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,840
Total fear.

386
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,460
Fear?

387
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,320
Fear.

388
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:40,920
Fear.

389
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,460
Absolutely.

390
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,560
They fear her.

391
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,300
I see.

392
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:43,700
Absolutely.

393
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,000
They fear Connie's cunt.

394
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:45,780
Absolutely.

395
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,000


396
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,760
Trouser wettening fear.

397
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,800
You know, and I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that it hasn't really been explained

398
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,940
how many faces.

399
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,460
Well, Bob has one face, right?

400
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:58,900
Right.

401
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,100
There's only one Bob.

402
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,060
We know what he looks like.

403
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,620
Connie has infinite faces.

404
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,400
And hairstyles.

405
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:05,900
And colors.

406
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,900
And races.

407
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,580
And she is.

408
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:07,780
And cunts.

409
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,420
And the hair is red.

410
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,020
And because Connie is so many different things, it's really hard for most of the general population

411
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,680
to actually be able to know.

412
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,220
To know that's Connie.

413
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:17,620
Good point.

414
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,040
At that moment.

415
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:18,620
Good point.

416
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:27,200
I mean, I've seen Connie as some of this amazingly just gorgeous kawaii little Japanese girl.

417
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,920
And I saw her one time when I was in a rather bad neighborhood.

418
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:38,040
And she had on high heel boots and black booty shorts and a black tube top and a freaking

419
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,780
leather top hat working it.

420
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,620
I think that was Suzy the Flusy.

421
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,060
No, no, no, no, no.

422
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,380
Oh, it wasn't?

423
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,380
It wasn't Suzy the Flusy.

424
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:44,580
But.

425
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,600
No, I don't like.

426
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,740
We should get Suzy a top hat, actually.

427
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,160
Anyway.

428
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,140
She'd wear it well.

429
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,100
But yeah, because Connie is so many different.

430
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,720
I mean, she's the opposite of Bob in a lot of ways, besides just gender and equipment.

431
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,740
But, I mean, she has.

432
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,780
She can show up as so many different faces.

433
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:11,920
The Connie merchandise is that one incarnation of who actually was created by a guy.

434
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,020
Of course.

435
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,560
Who.

436
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,420
Who thought that that was what all the Connie's were.

437
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,780
It was just the Connie that came to him.

438
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,380
You know, that's probably part of the issue, I would say.

439
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,520
I would imagine so.

440
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,940
That's a very good point.

441
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,140
We should probably.

442
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,100
Actually, we should mention some things about while we're up here, because this has been

443
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,880
asked for before.

444
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,860
How not to make an ass of yourself in front of a female.

445
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,080
Actually, as a male who is trying to look for some ooze squirt or sex hurt.

446
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,420
Because this has been.

447
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:49,300
We've been asked a lot from how not to flirt with an uber femme.

448
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:49,800
No.

449
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,520
Well, we can do it from that point or what to do.

450
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,920
How to flirt.

451
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,760
Why don't we do how not to?

452
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,300
Because I think that's probably the more important problem.

453
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,020
So, what I guess we'll ask is, is think about the worst.

454
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,500
I mean, this has been asked for before.

455
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:12,480
I mean, just think about what's something or give us an example of how the type of behavior

456
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,740
that you're not even.

457
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,540
You're there's no chance in hell.

458
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,600
Don't squirt anything on a woman's back.

459
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,200
Yeah, that's all.

460
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,720
In general or on meeting?

461
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,320
Well, yeah, on meeting.

462
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,880
That's not that's not a good way to.

463
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,080
What is that like?

464
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,580
Hello.

465
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,060
No, even before you say hello.

466
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,760
We will not go home with you if you do that.

467
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,140
That's like the.

468
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,280
Even before.

469
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,220
The before the.

470
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,380
Hello.

471
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,220
Initial greeting.

472
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:46,820
It's just like.

473
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,360
And you're like, oh, sorry.

474
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,440
Yeah.

475
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,360
I must have.

476
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,140
That's that's right up there with like coming up behind somebody to give them a hug with

477
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,680
your zipper down and your junk out.

478
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,840
It's kind of like it's kind of like the hole in the popcorn, you know, things that that's

479
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,760
usually a generally a bad sign.

480
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,940
If you feel that you have to pull your junk out to give somebody a hug from behind, that

481
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,140
that's the next step in the relationship with somebody you've recently met.

482
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,640
Yeah.

483
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,560
Yeah.

484
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,560


485
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,560


486
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,560


487
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,560


488
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,560


489
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,560


490
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,560


491
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,560


492
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,560


493
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,560


494
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,560


495
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,560


496
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,560


497
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,560


498
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,560


499
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:14,560


500
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,420
I urge you to reconsider.

501
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,320
Yeah, it's not really.

502
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,260
It's not really.

503
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,720
Sadly, in general, unless you have a masterpiece of junk, generally, it's probably not best

504
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,820
to pull it out until we're on a first name basis.

505
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:28,740
Right.

506
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,320
Usually, you know, when a guy comes up with the line, hi, I'm hard.

507
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,880
You what?

508
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,420
That just doesn't work for me.

509
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:36,980
Yeah.

510
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,320
You need something a little more.

511
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:39,660
Right.

512
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,480
After that.

513
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,000
Do you get the.

514
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,160
Do you.

515
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,480
Of course, you're married in this situation.

516
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,000
So you.

517
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,240
Yeah.

518
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,140
There's a little bit of off limits for you, though.

519
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,480
I'm sure you still get some because.

520
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,120
Well, yeah.

521
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,420
The off limits.

522
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,880
There's some.

523
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,160
I mean, yeah.

524
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,660
I mean, men are human after all.

525
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,760
I mean, some are yetis, but most are human and they're susceptible to the usual feelings

526
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,160
that one would get.

527
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:13,080
I had one time where I was told that the person looked me straight in the eyes and stared

528
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,260
intently in them and said.

529
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
Oh, you have the most beautiful eyes.

530
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,600
I don't fucking know what color they are, but they're beautiful.

531
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,760
That's a winner.

532
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,940
And colorblind, right?

533
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,820
He was colorblind.

534
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,640
He was colorblind.

535
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,580
Now he's just drunk.

536
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,120
That's what I write.

537
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,560
It's like, yeah, I'm sorry.

538
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,340
That's not a good place to start.

539
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,120
But well, Pantiera, can you think of I know you have I've seen you subjected to quite a few

540
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,760
bad lines.

541
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,380
I can't remember them.

542
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,520
They they immediately fall out of my brain as soon as somebody says them.

543
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,140
I immediately ignore them.

544
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,880
But damn, I can't think.

545
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,820
She's chowing down on this meat, by the way.

546
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,380
I'm literally sucking the marrow out of these bones.

547
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,740
That's a hardcore.

548
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,140
Yeah, that's some hardcore eating pockets.

549
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,260
I know pockets is from almost my neck of the woods.

550
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,560
Actually, we're both from the sort of like southern mid-Atlantic.

551
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,940
I'm a little more mountain.

552
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,540
She's a little more Piedmont.

553
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:22,520
But we we both have the same not suffering drunken male fools a lot problem.

554
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,340
I've gotten I've had my share.

555
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,780
I, you know, actually, I write them down.

556
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,560
You do.

557
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,420
I keep track of the lines that I get.

558
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,220
I cherish that.

559
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,280
Yeah.

560
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,440
Well, share some really good ones.

561
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,740
I've had a good place.

562
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,460
Please share this one actually worked out because coincidentally, I am a Pisces.

563
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:43,800
I had a fine drunk fellow come up to me one day and say, Are you a Pisces?

564
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,500
Because I'm an Aquarius and you need my water to swim.

565
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,600
Oh, yeah.

566
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
That was a good one.

567
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,120
That's that's one.

568
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,360
And that makes three Pisces up here then.

569
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,060
Yeah, there's a lot of us actually, if I remember at some point it was brought up because I

570
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,780
believe Reverend Magdalene is one as well.

571
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm an Aries but I'm a Magdalene.

572
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,280
Definitely.

573
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,900
You're on the cusp.

574
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,620
There Yeah, there are a lot of Pisces and females and I think it has to do with the

575
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,560
fact that that we're just crazy enough.

576
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:13,780
Yeah.

577
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:13,780


578
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,320
I would however like to share one more line that is sure.

579
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,560
I cherish it.

580
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,840
I'll remember it till the day I die.

581
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:27,260
I was approached by another drunken man that asked me, baby, is that a keg in your pants?

582
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,800
Because I would really like to tap that ass.

583
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,860
I think you should tell the Perry Como story.

584
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
Oh, I don't know about Perry Como.

585
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,260
We'll see.

586
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,060
Perry Como.

587
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:39,900
Perry Como.

588
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,760
Perry Como.

589
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,240
We want Perry Como.

590
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,440
Perry Como.

591
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:43,980
Oh, Perry Como.

592
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,360
He's my favorite.

593
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,700
Come on with the Como.

594
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:54,060
Perry Como wanted certain oral favors from me as a younger youth drunk in a Florida bar,

595
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,780
and being that I'm classy as well, I said very loudly, F you Perry Como in the bar.

596
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,140
Then I finished my beer.

597
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,780
That's all, it's not the best story ever.

598
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,180
That's a pretty good story.

599
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,160
I like it.

600
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,420
How many people have had the opportunity to say,

601
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,300
fuck you, Perry Como, and mean it?

602
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,260
That's a better question.

603
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,520
My first question was how many people gets the chance to be asked

604
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,980
by Perry Como for oral sex,

605
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,800
and then it dawned on me that probably a lot.

606
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,820
He probably makes a habit out of it.

607
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,140
I think I was supposed to be like, oh, you're Perry Como, let me.

608
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,240
Sister Decadence was approached by Adam West.

609
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,080
Sister Decadence was approached by Adam West?

610
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:41,620
Awesome.

611
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,160
Yes, he wanted the special finish on his massage.

612
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,540
Happy ending?

613
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,460
He was turned down.

614
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,800
She doesn't work in a spa.

615
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,580
No, that's where the shark repellent was.

616
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,640
The shark repellent, yes.

617
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,240
She needed some happy ending repellent on his ass.

618
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,100
I have one line that people tend to use whenever I'm at X Day.

619
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,780
They're like, hey, why did you come over this way

620
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,140
to my house?

621
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,240
They're like, why are you at my tent?

622
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,280
Well, they don't say.

623
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,200
They're just like hinting to do that.

624
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,100
That's another way not to attract women.

625
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,220
Don't tell them to go somewhere alone with you

626
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,780
when you've known them for 20 minutes.

627
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,820
Don't hit them over the head with a stick and drag them

628
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,180
by the hair to your tent.

629
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,180
It doesn't work.

630
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,340
And some of us have really, really, really hard skulls

631
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,300
and it doesn't work anyway.

632
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,040
Not at all.

633
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,780
That means we will become angry.

634
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,160
Why would we get kicked in the balls?

635
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,760
They've tried to knock me out a couple of times.

636
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,400
It's never worked.

637
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,140
Do not ask a lady if she's worth it.

638
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,860
She wants some of this chocolate.

639
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,280
Referring to yourself.

640
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,040
No.

641
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,780
And please, please, under any circumstance,

642
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,660
do not ask us if we want to get pizza and fuck.

643
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,920
We do not like pizza.

644
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,940
As far as, you know, the X-Day situation,

645
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,780
one of the things that needs to be understood is that, you know,

646
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,240
besides that old line from the book,

647
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,400
we're just not that into you.

648
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,900
I mean, that happens.

649
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,400
It does happen.

650
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,520
But one of the things that does happen a lot, I've noticed,

651
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,280
is that there is a tendency towards what I call creepy stalking it.

652
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,560
Where, for example, like, let's say Pantiera is, like,

653
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,780
walking through the field, and I'll notice behind her,

654
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,780
like, about three feet is this guy.

655
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,920
And then, you know, she'll change directions,

656
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,340
and about three feet behind her will be this guy.

657
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,600
And so she comes over to talk to us.

658
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,720
I'm like, hey, Pantiera, what's up?

659
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,000
And then there's this guy.

660
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,280
And then she goes over to another camp, and there's Wee,

661
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,640
and she's like, hi, Wee, how are you doing?

662
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,300
And there's this guy.

663
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,720
And everywhere she goes, there's this guy,

664
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,760
and he shows up just a little bit after her.

665
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,820
Not a way to get laid.

666
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,620
No, there is only one guy that's allowed.

667
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,780
This brings up a really, really, really, really, really good point.

668
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,220
Okay?

669
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,300
I know when Stang and Philo were writing this material,

670
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,200
there was, you know, promises of sex quite a bit.

671
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,160
That doesn't necessarily...

672
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,160
That doesn't necessarily...

673
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,540
The whole sex with the live girl

674
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,020
doesn't necessarily mean that you, personally,

675
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,740
get to have sex with me, personally.

676
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,760
It's not like a ticket where you can go up to any chick and say,

677
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,800
hi, tits, I get to have sex with a live girl.

678
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,620
Redeem it.

679
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,300
Redeem it.

680
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,840
It's not like that.

681
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,780
The key on sex with a live girl is,

682
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,020
and it has been said that, you know, there's been statements,

683
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,700
well, if you can't get laid, actually, you're not trying.

684
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,240
There's a little finesse to it.

685
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,360
There is a little finesse to that.

686
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,780
The truth of the matter is, is that you will, at some point,

687
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:49,100
before the exes come, have sex with a live girl.

688
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,480
And if you don't, I understand, I'm not going to name anyone.

689
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:59,740
But if you don't, then the sex goddesses on the saucers

690
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,320
are giving you your own live girl.

691
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:03,880
Right.

692
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,960
So you don't have to...

693
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,900
She may not have a brain, and she may be a clone.

694
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,460
It won't be perfectly realistic.

695
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,540
It's still a girl.

696
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,380
It's still a...

697
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:11,380


698
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:11,380


699
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:11,380


700
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,300
It's still a live girl.

701
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,860
You will get this no matter what.

702
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,500
They just...

703
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
Please, please, I understand the nature,

704
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,100
because if you can beat off in 2.5 seconds,

705
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,560
I'm sure that you think that it's that easy to get a woman.

706
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,600
But it's not.

707
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,100
Just because you can do it that quickly

708
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,300
doesn't mean you can come up and say,

709
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,060
hey, let's fuck.

710
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,040
There's a little more to that.

711
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,220
It's just you won't get it.

712
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,080
Well, you know what, though?

713
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,720
Hey, let's fuck.

714
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,640
Let's be straight about this,

715
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,220
because if it comes down to it, me personally,

716
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,100
I somewhat prefer that,

717
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,040
because then we can just go and break through all the bullshit.

718
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,880
You're not talking to me.

719
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,700
You're not trying to be friendly.

720
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,160
You're not saying,

721
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,260
hey, I got some beer back at my camp,

722
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,920
and we got some really cool picture books.

723
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,500
No.

724
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,580
Instead, what happens is you say,

725
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,420
hey, I'd like to fuck you,

726
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,300
and I say,

727
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,700
probably no.

728
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:55,840
Yes.

729
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,440
Pockets.

730
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,060
I'd like to fuck you.

731
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:00,940
Okay.

732
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,000
See?

733
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,300
It works.

734
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,300
Woo!

735
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,620
It works.

736
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,860
Praise Bob.

737
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,020
Praise Bob.

738
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,120
Now, and again,

739
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,520
I would probably say no,

740
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,480
but then Pockets in this case said yes,

741
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,480
but you see,

742
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:23,120
that could be the live girl for that Yeti.

743
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,360
You can't just fuck any girl.

744
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,580
You got to find the right one.

745
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,000
It's a matching game.

746
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,960
It really is.

747
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,060
And here's the thing about the matching game,

748
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,620
boys and girls,

749
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,140
because here's the important part of what I was bringing up earlier.

750
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,180
The matching game works this way,

751
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,100
because some of these girls who are your match,

752
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,660
or who are your match,

753
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,060
haven't joined the church yet.

754
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,620
The only way you are going to get your match,

755
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,480
if that's the case,

756
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,080
before the saucers arrive,

757
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,900
is to encourage more tits in this church.

758
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,960
It's really that simple.

759
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,720
That's how you get your match.

760
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,400
And so just because you say,

761
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,620
Pisces, I really want to fuck the shit out of you,

762
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,120
and I say,

763
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,400
um, sorry, no,

764
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,580
doesn't mean that it's over.

765
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,080
Right?

766
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,860
It means that next time you have some subgenius propaganda

767
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,600
in your pocket on the bus,

768
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,880
and you see a girl that's kind of like,

769
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,220
Picking her nose.

770
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,160
I'd do her.

771
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,500
You can hand over some subgenius information,

772
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,840
or leave it nearby and let her read it,

773
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,540
and who knows,

774
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,640
you may show up next time some subgenius event occurs,

775
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,440
and there she will be.

776
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,280
There she will be,

777
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,240
and that could be your real live girl.

778
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,980
She's on the screen behind you.

779
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,620
It could be your true Yeti mate.

780
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,260
Right.

781
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,480
But until we get more chicks in the church,

782
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,580
some of you boys are going to be

783
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,000
whacking off in 2.5 seconds.

784
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,480
I'm sorry.

785
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,600
So I think the mission for all you Yetis out there,

786
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,400
for, well, I guess the next, what, two, three days,

787
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,800
because this is the year,

788
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,660
Yes, it is.

789
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,660
is to find as many women as you can

790
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,420
that are worthy of the ordainment,

791
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,220
and bring them in.

792
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,300
We need Uberfams,

793
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,620
and you will get laid,

794
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,500
if you find your match.

795
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,240
And again,

796
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,020
this is the year,

797
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,900
so some of you don't be totally disheartened.

798
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,400
As we said,

799
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,220
the sex goddesses will be providing you

800
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,020
with a real live girl, too.

801
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,180
Absolutely.

802
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,380
This is definitely the year.

803
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,240
This is the year.

804
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,920
This is the year.

805
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,220
You know why I know this is the year?

806
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,660
You can feel it.

807
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,440
I can smell it.

808
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,300
I can smell it.

809
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,880
I can smell it.

810
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:31,980
I can smell it.

811
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,020
I can smell it.

812
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,600
I've heard a lot of great sex this year.

813
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:34,820
Me too.

814
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,440
I mean, not just me.

815
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,040
Me too.

816
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,460
Yeah.

817
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,420
Oh my God.

818
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:37,920
There is a good sex.

819
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,080
The amount you can walk,

820
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,020
just be, okay,

821
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,400
and you're not actually getting the great sex.

822
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,840
Look, walk very quietly through the campground

823
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,180
around 4 a.m. or so.

824
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,520
That's when the great sex seems to start.

825
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,800
And you can hear it from tent after tent after tent.

826
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,340
There is some serious grooving going on this year.

827
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,240
And we've said before that there must be some signal

828
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,100
that contacts the exes.

829
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,800
More sex.

830
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,840
You know, I'm sure that with the more sex,

831
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,920
I don't know,

832
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,820
I mean, some people were woke up,

833
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,940
I think a lot of people were woke up in the past couple of nights,

834
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,080
but that's,

835
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,080
if we can wake up our neighbors in the next tent with our sex,

836
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,620
perhaps that will be the noise that is needed

837
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,360
to call the exes from the heavens.

838
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,740
More sex.

839
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:25,660
Absolutely.

840
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
You want the exes.

841
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,140
We need more sex.

842
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,940
To have more sex,

843
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,060
you need more titties in the church.

844
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,140
Loud sex.

845
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,500
Loud sex.

846
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,940
Good sex.

847
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,220
Good sex is always loud and funny.

848
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,080
It's always good sex.

849
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,620
Right.

850
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
And this is again,

851
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:40,800
this is a great thing.

852
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:40,800


853
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,600
This is why we need you to work to find more women for the church,

854
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,560
because your woman,

855
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,020
who you're going to have good sex with,

856
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,940
is out there,

857
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,420
and she just hasn't found Bob yet.

858
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,320
So it is your duty to help her find Bob.

859
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,040
And you know what else?

860
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,160
The buddy you're sitting next to you right now,

861
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,160
look over at him,

862
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,360
because his live girl is out there.

863
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,380
She has not joined the church yet.

864
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,660
Do your buddy a favor.

865
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,920
He needs to get some.

866
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,060
Start showing girls about Bob.

867
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,620
It's really that simple.

868
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,840
That's all you have to do.

869
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:09,980
Look,

870
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
he'll help you out.

871
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,800
He'll hand the car to a girl on his bus.

872
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,660
She will show up,

873
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,000
and you will get the best sex ever.

874
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,860
You do the same when you're riding the train into the city.

875
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,600
Go ahead.

876
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,860
Pass out that Bob information.

877
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,040
Bring more tits to this church.

878
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,560
Praise Bob.

879
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,360
Praise Bob.

880
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:25,520
Praise Bob.

881
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,380
Lick Connie.

882
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,360
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.

883
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:28,700
Well,

884
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,740
I have a little secret.

885
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:37,260
I happen to know that Susie the floozy has brought an inordinate number of Mardi Gras beads.

886
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,540
So there should be lots more tits showing up.

887
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:39,560
Woo!

888
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,500
Lots more tits going around here.

889
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,260
More tits.

890
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:43,780
More tits.

891
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:48,260
She must have brought like 500 pounds of Mardi Gras beads.

892
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:48,500
Oh,

893
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,060
I see titties in the near future.

894
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,080
There could be more.

895
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:51,580
She said,

896
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,620
she said when she held up her gigantic pile,

897
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:53,980
she said,

898
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,140
yeah,

899
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,740
I brought a few.

900
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:55,840
A few.

901
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,540
A few.

902
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,080
A few.

903
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,140
And Susie the floozy,

904
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,620
and I know she had a rough drive in here.

905
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,140
She has been,

906
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,200
she got here by herself,

907
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,440
and she's tired.

908
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,060
And what a vision she is,

909
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,060
no matter what.

910
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,560
That is the truth.

911
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:09,780
She's got angels,

912
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,440
uh,

913
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,660
whacking off next to her at all points.

914
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:14,740
I,

915
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,340
I mean really.

916
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,060
That's for sure.

917
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,680
When she rolled in,

918
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,360
looking like a,

919
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,340
like a angel glowing in the sunlight.

920
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,620
She excrimeticates pure slack.

921
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,180
That was the angel.

922
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,360
She really does.

923
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:23,900
She just,

924
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,480
just craps out pure slack.

925
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,440
It's amazing.

926
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,820
I don't understand it.

927
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,700
When I,

928
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,260
when I grow up.

929
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,240
People fight to smell her poop.

930
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:31,880
When I grow up,

931
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,740
I want to be Susie.

932
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,440
When I grow up,

933
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,440
I want to excrimeticate pure slack.

934
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,920
There's a trick to it.

935
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,440
We can,

936
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:38,780
we can,

937
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,100
yes.

938
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,540
Well,

939
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,440
she'll,

940
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,660
she'll take an understudy,

941
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,040
I'm sure.

942
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:42,420
Yeah,

943
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:42,720
I mean,

944
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,180
well,

945
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:43,880
I mean,

946
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,300
call me.

947
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:44,800
Yes,

948
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,040
there's,

949
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,320
there's,

950
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,680
there's certain tricks that.

951
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,460
I'm going to ask,

952
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:53,660
uh,

953
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:54,800
well,

954
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,040
well,

955
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,520
let's,

956
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,760
you want to open the field for questions?

957
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:57,720
Oh,

958
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,200
yeah.

959
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:58,740
Yeah.

960
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,140
Open the field for questions.

961
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:00,620
Okay.

962
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:00,920
Look,

963
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,440
Tits is,

964
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,260
Tits,

965
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,400
Tits would like to know,

966
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,740
wouldn't it be better to recruit other women to the cause by handing out Connie instead

967
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,520
of Susie?

968
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:09,520


969
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,880
And that's certainly a possibility.

970
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,360
Here's one of the things that I will digress just momentarily.

971
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,600
Sometimes with telling people about Bob,

972
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,280
you don't necessarily have to go about it the way of say pamphlet one or pamphlet two.

973
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,920
There's a lot of back doors and other entry ways.

974
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,300
And that's another thing good about.

975
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,120
And I,

976
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
some of us,

977
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,800
and I know myself and Pantiera both have had our own outreach ministries in various

978
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,200
ways.

979
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,520
And I,

980
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


981
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


982
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


983
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


984
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


985
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


986
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


987
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


988
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


989
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


990
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


991
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


992
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


993
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


994
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


995
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


996
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


997
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


998
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:39,520


999
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,800
and everybody does it a little different.

1000
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,160
Pantiera was all about,

1001
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:42,500
man,

1002
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,800
you work the postal service.

1003
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,520
Yeah.

1004
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,120
I only got one reply though.

1005
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,620
That was from an 80 year old man.

1006
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,060
But I'm sure,

1007
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,000
you know,

1008
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,160
I,

1009
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,440
you know,

1010
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,300
he could have been a rich oil man and you could have married him and,

1011
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,540
uh,

1012
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,740
got yourself a trend spot commercial or no,

1013
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,520
but you,

1014
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:01,740
everyone,

1015
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,440
everyone has their different ways of outreach.

1016
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,240
And I used to do it based on what the market was.

1017
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:06,520
I mean,

1018
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,960
it's really like that's what we're talking about.

1019
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,500
This is a church,

1020
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,980
And so you've got a great point.

1021
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,920
It is about the market.

1022
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,560
For example, when I would go to science fiction conventions,

1023
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,340
at a science fiction convention, those of you who have gone,

1024
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,680
there is a lot of guys who are going to be jerking off that night.

1025
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,040
I mean, there just really is.

1026
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,380
There's a lot of girls who are completely unattainable,

1027
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,220
and there's a lot of guys who are going to be jerking off that night.

1028
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,520
So most of my promotion at what I would talk about, Bob,

1029
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:36,220
at the science fiction conventions was from the concept of the saucers and the sex goddesses,

1030
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,980
and that was a way to handle that.

1031
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,460
You are exactly on point.

1032
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,700
I encourage you to do that.

1033
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,280
I think that's great.

1034
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,440
Next.

1035
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,960
Oh, come on.

1036
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:51,660
No questions for all of these women sitting up here?

1037
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,180
Not a single question?

1038
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:53,960
Yes, Sting.

1039
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,420
How is Bambi formed?

1040
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,180
Just forget the whole thing I said earlier about the live sex girl thing.

1041
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,960
You see, when a man loves sex,

1042
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,300
when a man loves a woman very much,

1043
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,040
he puts his hands in her,

1044
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,060
and then things happen.

1045
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,520
We're not talking about finger babies.

1046
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,440
Oh, oh.

1047
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,500
Oh, well.

1048
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,180
I've had lots of those.

1049
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:19,800
When a man and a woman

1050
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,280
and then mudkips

1051
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:21,540
and alcohol

1052
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,680
they forget everything they did the night before,

1053
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,180
and then the woman gets pregnant.

1054
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,340
Suddenly.

1055
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,700
That's how it was meant to be.

1056
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,760
It was meant to be, right.

1057
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,980
Next question.

1058
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,380
Motomac.

1059
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,660
A comment, what you said earlier, introducing women to the church who are coming.

1060
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,700
As for the saying politely, how much comedy merchandise is sold?

1061
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,640
We had a discussion about that earlier.

1062
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,180
We actually have been through this, Motomac, yes.

1063
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,200
If you have been paying attention.

1064
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,820
Please take notes when the Uber fans are speaking.

1065
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,400
Thank you.

1066
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,640
There will be a pop quiz.

1067
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,180
I was off track.

1068
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,680
This does count.

1069
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,020
Oh, okay.

1070
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,960
This does count.

1071
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,060
This does count towards your final grade.

1072
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:09,560
Thank you.

1073
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:09,760


1074
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,740
He did do extra credit there, he said, so I guess that's okay.

1075
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,520
I mean, you know, I always curve on it anyway.

1076
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,440
I have a question.

1077
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,020
Yes.

1078
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,540
Would it be easier to recruit the Sporian women?

1079
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,160
Would it be?

1080
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,420
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1081
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,360
I actually know about, there's a couple of us who know a lot about this,

1082
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,060
and let me just explain something really quickly, okay.

1083
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,620
I made the mistake years ago of fucking both Connie and Eris on the same night,

1084
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,640
and it's a really.

1085
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,940
That's a bad.

1086
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,460
That's a really bad mistake.

1087
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,380
No, yes it was.

1088
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,460
That's a really bad mistake.

1089
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:41,940
It was.

1090
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,820
And actually, Eris was first, so it was really, really bad.

1091
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,960
So basically, because Connie really hates sloppy seconds.

1092
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,320
And so here's the thing about this, is that the Discordian female

1093
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:00,820
and the Eris-Connie connection, it can only be pulled off

1094
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,760
by a true hardcore Uber femme, who really can be stupid enough,

1095
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,420
to screw Connie and Eris in the same night.

1096
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,400
I do have a comment on that when you are done.

1097
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:12,680
Yes, okay.

1098
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:18,680
I've tried several, and what I've found is that you can get a Discordian

1099
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:25,640
to become a subgenius, but it takes about a year and a half.

1100
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,340
Really?

1101
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,840
That's not a bad incubation period.

1102
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,700
It's not bad.

1103
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,580
Really?

1104
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,580
You have to plant the seed in their belly button.

1105
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,460
You have to slowly plant the seed.

1106
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,740
The $30 for a turnip.

1107
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:37,740


1108
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:37,740


1109
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:37,740


1110
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:37,740


1111
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:37,740


1112
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:37,740


1113
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:37,740


1114
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:37,740


1115
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:37,740


1116
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:37,740


1117
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:37,740


1118
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:37,740


1119
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:37,740


1120
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,280
The seed of doubt.

1121
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,420
The seed of doubt grinds their gears.

1122
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,880
It tickles their Uber femme skin.

1123
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,600
They can't stand it.

1124
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:41,600


1125
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,300
They tickle their ovaries.

1126
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:49,240
So you kind of have to talk Discord to the future subgenius.

1127
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,680
You've got to trick them into it.

1128
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,260
Pay your $30.

1129
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,480
Or don't.

1130
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,020
Whatever.

1131
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,240
And just walk away.

1132
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:55,780
Right, right, right.

1133
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,360
Make it mysterious.

1134
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:57,780
Yeah.

1135
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,860
I mean, for me, I found both of them very close at the same time, actually.

1136
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,580
So it was a little, I guess it was easier to convert me.

1137
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,180
Hmm.

1138
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,840
And this is a good question, which is a good insight into Uber femmes.

1139
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:14,820
And we can ask, how did you find subgenius?

1140
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,720
Since we're talking about how to get more women into the church.

1141
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
How did, for we, for example, how did you find subgenius?

1142
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,060
Well, I was part of a group called the Association for Consciousness Exploration

1143
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:30,940
that had the Starwood Festival here for the last 19 summers.

1144
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,740
And someone in our group was well-read enough to...

1145
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,240
Oh, yeah.

1146
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,300
...ask Ivan Stang to come and speak at Starwood.

1147
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,560
And that's how I met Ivan and Bob and all of you.

1148
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:44,840
Right.

1149
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:45,820
Awesome.

1150
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:46,760
Awesome.

1151
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,540
That's sweet.

1152
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,380
Aww.

1153
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,880
Oh, no, no, no.

1154
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,400
Do you need tissue?

1155
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,200
And then you fucked.

1156
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:51,880
And it was beautiful.

1157
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,360
I think my vagina's crying.

1158
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,000
Okay.

1159
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,180
Well, can I say something about the woman who's the right?

1160
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:57,400
Get at me.

1161
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,620
She found Bob, but to make it official, I told her if she didn't go online right now

1162
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,880
and pay her $30, I was going to effing kill her.

1163
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,380
And now she's an uber-fem.

1164
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:06,740
Yes.

1165
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,360
Wow.

1166
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,560
That's a hard-fisted approach.

1167
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,260
Go fuck it.

1168
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:10,620
That's work.

1169
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:18,560
I had a crush on this boy, and he's actually wearing a skirt now, so I don't know what

1170
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,460
the hell I was doing.

1171
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,200
It's a kilt.

1172
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:20,780
No.

1173
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,560
That's a utility kilt.

1174
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:22,820
That's not a skirt.

1175
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,680
Are you wearing underwear underneath that kilt, by the way?

1176
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,160
No.

1177
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,720
No, he's not.

1178
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,300
I dropped a quarter.

1179
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,320
Could you pick it up for me?

1180
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,620
Praise Bob.

1181
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,400
Praise Bob.

1182
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,820
Well, I had a crush on this boy for about three years.

1183
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:34,840
Oh, wow.

1184
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:34,840


1185
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:34,840


1186
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:34,840


1187
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:34,840


1188
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:44,000
And we got back in contact with each other, and he introduced me to Bob and to Tiny Chat

1189
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:55,160
and a year ago yesterday, which coincidentally is also my vaginal ejection day, is my sub-birthday,

1190
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,840
because that's when I got my card in the mail on my birthday.

1191
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:58,320
Nice.

1192
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,080
Awesome.

1193
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,020
Aw.

1194
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,060
That's so touching.

1195
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:01,540
And then you fucked.

1196
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,200
And then they fucked.

1197
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:03,800
They fucked.

1198
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,720
And how about you, Miss Pockets?

1199
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,760
Well, I was kind of slack about it.

1200
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,820
I found Bob back in high school.

1201
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,060
I guess I was a big old gimme Bob.

1202
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,000
I love Bob.

1203
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:16,720
Praise Bob.

1204
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,340
And then I went.

1205
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,280
I had the good slack attitude.

1206
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,620
And then I got knocked up.

1207
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,860
I kind of forgot about Bob for a while, doing the kid thing.

1208
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,660
And then, you know, my kid got old enough, went to school.

1209
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,840
I had some more free time.

1210
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,340
And I said, oh, Bob.

1211
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:34,860
Praise Bob.

1212
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,980
And, you know, I got more into it.

1213
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,540
And so finally, you know, I went on my internets and I paid my ordainment.

1214
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,300
Approximately how long did that take you?

1215
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,260
To actually pay from when I found Bob?

1216
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:48,540
Yeah.

1217
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:50,840
Ten years.

1218
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,560
So you were talking earlier about 1.5 being long.

1219
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,480
That's what I'm getting at.

1220
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,340
You know, a lot of people take that long.

1221
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,240
And it wasn't a lack of just laziness.

1222
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,240
That's the gestation period of a subgenius.

1223
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:01,520
Yes.

1224
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,140
And, Pantiera, what about you?

1225
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:09,660
Well, I was in the same dorm as Reverend Alex, who he hasn't been here for like the past

1226
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,000
three or four years or something.

1227
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:19,280
But he, you know, he was like the young superstar sort of, I don't know.

1228
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,920
But everybody liked him, I guess, at that point.

1229
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,500
He was popular.

1230
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,400
He was popular.

1231
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,120
Yes.

1232
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,680
And so he invited me.

1233
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:33,120
While we were living in the dorm together, he introduced me to Reverend Alex.

1234
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,120


1235
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,120


1236
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,120


1237
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,120


1238
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,120


1239
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,120


1240
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,940
And I was like, I'm going to go to the church.

1241
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:41,300
And the first subgenius book I ever read was Revelation X, which is an excellent indoctrination

1242
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,180
book, even better than the original book of the subgenius.

1243
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:44,540
I concur.

1244
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,200
Yes.

1245
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:45,880
It's excellent.

1246
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,520
I was obsessed with it.

1247
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,020
And then he took me to X Day.

1248
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,380
And we never did anything together.

1249
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,260
But I've met others.

1250
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,920
You found Bob together, dear.

1251
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,120
Yes.

1252
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:56,320
That's it.

1253
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,020
Yes.

1254
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,180
Yeah, well, that doesn't mean anything.

1255
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,400
My story is so lame.

1256
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,100
I'm sorry.

1257
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,100


1258
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,100


1259
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,100


1260
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,740
Okay, like, we'll break this down.

1261
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,320
And this is how it happened.

1262
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,780
There's this dude, right?

1263
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,880
And I had a relationship with him.

1264
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,120
It wasn't a relationship as in, like, lovey relationship.

1265
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:17,960
It was a relationship as I go over to his house, get fucked up, and we have sex.

1266
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,080
And that was all it was.

1267
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,520
And this went on for a couple of months.

1268
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,040
We were happy.

1269
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:24,760
No problem.

1270
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,080
One day, he wouldn't have sex because he couldn't stop talking about some stupid fucker named

1271
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,740
Bob Doves.

1272
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,500
And I was like...

1273
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,100
That's kind of a good thing.

1274
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,100


1275
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,180
I'm an oxymoron, but fuck you.

1276
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,980
And I was like, what the fuck are you talking about?

1277
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,080
Look, you're cutting into the booty time.

1278
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,760
Let's get on and have sex.

1279
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,500
And he was like, no, no, no, I have to show you this website.

1280
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,560
I have to do this.

1281
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,100
I have to do this.

1282
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:47,620
And at that point, I was like, fine, I'll fucking pay it.

1283
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,080
I paid the membership.

1284
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,440
And then later, I started hanging out on IRC and things like that.

1285
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,720
And the dude who introduced me to him, I haven't seen him since the one time he came to XC.

1286
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,680
He's a fucking blonde.

1287
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,600
So I don't know.

1288
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,000
Surprised.

1289
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,380
Surprised, yeah.

1290
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,360
And then his loss.

1291
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,700
He got married in a minivan and forgot about Bob.

1292
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:13,080
I think it might have been like he became a baby daddy or something.

1293
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,440
I don't know.

1294
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:24,360
Don't let becoming a baby daddy or a baby mama turn you away from the church.

1295
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,980
Just get a babysitter.

1296
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,300
Right.

1297
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:32,820
Don't slip into normality once you've paid the $30, because then you won't get taken

1298
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:37,300
up into the saucers, even though you've paid your $30, because Bob can smell the pinkness

1299
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,360
that's rubbed off on you.

1300
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,100
This is true.

1301
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:44,540
I am living proof that you can become a baby mama and still be a subgenius woman.

1302
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,160
Exactly.

1303
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,540
And a hot baby mama.

1304
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,080
Damn straight.

1305
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,100
Hot damn baby mama.

1306
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,200
MILF.

1307
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,240
That's why I married you.

1308
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,600
This is true.

1309
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,020
This is true.

1310
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,880
You need to teach your children about slack.

1311
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,580
Teach your children about slack, and then they will grow up to be future females.

1312
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:02,800
And then they will be like, I'm not a baby.

1313
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:02,800


1314
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:02,800


1315
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:02,800


1316
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:02,800


1317
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:02,800


1318
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:02,800


1319
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,240
That is true.

1320
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:29,240
I need to be very, very bold and very round.

1321
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:29,480
Wait till you see me in my 20th birthday.

1322
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:29,480


1323
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:29,480


1324
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:29,580
Look what I did.

1325
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:29,580


1326
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:30,600
Look what I did to my Allison, my royal aunt, my queen mata, my princess m 8 зрsak prey,

1327
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:30,600


1328
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:30,600


1329
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,340
I loved doing baby rowing.

1330
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:31,640
I loved photographs.

1331
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,740
I loved telling my grandchildren.

1332
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:32,740


1333
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:32,740


1334
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,120
No!

1335
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:33,920
No!

1336
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,440
I hate Bob.

1337
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,160
I hate Bob.

1338
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,460
That's the point.

1339
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:38,620
But they'll get over it.

1340
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,860
After they're about in their 20s, they'll realize that you're right,

1341
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,440
and they'll forsake Jesus, and they'll accept Bob into their urethras.

1342
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,040
Do we have any other questions?

1343
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,520
Come on.

1344
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,520
Any more questions?

1345
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,400
Come on, you have a question.

1346
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,260
We are women and have vaginas, and we can do whatever we want.

1347
00:44:59,520 --> 00:44:59,960
That's exactly right.

1348
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,760
Praise Bob.

1349
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,580
Praise Bob.

1350
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:02,740
Hail Connie.

1351
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,200
Hey, we have a question.

1352
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:04,600
Yes.

1353
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,540
What list?

1354
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,120
Remember you were taking notes earlier for things not to do to get laid?

1355
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:15,080
Okay, another thing not to do to get laid is make us repeat ourselves.

1356
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,460
We don't like it.

1357
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,760
That's not how you get laid.

1358
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,080
That's how you get fucked.

1359
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:21,900
Yes.

1360
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,100
Yes, yes, yes.

1361
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:26,920
It's recorded.

1362
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:27,820
Don't worry about it.

1363
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,740
Ask for help.

1364
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:29,560
Ask for help.

1365
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,560
Yeah, that's an interesting one.

1366
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,380
Ask for help.

1367
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,260
Yeah, yeah.

1368
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,120
Yeah, you know, actually, I'm not going to say much about that, because I got to tell

1369
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,440
you something.

1370
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,940
Uber femme women are the most stubbornest fucking bitches on this goddamn planet.

1371
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:41,760
Yeah, we are.

1372
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:42,400
Woo!

1373
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,160
Amen.

1374
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:43,980
You said that right.

1375
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:49,120
We are ornery, and we are stubborn, and we are just difficult.

1376
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,660
We are ornery to the 15th power.

1377
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,640
But we're kind of, but I don't know.

1378
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,080
Especially next time.

1379
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,120
I think we're kind of worth it.

1380
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,720
Because, you know, we're on our guard.

1381
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,020
We, there's, it's like a ratio of one.

1382
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,480
Woman to four men.

1383
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,120
Right.

1384
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,320
And we have to be on our guard, and we're getting sun poisoning, and.

1385
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,180
Or melanoma.

1386
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:09,860
Yeah.

1387
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,780
And so, you know.

1388
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,080
And probably a little bit hungover, you know, and.

1389
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:15,820
Yeah.

1390
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,680
I love that we laugh over cancer.

1391
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:20,680
Praise Bob.

1392
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:21,920
Praise Bob.

1393
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:26,000
Well, I mean, and we are ornery, we are difficult.

1394
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:30,120
And yes, but I do think most of the time when you, when you find the right Uber femme, you'll

1395
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:30,940
find it's worth it.

1396
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,280
I'm staying in.

1397
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,420
We are an incredible example of that coupling, actually.

1398
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:35,680
Yeah.

1399
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:40,500
Honestly, of a lot of, there's a, there's several couples I know like that have this trait, but

1400
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,720
it's very strong in them in the sense of we is the only person who can take stank shit

1401
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,580
and stings.

1402
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,540
Probably the only person who can take we shit.

1403
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,840
You said that perfectly.

1404
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,440
Absolutely right.

1405
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,600
You see, here's a big clue.

1406
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,780
Here's a clue in relationships that I will share with you.

1407
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,080
The number one rule of, of, of subgenius relationships.

1408
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,660
It probably applies to pinks, but I don't know.

1409
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,740
Cause I don't, I try not to do anything with them is.

1410
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,560
Everyone is crazy.

1411
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,680
Everyone, everyone's bat shit.

1412
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:11,880
The clue and the key, the thing that you have to do is find the compatible crazy to your crazy.

1413
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,720
The problem is, is that since everyone's crazy, that's a long, hard road.

1414
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,040
And how.

1415
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:20,960
And how.

1416
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,180
Okay.

1417
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,460
And Dr. How.

1418
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,480
And Dr. How.

1419
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,080
Dr. How.

1420
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,060
I like Dr. How's brain.

1421
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,740
I think he has an incredibly sexy brain.

1422
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:30,800
And, and that's, you know, it's just.

1423
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,560
It protrudes right through your brain.

1424
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:31,560


1425
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,020
It's like a little bit of a trim his skull.

1426
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,460
It's, it's, it's, it's incredibly hot.

1427
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:35,380
It's got nice curves.

1428
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,740
We want to lick your brain.

1429
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,280
I mean, I want, I, I wish you could like take the brain out and have my brain, like

1430
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,040
get it on with just his brain.

1431
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,960
Brain babies.

1432
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,180
I mean, that would rock.

1433
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:50,900
She wants to have Snoo Snoo with Dr. How's brain.

1434
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,480
Snoo Snoo.

1435
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,140
Me want Snoo Snoo.

1436
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:01,540
Well, the brain is the largest sex organ.

1437
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,320
I mean, I want to have a little bit of a sex organ on the body.

1438
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,300
When the saucers come, we shall come as well.

1439
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,020
Yes.

1440
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:07,580
Yes, we shall.

1441
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,380
That is, that is, that is one of the things that you have to understand.

1442
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:15,420
So, you know, I mean, that's the advantage of being naked at 7 a.m. if you're interested.

1443
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,000
It's cleaner.

1444
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,140
If we get naked, do we get on the ship sooner?

1445
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,160
You don't have to experience this.

1446
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,340
You don't have to experience the clothing removal part.

1447
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,780
And also the mess that happens right when the, the mess.

1448
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:30,940
I understand.

1449
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,120
Yeah.

1450
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:31,180
Yeah.

1451
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:31,440
The mess.

1452
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:31,800
The mess.

1453
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,260
The mess.

1454
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,220
I expected the mess.

1455
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,220
If you're naked, it's, it's an easier step because when they bring you up, they will

1456
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:40,620
just sort of hose off the mess and they don't have to take the clothes off first.

1457
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,620
So yes, in theory, a few seconds faster because your clothing are, you don't have any clothing

1458
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,360
to remove, but they can just hose off the mess.

1459
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,400
That's love.

1460
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,140
I mean.

1461
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:53,920
I also feel that the women with over double D boobies should get like the best saucer,

1462
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,360
kind of like first class accommodations.

1463
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,320
What about the men with double D boobies?

1464
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,880
Maybe leather seats, a little more leg room.

1465
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,700
A nicer, a nicer balcony.

1466
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:01,380
Yeah.

1467
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:01,900
Yeah.

1468
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:02,440
Yeah.

1469
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,320
Here's the catch.

1470
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,040
Here's the catch.

1471
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,080
Cause I'm in this line.

1472
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10,840
Once you get on the saucer, your breasts will expand to like triple J's.

1473
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,080
So we'll all be happy.

1474
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,920
Oh, praise the Uber fans.

1475
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,540
Unless you don't want them.

1476
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,280
Well, you know, and that's the thing though, is that that's part of the thing that people

1477
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,180
forget about the sex goddesses is they are doing their, they have a list.

1478
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:28,260
I mean, it's like, it's like going to the best Chinese restaurant ever, except for on

1479
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,960
the menu is all the augmentations.

1480
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,360
The augmentations.

1481
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,440
And the changes.

1482
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:33,760
And there's no MSG.

1483
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:34,720
It's great.

1484
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:39,840
You can say, look, you know, I've lived my whole life in my left tit sags a little bit

1485
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,640
more than my right.

1486
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,620
And it's really gotten on my nerves.

1487
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:42,620
I don't care if you're 80.

1488
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,720
Once you get on that saucer, you will have the perky is most beautiful, roundest, hugest

1489
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,960
tits on the face of this planet.

1490
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,920
You'll have better tits than we'll be on this planet even.

1491
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,160
You will no longer have to tuck them into your socks.

1492
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,240
Well, let's talk about that for a second too.

1493
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:01,340
We're going to talk about that in a second.

1494
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:01,340


1495
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:01,340


1496
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:01,340


1497
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:01,340


1498
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:05,140
One of the things about sex gods and sex goddesses is that the sex goddesses come with a variety

1499
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:05,620
of attachments.

1500
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,980
These sex goddesses have more attachments than the standard electro looks that your

1501
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,300
grandmother had back in 1940.

1502
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:16,120
These sex goddesses have the capability to morph and change into anything that you could

1503
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,020
possibly want.

1504
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:24,440
So if for some reason you really want to fuck Milton Berle, the sex goddesses will do that

1505
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,040
for you.

1506
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,340
You know, and some of you, some of you may have heard of the sex goddesses.

1507
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:31,340


1508
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:31,340


1509
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:31,340


1510
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:31,340


1511
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:31,340


1512
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:31,340


1513
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:31,340


1514
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,400
They have had some concerns that they are aliens.

1515
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,820
They might not know what to do.

1516
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,060
You know it's okay.

1517
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,340
You can bring some porn, show them, but you don't really need to worry about it.

1518
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,280
They know what to do.

1519
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:40,600
They do.

1520
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,700
They know.

1521
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:42,460
They're ready.

1522
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,760
Praise Bob in the hands of our-

1523
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,780
And you can get them with the handles built into the head so you can kind of just

1524
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,520
turn them.

1525
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,280
Mind I add that gender is a pink social construction.

1526
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:59,200
So whether you call them sex gods or sex goddesses, it doesn't matter.

1527
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,280
They're the same damn thing.

1528
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:00,740
Right.

1529
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:01,500
They are.

1530
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:02,280
It's all about the catch.

1531
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,680
And the great thing about that is, is that if you happen to be a boy who likes other,

1532
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,220
who wants to fuck Milton Berle, you can fuck Milton Berle.

1533
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,860
If you have to be a female who wants to fuck Wilford Brimley, you can fuck Wilford Brimley.

1534
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:13,340
It's okay.

1535
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:16,340
I'd really prefer that Perry Cuomo didn't come on the ships though.

1536
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,320
I don't think I'd ever think about that.

1537
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,620
No Perry Cuomo on the ships.

1538
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:23,280
No, no, no.

1539
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,960
I think we can, we can arrange for that.

1540
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,340
That is one creepy old man.

1541
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,880
It can be arranged most definitely.

1542
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,300
But hey, if you, if you want to be a woman, you can be a man.

1543
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:31,300


1544
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,280
If you want to fuck creepy old men, you can do it.

1545
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,020
I mean on the, on the.

1546
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,860
You can do it now.

1547
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:38,540
I mean.

1548
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:39,020
Yeah, you could.

1549
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,100
Yeah.

1550
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,100
Go for it.

1551
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:41,680
I don't know.

1552
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,060
I've walked around and I've seen plenty of creepy old men.

1553
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:49,240
I mean, look ladies, if you want to fuck a creepy old men, look, I can, I'll set you

1554
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:49,440
up.

1555
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,840
Look, just, just come and talk to me.

1556
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,380
The free scale men will be delighted.

1557
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,760
I mean, come on.

1558
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,100
Do we have like a PA here?

1559
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,040
Can we call all creepy old men to the stage?

1560
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,700
Let, let the ladies pick them out.

1561
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,060
No, no.

1562
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:01,940
What a shame.

1563
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,180
Wah, wah, wah.

1564
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,300
That's fair.

1565
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,860
And we all went to lecherous you.

1566
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,840
And so, yeah, I mean, there's, again, we have that, those issues.

1567
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,660
I'm going to give, we're going to have Dr. Howell come up here very shortly.

1568
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,940
He is welcome to come up here at the moment if he would like, if it, unless there's.

1569
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,640
Oh no, never.

1570
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:25,060
He would never ban you, Dr. Howell.

1571
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,320
You were just put in the penis section for about 45 minutes.

1572
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:28,700
Yeah.

1573
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,180
You know.

1574
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:30,680
Your restriction was, you know, you were just put in the penis section for about 45

1575
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:30,680


1576
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:30,680


1577
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:30,680


1578
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:30,680


1579
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:30,680


1580
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:30,680


1581
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:30,680


1582
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:30,680


1583
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:30,680


1584
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:30,680


1585
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:30,780
minutes.

1586
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:31,720
You're welcome back.

1587
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,960
Yes, the, the, the, the penis ban has been lifted.

1588
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,140
I can't even say that with a straight face because that's such BS.

1589
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:42,700
No, no.

1590
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,400
The next day we banned penises.

1591
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,240
Oh, no.

1592
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,060
No, no.

1593
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:47,600
No.

1594
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:48,220
No.

1595
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,300
Just kidding.

1596
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,260
Then we'd have to get vibrate.

1597
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,180
Ban penises?

1598
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,340
Who said that?

1599
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,320
For 45 minutes.

1600
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,360
This is another Uber, quick Uberfim story.

1601
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,020
Oh, okay.

1602
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,460
Your, your town of home.

1603
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:00,660
I'm from, I'm from, I'm from, I'm from, I'm from, I'm from, I'm from, I'm from, I'm from,

1604
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:01,240
I'm from, I'm from, I'm from, I'm from, I'm from, I'm from, I'm from, I'm from, I'm from,

1605
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:01,240


1606
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:01,240


1607
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:01,240


1608
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:01,940
The airport there.

1609
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:02,840
My town?

1610
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:03,420
Yes.

1611
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,120
Oh, okay.

1612
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:09,140
I was going through that airport to go to Atlanta, Georgia for Dragon Con years back.

1613
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:12,120
And I've told this, some people have heard this story.

1614
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,000
This was a very interesting situation that I had.

1615
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,700
I was going to Drag Con and I had a number of sex toys in my carry-on.

1616
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:23,920
And one was, for example, a little white bumpy, you know, little, you know, palm-sized

1617
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,260
pocket rocket.

1618
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:32,900
And the other one was a very well-endowed purple alien cock with a vibrator in it.

1619
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:39,680
And I mean, so I knew my problem was going to happen when I got my boarding pass.

1620
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,820
And right on the boarding pass were three red X's.

1621
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,560
And I went, that's got to mean something not good at this point.

1622
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,060
I hate red X's.

1623
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,960
I get to the gate, the security gate, and they pull me aside.

1624
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,980
And they're like, we need to go through your stuff.

1625
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,220
And I'm like, all right.

1626
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,580
So the guy goes through it, and he gets to the sex toys.

1627
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:07,360
And he stops, and he goes, you're going to have to turn them on and prove they work.

1628
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,640
And I'm like, you want to use it?

1629
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:10,020
What?

1630
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,420
You want a demonstration, dude?

1631
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,000
Come on.

1632
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,900
And he's like, no, no, no, no, no, just turn it.

1633
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,580
And this is this old dude, and he's really embarrassed.

1634
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,300
He says, just turn them on and make sure they're not bombs.

1635
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,240
Okay, that's all right.

1636
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,880
So I turn them.

1637
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,260
And they're not bombs, and we're fine.

1638
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,460
So then he has to go through this series of screening questions.

1639
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,480
And the first screening question, you know, what's your name?

1640
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,100
Where are you from?

1641
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:32,180
You know, that kind of thing.

1642
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:33,680
These are typical security screens.

1643
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,140
You know, where are you going to?

1644
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:35,800
I'm going to Atlanta.

1645
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:36,700
Where are you going for?

1646
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:37,500
I'm going for a convention.

1647
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,560
And he looks down at the sex toys, and he goes, what kind of convention?

1648
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:44,500
And I said, it's a science fiction convention.

1649
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,020
And he points at the giant purple dildo and says, well, that would explain that.

1650
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,640
Well done.

1651
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:52,780
Well done.

1652
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:54,600
Well done.

1653
00:54:54,600 --> 00:55:01,540
The main Connie-type panelists there were Reverend Enshrina from Ministry of Slack,

1654
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,080
Priestess Pisces, Reverend Pockets, also Ministry of Slack,

1655
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:14,560
Princess We Are Doe, Queen of All the UFOs, and Popess Pantera Ibakovich.

1656
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:22,020
Dr. Legume, Dr. Howell, Pope Black, and myself were also heard from the Peanuts gallery at the beginning.

1657
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,060
I told you before.

1658
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,820
I'm going to tell you again.

1659
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,700
There's something that seems to be a misunderstanding with you men.

1660
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,680
Connie's a redhead.

1661
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:42,740
Connie's a blonde.

1662
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,680
Connie's a cute melee princess from Vietnam.

1663
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,180
Connie's a deep, deep, deep southern bell.

1664
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:04,800
Connie's a gangsta bitch who will shoot your ass straight to hell.

1665
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,760
But there's no Connie.

1666
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,500
There is no Connie.

1667
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,520
Connie's a Norwegian hooker.

1668
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:32,580
Connie's your neighbor's daughter and she's quite a looker.

1669
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:41,200
Connie drives a red pickup truck with a rebel flag.

1670
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,440
Connie's been sleeping with your dad.

1671
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,940
Connie fucked a two-ball thirty horsepower, already killed.

1672
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:52,940


1673
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:52,940


1674
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:52,940


1675
00:56:52,940 --> 00:57:07,120
players. Connie's got her hair in those blonde whiskey layers and there's no Connie though.

1676
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:29,560
See, there is no Connie. Not at all. She's Connie. She's Connie too. I'm Connie. But there is no Connie.

1677
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,080
There is no Connie.

1678
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:52,320
Connie wakes you up on Saturday morning with a blowjob. Connie likes to be bent over and bark like a dog.

1679
00:57:55,420 --> 00:58:03,740
Connie will put a strap on on and show you what's more. But there's no Connie.

1680
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,520
There is no Connie.

1681
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:06,240
There is no Connie.

1682
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,100
There is no Connie.

1683
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,580
There is no Connie.

1684
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:09,580


1685
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:23,360
In the background, we're listening to an improvisational jam by Six Fisted Tales of Connie, the band that forms only at the X Day Drills, in this case featuring Priestess Pisces and Dr. Drummond on vocals.

1686
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:37,100
Dr. Drummond on sax, Reverend Angry Larry and Reverend Suds Pasha on guitar. I think Reverend Phil on drums and no doubt others involved there, but I'd have to look at the videotapes and the answers.

1687
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:37,100


1688
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,080
And where on the record they aren't even labeled yet.

1689
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:38,880
I don't think they're labeled yet.

1690
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:50,740
This has been The Hour of Slack from the church of The Subgenius. You can learn pretty much everything you need to know about that and Bob & Connie Dobbs at subgenius.com

1691
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:54,340
For those in prominent or otherwise free of the internet.

1692
00:58:54,500 --> 00:59:04,060
It's post office, 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1693
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:04,980
In combination with an expensive erfolg in King County, inching generic somber viewpoint.

1694
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:04,980


1695
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,080
