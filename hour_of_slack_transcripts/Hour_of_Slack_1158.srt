1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,660
Talk to your doctor and find out if it's time for plaque buildup.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,560
He prescribed the buildup of plaque.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,400
Along with bad cholesterol and the progression of atherosclerosis.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,620
Ask your doctor.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,540
Liver disease isn't for everyone.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,520
Ask your doctor about severe lung disease, vomiting, and fatalities.

7
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,400
I'm ready.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,280
I'm ready.

9
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,280
I'm ready.

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,720
Call your doctor and request your bipolar mania.

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,860
The self-genius power of sweat.

12
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,840
Some serious side effects may occur, such as inflammation of the flatulence.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,160
And thank you, Lemur.

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,480
Friends, this is Hour of Slack number 1158.

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,620
Only it isn't, really.

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:56,720
It's mostly a Reverend Susie the Floozy's disease and anthrax special episode of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,640
From wonderful...

18
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,120
W-R-E-K in Atlanta.

19
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,640
And we're rerunning it because it's great.

20
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,960
And because the world ends any minute now.

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,200
X days practically here.

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,700
And when that happens, we take the path of least resistance.

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,060
And put on this background music by the Flyin' Ryan Brothers.

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,980
And let somebody else do the show.

25
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,560
Here then, now, is the work of Reverend Susie.

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,080
The program you are about to listen to is a true story.

27
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,720
It contains some of the most terrifying material I've ever encountered.

28
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,420
So often in a case like this, it's hard to pin down the details.

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:51,340
In the autumn of 1989, a company called Hazleton Research Products was using a one-story building in the business park as a monkey house.

30
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,320
Hazleton Research Products is a division of Corning Incorporated,

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,840
the company that...

32
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,300
makes Pyrex glass cookware.

33
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,220
Corning's Hazleton unit is involved with the importation and sale of laboratory animals.

34
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:13,620
Each year, about 16,000 wild monkeys are imported into the United States from the tropical regions of the Earth, including humans.

35
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,080
Hello.

36
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,980
Welcome, gentle sunlight.

37
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,120
Welcome to the Castle Amtrak.

38
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,520
The Castle Amtrak?

39
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,600
Yes.

40
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,420
It's not a very good name, is it?

41
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:27,660
Is it?

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:27,760


43
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,280
We've got some monkeys.

44
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:29,820
Monkeys?

45
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:30,940
Monkeys.

46
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,580
Yes.

47
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,000
Twelve of them.

48
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,380
He claimed that he had come from the future.

49
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,540
That he was looking for a pure germ that would ultimately wipe mankind off the face of the Earth starting the year 1996.

50
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,060
Yeah, yeah.

51
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,120
And that's all my hair fell.

52
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,880
And I see you've got the man's mind.

53
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,700
Mahmoud, you are acquainted with the role that Balib was to have played in the second phase of our operation.

54
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,260
I am, sir.

55
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,820
You should be in Oklahoma City tomorrow.

56
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,320
If this car rolls out.

57
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,020
If the two attacks come right on top of each other.

58
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,520
The TV will go nuts.

59
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,160
And the letters are ready.

60
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,700
We had to set a tone.

61
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,740
We had to make it a war.

62
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,260
We can't just have a couple of assassinations.

63
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,100
We have to make the media think war.

64
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,920
It has to be big.

65
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,280
If we want to get the great Satan, Sam snorted.

66
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,420
It'll be for nothing if we can't get him out here.

67
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,260
Grrrr.

68
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,780
In the world I see,

69
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,600
they're stalking elk through the damn canyon forest around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.

70
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:42,580
Oh you, you keep your head round and round and round and round.

71
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,240
Oh you, you've got the truth all left behind.

72
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,020
You were not ready before.

73
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,920
I was.

74
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,340
I sent a letter before.

75
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,460
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,700
I sent a dream to you.

77
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,680
I sent a letter to you last night.

78
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,320
From the end of the world.

79
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,420
Grrrr.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,580
Grrrr.

81
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,740
It's just like my dream.

82
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,200
Ha ha ha ha ha.

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,040
That was terrible.

84
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,960
I'll just sprinkle you all with some amnesia dust.

85
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:12,700
Poof.

86
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,720
Grrrr.

87
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,360
Grrrr.

88
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,480
Grrrr.

89
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,280
Grrrr.

90
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:21,720
Grrrr.

91
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,180
A micro break of a rainforest virus.

92
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,700
With unknown potential.

93
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,820
To start an explosive chain of lethal transmission in the human race.

94
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,500
Emerges in a cold geometry of clinical fact.

95
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,120
Mixed with flashes of horror so brilliant and disturbing.

96
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,160
That we draw back and blink.

97
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,060
As if we are staring into a discolored alien sun.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,680
Grrrr.

99
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,120
Who left those freaking blinds open?

100
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,760
Ow, my eyes.

101
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,980
Grrrr.

102
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,320
Oh, my throat.

103
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,280
Grrrr.

104
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,420
Oh, my chest.

105
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,600
Grrrr.

106
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,540
I mean, besides the obvious.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,820
I don't think I'm doing too good.

108
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,020
Grrrr.

109
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,260
Grrrr.

110
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,680
Grrrr.

111
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,360
Grrrr.

112
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,300
Grrrr.

113
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,660
Grrrr.

114
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,840
Oh, great. What have I started?

115
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,560
Grrrr.

116
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,120
Grrrr.

117
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,100
Like someone who doesn't know us?

118
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,780
Not at all, he said.

119
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,080
Happens all the time.

120
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,500
In fact we can even get grenades in mines.

121
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,820
Yes, these things have happened before.

122
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,360
Except grown ups do it.

123
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,400
They call it war.

124
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,600
So I said I wish you all would stop your groaning

125
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,940
Stop fussing and cranking and shucking and moaning

126
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,180
I wonder what would happen if you tell Jimmy

127
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,560
How far you hit him and if he hit Timmy

128
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,760
Maybe Timmy would go and shake Billy's hand

129
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,980
And hopefully someday they'll understand

130
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,320
Cause what's gonna happen if you don't do that

131
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,760
Will be Johnny and Frank are gonna wanna get your back

132
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,040
And you and Timmy will go beat up Bill

133
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,300
Who'll turn around tomorrow and wanna kill

134
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,660
You and him and Steven and Johnny and Jack

135
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,100
And one day one of you will try and get him back

136
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,460
Because Timmy hit Billy who punched out Steve

137
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,640
When Steve hit Laura after Jack and Johnny

138
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,920
Hit Tommy and Richard hit Emily

139
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,780
Who accidentally pushed Debbie with a toothy sniff

140
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,540
Well he fumped that over for a moment or two

141
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,060
And then he said I bet I can beat up you

142
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,420
So how do you feel?

143
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,460
Not too bad

144
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,200
As long as I don't laugh or sneeze

145
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,160
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

146
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,040
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

147
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,140
I don't feel so good

148
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,860
Ah Memorial Day

149
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,440
A day when our war heroes are honored

150
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,360
By even the most liberal of media

151
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,380
Not anymore

152
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,000
Naturally we'll have more on this story as soon as it develops

153
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,200
We now return you to the President's address already in progress

154
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,420
Flash ladies and gentlemen

155
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,040
The President threw up this afternoon on the steps of the family

156
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,340
Just prior to teach class

157
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,300
He was heard to mumble something about Boris

158
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,580
And was suddenly on his knees

159
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,720
Before his bodyguards could assist him

160
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,020
The President was in a state of shock

161
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,800
Five or six peasants of undetermined origin

162
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,940
Stuck several small protest signs on the President

163
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,760
Which Scott taped

164
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,160
Ah

165
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,880
Ah

166
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,700
Ah

167
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,460
Douche

168
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,520
Douche

169
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,420
That's my sound effect

170
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,540
Douche

171
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,340
Okay

172
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:19,960
Oh

173
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,060
Douche

174
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,040
Mr. President

175
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,280
He leans over

176
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,480
Head on his knees

177
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,920
And brings up an incredible quantity of blood from his stomach

178
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,800
And spills it onto the floor with a gasping groan

179
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,160
Ah

180
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,460
He loses consciousness

181
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,580
And pitches forward onto the floor

182
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,080
Ah

183
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,020
Then comes a sound like a bang on the head

184
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,020


185
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,300
A head sheet being torn in half

186
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,640
Which is the sound of his bowels opening as a sphincter

187
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,660
And drinking blood

188
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,900
The blood is mixed with intestinal linings

189
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,700
He has plucked his gut

190
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,520
The linings of his intestines have come off

191
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,620
And are being expelled along with huge amounts of blood

192
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,240
Brain damage

193
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,480
Nobody home

194
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,120
Now you don't see that every day

195
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,300
What the hell is going on in the classroom?

196
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,920
My God, there's been an explosion

197
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,980
The next day

198
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,440
A few bits of frozen meat from monkey 053 arrived at the institute

199
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,680
Brought by courier

200
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,620
And I did open that letter in my backyard with rubber gloves

201
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,560
Bum bum bum

202
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,640
Um

203
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,700
Don't want to get any of that on your hand

204
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:25,340
Alright

205
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,280
Monkey poop

206
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,340
Don't burn your hand

207
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,000
Ah you son of a bitch

208
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,480
What annoyed him was the fact that the bits of meat were wrapped in aluminum foil

209
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,580
Like pieces of leftover hot dogs

210
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,000
Like the kind of mystery meat you get in a store like this one

211
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,480
I'm making my lunch

212
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,380
That's nice

213
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,120
I'm making my lunch

214
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:52,460
Now I don't have to tell you all that the dangers of science are a time-worn threat

215
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,200
From Prometheus stealing fire from the gods

216
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,500
The Cold War era of the Doctor Strangelove terror

217
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,520
But never before

218
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,300
This is ridiculous

219
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,820
We're gonna whip it out, lube it up and wank it

220
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:06,980
I'm gonna whip it out, lube it up and wank it

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,280
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

222
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,660
People who knew him recalled that he was affectionate with wild monkeys

223
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,780
That he had a special way with them

224
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,000
You know me?

225
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,300
And about your work

226
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,360
My work?

227
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,420
Biowars, pathology, parameters in urban and semi-urban environments

228
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,480
General military medicine, June 1974

229
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,880
Incremental effects, countermeasures to toxic agents and liquid system delivery

230
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,560
Microbiological letters, January 1975, remember?

231
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,120
The doctors remember the clinical signs

232
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,980
Because no one who has seen the doctor before

233
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,760
Has seen the effects of a biosafety level 4 hot agent on a human being

234
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,260
Can ever forget them

235
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,380
Whoa ho ho!

236
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,000
I think the survivors would envy the dead

237
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,540
I was a very peculiar doctor in those days

238
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,180
Trying to find treatments for diseases that hadn't existed

239
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,600
So all the doctors invented them

240
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,520
Now I'm the only game in town

241
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,300
I was a military senior when they scratched the world

242
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,620
As a matter of fact I was gonna apply to Biowar lab for my postdoc but

243
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,620
Ha ha ha

244
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,840
The next turn never came

245
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,240
Grrrrr...

246
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,040
Grrrrr...

247
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,440
Grrrrr...

248
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:13,880
Grr...

249
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,460
Grrrr...

250
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:15,560
Grrrr...

251
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,640
You know that big dude what threw up cause he got so agitated

252
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,540
And if he'd known about our masturbation

253
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,820
He got so worked up

254
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,940
He had to puke

255
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,220
Yes

256
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,080
That's wrong

257
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,980
In the ash tray out front

258
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,460
I don't think

259
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,720
In the ash tray, a big ash tray that people had to empty

260
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,240
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

261
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,440
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

262
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,960
The worst of them was Ebola Zaire

263
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,600
The kill rate in humans in front of a computer

264
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:42,800
with Ebola Zaire is 9 out of 10. Ebola Zaire is a slate wiper in humans.

265
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:48,340
That's nice. Ebola Zaire is the most feared agent at the Institute. Those

266
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,860
people who work with Ebola are crazy. To mess around with Ebola was an easy way

267
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:59,760
to die. Better to work with something safer, such as anthrax. Ebola was

268
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,200
unpredictable. A virus is a small capsule made of membranes and proteins.

269
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:11,840
The capsule contains one or more strands of DNA or RNA, which are long molecules

270
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,460
that contain the software program for making a copy of the virus. A virus is a

271
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,920
parasite, it can't live on its own. It uses the energy and material in the cell

272
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,400
to survive. By attaching to the cell membrane causing cellій

273
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,740
soldieration. It makes copies of itself inside the

274
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:29,740


275
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,180
a cell until eventually the cell gets pigged with virus and parts and the viruses spill out

276
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:43,040
of the broken cell they replicate in large numbers mature and release their massive battalions by

277
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:51,440
blowing up cells oh my god that was when i knew that ebola can travel through the air

278
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:05,560
it probably traveled through the air in aerosolized secretions like drip coming out of

279
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:13,320
a faucet drip drip drip coffee coffee oh jesus the faucet runs and runs until the cell is exhausted

280
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:19,400
consumed and destroyed the viruses scatter besieging more cells and the infection spreads

281
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,420
as the viruses increase in strength and shape

282
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,860
Ebola virus destroyed an animal's internal organs,

283
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,200
and the carcass deteriorated abruptly after death.

284
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,740
It softened, and the tissues turned to jelly,

285
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,640
even if you put it in a refrigerator to keep it cold.

286
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,540
You wanted to dissect the animals quickly,

287
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,360
before the spontaneous liquefaction began,

288
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,260
because you can't dissect gumbo.

289
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,200
Is that anything about nothing we should mention?

290
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:47,700
No.

291
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,360
No, that's the dissolution of...

292
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,240
Monkeys spit and throw stuff.

293
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,760
Monkeys spit and throw stuff.

294
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:54,840
Yeah.

295
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,400
Yeah.

296
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:57,680


297
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,080
I can make toxins from both of these.

298
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:07,720
An airborne strain of Ebola could emerge and circle the world in about six weeks,

299
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,660
like the flu, killing large numbers of people.

300
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,480
Or it might forever remain a secret feeder at the margins,

301
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,060
taking down humans a few at a time.

302
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,240
But unlike HIV,

303
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,380
the attack by Ebola is swift and explosive.

304
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,000
Ebola does in ten days what it takes AIDS ten years to accomplish.

305
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,000
Christ.

306
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,320
It's great.

307
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,980
Just great.

308
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,800
Incomplicate, Doctor.

309
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,660
He had slumped to his knees, almost paralyzed, clasping the stricken elbow with his other hand.

310
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,160
Everything had exploded into yellow light.

311
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,520
Inconceivable, inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain.

312
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,220
The lights cleared, and he could see the other two.

313
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,260
The guard was laughing at his contortions.

314
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,140
He was lying on something that felt like a camp bed,

315
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,340
except that it was higher off the ground and that he was fixed down in some way so that he could not move.

316
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,480
Light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face.

317
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,280
O'Brien was standing at his side, looking down at him intently.

318
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,880
At the other side of him stood a man in a white coat, holding a hypodermic syringe.

319
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,320
Even after his eyes were open, he took in his surroundings only gradually.

320
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,220
He was in a state of shock.

321
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:26,420
He had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quite different world, a sort of underwater world far beneath it.

322
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,340
I looked at these doctors. I said, Bob, what in the world is all that?

323
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,960
I need a man who has dealt with the Americans and their vans.

324
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,880
Over to his left, Winston saw the man in the white coat break an ampule and draw back the plunger of a syringe.

325
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,740
He raised a finger to the man in the white coat.

326
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,600
Three thousand, he said, speaking over Winston's head to the man in the white coat.

327
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,220
Two soft pads, which fell on the floor.

328
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,320
The hands felt slightly moist, clamped themselves against Winston's temples.

329
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,240
He quailed.

330
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,560
There was a pain coming, a new kind of pain.

331
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,460
O'Brien laid a hand reassuringly, almost kindly, on his.

332
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,860
This time it will not hurt, he said.

333
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,880
Keep your eyes fixed on mine.

334
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,740
At this moment there was a devastating explosion.

335
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,780
Uh, and yeah, that was what it sounded like.

336
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,480
There was undoubtedly a blinding flash of light.

337
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,360
Winston was not hurt, only prostrated.

338
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,440
Although he had already been lying on his back when the thing happened,

339
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,300
he had a curious feeling that he had been knocked into that position.

340
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,080
A terrific, painless blow had flattened him out.

341
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,300
Also, something had happened inside his head.

342
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,040
Now I am a monkey.

343
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,580
A monkey, monkey, monkey.

344
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,940
And I am a monkey too.

345
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,820
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.

346
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,100
Space monkey.

347
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,460
Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good.

348
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,780
That's nice.

349
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,400
No one else wanted to do it.

350
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,540
Doc pulled on a pair of tight-fitting rubber surgical gloves.

351
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,640
Then, carefully, he used a sterile insulin syringe he'd bought,

352
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,860
removed a quarter of a cubic centimeter of cabin,

353
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,100
and injected into a soft gelatin cap.

354
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,440
Look at him jiggle.

355
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,380
Uh-huh.

356
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,500
Quivers. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome.

357
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,260
Then he enclosed the gel cap inside a two-part,

358
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,620
coated, non-soluble plastic capsule that I could carry in my mouth.

359
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,340
My mouth? Absolutely, tadpole.

360
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,880
When you're searched, people may be perfectly willing to stick their fingers up your

361
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,400
mob, but they seldom want to run them inside your mouth.

362
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,680
Mop. Yuck.

363
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,600
Don't worry, you won't feel a thing.

364
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,480
We got some drinks and coffins.

365
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,860
But nothing'selc ain't �uchtin'.

366
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,800
Mop. Yuck .

367
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:54,800


368
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:54,800


369
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,240
People, look.

370
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,680
He just can't get a thing .

371
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,040
Rar .

372
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,840
It's

373
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,280
We have got to get it together

374
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,400
We have got to get it together

375
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,820
You won't feel a thing till I jam this down your throat

376
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,780
You got it, Pop

377
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,260
Just let me run a few prints through it first

378
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,040
I dried everything in the shelves on him

379
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,960
Join me

380
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,560
Sweet

381
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,040
Squeezing taste, some monsterism

382
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,180
A needle jerked into Winston's arm

383
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,520
But somewhere or other there was a large patch of emptiness

384
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,440
As though a piece had been taken out of his brain

385
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,940
An utterly weak, and his spine goes limp and nervously

386
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,300
He is going into shock

387
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,660
He is crashing

388
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,140
He can't breathe

389
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,800
Viruses

390
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,380
Viruses

391
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:16,840
Viruses

392
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,840
Are molecular sharks

393
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,880
A motive without a mind

394
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,140
They had been injected with the hottest type of Ebola known to the world

395
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,180
You did what?

396
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,560
It was the Myinga strain of Ebola Zaire

397
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:28,880
Oh

398
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,020
This strain had come from a young nurse named Myinga N

399
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,420
Who died of the virus on October 19th, 1976

400
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,900
Some of her blood had ended up in the United States

401
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,800
Kept in super freezers at the Institute

402
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,780
At the temperature of liquid nitrogen

403
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,840
Man, woman, child, all of them

404
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,820
And the whole world is up against the wall of science

405
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,500
We have got to get it together

406
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,720
Now

407
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,800
Meanwhile, far below the Earth's surface

408
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,000
If only I had a little pink button to push

409
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,780
That could wipe out this town

410
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,460
You hold the power of the magic eraser

411
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,440
And it's your turn now

412
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,820
To believe in me

413
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,840
Miracle

414
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,800
Tell me, is it possible to get me a hydrogen bomb?

415
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,640
I doubt it, your majesty

416
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,700
How about germ warfare?

417
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,020
Do you know anything about that?

418
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,040
You mean poisoning the population?

419
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,380
Yes, that sounds like a fun project

420
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,760
How about rabies?

421
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,980
Could we spread that disease inexpensively?

422
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,760
I think so, your majesty

423
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,500
All we need is some rabbit bat pups to make a serum

424
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,800
Fine, let's try it

425
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,500
Rabbit bat pups?

426
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,720
And let's put in a little rat piss for good luck

427
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,820
You're a genius, your majesty

428
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,040
I know, I know

429
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,120
Give me a ticket for an airplane

430
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,580
Ain't got time to take a fast train

431
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,940
Lonely days are gone

432
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,860
I'm going home

433
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,800
My baby

434
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,100
We broke the alarm

435
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,480
I'm going home

436
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,080
It's all wrapped up in one big beautiful pink package

437
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,380
And if you could put a stamp on it and mail it to Washington to your favorite senator

438
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,860
You might get in a few good licks for the human race

439
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,280
What did he mean by that?

440
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,180
I don't know

441
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,760
Perhaps you'll have a little peace and quiet for a while

442
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:32,720
Yes?

443
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,160
I don't bring you peace and love

444
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,720
I bring you fear, famine, pestilence

445
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,840
Dad, you got a letter from the city of New York

446
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,020
Throw it away

447
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,440
Nothing good has ever come out of New York City

448
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,180
Thank you again for playing, president

449
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,480
Thank you

450
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,860
I'm all for the았� Bill

451
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,620
How come a Или safe?

452
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,000
I mean, it's been a

453
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,340
It's good for me

454
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,380
Go on and be a good I hooks

455
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,400
Love you to the world

456
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:04,960
Look at their straight teeth

457
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,260
A little bit

458
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,980
Anyway, where did all this come from project come from Jews

459
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,000
Actually, I think for the sake of history

460
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,980
Chicago in what said they're still up for adoption

461
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,580
They say the borrowing of securities and money since early ge flaps

462
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,620
And they think it's post office

463
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,080
that had a threatening note inside

464
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,180
and a powdery substance inside of the letter.

465
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,700
You big mailman, squeal on me.

466
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,900
They conducted an analysis of the substance with bio-tickets.

467
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,020
Both of those tickets came back negative.

468
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,540
Now, who's being naive?

469
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,780
And the shepherd's boy cried,

470
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:35,800
Woof!

471
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,920
His neighbors, supposing him to be playing his old game,

472
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,540
paid no attention to his cries.

473
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,920
While the wolf killed and devoured as many sheep as he wanted.

474
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,520
Thus, the shepherd's boy learned

475
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,640
that liars are not believed even when they tell the truth.

476
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,480
And then, and all of us understand

477
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,980
that we will develop the truth over time

478
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,220
because there's not a desire to hide it.

479
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,900
Yeah, right. Me too.

480
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,060
Woof!

481
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,060
That was terrible.

482
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,000
I'll just sprinkle you all with some amnesia dust.

483
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:18,940
Woof!

484
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,480
I say live it or live with it.

485
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,120
We're not that far gone, but we're on the road.

486
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,880
The yellow brick road. We're off to see the wizard.

487
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,460
Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.

488
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,600
This interview is over.

489
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,120
Wash, wash, wash.

490
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,980
Wash your hands before doing anything.

491
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,380
It has to do with food.

492
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,340
What about the rumors that a biological weapon

493
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,880
has been stolen and smuggled out of the country

494
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,680
during this conference?

495
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,360
Wash, wash, wash.

496
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,000
Be a germ fighter with me.

497
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,960
Wash, wash, wash.

498
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,440
Wash, wash, wash.

499
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,940
Wash, wash, wash.

500
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,300
You can better communicate.

501
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,900
As a result of hardening the homeland

502
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,160
against a virus attack with first-time responders,

503
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,700
our neighborhoods,

504
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,160
will be ultimately safer for crime.

505
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,300
It's funny because it's true.

506
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:24,160
Our response has been to weave a web of terrorism prevention

507
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,560
and is the linchpin of all of our efforts to protect terrorism.

508
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,740
Well observed.

509
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,280
Homeland security will make America not only stronger,

510
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,340
but in many ways better.

511
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,160
Knowledge gained from bioterrorism research

512
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,900
will improve public health.

513
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,040
We will develop vaccines,

514
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,420
to fight anthrax and other deadly diseases.

515
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,460
Naturally, we'll have more on this story

516
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,200
as soon as it develops.

517
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,820
We don't know exactly what the substance is.

518
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,980
What we do know is,

519
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,300
according to our protocols,

520
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,920
we've notified the FBI.

521
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,500
The FBI is on scene now.

522
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,040
This is now going to be a matter of a criminal investigation

523
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,420
conducted by the FBI

524
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,000
in conjunction with the United States Capitol Police.

525
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,780
FBI, good morning.

526
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,220
FBI.

527
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,400
Yes, good morning, sir.

528
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,520
FBI, how did you hear it in the hospital?

529
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,080
I know who did this.

530
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,760
It was those bullies at Tom and his Martin High School.

531
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,180
That's who.

532
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:23,600
Whoa!

533
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,900
There are now approximately 150 guerrilla groups

534
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,960
planning a revolution.

535
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,280
The Church of Jesus Christ is...

536
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,680
It'll never happen in my life.

537
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,120
I have nothing over which to get concerned.

538
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,300
Who are they?

539
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,380
First, we have the white.

540
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,100
A, 18 active-type Ku Klux Klan groups.

541
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,020
B, the National States Rights Party.

542
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,220
C, the Nationalist Socialist...

543
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,640
White People's Party.

544
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,680
Marathon Nazi Party.

545
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,820
D, the Minutemen.

546
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,960
E, the Christian Nationalist Crusade.

547
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,520
Anti-Semitic, anti-Jewish.

548
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,980
F, the White Panthers headquarters in Ann Arbor.

549
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,020
You'll hear much about them in a minute.

550
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,760
Secondly, you have the blacks.

551
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,940
Over 100 different groups.

552
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,000
A, Black Panthers.

553
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,180
B, Islam, the fruit of Islam.

554
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,180
C, the Republic of New Africa.

555
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,540
Hey, what you talking about?

556
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:04,840
I...

557
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,660
You know that hassle last summer

558
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,360
between the bikers and the Indian people

559
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,220
out in the black hills?

560
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,440
There was a bunch of cops and a bunch of bikers

561
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,560
and the Indian medicine people.

562
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,120
It's not that.

563
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:13,940
What?

564
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,180
Here for what we did to that boy.

565
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,240
It wasn't quite right, you know.

566
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,900
I think we made a crazy man.

567
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,920
You're calling me crazy,

568
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,060
but I got a bad feeling about this guy.

569
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,360
All right, then, let's do it.

570
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:22,620
Okay.

571
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,600
Look at this guy.

572
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,020
DJ, run it back.

573
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:25,600
Here we go.

574
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,140
Freeze.

575
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:26,900
Don't move.

576
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,840
Drop that ax.

577
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,860
I have to put the ax down?

578
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,220
This man, the FBI believes,

579
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,800
was involved in nefarious activity.

580
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,160
What was the evidence?

581
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,440
Well, the man was seen walking into his home one day

582
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,940
with a large pot.

583
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,700
And he was later seen dumping some liquid

584
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,040
out his back door.

585
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,000
Oh, my God.

586
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,540
Oh, man.

587
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,420
That's ugly.

588
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,980
Well, it turns out that the large pot

589
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,700
that he was carrying into his house

590
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,920
was for his wife's favorite chicken and rice dish.

591
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,720
And it just turns out

592
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,380
that the liquid that he was dumping out his back door

593
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,020
was soap water

594
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,940
that had come from a backed-up dishwasher.

595
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,020
Yeah, right.

596
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,040
Me too.

597
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,580
It's hard for me to clean this giant pot

598
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,320
when it keeps blowing meat tenderizer all over me.

599
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,760
Oh, great.

600
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,980
Now I gotta work in the dark.

601
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:44,020
Oh, my God.

602
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,820
Now, what's particularly sad and troubling

603
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,980
about this incident

604
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,040
is not even those blatantly unconstitutional measures

605
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,560
that the FBI took,

606
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,260
although they're disturbing.

607
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,320
What is particularly sad about this incident

608
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,580
is that when later asked about his reaction,

609
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,900
this man said,

610
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,140
the FBI can come into my home whenever they want.

611
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,480
I'm not complaining.

612
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,660
It's not particularly easy scientifically

613
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,960
to figure out that this particular strain of anthrax

614
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,080
came from this particular place or person.

615
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,260
It's pretty hard to figure out.

616
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,640
I think the FBI is doing its best

617
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,960
and the Center for Disease Control

618
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,160
is doing its best to try to get to the bottom

619
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,820
of who caused the anthrax attack.

620
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,600
Not me. I'm more of a male tamper.

621
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,480
Yes?

622
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,200
Boss, we've got a problem.

623
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:36,000
International health authorities were urgently concerned

624
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,200
to find the exact source of the infected monkeys.

625
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,260
Well, you know,

626
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,380
$29.95, I mean, it's not that big a deal.

627
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,140
What?

628
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,780
Hold the price on me.

629
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,420
Now, that's a friend rate.

630
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,980
$29.95 is a friend rate.

631
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,600
Trust me.

632
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,420
You go out on the internet,

633
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,460
well, we don't have time for all this capital flamboyance.

634
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,420
Money, when it was needed.

635
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,100
When the scandal hit the FBI,

636
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,440
kickbacks in an insider trading investigation,

637
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,460
the administration knew where to go.

638
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,540
The boy from Phoenix had a reputation.

639
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,340
He'd cleaned up the Phoenix force

640
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,660
and he'd clean up the FBI.

641
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,680
But he wouldn't try too hard.

642
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,680
Not many people remember his early days in Phoenix.

643
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,040
The night spent hunting drunk Indian chicks.

644
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,660
And, uh, I'm sorry that, uh, these discoveries have been made.

645
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,540
With that in mind, do you have any concern about the FBI investigation?

646
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,500
I say to myself, not bad.

647
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,460
And pull out your booze-soaked, sniveling rum pot.

648
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,840
That's all I'm taking from you.

649
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,100
Get back here, you jackass!

650
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,680
Let him finish.

651
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,820
We've changed the attitude of the FBI.

652
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,400
I mean, we're not, we're interested in spies.

653
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,240
We're on the hunt.

654
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:39,880
Shhh!

655
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,040
Major cities in all parts of the country, in New York,

656
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,220
Los Angeles, report plague victims falling dead in the streets,

657
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,140
in their homes, at their work.

658
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,740
The first symptom appears to be severe choking,

659
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,880
followed by immediate unconsciousness.

660
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,640
Death occurs within minutes.

661
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,820
Our fellow countrymen are dying.

662
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,000
The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble

663
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,820
under the dread assault of that horror long feared.

664
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,800
You're a morpher.

665
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,760
We hit the older people either bad outright,

666
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,560
or went to the third stage pretty fast.

667
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,180
Well, you know, Linus and Mike, Alvin and me,

668
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,420
we had some kind of psychotic illusions,

669
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,580
occasional stages of torture like a cave-in.

670
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,680
I've eaten everything that the Roach faced,

671
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,660
severe old cakes, and I still feel like crap.

672
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:26,880
It's me.

673
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,020
Turn on the TV.

674
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,180
Already, hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain,

675
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,460
and civil defense authorities face the situation as much the same

676
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,500
across the entire country.

677
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,100
Martial law is now nationwide.

678
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,920
We have in this country a tradition of invoking this law,

679
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,160
only when the most dangerous thing is to be done.

680
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:49,600
dire of circumstances requiring, but at what cost? All eyes now turn to New York City to see if

681
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,780
martial law will bring the terror to an end. Good morning. Today, with the invocation of the

682
00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:00,020
War Powers Act by the president, I am declaring a state of martial law in this city. To the best

683
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:04,460
of our knowledge, we are opposed by no more than 20 of the enemy. He's hiding among a population

684
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,700
of roughly 2 million. Intelligence tells us that he is most likely Arab-speaking, between the age

685
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:15,760
of 14 and 30, narrowing the target to 15,000 suspects. We can further reduce that number down

686
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,280
to those that have been in this country less than six months. Now you have 20 hiding among 2,000.

687
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,260
If you are one of these 20 young men, you can hide among a population of similar ethnic backgrounds.

688
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,620
Unfortunately for you, you can only hide there. And that population in a classic immigration

689
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:39,180
pattern is concentrated right here in Brooklyn. We intend to seal off this borough. Then we intend

690
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:39,680
to squeeze it.

691
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:47,700
This is the land of opportunity, gentlemen. The opportunity to turn yourselves in. After sundown

692
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,760
tonight, any young man fitting the profile I described who has not cooperated will be arrested

693
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,300
and detained. There is historically nothing more corrosive to the morale of a population than

694
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,020
policing its own citizens. But the enemy would be sadly mistaken if they were to doubt our resolve.

695
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,120
They are now face to face with the most fearsome military machine in the history of man.

696
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,100
And I intend to use it to be back on base in time for the playoffs.

697
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,460
Thank you for your time.

698
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,100
They will have more on this story as soon as it develops.

699
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,580
You better see a doctor.

700
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:24,220
A tiny core of doggy doctors. They take care of the army's guard dogs, as well as army horses,

701
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,880
army cows, army sheep, army pigs, army mules, army rabbits, army mice, and army monkeys.

702
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,120
Plus his clothing.

703
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,300
No, no, I don't know anything about the monkey army.

704
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,200
This doctor.

705
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:42,940
I don't know anything about the monkey army.

706
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:42,980
I don't know anything about the monkey army.

707
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,000


708
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,200
Hello?

709
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,320
This is the solar process.

710
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,760
Wow, it's been a long time since you've been in a consult me.

711
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,700
Still a lousy attempt.

712
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,960
I'll make it worth your while to make me feel better.

713
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,540
What'd you say, huh?

714
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,460
What's your question again? I wasn't listening.

715
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,120
I don't want to hear it again.

716
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,220
Now let me just shut up, okay?

717
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:09,820
I'm sorry.

718
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,200
Oh, man.

719
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,420
Oh, God.

720
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,440
At the Institute...

721
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,480
Welcome to the Consulate.

722
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:21,660
The seats are narrow and jammed together, and you notice everything that is happening

723
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,440
inside the cabin.

724
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,780
You would not have been able to ignore the man who is getting sick.

725
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,360
He is holding an air sickness bag over his mouth.

726
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,260
He coughs a deep cough and regurgitates something into the bag.

727
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,560
He opens his mouth and gasps into the bag.

728
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,940
The vomiting goes on endlessly.

729
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,680
I'm sorry.

730
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,480
You see, it's been a really long time.

731
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,320
The air sickness bag fills up to the brim with a substance known as the Vomitone Negro, or

732
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,960
the Black Vomit, a stew of tarry granules mixed with fresh red arterial blood.

733
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,720
It is hemorrhage and it smells like a slaughterhouse.

734
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,360
The Black Vomit is loaded with virus.

735
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:03,920
It is highly infective, lethaly hot, a liquid that would scare the daylights out of a military

736
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,000
biohazard specialist.

737
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,220
Son, I think I can safely say, woo!

738
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,640
the bag is bulging and softening, threatening to leak,

739
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,640
and he hands it to a flight attendant.

740
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,540
Hmm, wise guy. You better see a doctor.

741
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,380
No medical logic. Steam should be shooting out of his ears.

742
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,720
His ears are for a lot.

743
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,300
When a hot virus multiplies in a host,

744
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,900
it can saturate the body with virus particles,

745
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,640
from the brain to the skin.

746
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,160
The military experts say, then,

747
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,620
that the virus has undergone extreme amplification.

748
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,980
During this process, the body is partly transformed

749
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,200
into virus particles.

750
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,620
The end result is a great deal of liquefying flesh mixed with virus.

751
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,980
His personality is being wiped away by brain damage.

752
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,800
Tiny spots in his brain are liquefying.

753
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,820
The higher functions of consciousness are winking out.

754
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,280
The human virus bomb explodes.

755
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,060
He's rupturing, Captain.

756
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,680
Pressure sense.

757
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,520
Reading's confirmed.

758
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,960
He blew a left testicle.

759
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,660
Military biohazard specialists have ways of describing

760
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:06,960
the virus.

761
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,980
They say that the victim crashed and bled out.

762
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,500
Or more politely, they say that the victim went down.

763
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,140
Is anyone here not a downer?

764
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:16,680
That's nice.

765
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,140
Some of the men suffered from blown up,

766
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,580
semi-rotten testicles.

767
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,800
Sure, sure.

768
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,420
More testicles mean more iron.

769
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,440
That's nice.

770
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,300
All of us want to know,

771
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,760
just as much as I want to know,

772
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,960
whose response

773
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,260
to the

774
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:37,260


775
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:37,280
the

776
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,280


777
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,280


778
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:37,280


779
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,200
All our best to you two.

780
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,820
And ten minutes later, every cop in the state will be after us.

781
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,480
Plus the FBI.

782
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:53,420
Must prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons

783
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,120
from threatening the United States and the world.

784
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:05,380
The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over

785
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:05,860
a decade.

786
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,680
This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens.

787
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,220
This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens.

788
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:22,860
Rules of old, poison gas, and obsolete germ bombs.

789
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,680
Just as a freak tornado crews through.

790
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,760
Sucking up two thirds of it.

791
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,320
Suck, suck, suck.

792
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,000
For untimely dispersal over vast stretches of...

793
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,960
For untimely dispersal over vast stretches of...

794
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,580
What!?

795
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,980
A wasteland.

796
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,880
I wonder if it comforts him.

797
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,080
I wonder if I'll ever see a stream full of fish again.

798
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:49,520
I wonder if I'll ever see a stream full of fish again.

799
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,320
Where'd you ever see a stream full of fish in Harlem?

800
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,880
You crazy bitch!

801
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,100
At the Moosey.

802
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,800
As a result of hardening the homeland against a bias attack with first time responders,

803
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:03,560
What!

804
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,380
to detect biological and chemical weapons,

805
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:11,680
and agents. We're gonna have an even swifter response to food contamination.

806
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,840
That's my boy!

807
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:24,780
It was O'Brien who was directing everything. It was he who set the guards onto Winston and who prevented them from killing him.

808
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:33,420
It was he who decided when Winston should scream with pain, when he should have a respite, when he should be fed, when he should sleep, when the drugs should be pumped into his arm.

809
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:41,580
It was he who asked the questions and suggested the answers. He was the tormentor. He was the protector. He was the inquisitor. He was the friend.

810
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,840
I guess what I want you to know as a father is...

811
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,500
You're no son of mine! You don't...

812
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,540
He paused and signed to the man in the white coat.

813
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:58,300
Good news, boys! I found a pharmacy that carries leeches! Well, it wasn't exactly a pharmacy. More of a bait shop!

814
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,140
Well, I'm fine. I really don't need any more home remedies.

815
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,800
Oral thermometer my eye!

816
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,320
Think warm thoughts, boy, cause this is mighty cold!

817
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,720
Gotta pay the town!

818
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,960
This infectious diarrhea always precedes lunch time.

819
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,000
Can I have the first slide, please?

820
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,400
I think I'm gonna be sick!

821
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:32,340
The etiologic agent that causes infectious diarrhea usually can be divided into three large groups. Bacterial, viral, and parasitic.

822
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,400
In a large group of people, the virus is called a parasite.

823
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,100
It's a parasite that can eliminate the terrorist parasites.

824
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:45,640
Actually, it doesn't necessarily cause diarrhea per se. It penetrates through the intestinal mucosa to the mesenteric lymph node and then to the bloodstream and causes enteric fetal.

825
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,000
Oh!

826
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:56,280
And the most frequent major symptoms here are nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, infectious diarrhea...

827
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:56,840
Yes!

828
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,720
Space monkey. Ready to sacrifice himself for the greater good.

829
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,120
Sacrifice? Nonsense.

830
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,100
Doctor, what can I do? The cough wracks his body day and night.

831
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:13,900
Let them take this man of yours up into the hills, where his cough-torn lungs can breathe clean, fresh air.

832
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,540
But he perishes because the gods are angry.

833
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,720
He perishes because we live in a world full of superstitious fools.

834
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:25,080
It isn't the gods that make a man sick or well.

835
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,620
The gods could strike you dead for saying that.

836
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:31,220
Perhaps they will, but I'm sure they won't strike me with a bellyache.

837
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,360
That's heresy.

838
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,020
Nature follows certain definite laws, which can be observed.

839
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,320
And the course of a disease may be more or less predicted.

840
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,860
And don't forget, in any population, there's always the so-called background diarrhea level of 2 to 5%.

841
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:56,160
So, if you develop diarrhea, it may not be due to the foreign country, it may be due to yourself, okay, because there is such a thing as a background diarrhea rate.

842
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,580
He looks pretty sick to me.

843
00:38:59,140 --> 00:38:59,600
Hey!

844
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,140
I think he's coming around.

845
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,920
He's coming around, folks.

846
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:09,740
He's gonna be okay and ready to play Symptom 6 of Beat the Reaper!

847
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:18,960
Last week, our patient successfully survived the common cold, measles, pneumonia, dengue fever, and the yawns.

848
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,020
And now, the big question.

849
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,420
Are you ready to go up?

850
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:23,960
Where?

851
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,040
Where?

852
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,640
He's ready!

853
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:34,060
And now, our countless nurse Judy is wheeling our patient into the isolation ward.

854
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:39,740
Well, let's try the test vaccine, uh, 93B71.

855
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,160
Can you hear me in there?

856
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,500
How the hell do I know?

857
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,120
Okay, let's shoot him up!

858
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:53,640
Now, patient, you have 10 seconds to tell us what you've got and beat the Reaper!

859
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,420
Uh...

860
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,000
Uh...

861
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,340
I'm shaking.

862
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,360
Please, please, please.

863
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,480
I have...

864
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,520
My hands are all...

865
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,000
I'm turning yellow.

866
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:02,360
My...

867
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,360
My God, I've got jaundice!

868
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,480
Jaundice it is!

869
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,540
Give him here, Judy!

870
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,640
Well, that's Symptom 6.

871
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,380
And now, you've reached the final threshold.

872
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,000
Here's the question.

873
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:21,400
Are you ready for symptom number seven, longer than any patient has ever survived before?

874
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,660
I wanna go home.

875
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,560
Only one way to do that.

876
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,620
Doctor, bring in the super shot.

877
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,120
I'm ready.

878
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:28,120


879
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:28,220
I'm ready.

880
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


881
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


882
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


883
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


884
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


885
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


886
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


887
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


888
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


889
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


890
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


891
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,220


892
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,760
Now, for the first time on Beat the Reaper, we're going for the big disease.

893
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:37,780
The icebox is being unlocked by the president of the Armenian Medical Association, under

894
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,380
whose strict supervision these toxins are being administered.

895
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,140
Uh...

896
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:41,280
Uh...

897
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,600
This is it.

898
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,780
Doctor, give him that really big disease!

899
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,020
Now, patient, can you hear me?

900
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:56,940
You've got 10 seconds to tell us what you've got and, for the last time, beat the Reaper!

901
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,540
I think I feel...

902
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,860
I think I feel...

903
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,900
I don't know...

904
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,900
Whatever it is...

905
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,260
I wanna die!

906
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,280
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

907
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,720
That's not correct.

908
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,880
You didn't beat the Reaper.

909
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:28,200
According to my careful prosthesis, this man has the plague.

910
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,200


911
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,200


912
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,200


913
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,200


914
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,200


915
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,200


916
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,200


917
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,200


918
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,200


919
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,200


920
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,200


921
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,200


922
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,200


923
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,660
Thank you, Doctor.

924
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,600
You're welcome.

925
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,460
You've got the plague.

926
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,720
Well, isn't he a good sport, folks?

927
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,200
We'll be back in just a moment with our next patient, but first...

928
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:45,900
Pulling off the towel, he revealed an unmarked cardboard box wound heavily with tape,

929
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,040
put it in the trunk of his car, and drove to the Institute.

930
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,940
And, uh, the jars of urine?

931
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,640
Ooh, we'll hang on to those.

932
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:00,000
Ah, these Laramie cigarettes give me the steady nerves I need to combat evil.

933
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,500
You're a radioactive man.

934
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:10,120
A massive traffic tie-up as the death rate continues to soar.

935
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,860
And now, let's go to the river's edge and Charles B. Smith.

936
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:21,020
Torches blazing, the long line of shrouded funeral rafts drift lazily into view.

937
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,620
Great Black Death.

938
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,680
Candles flickering as hell turns.

939
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:30,040
The excitement is contagious, and so are the Black Cross volunteers

940
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:35,880
as they pass from family to family, pausing now and again to touch a child's head.

941
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,320
I wish I could, but I can't.

942
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:47,060
And I know they're going to do everything they can to safeguard the labs and other federal facilities

943
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:50,740
from being infected by these spores and this material.

944
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:03,440
Pick up and recall.

945
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:19,720
Most Alan Black was worried death and future-web

946
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,600
Crocodile?

947
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:29,380
only in nature an obscenity so extreme that it dissolves imperceptibly into beauty oh ordinarily

948
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:40,440
i take advantage of an introduction like that i'm so damn sick uh i'm evil suzy i had the appointment

949
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:48,560
and uh yeah just for your own information i'm much more tractable if you get as many

950
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,200
pills down as you can in the first few minutes of the consultation okay

951
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:59,280
are you 46 oh yeah

952
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,980
oh

953
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:07,840
i guess it'll help

954
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,300
so damn sick

955
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:16,220
yeah really lucky to be ambulatory

956
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:16,820
oh

957
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,460
i'll go

958
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:23,220
a gallbladder attack or a liver abscess could cause fever and jaundice and abdominal pain

959
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:28,340
the red eyes she could not explain oh yeah that was uh uh

960
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:35,260
what is this a big cage this was a room known as the staging area

961
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:39,100
she found a box of latex rubber surgical gloves

962
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,920
everybody's feeling gay

963
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:48,440
who the hell is that

964
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:48,820
who the hell are you

965
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:56,160
we're the lymph node institute i'm dr bug bladder i'm doc ellis i'm dr t-9 whatever works for

966
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:56,420
you

967
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,500
i'm evil suzy

968
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:07,300
who knows who's like i know i don't i don't know her in the biblical church way oh yeah

969
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,860
boy what that is

970
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:18,440
she leaned forward and vomited copiously on the floor of the room and she was like oh

971
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,560
yeah that was what it sounded like

972
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,840
that's better she said leaning back with closed eyes never keep it down that's what i say

973
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:33,400
get it up while it's fresh on your stomach like she revived turned to have another look

974
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,880
at winston and seemed immediately to take a fancy to him she put a vast arm around his

975
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:45,420
shoulder and drew him toward breathing beer and vomit into his face so you're a kid yeah

976
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,420
because you're off to a good time well i'm gonna take a look at the details at the other

977
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:48,420


978
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,560
Oh, Grandpa.

979
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,280
I want you to be on.

980
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,060
You guys are fun.

981
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:01,620
She was eager to prove herself, especially since some people around me were skeptical

982
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,320
of her ability to work in a space suit in Level 4.

983
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,300
Hey, look guys.

984
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,840
I'm with Pantyhose.

985
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,560
He can't get much safer than that.

986
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,100
Uh-huh.

987
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,320
And it quivers.

988
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:14,680
Yeah.

989
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,320
Yeah.

990
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,120
Awesome.

991
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,400
I'm with Pantyhose.

992
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:18,400


993
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:18,400


994
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:18,400


995
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:18,400


996
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:18,400


997
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:18,400


998
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:18,400


999
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:18,400


1000
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:18,400


1001
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:21,860
Just so I know.

1002
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,400
The people of Dun boca stop there.

1003
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,100
Lovely.

1004
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:32,500
Stephen and N skeetches finally meet.

1005
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:40,140
Oh, is that so.

1006
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:40,140


1007
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:40,240
It's super cute.

1008
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:40,880
He's desapicied.

1009
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,440
D'you likeارigar inteiro?

1010
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,920
Can't even be sure what you want from him.

1011
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,240
This is just probably the best joke in the whole show.

1012
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:47,580
Let's go.

1013
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,380
Let's go, guys.

1014
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:51,660
Uh, I remember that.

1015
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,240
Me too.

1016
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,060
That's nice.

1017
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,100
This was long before anthrax, any of that.

1018
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:56,800
They were around.

1019
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,240
They were on.

1020
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,900
Remember that time we partied with anthrax?

1021
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,540
Yeah, we were cool.

1022
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,620
Oh, it's on.

1023
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:13,040
It's on.

1024
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,540
Red light.

1025
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:13,940
Red light.

1026
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:19,620
At the Institute, there is a level four containment hospital called the Slammer, where a patient

1027
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,300
can be treated by doctors and nurses wearing spacesuits.

1028
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:27,840
If you are exposed to a hot agent and you go into the Slammer and fail to come out alive,

1029
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:33,400
then your body is taken to a nearby level four containment morgue known as the Submarine.

1030
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,440
What's up with that?

1031
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,440
If you do nothing, you should mention it.

1032
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,460
If enough cells are destroyed, the host dies.

1033
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,720
A virus does not want to kill its host.

1034
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:50,640
That is not in the best interest of the virus, because then the virus may also die, unless

1035
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,480
it can jump fast enough out of the dying host into a new host.

1036
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:06,800
They did not care to do research on Ebola, because they did not want Ebola to do research

1037
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,200
on them.

1038
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,720
No one else wanted to do it.

1039
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,840
Wanted to do what?

1040
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,020
Do it.

1041
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:12,780
Okay.

1042
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:13,840
Hell, I know.

1043
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:14,620
I am a...

1044
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:23,220
Oh, my pancreas on the floor.

1045
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,480
That was...

1046
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:26,480
What was that?

1047
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,220
Oh, my God.

1048
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,420
I'm surprised I got any jibble.

1049
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,500
I lost a bunch of them out front.

1050
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,760
I was waiting for someone to come to the door.

1051
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,240
Then I just scooped them up and put them in that big, decorative, you know, removable

1052
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:43,780
bowl.

1053
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,800
I don't think...

1054
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,580
I don't think...

1055
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,120
A big ashtray of people had to empty...

1056
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,960
I mean...

1057
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,760
Well, I think it was like...

1058
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:52,760


1059
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:52,760


1060
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:52,760


1061
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:52,760


1062
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:52,760


1063
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:52,760


1064
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:52,760


1065
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:52,760


1066
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:52,780
Well, I think it was like...

1067
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,640
I was the first.

1068
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,040
There was a big guy that...

1069
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,060
Hey, this is just a throw-up.

1070
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:57,080
...threw up.

1071
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,180
And she'd known about her imagination.

1072
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,220
She'd touched the...

1073
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:04,740
The Level 4 airlock is a grey area, a place where two worlds meet.

1074
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,840
Where the hot zone touches the normal world.

1075
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,340
A great deal of blood waited on the other side.

1076
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,920
She would be handling it.

1077
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:27,080
A bit vectors, she would soon see theSiDutter.

1078
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:27,080


1079
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:27,080


1080
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:27,080


1081
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,660
It gets really hot on the planet Earth.

1082
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:29,380
폭

1083
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,160

1086
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,240
Jacob

1087
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,160
Stop franchising us.

1088
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,140
Fine, fine.

1089
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,600
Take care.

1090
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:43,000
Y'all are real awesome.

1091
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,280
The door led into an airlock and level four.

1092
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,960
The door was plastered with a biohazard symbol and warning.

1093
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,860
You know, I still call that idiot pronounce.

1094
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,220
Hey, where are you guys going?

1095
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,220
I thought you were going to go in.

1096
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,720
I'm making my lunch.

1097
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,820
You lousy bastard.

1098
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:09,720
I know how high tech nerds like you operate.

1099
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,460
I know you got a view scope around here.

1100
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,680
You enjoy your lunch after you see this.

1101
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,860
Oh, darling.

1102
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,400
God, there's been an exposure.

1103
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,760
I can't entertain myself.

1104
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,540
What a loose hospital.

1105
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,240
I wonder what this little pig butt is for.

1106
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,500
Daddy.

1107
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,560
Abort firings. Abort firings.

1108
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:39,240
Interception will fragment the silly carrying missile.

1109
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,940
Repeat. Abort firings.

1110
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:41,960
You sent it to Jesus.

1111
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,140
Here is the Pentagon.

1112
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,200
The warned judgment.

1113
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,620
Well, here it is.

1114
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,480
Here.

1115
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,000
Now.

1116
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,140
In the form of billions of microscopic bacilli.

1117
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,960
This is the end.

1118
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:07,420
20, 30, 40 percent among the 18 to 55-year-old segments of their populations.

1119
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,600
And yes, these numbers are accurate.

1120
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,980
No way.

1121
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:12,680
It is not difficult to imagine.

1122
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,100
The substantial depopulation of large areas.

1123
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,000
Are you out of your mind?

1124
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:17,840
Come on.

1125
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,460
I wish it were possible to do everything at once.

1126
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,620
And you better believe it.

1127
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,680
Give it to me straight.

1128
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,040
And not hang around anybody that doesn't believe it.

1129
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,940
I can take it.

1130
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,820
You get their plague.

1131
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,780
Oh, man.

1132
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,700
Some of you already have been bit by it.

1133
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,840
Oh, he bit me with my own teeth.

1134
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,980
Your risk of getting these diseases begins now.

1135
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:42,980


1136
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,480
To decrease.

1137
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,160
Oh, I'm quitting for my health, too.

1138
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:49,680
Psychosomatic.

1139
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,100
Does that mean you're crazy?

1140
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,900
No, that means he was faking it.

1141
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,640
No, actually, it was a little of both.

1142
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:00,620
Sometimes when a disease is in all the magazines and on all the news shows, it's only natural

1143
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,960
that you think you have it.

1144
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:07,100
It was brought home to me how Americans are already answering that call.

1145
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:09,560
Hello?

1146
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,740
Oh, I'm nuts.

1147
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,960
When I spoke to a friend of mine, he said, you know, I'm not going to be able to get

1148
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:12,960


1149
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:12,960


1150
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:12,960


1151
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:12,960


1152
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:12,960


1153
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:12,960


1154
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:13,080
to New York.

1155
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,020
I have a friend of mine who is the head of a postal union.

1156
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,920
Shortly after we learned of the anthrax threat, I asked him how he was doing.

1157
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,800
Not well, he said.

1158
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,880
We've lost two workers in Somerset.

1159
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,760
He said, I went to New Jersey where they had some of the biggest problems.

1160
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:36,760
Because of anthrax, all the workers were working in a tent exposed to the cold, hand sorting

1161
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,260
the mail.

1162
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,720
He said, I thought I was going to get an earful.

1163
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,940
But when I asked for questions, he said, you know, I don't know what to do.

1164
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:48,040
A man stood up and said, I've been a postal worker for 30 years.

1165
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,500
We're here.

1166
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,300
We're here.

1167
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:58,320
The punishment was you and those like you brought upon us.

1168
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,900
You taught them how to make bombs.

1169
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,980
That's why you were looking for the wiring signatures on that blue bus.

1170
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,200
Now they're here.

1171
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,500
Doing what you taught them how to do.

1172
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:18,960
There's no probe here.

1173
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,080
Find one.

1174
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:20,700
Yes, sir.

1175
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,940
This place is dirty, doctor.

1176
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,500
Doctor, these animals are dirty.

1177
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,680
They stink.

1178
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,140
They carry communicable diseases.

1179
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,960
Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?

1180
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,840
You don't sound happy in your words.

1181
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,340
A little more than a vet in this laboratory.

1182
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,480
Hey, Darby.

1183
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,380
I'm just passing through.

1184
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:47,060
She unplugged her air hose and unlatched the steel door and entered an airlock.

1185
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,940
The airlock was made entirely of stainless steel,

1186
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:53,640
and it was lined with nozzles for spraying water and chemicals.

1187
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:58,340
This was the decon shower, the decontamination shower.

1188
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:03,900
The door closed behind them, and they crossed over to the hot side.

1189
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,080
One side keeps the other side going.

1190
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:06,900
Hey!

1191
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,300
I hear about some monkeys.

1192
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,860
Hey, who is this?

1193
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:16,060
You gotta get in line behind this alien, Bimbo, though.

1194
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:20,940
They unplugged their air hoses and proceeded down the hallway and entered the monkey room.

1195
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,360
The healthy monkeys went nuts.

1196
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,240
Humans and spaces made monkeys nervous.

1197
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,340
All the monkeys in those cages were infected with Ebola virus.

1198
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,960
Their immune system had failed or gone haywire.

1199
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,060
They sat almost motionless in their cages,

1200
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,220
watching the two officers with expressionless faces.

1201
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,680
They had been injected.

1202
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:45,140
They were infected with the hottest type of Ebola known to the world.

1203
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:48,640
It was the myelitis strain of Ebola's I.E.

1204
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:52,120
I love little poor little guys.

1205
00:54:55,360 --> 00:55:00,380
Oh, you know, I know just how you feel, poor little people.

1206
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,240
Oh, you're all sad and foamy.

1207
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:08,980
I know I want to cheer you little guys up.

1208
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,540
Come on, let's take a walk.

1209
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:12,220
Come on.

1210
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,240
Come on.

1211
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,440
Come on.

1212
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,240
Take some flies when you eat outside.

1213
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:23,320
Remember, flies carry dangerous germs on their feet.

1214
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,380
They're not so many with the germs.

1215
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:30,460
On the morning of Earth, traffic this morning is as bad as it gets.

1216
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:35,420
Due to the fire at the Omicast lab, a bunch of escaped infected monkeys are roaming the expressway.

1217
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:41,520
Despite the sweltering heat, don't unroll your windows because those monkeys seem confused and cannibal.

1218
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,440
Come on.

1219
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,400
The army is reporting the ape's position.

1220
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,380
General Sutton clearly favors a capture and not a kill.

1221
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,180
Units under Colonel Nevin have left their headquarters

1222
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,560
to block the male gorilla and divert him to where he can be apprehended.

1223
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:23,720
Oh, no. My dad's going to kill me.

1224
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:28,020
The virus absolutely nuked the monkeys.

1225
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,920
It was a complete slate wiper.

1226
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,060
Is there anything you can do, Doctor?

1227
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:36,140
I'm going to see how you've lost over 200 million patients.

1228
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,780
You seem like a nice lady.

1229
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,880
Well, that nice lady set the cause of biological warfare back 30 years.

1230
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:42,660
We're only now.

1231
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,560
I'm finally caught up.

1232
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:45,380
Hey.

1233
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,560
You know, I'm starting to feel a lot better.

1234
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:54,840
Maybe there's something to this medical science racket.

1235
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,300
Sister, you're healed. You can get out of that bed.

1236
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,500
I don't know about that.

1237
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,760
Now he gets the house.

1238
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,500
There's a whole bunch of them in there going crazy.

1239
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,260
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1240
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,860
It's so bad. I'm so scared.

1241
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:09,540
I'm dead.

1242
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:12,540
Jesus, you should have been.

1243
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:12,980
You're going to get out of here quicker.

1244
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,520
If Jesus doesn't come quick enough, do you give up?

1245
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:18,760
Huh?

1246
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:21,140
You've got Groningson's disease.

1247
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,960
I can see 10 clear symptoms on your flesh.

1248
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,600
You're going to be dead in two weeks.

1249
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,720
And I became convinced I had the disease.

1250
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,120
The symptoms were so evident and said,

1251
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,160
Oh, what should I do?

1252
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:30,900
And then you said,

1253
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,240
Don't worry. This is a cure to Groningson's disease.

1254
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,060
I told my house to raise the money to give it to you.

1255
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,500
It's given to you as a free gift.

1256
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:39,300
I'm not going to despise your sacrifice.

1257
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,100
I'm going to appreciate it.

1258
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,520
And I'm going to appropriate it.

1259
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:42,640
Why?

1260
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,220
Because I've seen the disease.

1261
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:45,960
But I might appreciate the cure.

1262
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:49,100
And, Sally, what's happened in the U.S. and the Western world as follows

1263
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:53,380
is that we have preached the cure without first convincing you of the disease.

1264
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:53,900
Whoa!

1265
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,160
My brethren, our task is nearly complete.

1266
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,540
He was the last of those who brought the punishment to us.

1267
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,420
We have cleansed and purged his world.

1268
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:05,480
I don't have it.

1269
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,000
Have what?

1270
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:08,140
It's plague.

1271
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,280
I'm immune.

1272
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,000
Everybody has it.

1273
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,500
Everybody but me.

1274
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:12,860
Yeah.

1275
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:22,480
Ten days after he fell sick, the doctors noticed a change for the better.

1276
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,820
His fever subsided and his eyes cleared.

1277
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,920
His mind and personality came back.

1278
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,120
And he recovered slowly but completely.

1279
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:30,740
He was released from the hospital.

1280
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,260
And then, right after that, he died.

1281
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,240
And I kind of feel there's something that's quite right about that.

1282
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:40,820
It's a little odd, but the way he died, I kind of question it.

1283
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,940
It seems to be a lot of unanswered questions.

1284
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,440
Zoos of this blood went to laboratories around the world.

1285
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,480
Some of it ended up in glass bottles.

1286
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:48,280
Oh, no!

1287
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,040
And freezers owned by the United States Army,

1288
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,120
where it is kept immortal in a zoo of hot agents.

1289
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,240
It was a complete slate labor.

1290
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,860
Well, after that, all I've got to say.

1291
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,060
You want to know what's going on?
