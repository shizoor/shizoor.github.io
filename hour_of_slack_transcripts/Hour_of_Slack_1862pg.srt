Aber, äh, anyway,

25
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,360

Äh, äh, yes,

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,340
this music in the background is, äh,

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,360
somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,860
Yeah, there's an album called Mary Axmus,

30
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,400
a guitar axmus.

31
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,820
It's cool, man, cool!

32
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,900
And, äh, äh, äh, äh, äh,

48
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,700
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?

49
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,240
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw.

50
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,280
Yeah, I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells

51
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,500
till I get the damn chainsaw fixed

52
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,900
and back in my arm the way it was Tuesday.

53
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,960
Now you boys be good

54
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,400
and I'll give you some of this here.

55
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,640
It ain't no good of a child.

56
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,520
That dog's running off with them brain cells.

57
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,060
Can you do something about that, boy?

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,900
I'm gonna have to...

59
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,300
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.

60
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,820
I'm gonna have to...

61
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,180
I'm gonna have to...

62
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,420
What?

63
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,100
Eric Cranston!

64
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,680
What we as manufacturers sell you is fun.

65
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,760
The faith of a child.

66
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,780
Spend all the money you've got.

67
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,920
Spend all the money you've got.

68
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,600
The Christmas Trough.

69
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,040
Oh, look.

70
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,560
Dave's dressed like Santa Claus.

71
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,800
He's like a cowboy Santa.

72
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,480
How jolly.

73
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,220
Oh, Jazz is giving Dave the show pill.

74
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,680
Boy, I really...

75
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,080
Was soll ich mit dem Laufmann in seinem Schuh machen?

76
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,500
Ich brauche das Show-Bath.

77
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,580
Das Show-Delousing.

78
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,540
Oh, Dave hat nicht mal Headphones.

79
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
Das ist genug.

80
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,840
Oh, er hat Headphones.

81
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,160
Ich habe auch die Part von meinem Pankreas, die ich euch jetzt zeigen möchte.

82
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,260
Es ist in der Sache erhöht.

83
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,560
Oh, dein Pankreas sieht toll aus, Dave.

84
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,500
Schau, es ist schwebend.

85
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,960
Ich habe die Möglichkeit, 190 IQ-Brand zu haben.

86
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,180
Ich werde mehr Pille für alle machen.

87
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,480
Oh, diese Pille, sie machen meine Mundschutz auf Feuer.

88
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,060
Und mein Gehirn fühlt sich an wie ein Puddel aus liquefierter Kristalle.

89
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,780
Ich bin überrascht.

90
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,280
Die roten Pille sind wirklich gut.

91
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,760
Ich würde gerne die rote und die blaue nehmen.

92
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,120
Die rote und die blaue.

93
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,360
Am gleichen Zeit.

94
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,660
So gehst du in und aus.

95
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,820
Die Wartemix ist einfach.

96
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:36,940
Und aus.

97
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,900
Die ist so hoch, du kannst nicht über sie gehen.

98
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,440
Angels, wir haben auf hohem Flugzeug gehört,

99
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,260
singen über die Berge.

100
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,500
Und diese Berge, in Antwort,

101
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,300
sagten, wir wünschen, wir hätten auch einige.

102
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

103
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,080
In Exelsis Deo.

104
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

105
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,860
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

106
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,160
It excels this day.

107
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,780
Barbie Dolls.

108
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,960
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

109
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,120
Women rape and memorialize their lives by role-playing with Barbie.

110
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,200
Barbie Dolls.

111
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,200


112
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,420
Barbie Dolls.

113
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:53,300
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

114
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,960
They will empower us to resist us.

115
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,140
You will use your church as a vehicle.

116
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,620
Bring these toys before the power.

117
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:12,260
It will be a battle for kids.

118
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:22,800
But how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

119
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,220
Good have lots of muscles.

120
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,500
Good.

121
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,400
Good!

122
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,760
The primitive earth societies should accept this value.

123
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:42,980
Good will have very physical attributes according to human desires, sexual desires,

124
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:52,620
latent in children brought out through the vehicle of this so-called...

125
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,900
So Farmer told these boys at church, batteries not good.

126
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,440
She's new from Kenner.

127
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,620
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

128
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,760
Oh, we must fight.

129
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,680
We must fight our toys.

130
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,520
Yes.

131
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,980
The old subgenius toy marketing scheme.

132
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,760
Recorded there at Dockstock 1984.

133
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,840
And me and Palmer Vreedys.

134
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,520
Angels We Have Heard on High.

135
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,700
It was by the Philistines.

136
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:32,240
The collage called All the Money You've Got is from the great obtuse Christmas collage album,

137
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,760
which you can find on the Internet.

That's obt...

143
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,480
Excuse me.

144
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,680
Ah, yes.

145
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,380
And next up, the real story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.

146
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,820
The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.

147
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,460
Once upon a time, there was the baby Jesus.

148
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,920
And he had two eyes made out of coal.

149
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,100
And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.

150
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,780
And he wanted his two front teeth.

151
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,860
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.

152
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,320
And he had a dog named Santa's little helper.

153
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,820
And he took all the presents from Whoville.

154
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,620
And his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys.

155
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,440
And he wanted to go to the movies.

156
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,360
And he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy.

157
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,560
But he couldn't.

158
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,580
He wanted 10s and 20s.

159
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,000
10s and 20s.

160
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,520
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.

161
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,280
And he got Zuzu's pedals.

162
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,860
And that's the real story of Christmas.

163
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:16,320
Well, that'll be in the next episode.

164
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,900
Good night, y'all.

165
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,380
See ya' in the next one.

166
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,200

00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,320

00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:31,420


174
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,320
Ich werde diesen MTV-Bombardement nutzen, um dich normal zu machen.

175

Hör auf, Pinkboy!

176
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,300
Keine Ahnung, ich werde nie für die Konspiration verkaufen.

177
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,140
Schau dir ein bisschen meiner Rocket-Pipe an, Alien-Tool.

178
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,300

Und die Bastards des Universums.

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,340

Von Bob Dodds.

186
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,640

Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas.

194
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,140
He wanted an electric train.

195
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,160
He had the whole thing in his mind, even to the table,

196
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:29,940
and his door was going to it.

197
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:42,140
That was what he knew.

198
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,500
He had the whole green prize,

199
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,460
so when he bought Taw masala he knew exactly what he was gonna eat.

200
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,660

208

But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.

209
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,700
It is turnover.

So come and get it, everyone, and just buy our products.

214
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,220
I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

215
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,600
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?

216
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,920
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.

217
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,720
But the present subgenie try to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now

218
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,560
and sell everything to the pigs.

219
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,760
Oh, yes.

220
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,200
Once a pagan holiday.

221
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,480
And now a shopping season.

222
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,860
And it was something else in between there.

223
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:40,200
But before it was, after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season,

224
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,680
it was something else.

225
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,440
But I think they started to war over it.

226
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

227
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,160
And then at the end of the year, the name of Santa Claus got into that.

228
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,460
And Spruch am Gaben.

229
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:07,860

He was a huge, beastly, bulging man.

He was so real. How come we didn't get squat last year?

274
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:13,820
