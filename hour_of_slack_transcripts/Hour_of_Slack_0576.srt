1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:06,500
I'm not insane. I'm... well, I am insane, actually. I'm insane.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,980
And so there's really no point in getting upset about it.

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:22,400
I'm merely experiencing life from a deviational viewpoint.

4
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:36,360
So, any serious dissatisfactions I might have, though they may be subjectively real to me, actually,

5
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:44,500
since that doesn't impact the actual reality around me in any positive way,

6
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:51,000
why even acknowledge the existence of such disgruntledness?

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:59,180
Except for such purposes as this mini-rant

8
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:07,480
by which we try to excuse the vastness of our egos,

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,540
our royal egos, yes,

10
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:18,460
by at least some self-mockery,

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,280
which even then is so hollow.

12
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:30,060
Because for one whose ego is truly, truly vast,

13
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,640
and thus invulnerable, unshakable,

14
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,660
for one such as, yes, I,

15
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,380
I forgot what I was going to say,

16
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,840
but whatever it was, if I ever do remember it,

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,700
pick up on it, man.

18
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,280
The Subgenius Hour of Slack

19
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,080
I guess it's time to start up another one of those shows again.

20
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,780
Yeah, let's do a show.

21
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,120
We'll record.

22
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,400
And more believers over to Bob.

23
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,340
Yes, Bob desires more souls,

24
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,840
and we must bring them in.

25
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,560
Bring in the money, stay awake, cast out needy.

26
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,840
Bring in the money, stay awake, cast out needy.

27
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,100
Bring in the money.

28
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,340
My life for me.

29
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,820
You prevented me from being a rich, famous movie star like you.

30
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,720
And I just want you to know,

31
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,280
I'm...

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:52,900
really upset.

33
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,940
Ah, but who cares, dear friends?

34
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,900
Who cares?

35
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,380
Because the end times are coming up.

36
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,860
You know, it's the first day of the end of the world.

37
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,480
And, uh,

38
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,400
we've been given, Bob has given to,

39
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,120
has given us to see signs and portents

40
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,760
of what will bring this end,

41
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,300
and what will trigger the day of judgment.

42
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,940
Oh, hi, guys, boys.

43
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,140
Sorry I'm so late.

44
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,740
I was at the Gingrich's animal party and lost track.

45
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,840
Hey, what's this new switch here?

46
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,640
Uh...

47
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,560
Remember, this is not really Armageddon.

48
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,020
It's only in your radio.

49
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,020
If it were real, you'd know it.

50
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,280
Okay, I think we're all set.

51
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,100
Here we go.

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:52,400


53
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,000
It's all its fault.

54
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,560
And you aren't helping me.

55
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,800
But it's crazy.

56
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,720
Not like me.

57
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,300
I'm perfect and good.

58
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,440
And it is ruining everything in my life.

59
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,780
It's like, man, I'm sorry.

60
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,140
I ain't Bob.

61
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,300
I'm just Reverend Stank.

62
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,500
All I got into this for was to preach the word of Bob.

63
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,900
I didn't want to be a businessman.

64
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,400
I didn't want to be an executor of the dead guy's estate.

65
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,600
And our life-changing books,

66
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,280
all...

67
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,300
free of charge to prisoners.

68
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,400
You have been listening to...

69
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,040
Just shut up.

70
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,700
Thank God.

71
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,320


72
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,920
I said I have what I have.

73
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,920
Thank God.

74
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,000
Some people don't understand.

75
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,420
Help them, God.

76
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,040
Some people don't understand.

77
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,860
Help them, God.

78
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,920
Oh, help them, Bob.

79
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,880
Oh, help them.

80
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,060
Help them to understand.

81
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:11,720
No.

82
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,100
But actually, friends,

83
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,360
I always say,

84
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,000
get up in the morning in a terrible tissy fit.

85
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,900
But it is the hour of slack.

86
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,840
And we do have slack, actually.

87
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,180
You know,

88
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,680
I was...

89
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,180
Whenever I think about all the pressures

90
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,560
and the stresses and strains and,

91
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,620
oh, you know,

92
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,620
the physical exhaustion of having to satisfy all those groupies.

93
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,040
You know, I start to complain and then I think to myself,

94
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,820
well, I'll bet you Christopher Reeve

95
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,100
probably is wishing he didn't have to pay somebody

96
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,360
to scratch his nose right now.

97
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,260
So I shouldn't be griping and complaining.

98
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,840
And I should be praising.

99
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,720
I should be praising Bob.

100
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,040
But you know what, friends?

101
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,020
I tell you what,

102
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,980
I like to gripe and complain.

103
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,960
And there's a good reason to gripe and complain in this modern day and age,

104
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,620
especially if you're a subgenius.

105
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,280
Worst thing to complain about is that X-Day ain't here yet.

106
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,620
Another...

107
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:18,160
I believe my computer this morning told me there was 438 days till X-Day.

108
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,100
Glorious X-Day.

109
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,560
Yes, the day...

110
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,480
Well, friends, I think we're going to do an X-Day show.

111
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,960
I'm going to attempt to put this show together from...

112
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,240
during the course of two or three days, actually,

113
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:39,720
instead of my normal routine of sitting down to whack the show together in one morning.

114
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,920
I'll just be playing, listening to music in the background while I work on my other stuff.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,280
And when I hear something good, well, and it has to do with X-Day, the day, the day,

116
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:58,940
dear friends, the day, July 5th, 1998, a specific day, 7 o'clock in the morning, very specific time,

117
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:06,900
the day, the moment when the men from Planet X shall come to this planet and...

118
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,400
and rupture up the subgeniuses.

119
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:21,100
Yes, we will suffer the Earth blues no longer as we go to join Bob and his crew of sex,

120
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,320
sex goddesses, and, well, they're all sex goddesses, but some of them look like sex gods, okay?

121
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,580
But let's not get lost in the dogma, friends.

122
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,080
We must focus on the one true fact, which is our salvation at the hands of Bob on X-Day,

123
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,900
when we are saved.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,560
Those of us who have purchased our $30 subgenius membership, ministership,

125
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,100
and are, in fact, ordained children of Bob, ordained ministers, not just some, you know...

126
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,140
I mean, this is... we're more...

127
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,080
We're more...

128
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,080
We're not like some of these other religions that say,

129
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,980
oh, anybody can join our religion, anyone.

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,120
We welcome everyone.

131
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,320
We don't welcome everyone.

132
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,580
We welcome everyone who has $30 to spend on Bob.

133
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,260
If you think Bob's worth that much, then okay, we'll let you hang around for a while.

134
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,720
If we decide that you're really a subgenius, you'll know.

135
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,560
And you know how you know?

136
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,680
You'll magically start ordering a lot of church goods from us,

137
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,060
T-shirts, and stuff.

138
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,620
T-shirts, and stuff.

139
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:21,620


140
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,120
T-shirts, keychains, tapes, videos, things like that.

141
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,000
That's how you know that you're not just one of those Bobbies I was complaining about.

142
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,360
It's that simple.

143
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,340
Ah, yeah, so good to be...

144
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,880
To get away from the complexities of all those rival religions

145
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:47,000
and just sink deeper down into the word, the word of God.

146
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,440
Bob, I love you, man.

147
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,200
I love you.

148
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,940
I'm not a homo, really.

149
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,880
I'm not even bisexual, not really.

150
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,420
I like to pretend I am just to be cool.

151
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,780
But Bob, I still love you, even if I'm just a square old polygamist.

152
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,100
Man, I just...

153
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,820
Bob, I love what you've done for me.

154
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,540
I love what you sold me.

155
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,260
I love what you told me.

156
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,200
And I love what you promised for X Day.

157
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,920
I love what you told me, Bob.

158
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,760
You told me...

159
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,360
Somehow, Bob, you told me what I most wanted to hear in all my life.

160
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,840
Oh, God, it seems too good to be true.

161
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,260
It just seems too good to be true.

162
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,940
But I know it ain't.

163
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,200
I know it ain't.

164
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,340
¶¶

165
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:48,000
¶ See what I used to be wounded ¶

166
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,700
¶ Remember the scars ¶

167
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,620
¶ But now you can't see a thing ¶

168
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,580
¶ And I don't feel no pain ¶

169
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,900
¶ No, no ¶

170
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,120
¶ Hey ¶

171
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,060
¶ Singing about the valleys of sunrise ¶

172
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,700
¶ Green and blue canyons too ¶

173
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,080
¶ I'm singing about a mantis bird's age ¶

174
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,220
¶ But is there enough to win this rising ¶

175
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,360
¶ Rising ¶

176
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,900
¶ Rising ¶

177
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,700
¶ Dare to dance ¶

178
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,720
¶ Do it instead ¶

179
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,760
¶ Oh, yagh ¶

180
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:49,220
¶ This girl needs like some thing of herself ¶

181
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,220


182
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,220


183
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,220


184
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,220


185
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,300
¶ Great christmas! ¶

186
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:49,320
¶ Yagh ¶

187
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:49,680
¶ Yagh ¶

188
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,320
Why do you want to be normal?

189
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,380
The rupture is upon us, dear friends.

190
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,300
That fateful day, July 5th, 1998.

191
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,060
Next days are coming.

192
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,940
And the peaks are coming.

193
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,620
Next days are coming.

194
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,620
And the peaks are coming.

195
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,880
Sure, when the rupture hits,

196
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,540
we'll all be in our first-class window seats on the pleasure saucers

197
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,380
watching the little pink boys fry.

198
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,760
Turn on, tune in, and...

199
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,220
We certainly don't want to split, stupid fool.

200
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,660
Next days are coming.

201
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:49,980
Next days are coming.

202
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,260
And the peaks are coming.

203
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,680
Sure, J.R. Bob Dobbs is my savior.

204
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,320
And of course I want more slack.

205
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,940
And I'm smoking prop nonstop.

206
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,360
But what I really want...

207
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,340
Oh yeah, that's right.

208
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,040
Those lovely alien nympho mutants.

209
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,100
Oh!

210
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,400
Oh!

211
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,600
Non-stop orgies on the pleasure saucers.

212
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,600
Oh, I love to be naked.

213
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,660
More, more.

214
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,820
Oh, Bob.

215
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,560
Turn on, tune in, and...

216
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,200
We certainly don't want to split, stupid fool.

217
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,020
And of course I want to be naked.

218
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,260
We certainly don't want to split, stupid fool.

219
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:49,260


220
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,440
X days are coming

221
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,540
And the pigs are bumming

222
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,060
I said X days are coming

223
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,340
And them little pigs are bumming

224
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,820
Those conspiracy Duke Pinkboy normals are gonna fry

225
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,600
They won't even know what hit them

226
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,360
That old stark fist is gonna come down hard

227
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,040
But nothing's guaranteed, dear friends

228
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,260
I'm a card-carrying member of the Church of the Subgenius

229
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,140
I'm the almighty king of slap

230
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,040
But when X day comes around

231
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,600
The only thing I have is my unshakable faith in Bob

232
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,360
Turn on

233
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,040
Tune in

234
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,320
On X

235
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,200
X days are coming

236
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,280
And the pigs are bumming

237
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:05,820
X days are coming

238
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,640
And the pigs are bumming

239
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,520
Listen to me, mister

240
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,200
It's salvation I'm talking about

241
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,040
X days are coming

242
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,920
X days are coming

243
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,460
X days are coming

244
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,080
X days are coming

245
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,660
X days are coming

246
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:33,000
Dr. Lewis West, a psychiatrist and cult specialist at UCLA, has seen all this before.

247
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,160
With fanatical beliefs in some person or idea,

248
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,240
a very rigid structure of control over the members,

249
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,300
and thick boundaries between the membership and the outside world,

250
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:47,300


251
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:55,600
Dr. Lewis says, the parallel is so strong to Jim Jones and the 900 followers who died drinking cyanide in 1978,

252
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,900
the 80 followers of David Koresh who died in the inferno at Waco,

253
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:06,160
and the 74 members of the Order of the Solar Temple who have killed themselves in Europe and Canada since 1995.

254
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,200
It's a Honda.

255
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,160
It's a Camry.

256
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,380
It's a Taurus.

257
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,180
Is this comet perhaps a sign of the end time?

258
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:17,280
Yes.

259
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:17,280


260
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,720
It's well known in the church that it's all a sign of the end of time.

261
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,440
This one was specifically forecast over a year ago,

262
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,340
including the confusion about the name Hail Bob.

263
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,920
It appeared in the book of the subgenius as long as 15 years ago,

264
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,340
in a rather cryptic fashion, but it's there.

265
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,580
I've got the book with me tonight.

266
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,820
Far less cryptic than, say, the predictions of Nostradamus.

267
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,580
Oh, far less. Far less.

268
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,560
And a lot more accurate, too.

269
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,280
To be fair to Nostradamus,

270
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,680
he did predict the end of the world in July of 1999,

271
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,440
and since he was doing that from about 500 years before,

272
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,380
he was only off by about two-tenths of a percent,

273
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,040
which really beats out a fair amount of the science you can find in the journals over here in the library.

274
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,640
You certainly raise a good point there.

275
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:08,340
So could you tell us when you think the end of the world will be?

276
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,260
Oh, absolutely.

277
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,340
7 a.m. local time, July 5th, 1998.

278
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,300
What if you're on, say, solar time, as, say, India is?

279
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,500
Will that local time proceed, say, minute by minute,

280
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,860
as the sun reaches, you know, the azimuth of 7 a.m.?

281
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,960
Well, as I understand it, the death rays of the Exos saucers

282
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,400
will be taking out approximately 15 degrees of the Earth's surface at a time.

283
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,660
They'll be lined up from pole to pole and wiping it clean as it goes,

284
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,640
and they'll be taking it pretty much time zone by time zone.

285
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,940
Okay, it may not match exactly, but they'll get them all.

286
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,320
Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, it's not a problem with Earth.

287
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,200
It's not a problem with their technology.

288
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,200
It's a problem with ours and the way we keep time.

289
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,940
Well, not ours.

290
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,260
That's a frequently unfortunate pronoun to use

291
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,060
because this is the pinks who have constructed this.

292
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,620
Oh, this is true. This is true.

293
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,000
And now that the end times are here,

294
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,960
we who have been hiding the yet and sin,

295
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,600
the remnants of the folks from Atlantis

296
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,840
that created the humans by an unfortunate genetic experiment gone wild,

297
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,780
we want it to be known we've been here all along.

298
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,640
You've seen some of us in the woods called us Bigfoot and things like that,

299
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,700
but that's not quite accurate.

300
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,460
But we've been here all along, and we're pretty honked off, actually,

301
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,620
about the way things are going.

302
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,600
And we're pretty much just getting ready for July 5 of 98 so that we can laugh at you.

303
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,160
Well, I mean, I think that laughing at people is something we need to do more of.

304
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:37,840
Absolutely.

305
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,260
In fact, if you've been listening to the show out there and also you yourself,

306
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,820
you know that we're going to be laughing at you.

307
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,220
And I think that's the thing that we're going to be trying to do.

308
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,220


309
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,220


310
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,060
It's a thing that I try as much as possible to poke fun at our guests.

311
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,940
I don't do this because I'm a mean person.

312
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:56,040
I do it because, you know, humor is a remedy medicine that we need more of in this world.

313
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,720
Absolutely.

314
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,120
The world is sick.

315
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,880
It needs some healing.

316
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,080
And we have some of that healing.

317
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,640
As the Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh from Devo,

318
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,420
one of the early members of the church, said,

319
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,680
I'm going to be a good man for a constipated society.

320
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,560
And it...

321
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,820
Yes, dear friends, it's true.

322
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:27,620
The Church of the Subgenius is, in fact, that enema for a constipated society.

323
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,520
And that was Dr. Dinosaur,

324
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,440
king of alt.slack,

325
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,860
the subgenius internet news group.

326
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:47,420
Not that he would ever want to take on that mantle of king.

327
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,340
But he, you know, he's the silverback.

328
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,080
He's the one who's been there longest.

329
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:59,120
Dr. Dinosaur on that local radio station there in Virginia.

330
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,280
And I don't even know what the heck it was.

331
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,720
But friends, you know what we're trying to do tonight,

332
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,900
and probably for the next several shows,

333
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,280
is pull together the X Day spirit.

334
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,840
You know, that's the spirit.

335
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,360
That's really what we're going to try to do,

336
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:19,860
is build you up to the point where you'll take it seriously.

337
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:27,360
You know, I mean, not necessarily as seriously as the Heaven's Gate people.

338
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,700
I mean, you may find that's true.

339
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,400
There is such a thing.

340
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,660
You know, too much is always better than not enough.

341
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,700
But it's almost as bad.

342
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,840
The recent mass suicide of 39 cult members

343
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,180
have left America spiritually confused

344
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,160
about the difference between a cult and a true religion.

345
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,220
It says here in this communist newsletter here,

346
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,060
The Nation.

347
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,860
I don't know if you've ever encountered that one before, friends.

348
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:10,760
But there is actually quite a concise and to-the-point essay about that.

349
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,880
And I guess after this, maybe we'll really leave the Heaven's Gate thing alone.

350
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,040
You know, it's hard for us to let go of it.

351
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,680
It's so much fun to just grab it in our jaws

352
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,980
and shake it like a bulldog would shake a little old Raggedy Ann doll

353
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,480
that smells like its owner.

354
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,780
Anyway, um...

355
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,620
Typical is the recent headline over a story in the New York Times.

356
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:46,460
A fringe millennialist group that used disconnected elements of Christianity.

357
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,080
Lest more Americans be tragically led astray,

358
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,400
we offer this guide to the differences between a real religion

359
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,120
and a cult.

360
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,280
And this that I'm reading is from that magazine, The Nation.

361
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,320
April 21st.

362
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,180
And this little bit here is by Richard Lingeman.

363
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:14,300
And, uh, Edward Sorrell, I believe, illustrated it.

364
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,700
But you know, friends...

365
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:25,040
A characteristic common to many cults is a belief in heavenly signs,

366
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,720
such as comets.

367
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,940
Such pseudoscience should be carefully distinguished

368
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,920
from credible miracles fully documented in the Bible,

369
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,920
such as Ezekiel's wheel or the star in the east.

370
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,340
Modern cults often boast of contacts with extraterrestrial entities

371
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,580
such as flying saucers or aliens

372
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:50,160
who bring them comfort or glad tidings from elsewhere in the universe.

373
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:55,840
Such images are easily confused with true divine messengers like angels,

374
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,540
whose reality is widely accepted by thinking people.

375
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,560
See numerous gift shops, movies, and television shows,

376
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,120
Time magazine covers.

377
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,840
Cults like Heaven's Game,

378
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,620
Teach That Our Bodies Are Mere...

379
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,140
Containers of the Soul,

380
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,740
Which Death Liberates to Move to a Higher Plane of Existence.

381
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,080
These perversions of religion could easily be mistaken

382
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,760
for the widely accepted Buddhist doctrine of reincarnation

383
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,300
or the Christian belief in heaven.

384
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,580
Cults also regard the body as a source of corruption.

385
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,820
This extreme belief,

386
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:37,940
which is often misinterpreted as a form of self-deception,

387
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:37,940


388
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,840
The doctrine should not be confused with theologically sound

389
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:46,260
tenets of ascetism found in many religions such as St. Paul.

390
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,160
Cults often urge their followers to live communally

391
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,760
to avoid contamination by worldliness.

392
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,620
This practice should never be confused with well-established communities

393
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,040
like monasteries, nunneries,

394
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,940
gush, emunim settlements on the West Bank, etc.

395
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,780
A pervasive characteristic of cults

396
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:16,080
is their demand that members contribute money to the cause.

397
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,820
Such pleas should not be mistaken for legitimate requests

398
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,180
such as those by respected evangelical ministers on television

399
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,440
for faith offerings from viewers.

400
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,940
Cults also indoctrinate their followers.

401
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:35,440
Such practices are different from demands that religion be taught in public schools

402
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,440
or that children attend parochial schools or religious academies.

403
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,780
Nearly all cults are dominated by some charismatic leader

404
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,580
who claims to know the one true way to enlightenment.

405
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,760
This is an oblivious borrowing of the Old Testament account

406
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,700
of Moses receiving the Ten Commandments from God.

407
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,120
See also Buddhism, Hinduism, and so forth.

408
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,520
These are indeed trying times for men's and women's souls.

409
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,340
Hail Bop, Hail Mary, they say.

410
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,940
There, yes, uh...

411
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,500
Obvious, perhaps, but, you know, it can't be said enough.

412
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:23,620
In the meantime, we also have run across our friend, well, our friend Modemac up in Boston.

413
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,100
Discovered this magazine. Paranoid.

414
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,700
Uh, he says here in this letter,

415
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,980
I've heard of paranoia, but never seen it before now.

416
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,540
Issues are hard to find.

417
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:41,240
Uh, but fortunately, years of scanning alt-dot conspiracy

418
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,740
have prepared me for the sort of wild-eyed ranting

419
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,120
to be found in the pages of this magazine.

420
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,980
And, uh, he says there's conspiracy theories all through paranoia.

421
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,860
Actually, I've seen paranoia, uh, has been around for a while.

422
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,080
The subject of this letter, uh, is paranoia.

423
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,680
The subjects covered in this issue include OJ DNA and the conspiracy on trial.

424
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:06,820
Uh, who killed Yitzhak Rabin, um, so forth, so on.

425
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:12,340
The TWA 800 bombings, uh, Madeline Murray O'Hare's disappearance.

426
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,680
But, here's where we come to the article.

427
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,000
Satanism, the Illuminati, and the Andromitans.

428
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,780
Written by R. Roy Blake.

429
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,980
And illustrated with Michael Aquino of the Temple of Set.

430
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,980
With a picture of J.R. Bob Dobbs, taken directly from the cover of Revelation X.

431
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:38,580
And, uh, Mr. Blake gives us a long rambling essay about the relationship between Satanism,

432
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,160
the Illuminati, alien ships from Andromeda, and the Church of the Subgenius.

433
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,940
Here is an excerpt containing his ruminations on our mighty Church.

434
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,640
Note his reference to the Necronomicon,

435
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,760
a book that most people think doesn't exist.

436
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:09,580
Descriptions of certain types of aliens have distinct similarities with some of the evil entities that are found in occult nature,

437
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:16,220
and are occasionally described as having interacted with secret societies throughout human history.

438
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,220
The second largest Satanic bestseller of all time, the Necronomicon,

439
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,680
describes an evil being,

440
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,540
known as the Eater of Souls.

441
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,720
One whistleblowing and very frightened governmental insider,

442
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,620
who claimed to be aware of a governmental alien cooperation,

443
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:40,720
talked about alien ships, which conducted a harvest of souls.

444
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:48,240
Some occult writers have speculated that the Eater of Souls is a more frightening entity than the Devil himself.

445
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,480
In the cryptic Illuminatus trilogy,

446
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,660
the authors suggest that such beings are not the only beings that are in the Necronomicon,

447
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,760
and that they are not supernatural at all,

448
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,480
but rather because they are able to manipulate dimensions in unknown ways,

449
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,800
merely appear to be supernatural.

450
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,720
Trilogy, the Illuminatus trilogy, is a wild ride,

451
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:11,300
and indeed so wild that its plot defies description here.

452
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:19,240
Another interesting piece to the puzzle was provided by an anonymous source within the military,

453
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,140
who contended that some of the people involved with the Illuminatus trilogy,

454
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:31,780
were also involved with the popular 1980s church of the subgenius, Bob Dobbs and Slack.

455
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,240
For those not familiar with the above phenomena,

456
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:40,960
the weekly radio show Night Flight ran a series of not-so-musical videos in the 1980s,

457
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,420
put out by an organization which called itself the Church of the Subgenius.

458
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,040
The videos included blatant hypnotic and post-hypnotic suggestion,

459
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,960
prompting speculation that they were one of the more obvious attempts

460
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,760
at mind control made over the airwaves.

461
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:03,580
The subgenius videos also included dizzyingly rapid images of satanic symbology

462
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,500
that was apparently aimed at the subconscious.

463
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,220
In a deep voice, the announcer told the story of super salesman Bob Dobbs,

464
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,780
while the cartoon image of Bob with the pipe was turned back and forth at such rapid speed

465
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,760
that at times it looked like a swastika.

466
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,760
The announcer explained how Bob had stumbled upon the secrets

467
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,320
of who really runs the world.

468
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,780
A subsequent book put out by the same church suggested its followers

469
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:36,520
use the number 666 as frequently as possible if for no other reason than to annoy Christians.

470
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:43,220
Among the strangest of its internal revelations was that aliens secretly control the world

471
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,620
through a secret structure which also controls world government.

472
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,580
The supposed world headquarters of the aliens and their human puppets

473
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,880
were located somewhere in New York City.

474
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,660
To punish small transgressions on the part of their human puppets,

475
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:02,200
the aliens employed a device known as a migraine machine.

476
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,860
As a frequent sufferer of migraine headaches,

477
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,240
I can testify how effective such a device might be for torture.

478
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,720
And friends, you can find out more about the Church of the Subgenius

479
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,300
from the conspiracy reader at P.O. Box 1041.

480
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,840
Providence, Rhode Island, 02901.

481
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:36,560
Or you can write directly to Bob at Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

482
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,200
And when we come back on Side 2, dear friends,

483
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,360
it will be nothing but X-Day.

484
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:47,520
Yes, we will travel through space using the music of the spheres

485
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,600
to carry us on upward spiral.

486
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,360
Ever, ever upwards and onwards.

487
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,380
Farther away from the gravity of this,

488
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,180
oh, this mundane, sad world.

489
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,060
Yes, we'll go on to a new, a new land that Bob told us about.

490
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:07,940
A new land where, uh, everything we ever wanted to be told about,

491
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,780
we are told about. Thank you.

492
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,080
Well, that's some mighty good frapper you got there, Reverend Stang.

493
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:20,060
I just wanted to thank you, from all the other demons here in Hell,

494
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,380
for carrying on this show for all these years.

495
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:30,040
We really appreciate everything you've done for us and, and Hell in general.

496
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,240
Well, thank you, old splitfoot. I'm so happy to hear.

497
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,860
We're always proud to drag more souls into Hell

498
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:40,500
and, uh, prevent them from ever finding their peace with God,

499
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,220
uh, up there in Heaven.

500
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:48,880
And you have paid us so well in, uh, in, in money, women, drugs, and so forth.

501
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,040
Satan, I just don't know how to explain it.

502
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,680
I don't know how to thank you.

503
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:55,260
I think, uh, I think that, Satan, between you and Church of the Subgenius,

504
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,160
we could own this world.

505
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,840
Now, there's an idea. Hmm.

506
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,260
That's where the

507
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,280
demon came from.

508
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,440
The ish one is going to be the man

509
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,300
Obغ ,

510
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,620
I understand the same thing.

511
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,600
I need to go to the water.

512
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,860
Are extraterrestrials able to accomplish this?

513
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,440
I will explain, but you become more puzzled

514
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,200
at the possibilities.

515
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,180
Earth-ending trilogies, wacky stuff,

516
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,700
light gas passing dinosaurs.

517
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,580
Warlocks drawing circles blindfolded.

518
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,320
Gave a lady some wrinkle cream out of rat poop.

519
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,500
You might just laugh so hard, the skull cracked,

520
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,160
brain spilled, split blood shooting out

521
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,300
like a champagne cork.

522
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,260
Females so horny and mean, sucking scales off of lyrals.

523
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:06,780
Rattlesnakes.

524
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,920
My boy gave his girl money for groceries.

525
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,160
She got a new hairdo.

526
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,800
Women like this could even make the devil commit suicide,

527
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,980
hung from a tree in Johannesburg with no parachute.

528
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,080
Bigfoot captured by UFOs.

529
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,260
Halos were found at the landing site.

530
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,800
Vanishing victims kept alive on metal examining tables.

531
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,620
Experts baffled the survival from crop exposure

532
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,860
to laser scalpels.

533
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,940
Green berets, glowing cold heads and mechanical wounds.

534
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,920
Radioactive constant temperature circular appendages,

535
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,700
crippled starships and in distress signals.

536
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,480
We're not alone in the twilight zone.

537
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,580
They weaved among the trees and bring next speed.

538
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
Keep it simple.

539
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,560
They weaved among the trees and bring next speed.

540
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,520
Keep it simple.

541
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,140
Back in spiral, I roast humans like a gyro.

542
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,580
New York, Atlanta, Africa to Cairo.

543
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,320
Diplomat king, presidential offspring.

544
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,660
New miles from Westinghouse with lights down south.

545
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,280
Government chemical, voodoo man miracle.

546
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,380
Super disease, your brain is more sterical.

547
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,900
My urine see paralyzes your ability with space codes.

548
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,560
Electrode, you're ready for pap smear.

549
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,800
Wax in your inner ear.

550
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,680
Voodoo in your eyes.

551
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:04,880
Out of air.

552
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,760
Two cows, a zebra will jump through your atmosphere.

553
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,940
Giraffe funk with rays beaming through your trunk.

554
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,040
Steam of legion to burn up in your anal region.

555
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,140
Power contracted with bombs in its rectum factor.

556
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,160
Utilize phonic like water in your Panasonic.

557
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,380
Trip or slip or fall right into the earth pit.

558
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,520
Gamma ray toilet, microscopes on your earth shit.

559
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,420
Dr. Ludacris, I turn into an octopus.

560
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,760
Grab eight species, isolate like an incubus.

561
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,960
Convert with probes.

562
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,320
Grease shitters on your ear lobes.

563
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,560
Attack with stomach with juice they call gastric.

564
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,880
Alien bugs with pickle cells.

565
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,960
Get the ass kicked.

566
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,820
Dermatologist, examine more black piss.

567
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,660
Radiation butter pouring down on my face.

568
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,060
Dr. Octodon.

569
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,800
Weaved among the trees at Brinkley speed.

570
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,840
Keep it simple.

571
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,680
Weaved among the trees at Brinkley speed.

572
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,700
Keep it simple.

573
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,960
Utilize to refuse vines.

574
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,020
Slice head halves.

575
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,660
Let's probe the subconscious lobe.

576
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,200
Mathematical parabola at this address.

577
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,480
Explorating a creative arctic region.

578
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,800
An isolated cockpit.

579
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,220
A regular pit stop monitoring with enough fuel to fly a small dirigible to a pasted oasis in a nebula.

580
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:01,780
Earth.

581
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,900
Universal charting unseen atmosphere.

582
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,640
Request a new mission.

583
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,060
Testing assistance.

584
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,340
I speed through brains like a Concorde SST.

585
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,960
An open aperture.

586
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,180
The shape of octagon.

587
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,680
Two legs forward morphing into the vertical Frankenstein.

588
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,380
Prototype of like Kevokian.

589
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,980
Mind pedestrian controls.

590
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,840
Suspend elevation gaveling air during supersonic cruise.

591
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,320
Pattern to think.

592
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,960
Focus psychosis with one blow for the black lotus.

593
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,720
Releasing the lifeless flailing external terminal update.

594
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,860
Thermal conducted power source supplies.

595
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,600
Banner on the moon.

596
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,320
And on suit up cable boxes.

597
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,140
Getting up impossible.

598
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,740
The speaker needs another dose.

599
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,080
Concocted scenario.

600
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,160
View in a position of coroner describing current events.

601
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,420
Bet on human dismemberment to a point of no resemblance.

602
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,420
We're not alone in the twilight zone.

603
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,540
They weave among the trees at breakneck speed.

604
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,520
Keep it simple.

605
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,360
They weave among the trees at breakneck speed.

606
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,220
Keep it simple.

607
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,640
Like Enoch.

608
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,380
I wear my cape.

609
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,180
You can't destroy my impeccable caliber that makes your vision blur.

610
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,140
I drop particle X when having mental sex.

611
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,900
Voodoo rangers with the kids power rangers make me see other men.

612
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,580
Gorillas masturbating with human strangers.

613
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,700
Legally through court.

614
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,880
You're stung by genital wart.

615
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,660
Chlamydia through the city.

616
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,440
Los Angeles, Texas has a servant that's urgent for the mass appeal.

617
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,520
Biomedical test your rectum squeezing in banana pills.

618
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,320
Outwards, backwards toward Boston.

619
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,000
It's Questa androids leaving humans with hemorrhoids.

620
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,520
Thinking more of what they can't explore.

621
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,980
Like the cartoon Donald Duck is giving fellatio on the floor.

622
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,640
With Reed Richards looking at the things naked pictures.

623
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,820
Taking X-lax.

624
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,240
Too relaxed with the needle and thread.

625
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,600
Sewing up all the other butt cracks.

626
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,780
In the industry there's no one who can mess with me.

627
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,140
Dr. Octagon now serving coleslaw and pink pickles.

628
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,560
Eat them on the trees and bring them to the hospital.

629
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:33,560


630
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:33,560


631
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:33,560


632
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:33,560


633
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,020
Keep it simple.

634
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,800
Make a heat among the trees and brake the speed.

635
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,040
Their bikes.

636
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,720
Keep it simple.

637
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,220
Detached his bike and leaped to safety just before it collided with a tree.

638
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,780
And what it's going to be, of course we know when the X's will of course arrive July 5th,

639
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,560
1998 at 7 o'clock in the morning all over the world.

640
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:01,940
But.

641
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:02,960
. .

642
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:09,220
What triggers the end times for the other alien beings, the Yakatizma and so forth,

643
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:17,960
is this one moment when the world, when America becomes so decadent that it no longer deserves to live.

644
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,960
. .

645
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:25,560
And that sign of the end times, dear friends, is the Royal Jelly Enema.

646
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:32,940
At a time 1998, 97, doesn't matter when, might be now, may have already happened.

647
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,560
. . .

648
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:41,060
A time when beggars are crowding the streets and children, poor children are out starving.

649
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:48,060
Celebrities and lawyers in Hollywood will be indulging in the latest hedonistic health,

650
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,060
the crackpot health fad.

651
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:56,700
Getting enemas with pure royal jelly, the honey fed to queen bees,

652
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:02,180
which costs $1,000 for enough royal jelly to get the average jaded swinger,

653
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,200
you know, off or whatever.

654
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,060
And so at this time when the homeless are selling their babies to procure used,

655
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:15,300
leftover ambergris and royal jelly enema byproducts,

656
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:21,940
when a Hollywood star, the moment when a Hollywood star spends $60,000 in one night on that,

657
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:27,200
and his used jelly is sold on the streets for $200 for half a pint,

658
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,160
this so disgusts the aliens that they decide to trash the earth.

659
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,060
Before the excess.

660
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,700
Arrival.

661
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,700
It's going to be a rough time and I'm going to, I'm going to, this is,

662
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,780
this is going to be an all X day night and night of celebrating.

663
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,440
Yes.

664
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,040
That time when Bob will come and hose down the streets and clean up this crooked and perverse nation.

665
00:37:54,260 --> 00:38:00,180
So we're going to hear from, uh, father Joe mama as he delves on into this as well.

666
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,400
Praise Bob.

667
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,320
Hello friends and welcome.

668
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,180
You know, most of you out there must be feeling pretty smug with yourselves.

669
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:17,800
After all, you're alive, you're healthy, your life's insured.

670
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,040
There's little money set aside in case of accidents.

671
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,660
What more could you ask for?

672
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,520
These are good times.

673
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:29,960
Easy money, easy sex, VCRs and Nintendo to keep your minds occupied.

674
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,180
You know, they say.

675
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:31,920
That the.

676
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,360
Golden age is never the present age.

677
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,380
They really do say that.

678
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,580
But we look all around us everywhere.

679
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,840
And what do we say?

680
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,740
Golden opportunity.

681
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:51,700
Well, friends, that's just calm before the storm because tonight's sermon is entitled X day, 1998 day of reckoning.

682
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,680
We all know vaguely what X day is.

683
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,120
Bob told us himself that it shall occur July 5th, 1998.

684
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,620
The X's shall land and whisk the good subgenies off.

685
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:01,820
To.

686
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:01,900
An.

687
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,240
Never an.

688
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,700
Impleasure cruise of the cosmos.

689
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,180
But what of the peaks that remain on Earth?

690
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,520
What will happen to the holes that are left behind?

691
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:18,180
Well, friends, as much as I hate to gloat over those less fortunate, the fact is they'll get exactly what they deserve.

692
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:25,720
Not to any real subgenie giving a normal what he deserves is about the cruelest fate a normal could ever receive.

693
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:31,140
After all, these are the same normals that have supported the conspiracy for centuries.

694
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:36,040
These are the same normals that have tortured us with their ignorance and defiled the name of Bob.

695
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:47,900
These are the same normals that have taken the most free country in the world and turned it into an ever growing bureaucratic governmental monster that feeds on taxes, committees, laws, statutes, buck passing and fill in the blank.

696
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:57,040
Then once the creature's rot filled gut sprues out the digestive combination of all the vices before mentioned by the lawyers and liars that created this filth.

697
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,140
What's the result?

698
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,660
Why, the conspiracy, of course.

699
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:07,200
And this pile of stinking defecation we're supposed to kneel before and worship and serve?

700
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,380
Never!

701
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:16,180
Bob will avenge us for the years of conspiracy rule on that most dreaded of subgenius holidays, X-Day 1998.

702
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,180
Dreaded by them, but not by us.

703
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:29,260
Let us look at Bob's prophecy and see what the normals have in store for them, shall we?

704
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,420
Bob.

705
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,560
This word comes in many mysterious ways.

706
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,000
Not all of which are immediately recognized as divine in origin.

707
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,320
Indeed, since Bob transcends time, so does his word.

708
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,800
This revelation popped up in a 1938 radio drama.

709
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:53,180
In this story, the Martians, then a synonym for aliens, later to be known as X's, have landed and started to round up the normals.

710
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,960
Two of the unlucky survivors meet to discuss the future of mankind.

711
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,620
The smarter one asserts, quote,

712
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,560
Right now, we're caught as we're wanted.

713
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:08,740
An X's only has to go a few miles to get a crowd on the run.

714
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,800
But they won't keep on doing that.

715
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:18,000
They'll begin catching us systematic-like, keeping the best and storing us in cages and things.

716
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,860
They haven't begun on us yet.

717
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,840
Not begun.

718
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,400
Later, he goes on to say,

719
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:29,600
All those little office workers that used to live in these houses, they'll be no good.

720
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:29,840


721
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,440
They haven't any stuff in them.

722
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,840
They used to run, run off to work.

723
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,640
I have seen hundreds of them running and catching their commuter trains in the morning,

724
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,500
afraid that they'd get canned if they didn't.

725
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,520
Running back at night, afraid that they wouldn't be in time for dinner.

726
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,780
Lives insured and a little invested in case of accidents.

727
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,720
Yay, and on Sundays, worried about the hereafter.

728
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,620
Well, the X's will be a godsend for those guys.

729
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:04,920
Nice roomy cages, good food, careful breeding, and no worries.

730
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,620
Yeah, after a week or so of chasing around the fields on empty stomachs,

731
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,960
they'll come and be glad to be caught.

732
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,760
Now, this is 1938, mind you.

733
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,860
He goes on to say, finally,

734
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,360
That's not all.

735
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,880
These X's are going to make pets of some of them, train them to do tricks.

736
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,840
Who knows, get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up and had to be killed.

737
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,480
Yay, and some maybe.

738
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,400
They'll train to hunt us.

739
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,360
Yes, they will.

740
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,100
There's men who will do it gladly.

741
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:37,660
Well, friends, how much more obvious does Bob have to be?

742
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:42,980
When he gave this brief preview of the future in 1938 on CBS,

743
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,460
it sent millions of normals into the streets screaming for a reprieve.

744
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,720
They repented.

745
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,920
They begged forgiveness.

746
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:57,840
And yet, just a few days later, after Bob Orson Welles in the War of the Worlds broadcast was described by the conspiracy,

747
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,960
as nothing more than a joke,

748
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:05,560
the normals went back to the conspiracy way of life as if nothing had ever happened.

749
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:11,280
They came so close to getting a second chance at mending their ways, but they blew it.

750
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:18,380
They went back to the conspiracy masters, and for their loyalty, they were generously rewarded with yet another world war.

751
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,420
There's a strange sense of poetic justice to it, isn't there, friends?

752
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,520
Well, they haven't seen nothing yet.

753
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,580
Just wait till the real McCoy comes.

754
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,080
It's only a few miles down the road, pink boy.

755
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,520
And like Dr. Al prescribes to his patients,

756
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,340
if you're caught in a nuclear holocaust and your skin begins to melt, don't panic.

757
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,020
This is perfectly normal.

758
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,880
Yes, friends, just another normal way to die for the normals doomed to die.

759
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:44,420
What?

760
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,200
Did I say doomed to die?

761
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:50,660
I should have said lucky to die, for blessed are the dead after X-Day arrives.

762
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:57,540
The doomed are the unlucky pink survivors who must live out their wretched existence under the cruel and merciless excess.

763
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,660
Cruel to them, but not to us.

764
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:07,440
Not only will there be no more bowling alleys and golf courses for the pinks, but there'll be no more subgenies to kick around anymore.

765
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:15,160
We'll be surfing the celestial stars, smoking our froth, unweaving our slack, and sexing our anti-virgins like there was no tomorrow.

766
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,940
Because in space, friends, there isn't.

767
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:21,760
Only back on Earth will it be a tomorrow, and then the next day, and then the next.

768
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:27,800
It'll be an eternal hell without end, and we'll be enjoying it all in the heavens on closed circuit TV.

769
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,520
Because we won't want to miss a single revenge film minute.

770
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,100
Praise Bob!

771
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,020
Amen.

772
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:44,960
Turn around, go back down back the way you came.

773
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:53,380
Can't you see that flash of fire ten times brighter than the day?

774
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,720
And behold, a mighty city.

775
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,640
Broken in the dust again.

776
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:08,200
Oh God, pride and man, broken in the dust again.

777
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:17,740
Turn around, go back down back the way you came.

778
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,600
Babylon is laid to waste.

779
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,080
Egypt's buried in high shame.

780
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,780
There may be a fire in the sky.

781
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:27,780

Oh God, proud of man, broken in the dust again.

Turn around, go back down back where you came.

809
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:31,860
And shout a warning to the nation that the sword of God is raised.

810
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:39,380
Give Babylon back what he sent him, who took the treasure from his hand.

811
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:46,500
Oh God, proud of man, broken in the dust again.

812
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:31,820
Oh God, proud of man, broken in the dust again.

813
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:37,760
You dwell on many waters, rich in treasure, wide in fame.

814
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:44,920
You bow unto your God of gold, your pride of might shall be your shame.

815
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:52,320
For only God can lead his people back unto the earth again.

816
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:59,900
Oh God, proud of man, broken in the dust again.

817
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:06,900
Thy holy mountain be restored.

818
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:17,240
And the seed of thy people, thy people love.

819
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,840
You might think, well, I'm not going to spend any money on this Church of the Subgenius.

820
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,980
I'm not going to spend any money on this.

821
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,460
I've got better things to do with my $30.

822
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:46,060
I can go out and buy a Hootie and the Blowfish CD or something without money.

823
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:53,820
And I can sit at home and I can listen to my Hootie and the Blowfish CD over and over and over again.

824
00:48:54,980 --> 00:49:01,120
And I can sit back and just jam and have me a good time listening to my CD player.

825
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,460
Because you like music so much.

826
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:11,020
Well, the next day, that CD player is going to melt into a pile of slag.

827
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,760
That's right.

828
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:20,640
All your cheap pink entertainment devices are going to be destroyed in the fires of the Exist invasion.

829
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,540
There will be no music then.

830
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:31,060
The only music there will be will be the screams of the dying.

831
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:41,960
You may not like the sound of this type of music, but we subgeniuses will damn well be dancing to the tune.

832
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,100
So what can you do?

833
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:54,260
You can join up with the Church of the Subgenius or you'll be singing in the choir.

834
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,520
That's right, brothers and sisters.

835
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:01,720
You'll be singing along with all that screaming in pain and all that horror.

836
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,740
And all that horrible moaning and wailing and praying.

837
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:13,640
You know, when I was in Chicago last night, I was down in the dressing room getting ready to go up here and preach to the folks out there.

838
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,780
And a cockroach was crawling across the table.

839
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,840
And I took out my ink pen and I was kind of poking it along.

840
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:26,340
And it'd run and go across the table and I'd reach over and poke it the other way and I'd watch it run.

841
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,840
And I'd sit there and watch the little things that got so frustrated.

842
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:36,420
And then I took out my cigarette lighter and I started singeing around his antennas.

843
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,780
And then I reached around behind him and started burning off his wings.

844
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:46,580
And he flipped over and his little legs were kicking and screaming and flying around in the air.

845
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:53,780
On next day, if you don't have a membership card, you're gonna pray.

846
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:58,360
You're gonna wish, you're gonna wish that you were that cockroach.

847
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,600
That's right.

848
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,640
You'll wish you were that cockroach on next day.

849
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,760
You'll wish that you could just be tortured for a little while.

850
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:11,100
And then put out of your misery in a burst of flame by some sadistic subgenius preacher.

851
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,640
But we're not gonna make it that easy on you.

852
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:15,620
No.

853
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:22,460
Brothers and sisters, the river is rising and you're gonna drown.

854
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,580
Tonight, I am offering you a personal flotation dance.

855
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,400
I am offering you a personal flotation device to keep your head above this rising river.

856
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:39,080
I'm offering you a personal flotation device in the form of this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

857
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:44,520
The time has come nigh for you tonight.

858
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:48,500
The time has come nigh for you tonight.

859
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,860
It is no accident that you are all here.

860
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:58,060
You all have been chosen to receive this message.

861
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:01,980
You have been chosen because the water's rising up.

862
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,480
And it's just about to rise over your heads.

863
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,000
And we're gonna throw you this flotation device.

864
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,560
And you can either grab onto it and live.

865
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,720
Or you can pass it on by.

866
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:16,100
And you're gonna go down like yesterday's shit,

867
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,740
just twirling down the toilet.

868
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,600
It's no accident.

869
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,580
You must join the church of the subgenius or die.

870
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,020
You'll be damn glad.

871
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,020
That you join.

872
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,780
You will be damn glad that you spent that pitiful $30.

873
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:36,420
I really don't want to see all of you die.

874
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,700
Some of you I do.

875
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,080
But I don't want to see all of you die.

876
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,740
We are here to help you.

877
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,680
We are your friends.

878
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,520
You must know.

879
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,640
Can't you feel by looking at this man, Bob,

880
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,200
how much he loves you?

881
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,980
So when is that X-Day anyway?

882
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,780
Well, satan, X-Day, the end of the world as the humans know it,

883
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:10,440
is of course July 5, 1998, and this is important.

884
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,300
7 o'clock in the morning.

885
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,780
You don't want to sleep late and miss that.

886
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,200
Even though it is right after the fourth of July.

887
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,440
Just plan to stay up all night.

888
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,260
If you are a $30 subgenius member at seven in the morning,

889
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,840
whichever time zone you are in,

890

boom

908
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,600
I don't care as long as I can live with Saucerman.

909
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:58,280
I know that you don't take requests, but I'm a special case.

910
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:02,680
Come on down, you Saucerman, and take me off to space.

911
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,140
Take me off to space.

912
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,980
Take me off to space.

913
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,280
Come on down, you Saucerman, and take me off to space.

914
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,840
Take me off to space.

915
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,620
Take me off to space.

916
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,260
Take me off to space.

917
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:19,940
Come on down, you Saucerman, and take me off to space.

918
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:24,440
Hey, cow mutilators, let me join your crew.

919
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:28,660
Give me a night, you bet your life I'll cut up cows for you.

920
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:32,920
I don't care if you're some kind of ghastly beast without a face.

921
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,940
So come on down, you Saucerman, and take me off to space.

922
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,400
Oh, take me off to space.

923
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,460
Take me off to space.

924
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,540
Come on down, you Saucerman, and take me off to space.

925
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,700
Take me off to space.

926
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,800
Take me off to space.

927
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:54,220
Come on down, you Saucerman, and take me off to space.

928
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:58,420
Come down, you tiny robots with your little nipper claws.

929
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:02,680
You pale and bug-eyed aliens with white and clammy paws.

930
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,740
Life is just a sucker's dream, and death is a disgrace.

931
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,900
So come on down, you Saucerman, and take me off to space.

932
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,960
Oh, take me off to space.

933
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,100
Take me off to space.

934
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:19,420
Come on down, you Saucerman, and take me off to space.

935
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,280
Take me off to space.

936
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:23,360
Take me off to space.

937
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,580
Come on down, you Saucerman, and take me off to space.

938
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:28,920
Woo!

939
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:29,700
Yeah!

940
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:44,340
Oh, friends, you know, oh, I should mention that was Horton Nenslow singing Take Me Off to Space,

941
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,600
that wonderful old hymn.

942
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:50,160
That's one of the hymns that we like to sing on our subgenius holidays.

943
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:55,880
A lovely, lovely old-time gospel hymn.

944
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,400
Yes, yes, yes.

945
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,220
This is Dr. Sporb in the background.

946
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:06,280
But, friends, you know, our critics have some people worrying now and then

947
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:09,280
that the church might become corrupt.

948
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:13,680
The church of the subgenius might become corrupted by the conspiracy,

949
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,600
and there'd have to be a replacement.

950
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:16,480
There'd have to be a replacement for it.

951
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:22,960
Well, friends, I tell you, we don't have to worry about that.

952
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:27,960
Because the true church, the true church of the subgenius is going to be up in the saucers.

953
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:35,320
Ah, the pinks won't have to worry about even seeing the subgeniuses again.

954
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,360
There'll be all kinds of cheap cults and spin-offs left behind,

955
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:45,080
just like the cargo cults among the last mutated remnants.

956
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,320
Humanity.

957
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:49,100
And also, there'll be subgeniuses left behind.

958
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:56,440
The subgeniuses who didn't think they really needed that $20 membership card.

959
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,980
Did we just have a power failure?

960
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,860
I believe we did.

961
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:01,280
Ahem.
