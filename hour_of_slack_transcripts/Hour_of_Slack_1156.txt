From PR News in Washington, I'm twisted on the street below.
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said...
Uh...
Um...

Bloomberg was speaking this morning.
In early trading on Wall Street 6, 12, 6, 9, 8, 15.
This is PR News.
PR's bad.

And I want to welcome you to the loneliest time in thousands of years of human history.
Let me repeat that.

The reason I'm here, I'm a schizophrenic.
Probably having a hard time in San Francisco.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, you are living social theory.
I know it's weird.
I know it's weird.
That's what we're all about on this program.
I want to live a life prostitution.
Uh, can you help me here?
Crossing boundaries and loving strangers.
You go out to the same restaurant or the same bar together.
Whatever.
And that's kind of a necessary element.
Even in the corporate world, I understand that...
If you're going to have a meeting and you want some sort of bonding, even at the corporate level,
you're going to have to bring in prostitutes.
You're just going to have to bring in prostitutes.
You're vulnerable.
That's right.
You open up yourself.
It's five, six times per week.
In and out.
All the time.
Constantly.
And you know what that's like.
I mean, you did some of that in the corporate world.
I did it in the corporate world.
Pornography.
Man, you know what we ought to do?
Provide love.
Provide X-rated movie in the hotel room.
The opportunity to develop new relationships in new cities.
We don't want to be lonely anymore.
This is going to be the beginning of something I think very, very significant here.

I'm president-elect of the American Marijuana Academy that services California,
which is the first reality series on television.
Drugs.
Really, drugs.
Drug.
I'm going to talk about the scope.
But I'd like to start off with drugs, marijuana, as well as other.
Getting off tenfold in potency.
Marijuana.
Using marijuana.
Slack better off.
Now, that's a clue.
So marijuana, even if it's chronic or a use of the marijuana.
But start early and keep going.
And so it's important to increase that.
And we need more marijuana.
Well, I want to thank you for your attention.
Hello.
Yep.
How many people has George Bush murdered?
Murderer a bigger criminal than Al Capone.
Sir.
What is happening to human beings?
My God, that sucker's a murderer.
Of course he is.
Of course he is.
George Bush is the killing master.
We're going to have some fun.
Torturing is all right.
Kill a few people.
We want you to wipe out blocks and blocks and blocks and blocks and blocks of homes,
of residences, and wipe out at least eight people per household.
George Bush and Dick Cheney.

Dave, that was what we recorded from inside of your head earlier tonight, isn't it?
I thought...
I thought you said some guy was threatening you.
Like you were in the parking lot.
You were at Dave's supermarket or someplace that I'm not supposed to mention because it sounds like a commercial name.
And a guy with a machete or saying something in Cuban or Hispaniol or something like that.
Man, I don't know what happened.
It was like one of those little dagger swords with a...

Shout out to Kいや
Earth, Wind & Fire
from some...
You know, it's unusual for us to play
what we call conspiracy music.
Anything that was owned
by a record company at any point.
But I just...
You know, I love covers.
Especially inappropriate covers.
That one was actually strangely
appropriate.
I would say that it was
appropriate in context.
And appropriated
in the case of...
In the context of Hour of Slack, where we've
completely ruined that great mix
by letting, by allowing
civilians...
To abject mortals.
To repurified
ex-marks. It proves there's a plot.
The Tommy Sandwiches and
the Vino Lady.
She wasn't there either.
And you know who really
controls the media, don't you?
Yeah.
Yeah. Media employees.
Yeah.
Rich guys.
Actually, we've had so many
kooks and crackpots and
what we call normal people.
Media ditch guys.
Yeah, media ditch guys on the
Alt of Slack.
That's the text version of this show
that happens on Usenet.
And
we've had so many kooks and crackpots
there that I've realized that everything
in the world proves
that everything
in the world is a
satanic, pagan,
Masonic Jew.
Well, you once said yourself...
In fact, I've got a list. A guy
posted a bunch of material
comparing me to Hitler.
Really? As a psychotic...
In the football there, that silver case.
There's a letter by a...
Oh, wait. Maybe it's over here.
Oh, here it is. Look at this.
This guy posted...
Hello.
Hello.
I'm gonna pause this background music,
which is good, and we'll put on some
which is the worst.
It's great.
The worst background music.
We need to put on the worst background music there is.
Well, it is, actually. Let me explain
what this is coming up.
Mr. Sister found this
for us. It's called The Most Unwanted
Song by a fellow
soldier named Dave Soldier.
And he conducted
a poll in 1999.
in which he asked
500 people or so
what was their most
disliked kind of music.
We're hearing it in the background.
The things that people...
This is 1960s. Not sitcom,
but, you know...
No, this isn't... Let me explain
what this is, okay?
It was found
that the things that people
really dislike in music
are accordions,
tubas,
kids singing,
cowboys. Dave, I thought that would
be interesting to you. Cowboys.
And things about cowboys
are disliked.
Rap,
opera, high-pitched
voices, bagpipes,
ad jingles, elevator music,
and Christmas and holiday
music. Those were things
that people tend
to hate. In fact, when this
fellow put together this piece of music
using only the most
disliked elements of music,
he calculated that
fewer than 200
individuals of the world's
total population will enjoy
this show.
Now I'd like to ask you
the following question,
Reverend Ivan Stang.
What is the vernacular meaning
or the phrase commonly used
to mean real is feeling really?
Isn't there a word now,
Stang, that describes where
the deconstruction,
the expression of the elements is more
understandable
to the masses than the...
Oh man, you know what I'm trying to say?
I'm trying to say
like some of the music that's like,
you know, sounds like bad, you know,
how the stuff used to be real bad, like when they
did the strings and so forth, or the
horns, it sounded real like computer-like
and it was real crappy. And now people
lust for that sound because it's
gone. It's like history. Bad,
uh...
It's become bull-daughter.
In organic music.
It always was bull-daughter.
It always was.
Well, but bull-daughter itself has
18 different gradations or stages.
If we had a copy of Book of the
Subgenius here, I could recite them
from the memory in that book.
But some of them cause follicular damage,
and that's what I'm worried about.
Listen.
I love this.
It is so...
There's the tuba.
It's so dislikable.
And the opera.
And there's all these other things.
And also, you know, from a musical...
And corny cowboy stuff.
From a musical standpoint, the little embellishments
are really redundant as freaking hell, you know?
It sounds...
Well, this piece of music is 22 minutes long,
and it goes all over the...
Globe.
Yeah, it goes everywhere.
So we should probably, what, put the globe hats on and get up the psychic swami dance,
go in here and turn the lights off and on, and just create something.
Something bad, something foul, something evil.
No, that's been done for us with the most unwanted song.
Most...
But we wanted it.
We certainly did.
In fact, this...
I now know that I've lusted for this song before I was born.
I think genetically...
Oh, the bagpipes.
Oh, man.
I feel like...
There's a hard rock section in this coming up with bagpipes.
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
Oh, man.

Oh, man.



It was a hell of a day for me in Kilcuddleville.
Three days enough of them stood against the brush,
and only four of them remained afterwards.
I'll change focus here, Captain.
Here's the new scenery.
It's a matte vision brought to you by Earl Pudney
and the rest of the guys and gals down at the...
And down at the ancient Fulke's home.
And...
Oh, look.
It's a multicultural group of children, all of them four foot three and chopped at the
spreads.
And look.
They're all wearing funny fright wigs.
This is what we expect from you.
I said this is what we expect from you.
We want you to dance like this, look like this, culturally envision yourself as a member of
the new Newpy Cadets.
Oh, that's no problem.
I can do that with both hands.
I can do that with both hands and feet tied behind my back.
Can you do the quick tuba dance?
Step right up here.
But of course, but of course.
Watch this.
Oh, that's...
See what I can do.
Look what I can do.
Look at how Steve flies.
She's our girl.
There she is.
And so we began the long unstructured journey to Dobstown in hopes of becoming a fundamentalist
reactive star.
She could dance all right.
She could dance all right.
To quick time tuba and bag types.
But could she actually forewarn those with the foreskin on their forehead?
Here's an interesting news item from the plane dealer April 25th, 2008.
David Alan Chapin, who ate the brain of his roommate after he shot him 30 years ago in
an argument over whose religion was best, is up for parole in June.
He is like Clermont County's version of Hannibal Lecter, assistant prosecutor Daniel Woody
Breyer said of Chapin, who was sentenced to life in prison for aggravated murder.
Chapin shot his longtime friend Donald E. Liming in the right eye with a rifle in their
apartment.
Uh, Chapin was a Baptist while Liming had claimed he was a Catholic, a Buddhist, and
a pagan.
Oh, no.
After stuffing Liming's body into the truck of his Buick Skylark, Chapin drove to Raymond
Walters College in Ohio where he was a student.
A biology professor testified that Chapin asked if he wanted a corpse to dissect.
They oppose Chapin's release because he's very dangerous.
It's not safe to have him in society, Liming's brother said.
No, it's not safe.
Not safe at all.
He would go after my mother and my sister.
I do believe him.
That's more than a mother and sister.
He is a convicted, cold-blooded, subgenius murderer and I don't think that people who
do brutal acts such as that can be re-habifrapazipilopsitabitated.
And he says a psychiatrist testified that Chapin told him he and Liming had agreed to
eat the brain of whoever died first so that the spirit of the dead person would live on
inside the survivor.
Yeah.
Here ye, here ye, this court's marshal is now in session, Judge Honorable Rudson P.
Feudy, sitting upon a bench.
Before the docket's first message, it is really brief.
There's a on the docket, a raping Chapin as he's known.
Mr. Chapin, what do you have to say for yourself if you have anything to say for yourself?
Now here, Dave, here's what-
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.



You know, our favorite subgenius kook on Alt-Slack-
Please don't.
He, and this guy's dead serious.
This is his list of things that Hitler and Stang-
Have in common?
Have in common.
I'm Stang, and Hitler wasn't here tonight.
Well, at least you have one penis like the rest of us.
Not like Adolf Hitler.
Well, now, we're getting to that.
He's getting to that.
We're getting to that.
Well, Hitler had four.
Number one, both were cartoonists.
Number two-
seen all my published cartoons.
Both espoused
the virtues of
vegetarianism.
Both were politically
socialist.
Both were avid students
of the occult and Satanism.
Apparently Stang is dead.
Both supported and mingled with homosexuals
and other sexual perverts.
Deviants and pevels.
I want to hear more about this mingling.
And best of all,
both were Jewish.
This guy,
by the way, also said that
the Chinese
deserved that earthquake.
That was punishment from God
who's punishing them for being
slavish followers
of a Jewish-inspired
government.
Freemasonic.
Because Chairman Mao and the
Chinese communists were
Freemasonic Jews.
Because communism,
of course, is a Jewish plot.
And Judaism is a Masonic plot.
Judaism is.
Or something.
They're somehow related.
According to the new crop
of all-purpose kooks that we're getting,
or let's call them
differently-samed people.
I don't want to be a bigot.
I'm a bit confused here now.
I am too.
I always thought a pie mason was just like
one of those guys who loved sweets
and fantasy pastries.
And here I, you know,
now a Jew mason,
that would be someone who likes to
eat Jewish people?
That would be the...
Well, actually,
don't we have one next door?
In fact, we do have a gay, satanic
Jewish mason lives next door to us.
I read this routine to him
and he said he added
some more sins he had
that he was enjoying.
When you said that, you know, thing about Chapin
eating the brain of a guy for being a Buddhist
Catholic,
whatever else he was,
doesn't it seem likely he'd also want to eat
our brains just for a different flavor?
Oh, yeah, right.
Subgenius brains.
That's a great idea.
They're a little overcooked.
You really want to get in trouble for eating
a subgenius brain.
They've been in the sun for a little too long.
To inherit his great intelligence,
his spectacular courage.
Yeah, right.
No, there are instant, automatic reactions.
When you eat a subgenius brain,
there's immediate vomiting,
there's a whistling in the ear,
there's a whiz-banging of the knees,
and sometimes there's actual
artifacture from space falls down.
Another researcher here
on .slack,
Reverend Richard Skull,
discovered that there were
other similarities between
me and Hitler,
in that we both love cute kittens.
And you both have facial hair.
A little bit of facial hair, too.
And he said that there was some difference.
Hitler preferred sheep,
while Stang is a goat man.
A goat!
Hitler loved a big Mercedes,
but did not drive.
Stang can...
He can drive,
but can't afford to buy gas.
But that's only because
dwarf male prostitutes are so expensive.
You have to pay for their gas.
They're bound to go down again.
Hitler had only one testicle,
while Stang has at least 30.
And they all post to alt.slack.
Hitler's dog loved him.
Stang's dog used to pee on his leg all the time.
And I want you to know, friends,
it is not easy to train a dog
to pee on Hitler's leg.
Sumner Redstone,
chairman of Viacom,
rejected Hitler's art,
while Stang's was published all over the world
under the pseudonym of Charles Schultz.
No, it was under the Charles Mason,
spelled with a silent N.
No, I'm a Manson.
I'm part of the...
I'm not a Freemason.
I'm a Freemanson.
I've always been behind the concept
that if we could free Charlie,
he could lead the world into a new eon
a new millennium.
That would all be like this perfect world
where it's like free love.
You could do your own thing, man.
When will we attain such a world?
You're just a robot.
We all can end being a...
Stop being a robot.
You can be real, man.
You can have a real life.
I need all the free love I can have.
Sweet reality.
Sweet reality.
Sweet reality.

Yeah.

But, but, but, but, but, but,
why?
And, uh, you know, you've got
this lovely penis.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
I'm tired of hearing you.
Wait, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Let me, wait a minute.
Let me.
Brass are up there.
Brass are up there.
Money, money, money, money, money.
Money.
Woo!
Learn how to fleece people
by starting religions.
Discombobulated.
The organ is playing.
The choir is singing.
Ah, here you have the pope out here.
Um, very happy to have dinner
in the White House.
With a murderer.
A murderer.
George Bush is a murderer.
Truly immoral behavior.
Ah, yes, different.
Ah, yes.
Ah, yes.
Thanks to Norrell Preff
for cutting those things up.
And that, uh, amazing version
of Power of Soul there
was by Bootsy Collins
with George Clinton
and the P-Funk All-Stars.
How about that?
Now, that was more of a stir-fry
than a collage.
By the way, it is pronounced
P-Funk.
Yeah, because they, uh,
sometimes,
you feel in front of it.
The poo-poo
It makes a sound like this.
It goes
P-Funk.
Like that.
Do you understand?
P-Funk.
Now, we have something
really important
coming up musically, Doug.
Is that it?
What the hell?
Yeah.
Huh.
Detective Dave
is on his way
to pick up his new assignment.
And will she be a blonde?
Will she be a brunette?
Will she be a Russian spy?
Yes, Detective Dave
is on his way
to meet his
maku.
Uh, Ginger,
did I have any messages?
The Neanderthal
detective.
Yes, there's three messages
for you, sir.
Uh, what's this first one
on the top?
It looks like, uh,
from the Reverend Ivory Stinks
or something.
I can't read the...
Ivory Stinks, uh,
wanted to make sure
that you made the meeting
at three.
Three?
A meeting about what?
I don't recall any meeting.
Oh, well, you will have
to deal with that
personally, sir.
It also says here
on the return address,
it says,
Church of the Subgenius.
Is this some sort of
spiritual-religious organization
and what is it?
Uh, well, um...
Is it, uh,
like Scientology
or something?
What's the sound
of that voice?
Somebody just asked
if it was like Scientology
or something.
If anything,
the Scientology Crime Syndicate
mocks the subgenius.
This is not the other way around.
I disagree.
Scientology and the Church
of the Subgenius
are two different branches
of what is ultimately
the same profiteering UFO cult.
And both are part
of an experiment
in the running
of religions and cults.
The variable being tested
was slack
and what it does
when infused
into a fledgling saucer cult
and Scientology
is the control.
Without slack,
a for-profit cult
will focus exclusively
on making money
to the point where
it cripples itself
in social dimensions
and is vilified
by outsiders
for being too secretive
and costing too much to join.
The slack-in version,
the Church of the Subgenius,
is more accepted
because it is more flexible.
It can be a joke religion
and a purveyor of funny books
if that is all
the audience wants it to be.
And the beliefs are published
in big, easy-to-read books
with lots of pictures
for potential customer members
to buy and enjoy
before deciding
whether or not to join.
And even if they don't,
the Subgenius Foundation
has already sold them a book.
The experiment is still running,
but the results so far
show that valuing slack
and money
produces a more functional
real cult
slash joke church hybrid
in comparison
to the real cult
slash crime syndicate hybrid
produced by valuing money alone.
In the future,
all new religions
will have a joke religion aspect
and use the entertainment value
of absurdity
to facilitate actual belief
in ridiculous concepts
like hope, joy, and love.
After all,
if you can believe
that extra-dimensional horrors
are manipulating the planet
to feed on human misery
and that a lone salesman
and his gaggle
of misfit fair-weather followers
can effectively fight them off
by goofing off,
then less fantastical notions
than, like, for instance,
life actually being pretty good
and the world being a great place
are far easier to accept.
As possible.
What are you guys
jabbering about over there?
My ears were bleeding.
I hope you were listening.
My ears were bleeding.
That was really important.
That was an important part
of your lessons, kids.
Written by Moros,
also known as Dr. Holocaust.
Well, when we got to the second part
where you adjudicate or, um,
not substantiate.
There's that word again.
Adjudicate.
Adjudicate.
Adjudicate.
When, when,
when you create legislation
for your own benefit,
what is that called?
It sounded to me like
you were creating laws
and just coming up with stuff
and it was all it was going to do
was make you rich
and fatten your pockets.
That's called being human, Dave.
Fattening your pockets?
Yeah.
Can you use any sort of article
to fatten your pockets with
or does it have to be
U.S. currency or euros?
Can't you just put in
a little bit of extra cheese
every morning?
It can be gold teeth.
Ah, gold teeth.
A little bit of your soul.
So funny.
And I stole from my grandmother.
Anything works in this world.
I, I,
I can hear her singing now.
She, she was a socialist.
In fact, she was
an anarcho-syndicalist.
Well, I forget what it was,
but they had big, big meetings
and everyone would shout
and sometimes they'd play
the international
and she, she wore a cowgirl hat.
She'd play the bagpipes
and then she'd sing sometimes
and, oh, those were the days.
Poppy, I remember.
Her popular bullgirl, Davina.
Oh, yes.
She was a tuba player, too, wasn't she?
Yes, she performed the nightlife
every night.
She did rap opera?
Ten, two, rap opera.
Absolutely.
She was, she,
she had a Christmas album,
I believe.
Do we have that thing,
that little interview with her?
Do we?
That's just, that's what's
playing in the background.
Well, no, that's the
background music.
There was actually,
there were some bits,
some cut-ups.
No, this is the interview.
This is how she answered
the question,
where were you born?
Well, she's not singing
right this minute.
Oh, this is the part
where she starts talking.
Oh, no, you said
you were born in
Yalu Province
in northern China,
but your family
was not Chinese.
They were named
the Diplomatic Corps.
Is that correct?
Yes, that is correct.
And you said
when you start performing
in these local
Lake Erie resorts
and bowling halls
that sometimes
maybe elderly men
would actually
try to find you.







Oh, no, don't be
talking about that
over radio waves.
Well, your wisdom teeth
actually have
transmitters and receivers
and isn't that
a genetic twist?
That's why they're
called wisdom teeth.
But so?
Is there any relation
to the wisdom teat?
The wisdom teat
is like the wisdom,
we all want to suckle
at the wisdom teat,
but we don't want to
suck our own wisdom teeth
because they could be
gone at any minute.
We're in a miasma
storm of wisdom teeth.
Of mortality right now.
We're getting more ancient
every 14 seconds.
I was just thinking
I wish this show
had subtitles
so I could tell
what the hell
you're saying
half the time.
Yeah.
Stan, you told me
this show does have subtitles.
Yeah, but they're running
backwards from my point of view.
You, okay,
then you told me
that you were dyslexic enough
that you could read
them backwards
and now you're saying
they're rolling too fast.
While I'm engineering
at the same time.
It makes sense.
It makes me dizzy.
Now, Princess,
we remember
the Neanderthal song?
Yeah, the Neanderthal song.
Okay, now listen, friends,
you may recall
our last live show,
we played this
odd little tiny bit of sound
that some scientist
had reconstructed
what he thought
the Neanderthal voice
sounded like.
It was kind of a
eeeh.
That was all it was.
Brr, eeeh, brr.
And I cut it into
a little series
where he almost
was singing going
eeeh, eeeh, eeeh, eeeh, eeeh.
Well, Fernanda Nende
Leemur unearthed
some tracks
of the actual
Neanderthal
tribal singing
that's coming up.
Oh, choral singing?
There's a little
17-second cut here.
But stand by
and pay attention
because this is
the last time
the Neanderthal
will sing for you.
Yeah, man, it's worth
your while.
Believe me.
Check it out, man.
This is all the Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.



















It takes more than
intellect to be a
musician.
The machine gave me
my penny back.
Okay.
Whoa.
What's that all about?
Whoa.

Whoa.
Miah.
Ho, we got him.
Ho, here he comes,
full of it.
Oh, god.
One kick to do.
This is some
This is some T insecure
over the horse.
From PR News in Washington, I'm currently under investigation.
Officials did not say parts of the Midwest have been hit hard by another round of bad PR.
Bad PR.
Bad PR.
Repeat after me in Mandarin Chinese.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You know what you did to Grandpa in saying he was an opium smoker?
I didn't mean to take off his sandals and his fine founded feet.
I know he was a true and false subgenius, but when I...
Honey, stay away from the river!
I...
I'm on my way.
I'm go...
Ha-aaah!
Exposed to the vast nature of an impregnable life, you have the power to change the world

Oh...
Thank goodness, there's only about two minutes left of the most unwanted song, which we've
been running in the background.
This is still some of it.
I'm so happy now.
I wanted some.
It has a home here on the most unwanted show.
You know, some of us have been getting tickets lately.
Genetic deviance.
Okay, sure, but what can they really do about it?
They can learn the secrets of X-Day.
X-Day is celebrated by the subgeniuses every year at their annual mating migration,
at their mating grounds in far western rural New York.
Lovely Brushwood Folklore Center,
which is the natural habitat of these creatures for their mating rituals.
Facing the morning sun in a long, ever-ending,
reap of a balance of the most amazing.
Sir?

Sir, what are you doing with that?
Yai?
Sir, please.
Put that back in your pants, sir.
I'm going to be forced to call the dent-
I can't watch.
Put that back in your pants or I'll be called-
You're not supposed to watch.
Forced to call the dentist.
And so they called...
Private Dentist.
Denny the Dentist.
No, they didn't call.
Yeah, Denny.
Denny the Private Dentist.
They called out to him.
They called out to their aboriginal god.
The same god they'd been calling for thousands of generations.
And each and every one of them had a different interpretation.
And that's how the world was begat and begone.
Just so simple as that.
Did you want to learn more, honey?
Just sit up here on Grandpa's knee.
Or better yet, uh, wait a minute, I...
Afraid.
I'm call-
Afraid.
Afraid.
Be like Britney Spears.
You're insane, it's-
You're insane, it's a-
Go!
I don't care what men think.
I want you to be honored.
Tongue.
My dear tongue.
You are awesome.
I believe that God still has a name and his name is...
Sleelity.
Nam-me-a-fow-ro-vo-ho-
We want you to come.
And as those whales are coming for two years.
Two years.
Total head on the rock.
Now why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
All of those hypocrites in the church.
Church is boring.
Why?
Why?
You get filthy.
All of the profanity and the muck and the grime.
All of the vulgarity.
You hear the beat, beat, beat, beat.
Yow!
It's go, go, go, go, go.
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
The Bible is just filled with antiquated myths.
You're a monkey's uncle.
You're a monkey's uncle.
Ellen DeGeneres.
Cause we love homosexuals.
You may be seated.
Thank you.
Let's give God a clap.
Let's give God a clap.
Friends, thanks Nor-El Prep.
We're learning more about many of the mothers in U.S. history.
Sunday afternoon.
I pref Nor-El.
I piffed and pref both of them in my day, sonny girl.
That's perfity.
You know, I once was a person who was a woman.












I was a personal friend of the guy you call God, goddess.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
We used to chum buddy back when I was in merchant service.
You must have been like one of those who's who.
Yeah, I was forcing the ring way in the pottery service for the U.X.
Navy.
I was in the North Sea.
I had one good eye.
I did all right for myself.
But God, oh jeez, oh man.
He was an intense cat.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah.
He wouldn't sit down.
He wouldn't let it up.
He wouldn't.
He just kept going.








Nothing got by the guy, see?
I know.
Yeah, he was a gunner for a while.
A rear gunner.
He was a front gunner and a rear gunner.
I think a rear gunner is what got him.
But you know, he can't die, so what the hell?
Who cares, you know?
I know.
Yeah, you know.
You know what he told me one dark Tuesday afternoon, huh?
No.
You know what he told me?
He told me that none of us are going to die.
We're just going to be tortured for a long time after we die.
Oh man.
Yeah, yeah.
He said he's going to be personally in charge of the whole deal unless this, what's his
name?
Harry.






Harry.
Da.
Bob.
What's his name?
Unless, uh, some...
I don't know.
Bob Dobbs.
He was hard to understand.
This was his manic phase.
He was starting to sweat.
Pimples were starting to show.
Yeah, he thought he was in charge, but he was losing it, see?
And then he did lost it.
And I guess that was the end of me and God.
You know, I tried, but I couldn't.
You did the best you could.
Yeah, maybe I should have waited for him to stop breathing before I threw him overboard.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I guess it's bad knowing that you could have saved God if you had the chance.
It's all going to be all right.
You do have that chance, friends.
You might want to look up more information about the Church of the Subgenius.
Yes.
Subgenius.com.

We really do have a big office party coming up July 5th at that time.
It's actually exactly 7 a.m. July 5th of this year.
We will be awaiting the arrival of the sex goddesses from Planet X, as prophesied by J.R. Bob Dobbs.
End of the world company picnics of genius style.
Assuming this is 1998.
Which it might not be.
We don't know what year this is.
We don't know what planet this is.
I don't know hardly nothing at all.
But we know that.
We know that much.
We know that we don't know.
And that is good to know.
Yes.
It's possibly the last thing we'll ever know.
It's here in this small Mayan village where these three archaeologists from Knightsbridge, Uxbridge, and Cambridge have made their way to find the truth.
The temple, the entryway to the Palenque Mount and temple complex here some 50,000 kilometers away in a different space.
And if their mission is achieved and is proven, it means that Bob Dobbs actually was here some 2,000 years ago wearing funny red headbands and feathers and all the like.
As we see on this wall drawing here.
Someone is about ready to decapitate the Bob figure and hopefully pull his heart out and eat it.
But that's for another time where we join ourselves at the knees and I...
Friends, are you ready to walk in the path of Batman J.R. Bob Dobbs?
The salesman, the space salesman of planet Earth.
The snake oil salesman.
Oleum Serpentum.
That's the fountain of youth, my friend.
It can make you be what you won't be.
It can make you your own hero.
And hers too, as David Osman said.
You, the superior mutant, can rise up over those others around you.
It's a bright future for all of us.
You're better than them in the office, or at the assembly line, or there in the classroom.
You know you're better than them.
Not for any other reason than that you are different.
Not that you're smarter.
Not that you're wiser.
You're just better.
Why?
Because you have that subgenius minister's card in your pocket.
You.
And not that bubba next door.
Have the key to Bob's space ship.
The key to the wisdom teat.
You've got your little lips puckered and ready to suck.
On that stem of that teat we call the pipe of J.R. Bob Dobbs.
Bob loves you and he's gonna share with you.
He's gonna share his love, his slack,
his diseases.
Sure.
Those two.
Hey, you know we're all equal, aren't we?
Yes.
This isn't one of them hierarchical big corporate company calculations.
I see the sun coming up for all of us today.
I see our diseases reaching out into the cosmos.
I see our diseases growing far beyond our own numbers.
I know you want to get in on that too.
Everybody does.
That's our Bob.
So why don't you just check out that subgenius.com and you know before it's too late.
I mean what the heck?
The world could end tomorrow.
Are you ready for it?
You could be different genetically from anyone and everyone else.
You could be far superior to those around you.
You could learn arcane secrets.
How to hear dog whistles in the dark.
Smiling and bumping the humpy.
And also grievance committee time.
These things are amazing.
You can already do those things, friends.
But after you join the church of the subgenius, you'll be able to prove it.
Or at least you'll think you can.
And that's all that counts.
This is the new age, baby.
All that matters is how you feel.
And we love crybabies.
Come on down.
Sit at the feet of Bob.
That's all right, honey.
I'm not going to slap you too many times.
I'm going to slap you ten times.
Including the Congress.
Including the President himself.
You don't have to rub your fingers anymore.
We're going to beat all of them.
6969-800-6969-669-2323.
Or have an extension put in place through just one nostril.
It's easy and it's free.
A symbol of being out of touch and entirely too liberal.
And clinging to religion and guns.
Stay in control.
Maximum health in a maxed out world.
One for each wind and one for each direction.
The north nostril is the nostril of wisdom.
The south nostril is the nostril of innocence.
The east nostril is the nostril of the illumination.
The west nostril is the east of the atmosphere.
Shooting up heroin.
I don't remember.
Do heroin reparations.
You're not required to remember.
You're required to recall.
Heroin.
I still chose heroin.
Restate the premise.
You are here because.
Because Bob is the heroin of your mind.
It's the opium of your religion you might say.
It's the mass of your religion.
That's Bob.
You know what?
You've lost everything.
I lose everything.
You come from nothing.
You got a match of nothing.
You lost nothing.
Heroin.
Heroin smacked.
Heroin.
The heroin controls you.
Friends, we're going to have to move out.
And uh.

Uh.
Clean up ourselves.
This uh.
Exiting montage is by Reverend Shane Caplan.
Taking heroin.
Heroin.
Junkies.
Survive each dose.
Need each dose to survive.
Heroin fanatics.
Led to relax.
Fantastically rich.
Heroin.
Heroin.
Heroin.
It's going to lead to the needle.
The heroin.
Heroin.
Heroin.
I have just quit shooting up heroin.
And inject needles into your collapsing veins.
You're weak.

Your men are going to begin to bluff needles.
And your men are going to begin to bluff needles.
It ain't every day that a person quits shooting up four packs of smack.
Today.
Oh.
Please help.
Everything hurts.
If you hear me taking up just a few little sniffs of smack.
Again.
And it just proves that I'm human.
And if I can quit shooting up.
It'll prove that I'm beyond human.
Greater.
Or less than.
Human.
Hehehe.
Quit laughing.
It hurts.
You're just trying to make it worse.
I was an addict for 9 years.
Oh for what?
For drugs.
I went 8 times to jail.
I thought I was going to be an addict.
A dope fiend.
A junky.
But I heard about.
Bob?
I went to him.
I could probably.
Just take a few little.
Sniffs of smack.
back. On the way home from work here. I could. Why not? Come on. I could. There's probably a needle
in my ashtray. Yes. Yes. There is one. I'm sure of it. That very last piece there was by
Reverend Shane Kaplan. And he did that to get over, I guess to get through heroin withdrawal,
he said. He sent me three or four versions of it. He really worked hard on that collage.
And I guess it, and I know how that is. It may get your mind off your own troubles if you,
you know, work on something, do something that's, you know, like a good for the,
the world. Praise Bob and stay tuned.
