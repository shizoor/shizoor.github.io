1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
It'd be against my code of honor to borrow something and not pay it back.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:04,780
I know.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,200
As my grandpappy used to say...

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,320
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,900
I don't even know why it bothers me so much, but it does.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,980
I hope so.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,740
Shut up.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:33,040
From PR News in Washington, I'm suffering from dehydration and heat stroke.

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:39,380
Police in San Antonio, Texas are investigating what they describe as an apparent tractor-trailer

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,040
parked at an apparent Walmart.

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,220
PR reports on where the vehicle came from.

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,360
Chuck Schumer said Iran and North Korea.

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,720
Schumer said...

14
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,640
A strong PR News is nearly a clear message on behalf of the American people,

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,260
because Trump is Putin, but Russia is essential against Russia.

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,980
Turkey is in San Antonio overnight.

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,600
Turkey says PR News is permanent.

18
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,260
Palestinians say...

19
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,780
On Friday, officials say...

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,880
Israel says...

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,920
And officials say to praise the stabbings.

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,720
Pope Francis called for violence in Jerusalem.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,220
Pope Francis also called for PR News in Washington.

24
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,740
And he finally was able to do so

25
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,260
with the sister of President President Donald Trump.

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,300
A week after Trump threw Washington gentle

27
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:44,180
victim Mueller- Buddha Jr.

28
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,620
He greatest failure.

29
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:51,480
it's raining I can make you eggs and ham

30
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:59,340
synchronize your swallowing or there'll be a traffic jam

31
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:06,580
where three conjoining acts meet up and share an Adam's apple

32
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:15,820
Intersecting planixes might get confused and start to grapple

33
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,620
What do you say, three-headed woman?

34
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,920
What are you keeping in those credenzas?

35
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:33,500
Could it be that dresser holds three different kinds of prescription lenses?

36
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,560
Tell me what you want and I'll glance

37
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,280
I'm gonna gladly obey

38
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,420
Gonna make sure you have a three-headed day

39
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,140
Yes, Bill, you're getting a stomachache

40
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,100
What now?

41
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,700
Now, why does Bill have a stomachache?

42
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,740
How come she got three heads?

43
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,680
She has three heads

44
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,260
How come she got three heads?

45
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,920
She has three heads

46
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,420
How come she got three heads?

47
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,480
She has three heads

48
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,540
How come she got three heads?

49
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,100
Feeling like a fourth wheel?

50
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,360
You got your own ménage à trois

51
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,820
It's more economic

52
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,300
Because you only need one bra

53
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,840
Let's take a walk to the ice cream parlor

54
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,760
I'll bring you bib that's got three colors

55
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,620
How do you do, three-headed woman?

56
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,220
How many hats are you wearing today?

57
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,760
What do you say, my three-headed woman?

58
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:10,420
Come and use my pillows in your three-headed way

59
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,880
Have a three-headed day

60
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,860
Have a three-headed day

61
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,560
Have a three-headed day

62
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,700
Have a three-headed day

63
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,800
Have a three-headed day

64
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,460
Have a three-headed day

65
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,840
Have a three-headed day

66
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
Have a three-headed day

67
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,800
Have a three-headed day

68
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:55,240
Who could possibly do such a thing but the Rudy Schwartz Project from their new album Postal Code for Ham?

69
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,680
Just think, if you have the whole album.

70
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Welcome to Hour of Slack number 1600.

71
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,980
I'm Dr. Sinister, 88, and even though I'm still between radio studios and just sitting at my desk right now,

72
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:18,560
this is not a rerun, nor is it an X-Day compendium, but relatively new, sacred stuff.

73
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:29,340
I was missing my home base of WCSB Cleveland last Sunday, so I tuned and then called in to Dr. Sinister's radio synesthesia.

74
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,240
And that's coming up.

75
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,840
We also already heard titles, noises, and PR news by the great and hoary Lee Murr.

76
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,700
More coming, as will be some Bull Donna collage by Cool Hand Chris.

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:56,040
What we also have that's new is a visit to the porn shop by the new team called Subgenius Uber Women of Austin.

78
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,640
That being the good Dr. Boo-haha and the good...

79
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,520
Reverend Anna Monk.

80
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,480
Right now.

81
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,400
So what kind of vinegar was that that we saw?

82
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:14,960
Kangol.

83
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,380
Kangol. Yeah, but what is Kangol? What is a Kangol?

84
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,280
I've been wondering that myself.

85
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,980
I just, it's not like Kangols.

86
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,060
Is it like an exotic fruit? Is it part of an animal?

87
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,220
Is it the angle that a kangaroo makes when she's eating?

88
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:32,220


89
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:32,220


90
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,500
When it's bent its leg about to kick you in the face?

91
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,400
It's a Kangol?

92
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,020
Kangol.

93
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,240
How would you make that into a vinegar, though?

94
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,660
Kangaroo angle vinegar?

95
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:50,020
I don't know, but like there's a lot of stuff that I don't understand in an Asian mart.

96
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,900
Like vegetarian intestines.

97
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,080
That's weird. Did you see some in there?

98
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,060
Yeah. Yeah.

99
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,780
But they told me that guy would get better.

100
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,440
So...

101
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,520
Now they have actual vegetarian intestines in the, in the, they're like tofu shaped.

102
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:17,460
But, because you know, when I switch over to vegetarian food, the first thing I'm going to miss is looking like I'm eating intestines.

103
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,020
I'm going to miss the chewy texture of animal colons.

104
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:28,040
I'm just, you know, there's nothing like a, like a good vegetarian colon to make.

105
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,760
Honestly, I, I, they, they didn't like it.

106
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,260
They didn't look appealing.

107
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,360
They looked, they looked so much like regular intestines.

108
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,340
I also didn't want to eat them.

109
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,120
Yeah.

110
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,520
It did not make it okay.

111
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:48,920
I find that amusing is the vegetarians that want to eat things that look and feel like meat and taste like meat in their mouth.

112
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,420
It's like, why not just eat meat?

113
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,560
Right.

114
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,460
If I don't eat bacon, I'm going to miss it.

115
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:56,980
Well, yeah.

116
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:57,680
Yeah.

117
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,660
If you wanted it.

118
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,520
Then, you know, but why are you giving it up if you're, you know.

119
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,880
What about lab grown meat?

120
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,720
What about it?

121
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:13,340
Like, they, they, like a guy that grew his own, like a, grew a human ear and then like attached it to his arm and now he's like that art piece.

122
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,020
Well, aside from that, I mean lab grown meat for eating.

123
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,280
Oh, for eating.

124
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,180
Could they go?

125
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,500
No, because they've been doing lab grown meat for other purposes for years.

126
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,220
Well, they should start making lab grown human meat so we could.

127
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:38,160
You know, if the FDA is so up on approving like the growth of meats and other organs in the lab and like if it doesn't work out for like a transplant or something, why can't somebody eat it?

128
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,540
Yeah.

129
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,400
Fry it up.

130
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,560
I honestly think that there's some kind of weird black market when it comes to that kind of thing.

131
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:55,900
It's not just the morticians and the county examiner's offices that are like serving up cannibalistic cookouts and, you know.

132
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:55,900


133
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:01,340
And they're like, you know, upscale braised brain hideaway retreats or whatever.

134
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:11,360
I honestly think that somewhere out there there's a lab growing meat to feed to cannibals that think it's more ethical.

135
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,480
I mean, if you could grow a clone of yourself, would you eat yourself?

136
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,360
No.

137
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,320
Would you have sex with yourself?

138
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,300
Probably.

139
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,340
What kind of a question are you making?

140
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,420
Would you eat yourself?

141
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,880
No.

142
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,340
Like that?

143
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,240
Sure.

144
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,020
Sure.

145
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,180
I mean, why not?

146
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,260
Probably not, actually.

147
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,760
We'd probably just go and get somebody else to do it because we know how it is.

148
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,640
We like to be that lazy.

149
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,840
Oh, you and your clone would be fellow princesses together.

150
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,260
We are, yeah.

151
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:51,920
I think it was, as the great Pease once stated, you know, he was describing himself.

152
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,760
He wasn't describing me.

153
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,860
But as many subgenius might declare, I am a subgenius.

154
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:55,860


155
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,320
I am a selfish lover.

156
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:05,520
I think that the people that would pay money to eat lab-grown human meat would also pay

157
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,220
money to have sex with you and your clone.

158
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm not sure if I would take it, though, because it's like a me time kind of thing.

159
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,120
I mean, what if they were really nice?

160
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,600
Me times two kind of thing.

161
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,380
What if they were really nice?

162
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,100
What if they were really nice?

163
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,840
Then why are they really nice?

164
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:25,840


165
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,420
Because they're really hanging around with me and my lab-grown clone.

166
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,120
Right.

167
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,660
Why the f-

168
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,100
Well, maybe because they're nice but also kind of creepy.

169
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,460
You know, there's like those nice creeps out there.

170
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,740
You like tolerate them.

171
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,740
I'm stalking you, but I'm leaving you gifts so it's okay, right?

172
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,660
And they're not severed cat's heads.

173
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,280
They're just, they're like journals so you can put your feelings down and then I can

174
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,520
read them while you sleep.

175
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,280
They're very thoughtful gifts.

176
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,740
Thoughtful and heartfelt gifts.

177
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,880
I saw that your can opener broke when I was watching you through the window, so here's

178
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,640
a new can opener I got you.

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,600
Oh my goodness.

180
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,920
I mean, it's, I noticed that you're left-handed so a left-handed person can also use it.

181
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,060
Here's your left-handed can opener.

182
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:09,720
Oh.

183
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,720
Signed, that person that watches you sleep.

184
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,440
Right.

185
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:23,000
I, yeah, I like, I like how we make the voices for the stalkers really, la la la la la.

186
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,120
But they're in real life.

187
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,480
They're like, I just got this for you cause I thought you needed it.

188
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:35,520
You know, like just, they're probably a lot more gritty and crass.

189
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,960
Maybe your stalkers are.

190
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,100
Mine usually sound like cartoon characters.

191
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,440
Actually, all my, all my stalkers just yell in sign language most of the time.

192
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:44,880
Oh really?

193
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,780
They leave me notes in braille, but I can't read it.

194
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,620
That's pretty cool.

195
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,560
Not really.

196
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,760
It's probably like death threats or something.

197
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,840
A death threat in braille.

198
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,560
A death threat.

199
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,960
Oh.

200
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,620
Is this ableist humor?

201
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,500
It is not ableist humor.

202
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,420
It's pun-tastic.

203
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,220
Yeah.

204
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,600
It's just, you know.

205
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,580
It's very punny.

206
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,040
It's just a pun.

207
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:17,620
I wonder, you know, I'm pretty sure that my deaf friends would think that that was also

208
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,900
rather humorous.

209
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,480
Yeah, but the deaf can hear.

210
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,420
They also threaten me on occasion.

211
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:23,740
Oh, I see.

212
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:23,740


213
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:23,740


214
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:23,740


215
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:23,740


216
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:23,740


217
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:23,740


218
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:23,740


219
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:23,740


220
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:23,740


221
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:23,740


222
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:23,740


223
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:23,740


224
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:23,740


225
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:23,740


226
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,000
I know.

227
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,960
They would, they would find it quite charming.

228
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,580
In sign language?

229
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,040
Uh, yeah.

230
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,900
Among other languages.

231
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,880
But I mean, everybody knows that sign language.

232
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,560
Mmm.

233
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:32,880
You know.

234
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,920
You put your index finger down, you put your middle finger up, you put your ring finger

235
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,380
down, and your pinky finger down, you put your thumb in, and you point it to the person,

236
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,940
and that's what it's all about.

237
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,720
Yeah, it is.

238
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,920
I think is the way the song goes.

239
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,760
I could be wrong.

240
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,340
Mm-hmm.

241
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,740
So, uh, are you, are you, are you, are you, are you, are you, are you, are you, are you,

285
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:16,120
me from the highway shopping bookstores bookstores in quotes

286
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,900

287
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,360

288
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,920
you know the people can't see like the legislation in our town we live in the same place and it's a

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:36,560
city i know that what do you mean like we can go up the street right now and you want to go to the

the end of a perfect evening don't leave after all a girl likes to know you've had a good time

293
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:02,640
this same type of rot and decay caused 16 of the 19 major civilizations to vanish from the earth

294
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:15,520
magnificent egypt classical greece imperial rome all crumbled away not because of the strength

295
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,240
of the world but because of moral decay from within

296
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:33,620
when you think of two girls 16 and 17 years of age that leave school in their junior or senior year

297
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,100
and they want to get married then there's something definitely wrong

298
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,980
or take the case of the girl who finds herself in this situation

00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,100

310
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:11,760
that's science work that's science yeah oh man i'm gonna need to uh what's the word save money

yeah you can you can watch dr brouhaha give herself hickeys in various places on her person

313
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:36,120
if you send money to uh you know i guess animal house at gmail.com is paypal a-n-n-a-m-a-u-l-h-o-u-s-e

you want to send us money we're gonna need people to send us money

316
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,160
specifically state that it is for dr brouhaha's hickey fund

317
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:52,040
it will definitely go towards that i think how much was that we needed uh that one was 74.99

318
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:58,340
yeah plus tax though uh do they tax sex toys i thought they were like sure do i mean i'm sorry

319
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:04,040
educational models if we're teachers using them for education then they can't be taxed right i

320
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,860
thought there's laws against that there's not a form that they accept there in that store

321
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,720
i'm gonna have to get if you're using it for work

322
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:21,980
they will also not accept it the tax uh tax evasion form well there you have it folks that's why the

323
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:28,980
donations to the church yes are uh tax deductible donations to the church are tax deductible

324
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:36,260

00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:23,700
oh yeah now i know that the well actually many different multiple angles but also

341
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,000
not just from the interior but from the exterior from the posterior

342
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:37,940
and the anterior and the posterior of the posterior yes as it were

343
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,020
um yeah i didn't know these things because i

344
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:50,340
grew up in a very sheltered environment most of us did and that's why it's good to have these stores

345
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:59,640
regularly uh scattered across the american highways these days kiddos uh go and shop uh

346
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:07,460
shop locally yeah find your local adult video novelty and bookstore and frequent them ask if

347
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,620
if that product is right for you ask to see it

348
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,620
in action they they have to demonstrate it actually i mean but not they don't i mean not

349
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,800
like personally demonstrate they don't have to yeah they just have to turn it on they have to

350
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,140
well they don't have to turn you on they have to make sure that it can turn on there's no returns

351
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:37,260
or exchanges on these devices so yeah unless the factory specifically provides a guarantee

352
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,300
specifically because some of them do like cal exotics specifically

353
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:48,220
i think fun factory in germany's got like at least a year warranty or something yeah yeah

354
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,980
like if they blow i don't want one with a recall notice yeah if they blow up in your home you should

355
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,720
be able to get a refund for that but there's so many rechargeable devices now it is so impressive

356
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:06,260
like it'll save you money kids save it's like so save the planet yeah save your save your mind

357
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:11,620
you know and uh you'll have batteries in all your flashlights and remote controls

358
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:17,800
yeah when you need them yeah your your wii controllers and uh the the like all kinds of

359
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:24,080
stuff yeah we'll actually have batteries the double a's the triple a's a few of them nine

360
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:31,680
bolts or we'll stay in the smoke alarms and not end up but you know i gotta say the one thing

361
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,140
that's it's like you know how kind of disappointing it is when an annoying when you can't find your

362
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,120
phone charger yeah when you can't find your charger for one of these devices

363
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:50,160
yeah a little little annoying there yeah so but uh and they don't sell them side on they don't

364
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,480
sell yeah they're not like a cart yeah and they're not they're like proprietary like

365
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,580
phone chargers used to be so yeah maybe they'll make like universal models soon with those things

366
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:05,220
they do they do company-wide yeah models with the ones with magnetic attachments that are like the

367
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,620
two dots trying to avoid those kids that's uh you want to get the ones that have the insert with like

368
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,380
the the

369
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:17,120
jack the headphone jack the magnetic two dot ones the magnetic two dot ones are very specific and

370
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:25,460
if they're not connected just right um it it will and they're and they look like they could fit other

371
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,960
devices that have the magnetic two dot but it's really toy specific even within the brand

372
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,740
and so you're spending a lot of money on something that once you lose that little charger that you

373
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,120
will lose don't let your cats chew it up

374
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:51,900
seriously i've yeah anyway um if you want to play with your kitty don't let your kitty play with it

375
00:25:52,900 --> 00:26:01,220
right okay so uh there's the uh definitely the ones that had to plug in jack style charger though

376
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,900
absolutely universal across the board um there's one that's a little longer than the other ones

377
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,680
and don't ask me how i know this but anyway but it still works well for the all the like across the board

378
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:18,580
you could yeah good times waiting to happen expensive times though well they're worth it

379
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:23,940
in the long run minimum 50 bucks i mean think of how many dates that you spend like 50 bucks

380
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,680
just on a date none i am a single lonely

381
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:37,300
see there you go you're not spending money to like go out and talk to another human being that might

382
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,680
um may or may not touch you in ways that make you feel like you're not spending money on something that's not

383
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,760
going to make you happy oh so yeah it's like i'm saving myself all that bother yeah just 50 bucks

384
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,400
bam like the one that i wanted the one with the little wool and the other

385
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:59,180
that thing was 150 bucks well okay so that's like at least a couple years that's some whiz bangs

386
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:06,460
that was like yeah to like a uh you know like a tv website or something yeah that was like uh

387
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:11,240
that's a couple years worth of entertainment so that vibrator better have

388
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,640
a three-year warranty on it it did vibrate it also went

389
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:28,560
but uh needless to say um we spent way too much time in that store we did we learned a lot

390
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:34,300
the sales uh sales representatives were very helpful they were super sweet

391
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:40,520
yeah and they kept running off to the bathroom did they i think one had a

392
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:40,860
her

393
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,200
nose itched a lot weird i wish my nose was itching

394
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:55,740
anyway i've gotta say good night dr brouhaha good night animal i'm gonna i'm gonna not stop at that

395
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:01,100
place on the way back home okay good for you or do if you want to okay

396
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:10,620
oh wow this is back in 1998 at the original x day

397
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,060
he's an ab discip how are you emailing these guys

398
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,800
man that's of several different time travel

399
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,080
dimensions ago the history has been fractured

400
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:29,120
since that moment so many times that it's absolutely impossible to keep track of which

401
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:39,180
time stream that we're on from that point but uh that's getting off into the scientific ends of

402
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,560
things. I just

403
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,400
I shouldn't stay on the phone

404
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,480
long. I was falling asleep

405
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,140
but I

406
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,520
was tuned in

407
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,880
and was listening to the show

408
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,620
and I'm happy to hear

409
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,080
y'all.

410
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,160
I'm happy to hear from you.

411
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,500
Things are going better here

412
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,560
at Stang Ranch. I had a

413
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,440
rough July

414
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,700
but I've kind of

415
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,540
settled in. There's sort of

416
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,500
a routine. I'm able to get

417
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,800
back to work and

418
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,340
it rained.

419
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,940
It finally rained

420
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,600
after six weeks.

421
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,900
All the colors

422
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,540
altered

423
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,000
in about 24 hours.

424
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,900
Everything was yellow

425
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,980
and brown. Suddenly it's all

426
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,940
green and purple and blue

427
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,880
and red and everything.

428
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:33,260
So

429
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,240
things

430
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,420
are finally looking up.

431
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,100
It's my main point.

432
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,360
I said you never really can trust

433
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,400
the conspiracy anyway.

434
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,140
You

435
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,580
can't trust yourself.

436
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:47,720
You

437
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,560
can trust the conspiracy.

438
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,480
You can trust it

439
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,800
to be stupid.

440
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,560
That's the one thing

441
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,180
you can depend

442
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,660
on with the conspiracy.

443
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,880
If they're going to do something,

444
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,580
it's going to be stupid.

445
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,940
That's

446
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,300
the

447
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,400
kind of in some

448
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,300
ways the definition,

449
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,820
I guess, of the

450
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,320
conspiracy, the conspiracy

451
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,580
of the normals.

452
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,340
They'll go for

453
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,080
what looks

454
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,900
like the easy way

455
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,400
out.

456
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,000
Oh yeah. Nobody listens

457
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,900
to the old prophet of doom until

458
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,940
it's too late. Mark my words.

459
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,880
You'll see

460
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,800
you kids, by God,

461
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,520
I'm glad I won't be able to do this.

462
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,360
I'll be around to see it.

463
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,520
Praise God, everything's

464
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:45,780
okay.

465
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,600
The spirit came back to me.

466
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,660
You'll have to leave me for a second.

467
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,320
Friends, if you

468
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,400
want to help the church at Subgenius,

469
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,840
you just take a good look at subgenius.com.

470
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,420
There's a button on that front

471
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,400
page. That's all I'm going

472
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:01,760
to say.

473
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,480
Praise

474
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,000
God.

475
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:06,400
Praise God.

476
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:07,680
But

477
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,380
I'm so glad to hear

478
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:12,960
to

479
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,420
hear one more radio

480
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,040
synesthesia with

481
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,160
Governor Rocknard calling in.

482
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,540
It's like, man, I've been

483
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,880
listening to this kind of stuff

484
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,300
kind of in the background while I was working

485
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,300
dealing with my show right

486
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,480
after recording it every Sunday

487
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,020
night for 20

488
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,660
years.

489
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,260
And

490
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,680
I

491
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:36,980
just

492
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,060
I just

493
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,120
I just had to say

494
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,460
praise Bob and thank

495
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,040
you guys.

496
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,020
I'm so glad that you

497
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,100
hung in there.

498
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,260
Yeah.

499
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,600
You know,

500
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,180
they ain't killed us yet.

501
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,420
And by some

502
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,400
weird twist of luck, we're not

503
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,080
dead yet.

504
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,440
Oh, as long as they can get work

505
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,240
out of us, they'll keep us alive.

506
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,420
No, especially the unpaid

507
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:09,880
work.

508
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,680
Oh, that's the best part.

509
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,280
Stuff we don't get paid for.

510
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,440
Oh, they love that.

511
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,360
Yep.

512
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,480
All right.

513
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,980
But it all comes

514
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,480
out even in the end.

515
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,200
The great

516
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,480
sand

517
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,520
dial of destiny and eternity

518
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,000
where everything

519
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,860
is equal except some win

520
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,840
and some lose.

521
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,280
Otherwise,

522
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,000
as said in

523
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,480
as said in the book of the

524
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,600
subgenius, stop sucking

525
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,540
on the finger and go

526
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,680
where it points.

527
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,540
That's it.

528
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,480
That was a good one.

529
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,240
And as

530
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,700
NTC, the rub genius

531
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:53,760
said.

532
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,440
Someday I will be

533
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,800
a large scar.

534
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,520
Okay, if we're lucky, that's what

535
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,300
we'll all be.

536
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,820
That's the best you can hope for

537
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,340
until the exes come and Bob's

538
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,500
promise rings true.

539
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,240
On that day, we'll see all

540
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,280
the disbelievers embarrassed

541
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,140
and we'll be the trolls

542
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,420
that go lolling

543
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,580
to heaven.

544
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,020
Oh, that's right. You know, honestly,

545
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,360
the best part about being

546
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,980
in with Bob is not

547
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,940
the fact that we get our own

548
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,200
planet

549
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,900
full of sex goddesses.

550
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,500
And get taken there on pleasure

551
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,080
saucers.

552
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,980
That's nothing compared to the joy

553
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,740
of watching all the pinks left behind.

554
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,240
Right, right.

555
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,400
It's it's it's

556
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,940
that's all well and good.

557
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,160
All that slack and

558
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,780
joy and sex

559
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,940
and orgasmic

560
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,520
radiation and so forth.

561
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,360
But the but

562
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,800
really, it's

563
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,820
that we want to see everybody

564
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,420
else burning in hell.

565
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,980
It's just like every other thing.

566
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,700
Every other religion.

567
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,420
That's what it's all about.

568
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:12,760
Yep.

569
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,760
That's the basic formula

570
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,460
right there for any religion.

571
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,800
Who are you going to get to watch

572
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,860
burn in hell?

573
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,600
That's right.

574
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,980
By the way, one more thing.

575
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:24,800
Indignation.

576
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,000
It's an addictive drug.

577
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,780
Butthurt is a drug.

578
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,280
I like to call it proctalgia

579
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,760
or proctopathy.

580
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,400
Ouch.

581
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,960
Oh, oh, hey, that's cool, man.

582
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,960
Hey, that speculum is cold.

583
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:41,880
Yes.

584
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,520
Pull it out.

585
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,020
Yeah.

586
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,040
I'm not a real doctor.

587
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,160
I just play one on the radio.

588
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,860
But because I play one on the radio,

589
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,560
I can't use a term like butthurt.

590
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,120
I have to use terms like proctalgia

591
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,280
or proctopathy.

592
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,120
Oh, OK.

593
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,560
Oh, well, but why

594
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,920
I agree. I think that's

595
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,360
you know, after years

596
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,060
of tossing deliberately

597
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,480
whenever I could.

598
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,260
I finally.

599
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:06,960
Speaking of.

600
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,660
Well, they do that in headlines

601
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,280
now.

602
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,320
Wow.

603
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,880
Dr. Brujaugh.

604
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:14,840
Geez.

605
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,580
Animal Mall.

606
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,060
Overlord Animal Mall.

607
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,140
That was quite an adventure.

608
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,480
That was an adventure.

609
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,560
I am.

610
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,040
I am taken aback.

611
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,080
I think I have learned new things

612
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,220
that I didn't need to know.

613
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,940
I've learned things that I

614
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,060
definitely needed to know.

615
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,380
And so, yeah, that

616
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,320
that was a thing that they

617
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,140
have. And there were windows at the

618
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,180
adult bookstore.

619
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,680
Just a couple of them.

620
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,940
But they were in the front.

621
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,560
Sure.

622
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,420
So they could see you buying stuff

623
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,620
if you were to purchase things.

624
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,960
But we didn't do that.

625
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,040
Yeah, definitely.

626
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,760
We didn't buy anything at all.

627
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,400
We had to save our money up because

628
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,260
that is an expensive place to shop.

629
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:52,960
Yeah.

630
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,440
They for the you got to spend

631
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,980
money to get the quality goods

632
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,480
there.

633
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,660
That is that is probably

634
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:01,280
true.

635
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,260
Yeah.

636
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,800
Well, a lot of rechargeable stuff.

637
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,200
Anyway.

638
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,840
They did have a clearance rack.

639
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:06,960
So.

640
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,120
They they I don't want to anything

641
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,440
that's on the clearance rack of an

642
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,360
adult bookstore.

643
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,800
I think that you might, though.

644
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,320
I mean, sometimes there's some really

645
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,620
nice leggings or like a lovely like

646
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,920
costume with like those

647
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,540
those those tails

648
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,180
had internal parts

649
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:31,300
and not not on not for them.

650
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,860
Anyway.

651
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,240
So so anyway.

652
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,840
So that was that was a great

653
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,360
adventure. And I'm glad we got to go

654
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,240
on that adventure.

655
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,220
And now, you know, you know what

656
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,160
I want for my birthday.

657
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,380
But besides that,

658
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,520
yeah, I think that I'm going to stick

659
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,240
to pastry cafes

660
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,120
and coffee shops

661
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,320
full of Korean and other treats.

662
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,180
Maybe bookstores without adult

663
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,320
novelties in them.

664
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,780
Yeah. Well, I want the the closest

665
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,640
I want is like a pillow that looks

666
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,200
like a log, but it's really a

667
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,400
pillow.

668
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,740
That kind of adult novelty.

669
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,020
I can deal with that.

670
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,680
Or maybe a pen that shaped like

671
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,500
they had like a little cat at the

672
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,320
very top of it.

673
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,560
And that costs,

674
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,560
you know, $17

675
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,080
for no good reason.

676
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,260
What about a cup that's like a duck

677
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:23,560
shape?

678
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,080
No, no, no, no

679
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,160
duck shaped cups. But the the ones

680
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,500
that look like lab beakers,

681
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,660
but they're just like

682
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,340
kitchenware.

683
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,980
You can't actually put them over a

684
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,720
bunsen burner.

685
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,380
You couldn't, they would totally blow up.

686
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,580
That kind of adult novelty, you know.

687
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,680
Yeah. Like martini glasses with fake

688
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,420
sharks in them.

689
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,000
A finger puppet of Freud.

690
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,940
Oh yeah, I like that.

691
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,920
You know, something to that effect.

692
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,380
Wholesome novelties.

693
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,080
But that adults would purchase.

694
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,080
Gorilla feet.

695
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,880
As opposed to the monkey's paw,

696
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,540
which was also an adult novelty.

697
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,740
But a fake hook for your hand.

698
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:05,960
A fake hook for your hand.

699
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:05,960


700
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,580
Like a pirate's hook.

701
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,340
A real hook for your hand,

702
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,240
because sometimes it's just that novel.

703
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,280
Oh my gosh.

704
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,160
Now I want to find out monkey paw,

705
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,640
where more we can get monkey paws.

706
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,620
I don't know if I need some wishes

707
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,040
to be coming true.

708
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,920
I feel like they're cursed.

709
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,600
There's aren't the monkey paws all cursed.

710
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,140
Aren't all wishes like, like zing?

711
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,060
Like, oh, you wanted to get a back rub.

712
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,900
Zing! It's by spiders.

713
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,440
I didn't want a back rub by spiders.

714
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,140
You know, or like, but it feels so good.

715
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,020
Oh, but now the poison's sinking in

716
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,340
and my skin's falling off because it's necrotic.

717
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,740
You know, but like, you know, or like,

718
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,140
I wish for a thousand more wishes.

719
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,380
And then it just like exponential wishes.

720
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,320
Because every wish has to be for more wishes.

721
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,800
But you get all these wishes,

722
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,660
but you don't actually use them for anything.

723
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,120
Because you keep wishing for more wishes.

724
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,380
For more wishes.

725
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,940
It's just like a time waste. It's just like a time waste.

726
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,380
I wonder if there's like a foolproof wish

727
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,000
that you could wish that wouldn't cause like a rift

728
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,340
in the space time continuum.

729
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,620
I wish to cure cancer.

730
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,420
But then like there's worse disease

731
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,580
or leprosy makes a big comeback or.

732
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,220
Yeah, where you find out that cancer is actually helping us.

733
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,480
Yeah, because like then the planet overpopulates

734
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,960
and no one has enough food.

735
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:31,040
And then like the, you know, the World Bank collapses

736
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,560
and it's anarchy in the street.

737
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,400
Actually, that sounds fun.

738
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,100
Yeah.

739
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,900
I was gonna say.

740
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,360
Yeah.

741
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,240
And there's already not enough food for everybody in the.

742
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,760
I mean, there is enough food.

743
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,300
We just don't.

744
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,340
But there's not in the right places.

745
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,160
It's true.

746
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,080
Too much food in one place and not enough in others.

747
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,220
And I got to say earlier when I was eating my blueberry puree filled

748
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,020
Danish square bun thing, whatever it was from the bakery.

749
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,580
Hashtag Danish square bun.

750
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,420
Octothorpe Danish square bun.

751
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,440
It was so good.

752
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,700
I was thinking it's like, oh, and there are children starving

753
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,580
in other countries.

754
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,180
And then I was like, so which country do you think of when you think of starving children?

755
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,680
Ireland.

756
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:12,720
Really?

757
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,240
Ireland.

758
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,480
That's the top of your list?

759
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,140
That's your go to?

760
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,360
Well, I guess like Belarus.

761
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,440
OK.

762
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,680
I'm thinking like Somalia, you know?

763
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,500
Yeah, I guess like Syria.

764
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,840
They're probably starting there.

765
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,880
Syria's probably having some problems over there with food.

766
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,860
I hear there's stuff on fire in Greece.

767
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,720
Maybe some of their food got on fire.

768
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,740
Maybe they're.

769
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,300
Yeah.

770
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:34,840
Maybe.

771
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,100
Maybe some of their food is on fire.

772
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:43,520
So they have less olives and olive oil to eat there because it burnt up.

773
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,280
Slowly.

774
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,380
Just very slowly burning away.

775
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,480
It's like a tire fire, but it's an olive oil fire.

776
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,380
That's I mean, those trees are really big.

777
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,400
They might take a long time.

778
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,080
Oh, my gosh.

779
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,240
That would probably take forever.

780
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:04,700
But I was thinking like, you know, I like the starving children of South American, you know,

781
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:04,820
country.

782
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:09,140
I'm kind of Costa Rica because I can sit on the beach and watch starving children.

783
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,240
That's always fun.

784
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,700
You could get them to get you food from the bar.

785
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,400
I know you didn't in front of them.

786
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,740
Yeah.

787
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,360
That's all.

788
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,740
I mean, you could give them a you could give them a bite.

789
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,160
They're starving, so you can't feed them a lot at once.

790
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,980
They'll still get sick.

791
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,980
So just let them have like a bite or they can smell it.

792
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,980
Have them on a drip feeder.

793
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:30,280
If they smell it, that'll give them like they'll be inhaling food particles when they smell it.

794
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,800
So that'll give them a little nutrition.

795
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,560
I just get mine from the air.

796
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,440
That's the flaky puff pastries.

797
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,080
Well, yeah.

798
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,660
All they really are is air nutrition.

799
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:44,260
So yeah, well, let's send them flaky puff pastries because that way I won't.

800
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,700
No, I'm just going to eat this one.

801
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,040
It's so good.

802
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,660
I mean, you'll drop some crumbs.

803
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,660
But I thought about them.

804
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,200
See, you did.

805
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,380
And that's that's important.

806
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,300
It's the thought that counts.

807
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:59,500
It's making others aware that there's a problem.

808
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,960
Mostly it's my.

809
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,540
How I'm dealing with starving children.

810
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,880
I'm doing it for the sake of starving children around the world.

811
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,520
Prayers are good, too.

812
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:06,860
I hear.

813
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,940
Oh, thoughts and prayers.

814
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,520
Yeah, I hear if you send them, you got to put them in the combo.

815
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,560
If it's just thoughts or just prayers.

816
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:18,060
No, you got to be thoughts and prayers.

817
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,660
Send both or it doesn't work.

818
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:20,240
Yeah.

819
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,180
Likes and shares, thoughts and prayers.

820
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,920
There's also you can send money to.

821
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:26,620
What?

822
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,800
Who does that?

823
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,300
You know, to your PayPal account.

824
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,200
Oh, yeah.

825
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,520
It's a and a m a u l a t.

826
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:33,520


827
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:33,520


828
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:33,520


829
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:33,520


830
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:33,520


831
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:39,500
H o u s e at gmail.com is the PayPal that you'd want to send that to.

832
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,160
That'd be cool.

833
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:44,360
We will not purchase any adult novelties or books, but we will buy.

834
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,540
Totally will do that.

835
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,820
Flaky pastries.

836
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,580
Oh, flaky pastries.

837
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,820
And eat them in front of hungry children.

838
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,640
Well, no, we'll share with at least one hungry adult.

839
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,320
I get hungry.

840
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,020
Yeah.

841
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,400
I need more pastries.

842
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,180
I mean, there's some kids on this block.

843
00:42:59,300 --> 00:42:59,800
I could probably.

844
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,600
You're right.

845
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,240
I could probably give them a bite of my pastry.

846
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:03,500
I know.

847
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:03,500


848
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,100
They might want it.

849
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:06,880
What if they don't want?

850
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,620
That's the thing, though.

851
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,060
If you get one with nuts on it, kids hate nuts.

852
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,340
So then they won't want it.

853
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,340
They'll be like, oh, it's gross.

854
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,360
Which I did.

855
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,160
I got one with almonds.

856
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,060
Oh, that's terrible.

857
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,100
Kids find almonds just unpalatable.

858
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,780
I actually really liked the Jordan almonds when I was a kid.

859
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,100
Those things are terrible.

860
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,640
I was a weird child.

861
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:28,460
They're like.

862
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,780
I'm a weird adult.

863
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,980
I think they'll break all the teeth in your mouth.

864
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:33,400
They did.

865
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:33,480
They did.

866
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:33,480


867
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:33,480


868
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:33,480


869
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:33,480


870
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:33,480


871
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:33,480


872
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:33,480


873
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:33,480


874
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:33,480


875
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:33,480


876
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:33,480


877
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,320
I have horrible dental problems now because of almonds.

878
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,680
Because of Jordan almonds.

879
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,260
Yeah.

880
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,980
Because it's got like that rock hard titanium sugar alloy on it.

881
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,380
Oh, it's definitely something.

882
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,840
It's carterized the shell of the.

883
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,460
Yeah.

884
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,180
Yeah.

885
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:49,900
It's dangerous.

886
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,840
It's like now that you husked your almonds, just coat them in lead.

887
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,700
Bite into that.

888
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,220
It gives it a sweet, crunchy shell.

889
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,480
Diamond crusted lead shell.

890
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,460
Oh, man.

891
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:02,780
Yeah.

892
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,360
That's the.

893
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,500
That's where all the enamel goes.

894
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,580
Anyway, I've got to go back across town past that adult novelty store.

895
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,420
I'm not going to stop.

896
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:14,980
I'll probably stop at that 24 hour bakery though now that we've mentioned that again.

897
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,780
And if your town that you're listening, pleasure out there.

898
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:25,500
If you don't have a 24 hour bakery in your town, you need to protest at City Hall and

899
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,340
demand 24 hour pastries.

900
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,620
Or just open one yourself.

901
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,780
Or open one because it's a really good idea.

902
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:31,480
Yeah.

903
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,620
It's, you know, butter is expensive, but flour is cheap.

904
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,180
And, you know, just mix it all together and charge them $8 each.

905
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:38,340
Yeah.

906
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,200
And in the morning you're going to want to have the freshest pastry.

907
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,560
So you're going to be there all night anyway baking.

908
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,700
Or somebody is.

909
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,500
Not you.

910
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,320
You'll be asleep in your money bed.

911
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,640
You can pay somebody else.

912
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:54,260
But you can pay somebody else pennies on the dollar to be there overnight because they

913
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:54,880
hate humans.

914
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:00,540
And they will make sure that the place doesn't burn down while baking and glazing more pastries.

915
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,200
Hopefully with the butter mixture.

916
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,060
But, yeah.

917
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,640
And no Jordan almonds.

918
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:06,560
No Jordan almonds.

919
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,300
Hopefully not.

920
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:07,920
Okay.

921
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,400
Well, good night, Dr. Brujaha.

922
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,820
Good night, animal.

923
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,640
So, we're going to take one more caller here right now.

924
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,500
You're on the radio.

925
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,320
Hello?

926
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,420
Hello, No Money Mark.

927
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,140
Welcome to the program.

928
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,640
Yes, I am calling so late tonight.

929
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,880
Well, hey, it's good to hear from you.

930
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,180
No, you're fine.

931
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,360
No Money Mark.

932
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:30,520
No Money Mark.

933
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:30,520


934
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:30,520


935
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:30,520


936
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:30,520


937
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:30,520


938
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:30,520


939
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:30,520


940
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:30,520


941
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:30,520


942
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:30,520


943
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:30,520


944
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,660
How are you doing, Reverend?

945
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,640
I have a question for you.

946
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:45,540
One of the pinks tried to co-opt the subgenii by trying to fake the invasion of the sex

947
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:47,900
goddesses.

948
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,820
They can't do that.

949
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:51,740
What?

950
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,880
Who was fighting this invasion?

951
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,480
The saucers?

952
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,860
I want to see that.

953
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:57,360
Yeah.

954
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:58,840
Sounds good.

955
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,120
Yeah.

956
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:00,520
I'm not sure.

957
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:00,520


958
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:00,520


959
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:00,520


960
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:00,520


961
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,700
It's nothing like the real thing, though.

962
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,820
You're talking about an actual physical invasion by UFOs.

963
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,000
Correct, Mark?

964
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:17,400
Well, what we were expecting and still do expect is a ... It's more of a mystical, metaphysical

965
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,720
thing that we can't even understand.

966
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:30,220
It's like you could say we were being beamed up into gigantic, sizeless flying saucers

967
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:36,320
but really it all happens on a level that humans could never possibly understand.

968
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,300
I don't pretend to understand.

969
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:44,260
Well, this is where all ... Yeah, I mean, this is a fundamental concept in all religion

970
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:54,260
and that is the use of metaphor to put it in terms that us puny humans can understand.

971
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:54,700
No, no.

972
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:59,560
This is all literally ... This is absolutely literally true just like the book of Genesis.

973
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,500
Well, one of the books of Genesis.

974
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,280
Yeah.

975
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:03,280


976
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:03,280


977
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,900
Well, you're saying that it's hard for us to understand what's really going to happen

978
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,160
when the pleasure saucers come.

979
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:09,600
Right.

980
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:16,580
But I was told that the pleasure saucers would come with the exists and the sex goddesses

981
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,300
in command and they were going to let me board their saucer and they were going to take me

982
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:24,620
to either Planet X or another planet in that system where ...

983
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,380
That's technically true.

984
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:26,900
Okay.

985
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,320
We don't actually know where ...

986
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,200
And Bob sold it.

987
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:31,880
I smoked it.

988
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,640
That settles it.

989
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:39,080
But you're saying here that the actual process, which as described is something I can very

990
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,860
easily imagine because I've been a science fiction fan since I was a small child.

991
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:50,500
Well, then you would understand that this is the one that you can't understand.

992
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,680
Which means that there's going to be something that actually happens.

993
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:59,300
The actual process of it is going to be beyond the capacity of our small human being.

994
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,100
It's going to be beyond the capacity of our human brains to truly comprehend.

995
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:08,560
A good example for this would be the HBO show, The Leftovers.

996
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,900
Are you familiar with that Reverend Stang?

997
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,300
No.

998
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,320
Okay.

999
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:24,400
The Leftovers is about what happens in a world where a rapture type event takes place and

1000
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,100
2% of the Earth's population disappears.

1001
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:29,280
That's the point.

1002
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,840
And it appears in an instant.

1003
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:39,020
And the rest of the world is trying to cope with the idea of the departed.

1004
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,680
The sudden departure.

1005
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,860
Left behind, man.

1006
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:42,880
Left behind.

1007
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,140
Right.

1008
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:53,280
But it's actually more closer to the rapture itself, but it takes away the biblical Armageddon.

1009
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,720
You're saying that HBO ripped off Left Behind?

1010
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:58,700
Kinda.

1011
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,280
I bet they couldn't even get Kirk Cameron to act in it.

1012
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,020
Well, here's the twist.

1013
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:16,200
In the series finale, in the final episode, it was discovered that basically this woman

1014
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:21,540
who worked for the government department of sudden departures, where basically they were

1015
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,060
trying to keep track of who got departed.

1016
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,500
She found this group of scientists.

1017
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,380
Who she thought was running like a suicide cult scam.

1018
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:40,680
And they had built a special machine to where she was able to cross over to that place where

1019
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,540
the 2% of the population went.

1020
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:52,720
But for that 2%, it was a world identical to Earth, except for them, it was 98% of the

1021
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,080
rest of the world that disappeared.

1022
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,480
Well, Governor, former Governor, I'm not sure if you know this, but the former governor

1023
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:04,000
of North Carolina, Governor Rottner, sometimes I get the impression that you live inside

1024
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,380
the TV world.

1025
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,960
Oh, I do.

1026
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:09,520
Yeah.

1027
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,660
Yeah.

1028
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:13,400
Yeah.

1029
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:18,140
I kind of, I have trouble identifying with that.

1030
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,060
I'm old.

1031
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:26,160
I'm still out in the dirt world.

1032
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:26,720


1033
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,120
And your generation was the first to have been raised with television as a thing.

1034
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,560
Yeah.

1035
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,180
Yeah.

1036
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:42,740
You know, the funny thing is the people, a generation up, hipster, you know, elder hipsters

1037
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:53,580
that I respected would say things to me like, you guys, your generation is totally, totally

1038
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:54,140
different.

1039
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,220
You, you.

1040
00:50:55,220 --> 00:51:03,720
You, but the TV, you're not, you're, you're just not like us.

1041
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:07,820
And I was going, oh, I, I still am.

1042
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,120
You know, my, my family runs a ranch.

1043
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,340
I mean, I, I go hiking and exploring.

1044
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,600
I'm a survivalist, a naturalist.

1045
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:24,540
And they're going, no, you don't, it's, I was going, no, no, it's the next generation,

1046
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,640
Internet kids, they're the ones that are really cut off from reality.

1047
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:40,180
But I've come to realize that, no, the kids aren't the ones that are cut off from reality.

1048
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,200
To them, it's normal.

1049
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:54,040
And there's some things I'll never understand and I don't expect to.

1050
00:51:55,220 --> 00:52:00,780
And I'm just glad I'll probably be dead before the last mountain gorilla dies.

1051
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:08,400
You know what? I refuse to accept that I will just never understand some of these things that are going on in the world today.

1052
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:14,780
I think the more you hear the thoughts of the people who are involved...

1053
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:20,200
I think a person can understand. That's the whole point, is to try to understand it.

1054
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:24,440
I think that we can understand it.

1055
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,060
To relative degrees.

1056
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:31,680
The problem is, all the monkey people understand it differently.

1057
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,620
Well, but you can come to understand how they understand it.

1058
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,720
Because it's not like their brains are made of different material than yours.

1059
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:45,660
You know, they have probably the same number of neurons you do, or something very close to it.

1060
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:53,920
They have a prefrontal cortex and a medulla oblongata and a cerebellum and all that crap, you know.

1061
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:59,840
It's not like their biology is any different from your own, so...

1062
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,620
No, and those things were hard won.

1063
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:12,080
It took a long time for creatures to develop those organs you just mentioned.

1064
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,660
To the degree that we have them.

1065
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:18,900
It's...

1066
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,280
I just sometimes I have to wonder if...

1067
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,080
It's like, we got to the point where we can really understand it.

1068
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,860
It's a fairly good perspective on...

1069
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,040
The history of this planet, at least.

1070
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:41,000
Well, you mean the history of our solar system.

1071
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:41,480
But yeah...

1072
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:47,100
Because humanity has existed in two different worlds.

1073
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:54,360
The true earthlings, probably, you know, more than likely descendants from the African...

1074
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,720
And Sub-Saharan regions.

1075
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,700
And then the Martian earthlings.

1076
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:04,420
The Martians had to escape Earth after they wrecked it.

1077
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:12,060
And then they came to the Earth in the Mediterranean region, proclaiming themselves gods.

1078
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,280
Yeah, that's household knowledge.

1079
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:14,660
Yeah.

1080
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,500
Yeah, that's...

1081
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,140
You know, everybody knows that.

1082
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:30,320
But that's still...

1083
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:41,120
Everybody knows that, I think it's not until...

1084
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:45,160
Before they were stronger, before they came from the east...

1085
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:45,160


1086
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:45,600
We're meeting all these people who...

1087
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,220
We know they came to Earth to give us kind of an anxiety.

1088
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:49,220


1089
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:49,220


1090
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,720
Yeah, you know...

1091
00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:02,840
And for more information about the Church of the Subgenius or this insane show, it's subgenius.com.

1092
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,500
You'd be surprised.

1093
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:12,700
And now to close, the song by the Rainmakers that I first heard, and only once, on Dallas Radio in 1986,

1094
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:18,540
wrote down the band name, ran to the nearest Peaches, and bought the cassette.

1095
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:22,260
Except, this was their breakout song back then, friends.

1096
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:26,980
A little more popular in Europe than the U.S. for some reason.

1097
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:35,540
Although this is a livelier version from the album Live in Oslo and Kansas City.

1098
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:18,500
This is the song by the Rainmakers.

1099
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:48,520
And now to close, the song by the Rainmakers.

1100
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,100
A chair of gold

1101
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,580
He tell the boys with the horns

1102
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,140
To get down and go

1103
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,800
They're air back

1104
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,080
Aiming bells at the stars

1105
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,340
They say, beat me big daddy

1106
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,240
Hey, to the bar

1107
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:05,080
I did not put you here to suffer

1108
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,060
I did not put you here to whine

1109
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:13,000
I put you here to love one another

1110
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:17,140
And to get out and have a good time

1111
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,560
Nah nah nah nah

1112
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,540
Let my people go, go, go

1113
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:21,980
Yeah

1114
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,660
Let my people go, go, go

1115
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,120
Let my people go, go, go

1116
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,480
Let my people go

1117
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,640
Yeah

1118
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:38,060
Yeah

1119
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:39,900
Yeah

1120
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:22,880
Now Jesus went out for a walk with his mother

1121
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,780
Scribes and the Pharisees, they're flaunting, hugging mother

1122
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:30,720
They locked him up, they threw away the key

1123
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,760
He said, why's everybody always picking on me?

1124
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,780
I did not put you here to suffer

1125
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,620
I did not put you here to hide

1126
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,460
Which I hear to love one another

1127
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,700
I didn't have a good time

1128
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:50,500
Yeah

1129
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:54,580
Let my people go IG and The Didn's

1130
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:58,900
Yeah You gotta, baby, gotta

1131
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:01,160
Let my people go

1132
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:05,020
They ain't don't letting my people go

1133
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,020
I'm sick and tired of feeling so bad and do I feel alive

1134
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:15,060
That my people come here to have a good time

1135
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:15,440
You're a pig, you're a man, you're a viper

1136
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,360
Let my people go, let my people go

1137
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,600
Let my people go

1138
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,620
Gotta let my people go

1139
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,980
Oh, oh, oh, oh

1140
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:37,200
Give it fire

1141
00:59:50,280 --> 01:00:07,180
Give it fire

1142
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,740
To move faster in London

1143
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:11,940
The Dow is 39-21-614

1144
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,780
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled

1145
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,320
This is PR News

1146
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,220
PR comes from PR stations
