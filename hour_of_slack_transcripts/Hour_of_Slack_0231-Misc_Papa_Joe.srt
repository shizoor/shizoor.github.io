1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,420
I'd say it was, well, it was legal, technically.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:08,440
I mean, at least from a purely technical standpoint.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,340
Shouldn't be anything wrong with it, but...

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,220
But, but, but, but, but, but...

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,860
Copyright 1981 by the subgenius foundation.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,500
And that's even more legal, dear friends.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,440
No, wait a minute.

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,720
No, you wait a minute.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,740
No, can't wait another minute.

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,640
Yep.

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,760
J.R.?

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,920
It's Mama.

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,260
Mama, how are you?

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,320
Oh, fine, just fine.

15
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,320
Do these millionaires know what's a delicious economical snack?

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,380
The subgenius hour of swag.

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,140
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,820
What is the subgenius foundation?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,280
Well, the maybe followers of Bob at the fastest game...

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,820
Hello, Bob.

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,240
A great change has come over me.

22
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,760
I'm driving the car that Bob sold me.

23
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,460
Oh, the world looks better since Bob is my blindfold.

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,200
What is subgenius?

25
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:28,900


26
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:28,900


27
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,640
It's doctors for Bob.

28
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,020
We are the livers.

29
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:33,980
Subgenius.

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,300
Somebody told me this Bob was cool.

31
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,480
He had all the answers.

32
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,040
There was good fixing and fool.

33
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:46,380
And we would like to testify to the power of Dobbs what it has done for us.

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,080
Ever since we joined your church.

35
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,460
Praise you, Dobbs.

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,200
What did you get me for?

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,500
Yeah.

38
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,100
Oh, yes, sir.

39
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,740
Dear friends, oh, praise you, Bob.

40
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,300
Thank you.

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,560
Thank you, Bob.

42
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,380
Oh, yeah.

43
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,500
Oh, yeah.

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:02,940
Oh, yeah.

45
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,140
Oh, yeah.

46
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,140


47
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,140


48
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,140


49
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,140


50
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,140


51
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,140


52
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,140


53
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,140


54
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,140


55
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,140


56
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,140


57
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,160
All right.

58
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:03,600
I'll take it.

59
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,580
What kind of evidence could old Cliff Barnes possibly have had to connect me with that

60
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,280
counter-revolution?

61
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,480
They are.

62
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,280
He has plenty.

63
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,960
Well, I mean, what specifically?

64
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,500
I can't reveal that.

65
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,780
It's classified Senate information.

66
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,860
Oh, come on now, Bobby.

67
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,740
This is real world.

68
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,020
It's not a 1940s movie.

69
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,300
Oh, come on now, Bobby.

70
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,160
This is real world.

71
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,440
It's not a 1940s movie.

72
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,780
Man, I thought I was coming to do the radio show.

73
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,140
Paul, Paul, what are you doing here?

74
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,500
I don't...

75
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,240
Is that Nancy?

76
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,380
Yeah, I don't...

77
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,320
Nancy Collins?

78
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,540
No, no, no, no.

79
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,500
Nancy, for a good reason.

80
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,300
But, but, and what?

81
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,560
It's a whole orphanage.

82
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,480
Where am I?

83
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:45,880
Where am I?

84
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,200
Dr. Howell?

85
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,780
Is that you?

86
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,900
You're on the island of La Puta.

87
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,300
Let me flap your head.

88
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:50,980
You...

89
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,020
Wait, it's really Dr. Howell?

90
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,900
Right here in the...

91
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,320
But if that's true, then...

92
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,120
There's no slack.

93
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,000
It's a bunch of air.

94
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,620
Oh.

95
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,120
What a thing to say.

96
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,200
There's always slack.

97
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,620
But it's not always air.

98
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,480
Air.

99
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,980
Okay, now it's starting to make more sense.

100
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,500
You see, Doug?

101
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,000
Air?

102
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,520
Wait, what do you mean air?

103
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,340
We're on the air right now.

104
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,360
That was the natural step in evolution

105
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,120
when organisms became aerobic.

106
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,620
And that's what we're doing.

107
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:15,980
Sure.

108
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,960
We're recreating the first moment of air.

109
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,580
That's why...

110
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,000
The first moment on the air.

111
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,180
Millions of years before yesterday,

112
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,480
weird artists walked the Earth.

113
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,900
It started 3,700 million years or so ago

114
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,040
when chemicals were mixing in the sea.

115
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,300
They kept mixing and kept mingling

116
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,720
until they felt a little tingling.

117
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,460
And that tingling was the start of you and me.

118
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,740
Now that stuff called protoplasm

119
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,100
in the early oceans chasm

120
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,440
was the first stuff on our planet that could feel.

121
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,500
And if what it felt was lonely,

122
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,560
it's because it was the only stuff around

123
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,860
that could continue, not congeal.

124
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,980
That was beautiful.

125
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,820
Yes, that stuff, dumb and complacent,

126
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,080
fed on everything adjacent

127
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,600
till a lack of food forced it to rearrange.

128
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,680
Then it learned to die a little

129
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,180
so the rest could have some vittle.

130
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,700
Death was introduced

131
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,600
so future life could change.

132
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,560
And with death came competitions

133
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,360
as life put forth new additions.

134
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,120
Protoplasm learned to mutate to survive.

135
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,360
With this constant rearranging,

136
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,020
great improvement came from changing,

137
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,720
making sure it was the fit

138
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,480
who stayed alive.

139
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,660
And the earth whirled onward,

140
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,360
spinning outward from the first beginning,

141
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,160
piling up millennia upon time's shore.

142
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,220
Living things grew and divided

143
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,940
through the murky deep they glided,

144
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,140
each one slightly different from the one before.

145
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,220
Yet this process we're admiring

146
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,380
counts on countless things expiring,

147
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,400
systematized hideous mortality,

148
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,160
brainless horrors,

149
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,120
swarming, breeding, tearing, chewing,

150
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,440
gulping, feeding, brainless things

151
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,100
who died,

152
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,900
or brainless things can be.

153
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,400
Well,

154
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,020
I did benefit from it, of course.

155
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,140
But so did a whole bunch of old Dallas boys.

156
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,220
But I-

157
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,700
Now wait a minute.

158
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,040
No, you wait a minute.

159
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,200
I love that area.

160
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:07,960
And I-

161
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,040
Well now I show thee signs in the heavens

162
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,180
and signs in the earth.

163
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,960
Blood fountains from the earth.

164
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,320
My light to the-

165
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,900
The sky rebukes me!

166
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,440
The children of heaven

167
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,540
and the angels from hell

168
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,200
are among me,

169
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,040
spreading lies and deception!

170
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,980
What do you mean,

171
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,840
lies and deception?

172
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,320
Why, this is only Reverend Stang and deception.

173
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,900
Lies isn't here except on tape.

174
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,780
Yes, dear friends,

175
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,220
good to be back.

176
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,360
Actually, I was back last week,

177
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,280
but, uh, but, uh,

178
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,220
uh,

179
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,780
I just didn't feel like coming in and doing the show,

180
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,360
you know what I mean?

181
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,380
What luxury.

182
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,400
And it's slack, dear friends.

183
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,700
It is the slack of that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

184
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,040
who forces Willow Dobbs to do it here.

185
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,160
And, uh, you can-

186
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,740
you can actually call the station in the next hour

187
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,400
and find out what's going on.

188
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,680
Uh, we've put together a special show for you tonight.

189
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,300
Uh, completely.

190
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,600
Opposed to some new stuff,

191
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,700
but mostly from the old, uh, sad stuff.

192
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,340
Yes, Media Barrage No. 5.

193
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,520
An old subgenius type,

194
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,660
but uh, it's still just as spry and hard,

195
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,020
as uh, any younger one.

196
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,280
And, uh, you know,

197
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,980
by the same token,

198
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,080
it all stays good, don't it?

199
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,120
Well, no, I guess not, but...

200
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,240
I don't care.

201
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,180
Don't...

202
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,120
don't care a darn...

203
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,460
Oh, no, no.

204
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,300
Really, the subgeniuses are people who have nothing in common

205
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:11,200
except that they have nothing in common with the conspiracy of the normals.

206
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,620
Right.

207
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,800
So that should make perfect sense to everybody.

208
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,240
Well, again, as the book says, if any two are the same,

209
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,680
one must go.

210
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,240
That's too bad.

211
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,580
Sad, sad, but true, yes.

212
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,500
Okay.

213
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,400
We'll call here.

214
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,380
Hello, Jim, you're on 3WE.

215
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,280
Hello, Jim.

216
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,400
Jim went away.

217
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,100
And people will have a number in their hand and in their forehead.

218
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,160
Someone with a lot of energy.

219
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,160
They'll be given a...

220
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,300
Okay, your code number once more.

221
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:42,800
37.

222
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,260
Go by me, Bob, that I may be...

223
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,800
Go by me, that I may be...

224
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,540
Oh, hello.

225
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,760
I'm the subgenius.

226
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,800
His name will be registered in the cash register.

227
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,480
My...

228
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,340
Bob, can you see me?

229
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,760
Subgenius bitch party.

230
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,300
I wanted you so much I couldn't stay in that chair anymore.

231
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,140
I just couldn't.

232
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,420
You saw the evidence.

233
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,580
JR is guilty as hell.

234
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,740
What did you think of it?

235
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,220
And we have another letter from little Alice Limpenshaw.

236
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,000
He's a CUN

237
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,000


238
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,300
Thank you very much.

239
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,660
You're welcome.

240
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,100
I'm happy.

241
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,020
We'll get you off of the bus.

242
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,200
and it's addressed to puzzling evidence,

243
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,700
but since he was weighed in the balance and found wanting...

244
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,720
Now, this little Aaron Horrock says,

245
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,180
Once you're in, you can't get out,

246
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,920
not by any chance, with my simple ears.

247
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,580
Yes, I'm young, but feel those training years.

248
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,700
Perhaps he's referring to the wheel.

249
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,540
Ah, here we are.

250
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,920
Oh, it's the rest of the show. It just came in.

251
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,360
Isn't it, too?

252
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,200
And look at this.

253
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,500
It says here the mud tribes are going to fight the Nazis in the stadium.

254
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,040
Wow, I hope we don't miss out on that.

255
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,280
That could be a really good show.

256
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,920
Yes, and if we're lucky, this could be a really good show, too.

257
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,160
But it says here, why, here's a letter from a little listener.

258
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,480
It seems Reverend Glenn Goulson

259
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,560
called about a videotape to be made,

260
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,820
says he paid $60 pledge and hasn't received.

261
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,320
I loved him up,

262
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,800
says he collected general premiums.

263
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:44,980
Help.

264
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,320
And his number is...

265
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,760
Here it is, Will.

266
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,820
Well, actually, dear friends,

267
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,440
the subgenius videos went out in the mail, what, last week?

268
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,160
Yes, last week.

269
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,800
Actually, not until about Wednesday or Thursday.

270
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,280
It dropped in the mail.

271
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,380
And that should be going to just about everybody

272
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,260
that actually paid up their pledge drives, dear friends.

273
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:09,460
Yes.

274
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:09,700
Yes.

275
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,220
Yes.

276
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:10,300
Yes.

277
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,300


278
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,300


279
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,300


280
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,300


281
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,300


282
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,300


283
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,300


284
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,300


285
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,300


286
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,300


287
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,300


288
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,300


289
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,300


290
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,540
You creep in the little worm set there.

291
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,600
It actually thought you were going to get your tape

292
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,760
without ever paying that pledge.

293
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,120
But nay, ain't going to be happening.

294
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,040
I'm looking at pledge drive performance here.

295
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,560
Log of programs.

296
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,060
Hour of Slack collected $720,000.

297
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,260
Okay, that's fine.

298
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:31,880
That's fine.

299
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,440
What other mail do we have here?

300
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,880
Here's a letter from a listener.

301
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,960
Now, I have not checked these out before.

302
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Dear Kanoan,

303
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,200
no, I have not.

304
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,840
forgotten about you. I just had a few...

305
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,600
Here's...

306
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,280
What? Oh, Gary Benkar.

307
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,340
Okay, and thank you. And what is

308
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,380
our last bit of mail here? Gary Benkar,

309
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,720
we appreciate your...

310
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,340
I do have a tape on the way, I believe.

311
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,660
Yes, Will says...

312
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,580
Seems to think maybe.

313
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,060
And an article

314
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,700
from, obviously, from Dr.

315
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,900
Ranger Rita

316
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,260
on Palmer Rocky.

317
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,240
His great film, Scarlet Love. Thank you.

318
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,400
And

319
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:14,000
Our true size is the size of our

320
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,320
God.

321
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,960
Do you still insist, Exeter,

322
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,980
that we can allow any of these earth

323
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,860
creatures to have free minds?

324
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,700
Oh, yes. Interesting.

325
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,040
Maybe they are

326
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,960
all God's children, like you said,

327
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,000
Reverend. Maybe they are.

328
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,800
It would be unconvincing

329
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,900
before I believe you are the man.

330
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,100
The man that our church

331
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,020
wants preaching at us every

332
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,360
Sunday.

333
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,460
My mind is my own and nobody's going to change it.

334
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,020
I'm not going into that room.

335
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,160
Nobody is. Come on.

336
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,000
Break out of that glass box.

337
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,260
And join

338
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,060
the church of the

339
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:55,780
subgenius.

340
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,460
101 degrees.

341
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,340
The Lord knows that

342
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,000
within five

343
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,420
years, the United States, as we know it,

344
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,680
will cease to exist.

345
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,360
We're living in terrible periods.

346
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,200
Fearless. Chaotic

347
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,800
times.

348
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,240
Praise the Lord. And these times

349
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,360
are not going to get any better, my friend.

350
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:17,700
Amen.

351
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,240
They're going to get worse and worse.

352
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,560
What?

353
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,280
Okay, I knew you all think

354
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,400
you want to know

355
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,000
what's going on.

356
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,220
And that's okay.

357
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,700
So I saw this thing coming.

358
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,600
I saw this thing coming to me.

359
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,740
I didn't know what it was, but

360
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,940
it looked funny.

361
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,380
Oh, the one who sent the new messiah.

362
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,380
He's the one who grins and smokes the pipe.

363
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,900
For in a world of darkness, danger, and despair,

364
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,420
we can go on smiling,

365
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,380
because we know that Bob Dockery,

366
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,540
Bob's is always there.

367
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,060
And I know that Bob's on my side.

368
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,980
I know it as sure as I'm born.

369
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,460
He will make the proper deal

370
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,220
with the exes' whore.

371
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Then we'll come to meet him,

372
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,800
and we'll greet him,

373
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,700
and rule forevermore.

374
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,980
Bob is my one true savior.

375
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,120
You can't keep all of the rest.

376
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,620
Looking at his smiling face

377
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,220
helps me when I'm depressed.

378
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,760
For the pinks, I sure feel sorry.

379
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,360
For Damari, he's a good friend.

380
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,320
And he'll fry with all the rest.

381
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,220
Clever deceptions,

382
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,620
which have surrounded our space program.

383
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,180
Perhaps this is as good a time as any

384
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,300
to take a few minutes to repeat a message

385
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,220
that seems frequently lost

386
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,780
in the hustle and bustle of our daily activity.

387
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,560
Soon Bob will have thousands of followers,

388
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,160
and maybe it'll be okay, because...

389
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,300
Do you remember where I told you that Joe was in his house?

390
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,880
Remember where Bob is?

391
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,060
That Joe was in his house.

392
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,980
Bob is in the old box.

393
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,840
Oh, yeah.

394
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,180
14-03-06.

395
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,120
The final section!

396
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,380
Stand by to watch.

397
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,900
Stand by to watch.

398
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,960
Stand by to watch.

399
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,280
Once they join up,

400
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,180
we're able to get them off

401
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,040
to one of our subgenius retreats,

402
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,940
change their diet,

403
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,020
start feeding them propaganda,

404
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,240
repeating the same thing over and over again

405
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,640
until they forget who they are,

406
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,260
and start responding only to our dogma.

407
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,120
I'm sorry.

408
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,480
I'd hoped to have prepared you somewhat beforehand.

409
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,020
This is a mutant.

410
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,020
We've been breeding them here for ages

411
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,880
to do menial work.

412
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,960
Well, actually, they're similar to some of the insect life

413
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,740
on your own planet.

414
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,680
Larger, of course, with a higher degree of intelligence.

415
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,300
This one has been given orders to guard this corridor

416
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,000
as long as we're here.

417
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,820
I beg of you, go inside.

418
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,440
Cooperate voluntarily.

419
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,900
If you do, I give you my word that you will not be harmed

420
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,240
or your minds changed in any way.

421
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,880
You defy the monitor.

422
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,020
I already have.

423
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,700
Do you believe in Cal?

424
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,140
In this place, I wouldn't believe my grandmother.

425
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,140
I'm not a fool.

426
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:10,740
Wait a minute.

427
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,040
No, you wait a minute.

428
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,960
I love that area, and I...

429
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,500
No, they still like Bob.

430
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,440
Bob's got no real brain to speak of

431
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,140
Though his luck has seen him through the lack

432
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,520
For all the geniuses led us down the wrong track

433
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,920
Least we know a subgenius won't turn around

434
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,040
And stab us in the back

435
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,960
The conflicts they have us in

436
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,460
Are suckered

437
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,220
But I know that that is a lie

438
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,800
They're due for a big surprise

439
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,660
From demons from the sky

440
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,160
Makes me so glad I wised up

441
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,240
Got it sized up

442
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,100
Hell, I'm a lucky guy

443
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,220
The show's easy.

444
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,540
It's as easy as learning how to fall off a bicycle

445
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,280
after the first time you...

446
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,880
That's easy for you to say, Hal, with your normal voice.

447
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,500
Hold on to that.

448
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,980
It's my abnormal and maladjusted voice.

449
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,260
Tell me when you want me to fire up the valve, Big Bill.

450
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,180
Oh, there it goes.

451
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,600
No, that's my lung!

452
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:07,800
Stop!

453
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,820
The demons of Mother Nature

454
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,480
One look at them will tell you more

455
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,880
Than a thousand words of mine

456
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,160
Here they are

457
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,880
All real

458
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,700
All true

459
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,540
The cutest of them all

460
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,100
Our little tiny midget bulls

461
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,780
See them all

462
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,480
Right here

463
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,260
Pretty loose

464
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,280
Actually two cows into one body

465
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,600
A fifth leg right out of a rear end

466
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,520
Come now and see them here

467
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,500
Here they are

468
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,500
Strange mistakes of Mother Nature

469
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,960
One look at them will tell you more

470
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,460
Than a thousand words of mine

471
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,420
When they write their first chapter,

472
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:04,980
They'll be a little more than a hundred

473
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,320
To the subgenius foundation

474
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,300
That's when their luck begins to change,

475
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,160
Their finances improve, and that kind of thing.

476
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,220
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere

477
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,740
Where are you leading us, Bob?

478
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,040
Is he...

479
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,360
And where is Bob leading them?

480
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,380
Right now it acts like it's gonna make me rich.

481
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,100
Bob's my friend and he's leading me somewhere

482
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,400
Where are you leading them?

483
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,200
Kelly Lane, Channel 4 News, Dallas.

484
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,660
As the song says, different strokes for different folks.

485
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,380
Doug's been standing out in the sun too long, I think.

486
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,900
It certainly wouldn't surprise me.

487
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:45,820
Hmm.

488
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,900
Well, Bob does not summon the UFOs, he makes deals with them.

489
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:51,740
Ah.

490
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,200
And he is like your broker here on Earth.

491
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,980
You can have a broker with the UFOs

492
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,040
if you will follow the teachings of Bob Dock.

493
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,840
And pay your tithe to his mighty church.

494
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,520
Mm-hmm.

495
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,460
Not necessarily in that order.

496
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,340
No, first pay the tithe and then all the rest.

497
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:14,760
Right.

498
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,740
All right, I appreciate that, Cole.

499
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,780
We're gonna take a short break here,

500
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,020
We'll find out what's happening in the news,

501
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,860
And then we will continue our discussion,

502
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,720
Examining the Church of the Subgenius,

503
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,040
With Ivan Stang, who is the holy scribe of the church,

504
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,380
And Pope Jimbo of Cleveland.

505
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,020
Bob, Rob, and I are here today,

506
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,660
Home of troops.

507
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,240
And the 5th of December,

508
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,100
Have nopuyzomethy in heaven's ayy,

509
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,260
That do the full church's work,

510
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,000
Tonight I will wash theition at my dash,

511
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,160
Thanks from the whole Christian community,

512
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,360
I America.

513
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:56,360


514
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:56,520
I'll collected everyone,

515
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,600
And give them the cup of my holy нап eight million,

516
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:58,620


517
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,200
Why, God loves me too.

518
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:01,240
Ciao.

519
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,660
tell you all the voices you keep hearing in and out of the tapes here, and of course I can't,

520
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,500
you'd pretty much have to see the log of Media Barrage number five, but I can say that

521
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:20,940
certainly thanks are due to the puzzling evidence Dr. Howell, Gary Grobefran, and in this case,

522
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:31,440
Lies show, actually recorded me last weekend, Saturday at 4.30 in the morning, and yes,

523
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:44,240
Nancy, Regalia, Lies, Paul Marvides, Dr. Howell, all them puzzling evidences there,

524
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,240
doing that terrible show in Berkeley, and I must also thank those who have

525
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,920
accomplished this show, and I thank you all for being here, and I thank you all for being here,

526
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:50,920


527
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:59,560
and according to this Pledge Drive performance sheet of 1980 here, all those of you who have made

528
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:04,780
the Hour of Slack, yes, the number two of the top ten shows.

529
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:13,020
All in one place, they're waiting up to their knees in blood, but it's the blood of the baptism

530
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:20,140
of the mighty fist face of Bob, the face that can pile through eight foot,

531
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:28,400
thick titanium steel conspiracy Fort Knox doors, the face that can burn through metal with that

532
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,060
mighty pipe.

533
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,720
This won't make too much sense.

534
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,500
I have suddenly realized within the last few years, it's more of a not what you know and what you do,

535
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,400
but who you know game.

536
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:48,100
Because we need more girls in the church, and bring your rich fathers, and we'll convince them that we're not really that weird,

537
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,400
and we can get some money.

538
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,040
The smell of success is never too sweet.

539
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,440
We can help you out.

540
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,480
I think we're being sold a bill, a big bill of goods.

541
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,580
And you can be with Bob and be listening to the teachings that come through, and I tell you, friends,

542
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:14,880
if you can just get that, if you can just pull out that wallet, pull it out of your pocket, pull it out of your purse.

543
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,940
Lay your hands on the radio, lay your hands on the radio, man, to home.

544
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,020
I got them.

545
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,820
Big old Bob.

546
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,340
I got a big old Bob.

547
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,380
He's right inside my pocket.

548
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,140
Got my big old Bob.

549
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,140
Just reach inside my pocket.

550
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,900
I just washed him off.

551
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,100
He ain't too stinky this time.

552
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,560
You got to try my Bob.

553
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,840
He really wants to meet you.

554
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,380
azzi

555
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,540
The burning seat of Bob is leaking out of my pocket.

556
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,400
Just open unto him, and he'll crawl inside your socket.

557
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,120
Just open unto him, and he'll crawl inside your socket.

558
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:39,960
If you still want my Bob, but you ain't got a socket, you can still get Bob.

559
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,040
Just open up your wallet.

560
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,840
Just open up your wallet.

561
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,800
Just open up your wallet.

562
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,340
I think we're being sold a bill, a big bill of goods.

563
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,240
A mockery of everything that's decent and wholesome.

564
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:59,000
And I challenge you to point out national talk shows that do not belittle sexual fidelity, purity.

565
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,360
That they do not belittle the marriage union and the family lifestyle.

566
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,500
That they don't literally flaunt illicit lifestyles.

567
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,300
I mean, I challenge you to show me a talk show that doesn't make light of God.

568
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,300
The Subgenius Foundation.

569
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,100
The Reverend Ivan Stang.

570
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,240
And Dr. Philo Drummond.

571
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:19,600
Yeah!

572
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,640
I love the drum.

573
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,860
Moaning, bitching, and kvetching.

574
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,020
My headphones.

575
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,080
My headphones.

576
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:47,820
They don't seem to be...

577
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,320
Wow, someone sent us a check.

578
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,940
Someone sent Puzzling Evidence a check for 50 smackers.

579
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,340
Well, I'm going to have to turn this over to the...

580
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,420
Well, since there's money involved, no wonder he walked back into the room.

581
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,480
He was just waiting.

582
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,440
He saw Dr. Howell open that letter with a check.

583
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,860
Check for 50 bucks in here.

584
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,120
By the way, while we're setting up and changing hands...

585
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,060
And watching Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence start to fight with each other like they normally do as you enjoy on the show.

586
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,080
I think...

587
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,640
Oh, you think you're so smart?

588
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:28,080
Since I, Reverend Ivan Stang, am here this one time this year, I might as well actually impart some hard information.

589
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,420
And I'm...

590
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:36,860
Well, there's some things that the dues-paying Subgenius members out there have probably been wondering about.

591
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,020
Answers which only I can provide.

592
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,160
And for instance...

593
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,340
Where does our $20 go, Dr. Stang?

594
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,480
Well, that's...

595
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,420
Exactly the main question.

596
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,540
Let's look at the Subgenius pie and see how it's cut up.

597
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,480
Well, last Tuesday...

598
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,300
It's all sticky and icky.

599
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,280
Last Tuesday...

600
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,180
I don't like the looks of it.

601
00:24:59,380 --> 00:24:59,900
The...

602
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,640
I didn't do it either.

603
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,320
Now, quit doing show.

604
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,300
They need to hear this.

605
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,440
This is important.

606
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,420
Let's not let show interfere with show.

607
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,180
That's right.

608
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,860
Eat this Billius pie on Monday, and if it's Tuesday, you must be belching.

609
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:14,580
Okay.

610
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,040
Wah, wah.

611
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,040


612
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,020
Wee, wee, wee.

613
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,240
See, I've learned all the...

614
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,040
Okay.

615
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,860
All the casinoises.

616
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,700
Anyway, not to distract you, but...

617
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,200
Just to let you know what's been going on with the church headquarters in Dallas.

618
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,120
I know that many of you have...

619
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,240
Get it? Church headquarters?

620
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:36,560
Many of you have felt a certain slight lack of a Bob in the mail waves over the last...

621
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,160
What do you mean?

622
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,560
He's all mail, Doctor.

623
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:38,860
Years.

624
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,660
He's all man, that Bob.

625
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,920
And the...

626
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,900
I would like people to know that Tuesday...

627
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,620
This week, myself and Will of Dobbs...

628
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:54,280
Actually, Will O. Dobbs, the only paid subgenius...

629
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:03,360
And my boss carried 4,000 copies of the Stark Fist of Removal magazine.

630
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,200
It's a couple of weeks late, I'll admit.

631
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,440
But we carted it down to the Bulk Mail Center in Dallas, Texas.

632
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,140
It took a while.

633
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,760
They had to move those from the basement at Stang's Fortress of Solicitude there.

634
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,300
Outside the city of Dallas.

635
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,800
Now, if you believe these pathetic excuses...

636
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,560
They actually did enter the Bulk Mail system.

637
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:31,800
I know that some packages arrived at the homes of members in Dallas just as I was leaving on Friday morning.

638
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:37,560
But owing to the constipation of U.S. mail, they weren't squeezed out until too late.

639
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,500
Well, it's never too late.

640
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,020
Because what really are they going to do in between times?

641
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,020
Pastor Stang, I had someone call...

642
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,620
He called me up the last time we did our broadcast.

643
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,800
And he asked about the Stark Fist of Removal.

644
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,180
I started to describe the copy I had in front of me.

645
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,580
And he called me a liar.

646
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,400
He didn't believe that such a thing existed.

647
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:10,520
Well, I didn't either until I actually saw those 61 sacks addressed to states and individual zip codes and cities going out and wrote that check for $900,000.

648
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,400
Which will take those self-same magazines into the hands of...

649
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,940
Those believers who, yes, have waited.

650
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,220
Of course, if your address is changed...

651
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,320
You've waited and you've believed.

652
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,340
But it hasn't done you any good.

653
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,180
Because now, at last, the show is starting.

654
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,760
This, guys and gals, cats and chicks, it's the subgenius show that you know and love.

655
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,580
Starting up again.

656
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,240
And with our special guests, Lies and Reverend Nancy Regalia.

657
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,600
And, of course, myself, Reverend Ivan Stang.

658
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,860
Not to mention the doctor and Allison.

659
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:45,740
Yes.

660
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,900
The doctors are here again, ready to operate without warning on anyone they see.

661
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:58,520
Sharpening their scalpels on this sidewalk of life to operate on the roadway of your brain.

662
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:06,960
Yes, we like to separate the front and the back half of the brain and end what we call operating from the backside of the brain.

663
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,880
The hind brain or buttocks area.

664
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:15,720
The two spheres of the brain toward the rear deal with the subgenius element.

665
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,360
The mind.

666
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,640
Though we don't recommend it, you can do this operation at home.

667
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:23,200
Oh, yes, and he ain't got superpowers.

668
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,140
He ain't from another planet.

669
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:31,360
He ain't something that we have to bow down and kiss to.

670
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,400
You can pull Bob's leg and Bob will chuckle right along with you.

671
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:41,160
Because Bob's been a fool just like you or me.

672
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,780
He's been a pathetic fool.

673
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,840
And I tell you, friends.

674
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,300
J.R. Bob Dobbs will be a fool again.

675
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,920
He's a fool today.

676
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,460
He's a fool tomorrow.

677
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,380
He's the same Bob.

678
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,700
The same Bob.

679
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,360
He's always the same Bob.

680
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,120
And he's working for you and me.

681
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,380
No, wait a minute.

682
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,700
No, you wait a minute.

683
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,860
I love that area.

684
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:03,580
And I'm...

685
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,560
...mouth and carry on the way he did 2,000 years ago.

686
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,600
They'd not only crucify him again, but we'd probably see it on TV.

687
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,200
I respectfully disagree with that.

688
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,060
The Church of the Subgenius.

689
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,660
With the Holy Scribe of the Church, Ivan Stang, and Pope Jimbo of Cleveland.

690
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,020
And right back to our telephones.

691
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,160
Hello, Carl. You're on 3WE.

692
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:31,700
Yeah, I'm sure since you're an aboveboard host, you told your guests that you're ineligible to be a member of this group, uh, religion because of mesna.

693
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:32,720
Mesna.

694
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:33,640
Mensa.

695
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,360
Mensa.

696
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:34,720
Whatever.

697
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,460
See, that's why I'm not a member.

698
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,640
I'll tell you precisely how I got around that.

699
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,200
Okay?

700
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,100
I had a meeting with Pope Jimbo last night.

701
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,200
And I did indeed join the Church.

702
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,040
Uh...

703
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,800
But I plan to leave it before the check is cleared.

704
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,160
Oh, I see.

705
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,260
Oh, gee! That's great to know there, Bob!

706
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,180
I'll let the check go through.

707
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,100
But I'm just gonna have a schism.

708
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,120
Oh, okay.

709
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,140
Uh, now...

710
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:07,220
I think he isn't going back far enough because to me it sounds like kind of a combination of Jonathan Swift and Ayn Rand.

711
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,000
I mean...

712
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,140
Putting those two together is just about...

713
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,460
Uh...

714
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,320
Name this religion, wouldn't it?

715
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,180
There's a philosophy?

716
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,940
Well, I suppose there are many contributors.

717
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,160
Well, I would think if you...

718
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,740
I mean, Bob stole from everybody, didn't he, Ivan?

719
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,900
Bob Dobbs, um, took the best from many dead religions and sewed them together in sort of a...

720
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:37,260
A monster of dead religions that stands up...

721
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,960
You know, you put a lightning bolt charge to it and the thing comes to life.

722
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,500
It's frightening.

723
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:48,360
But what we're afraid of is that it's gonna destroy its makers in the great Frankenstein tradition.

724
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,200
You know, Poop Dog.

725
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,880
The Poop Dog hat.

726
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,760
The Poop Dog hat.

727
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,900
What about the Poop Dog hat?

728
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,100
You know, the Poop Dog hat.

729
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,020
What about the Poop Dog hat?

730
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,640
Who?

731
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,100
Bob?

732
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,380
Who owns the hat?

733
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,900
Well, everybody.

734
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,000
Oh, I don't own it.

735
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,760
I've never owned the hat.

736
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,720
The Poop Dog hat.

737
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,000
It's just the Poop Dog hat.

738
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,600
It's not like...

739
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:05,980
Certainly.

740
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,180
Everybody wanted it.

741
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,260
Nobody owned it.

742
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,440
That was the problem.

743
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,140
Until Bob.

744
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,660
Until finally Bob invented the concept of ownership.

745
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,980
Right, right, exactly.

746
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,380
Exactly.

747
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,560
We thought of owning the Poop Dog hat.

748
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:17,840
That's right.

749
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,920
And we wore it.

750
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,440
See, that's the problem.

751
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,080
The rest of us wore the Poop Dog hat.

752
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,440
It was a great idea on Bob's part.

753
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,000
But really, we were just sort of following along.

754
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:27,580
Yeah.

755
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,500
I think so.

756
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,260
I'm not talking about sex.

757
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,200
If you don't already know about sex, you're in the wrong church, friend.

758
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,940
Go to one of them non-industrial churches.

759
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,280
If you're afraid of sex, they'll just...

760
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,060
You're mine.

761
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,780
Everyone here should be experts in intercourse.

762
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,420
But we don't want your mind, friend.

763
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,280
Here at the Church of the Subgenius, our hands are big enough as it is.

764
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,800
No, what we want is your money.

765
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,080
And we don't want your money for ourselves.

766
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,140
No, no, no.

767
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,760
We want it so that you won't.

768
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,180
That's right, friend.

769
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,460
There's nothing wrong with having money.

770
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,740
J.R. Bob Dob's very own words said,

771
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,600
In money we trust.

772
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,180
No, friends.

773
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,820
The problem is wanting money.

774
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,300
Like the good book he says,

775
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,420
The love of money is the root to all slackness.

776
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,140
See, a lot of folks think the saying is,

777
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,940
Money is the root.

778
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,800
But that's just disinformation, friends,

779
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,780
put out by the conspiracy in order to confuse you.

780
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,860
It's the love of money that loses you slack.

781
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,420
And believe me, if there's one subject in the conspiracy wants to confuse you with,

782
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,580
It's the desire for money.

783
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:46,640
Because it's that desire for cash that fuels the conspiracy and enslaves 99.9% of the human race.

784
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,080
And yes, even a few unwary subgenius.

785
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,900
You get so wrapped up chasing those pieces of paper around,

786
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,700
That you're too busy to see the conspiracy has got you wrapped around its little finger, heart, body and soul.

787
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,000
You're so busy working for money that you forgot money is supposed to work for you.

788
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,760
And that's the good news, friends.

789
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,700
There is a way out of the rat race.

790
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,880
Through the conspiracy money made.

791
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,380
There is a key, there is an answer.

792
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,500
And J.R. Bob Dobbs has often thought aloud,

793
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,840
Life is a game.

794
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,400
And you can play by their rules or you can play by your own rules.

795
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,660
But if you play by your own rules, friends,

796
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,540
You can always get away with cheating.

797
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,780
That's right.

798
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,400
See, the conspiracy has got you going around that monopoly board.

799
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,500
In circles.

800
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,780
Hoping to pass gold and collect that lousy $200.

801
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,940
You're just trying to last until the end of the week, friends.

802
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,580
Trying to collect that chintzy little ass paycheck.

803
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,840
Praying all the while not to land on someone else's property.

804
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,040
Especially if they have hotels.

805
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,760
Yes, sir.

806
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,160
After that happens a few times, it's game over now, isn't it?

807
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,620
That's because they've got you playing by their rules.

808
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,140
But why not make up a few of your own rules, friends?

809
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,580
It's only fair.

810
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,800
Why should the conspiracy get to monopolize all the laws?

811
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,300
It's supposed to be a democracy.

812
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,980
Hell, you already got free parking now, friends.

813
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,200
What does that tell you?

814
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,240
And we know how good it feels to land on that free parking now, don't we?

815
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,840
When you collect that big pot of money in the middle.

816
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,080
Yes, sirree.

817
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:31,060
But do you think they, the conspiracy, would let you enjoy that little bit of slack deliberately?

818
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,440
Hell no!

819
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,400
It was J.R. Bob Dobbs' idea.

820
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,400
Expressly forbid the property.

821
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,700
And they're a rule book.

822
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,620
I kid you not.

823
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,040
Look it up if you doubt it.

824
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:45,060
You know what they, the conspiracy, say should happen when you land on free parking?

825
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,160
Nothing.

826
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,600
Nothing at all.

827
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:48,700
That's right.

828
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,460
It's just supposed to be free parking.

829
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,800
Like a day of rest, Sunday, to pacify you.

830
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,240
So you'll calm down and then go around the board for another week.

831
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,200
Well, friends, that's not good enough now, is it?

832
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,560
Hell no.

833
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,560
That's not how Bob Dobbs plays the game.

834
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,360
And that's not how you have to play it either.

835
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,180
But some of you out there are probably wondering, and you're thinking aloud,

836
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,100
Father Joe Mama, how come Bob's changed that rule for us, but he hasn't changed the other rules?

837
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,800
Well, friends, I'm glad you asked that.

838
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,640
Because Bob wants you to think for yourself.

839
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:25,120
He doesn't want to rule your lives, but he doesn't want the conspiracy to rule it either.

840
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,240
He wants you to rule your own life.

841
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,360
And that's why he's giving you a hand instead of a handout.

842
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,780
Like Bob Dobbs said many a time,

843
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,160
you can lead a man to slack, but you can't make him use it.

844
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,580
He doesn't want to lease you slack.

845
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,760
He wants you to own your very own.

846
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,280
The next rule to break is up to you.

847
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,080
Imagine the possibilities.

848
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,640
Why not agree that when you land on someone else's property,

849
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,440
you give each other slack?

850
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,260
No fees, no fines, just good neighborly hospitality.

851
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,720
Or better yet, make the state pay the fee and abolish taxes while you're at it.

852
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,800
You can do it, friends.

853
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,480
You make the rules.

854
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,380
Remember free parking?

855
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,560
The possibilities are endless.

856
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,040
Now instead of trading going around the block,

857
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,220
you're actually looking forward to it.

858
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,480
Now you're having fun with the game instead of the game having fun with you.

859
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:24,500
Now instead of minding the masters, you've become master of your own mind.

860
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,580
Now instead of being a board player, you're chairman of the board.

861
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,760
Now every time is your move.

862
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,480
Now you're using the money instead of the money using you.

863
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,100
Bob turned around all this a long, long time ago, friends.

864
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,740
He also learned that it takes money to make money.

865
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,240
That's exactly what he wants to do now.

866
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,060
Take your money so that you can make more of it.

867
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,200
Show the conspiracy that they no longer have charge of your charge card.

868
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,000
Take it out.

869
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,380
Take it out of your wallet right now and cut it in half.

870
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,680
Send it to us, friends.

871
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,280
Be sure to include both halves.

872
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,440
And also avoid cutting it vertically there.

873
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,200
You don't want to damage the man next strike.

874
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,400
We'll burn that sucker for you.

875
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,300
I promise.

876
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,020
Or better yet, just send us cold hard cash.

877
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,260
Or sign checks.

878
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,760
We'll even fill them out for you.

879
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,280
Hell, we don't care about the money.

880
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,640
You think we'd be the first church to pay taxes if we cared about money?

881
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,120
No.

882
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,920
We only want to show the conspiracy you don't care about money.

883
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,760
In fact, I'll personally make sure that money is not spent on anything.

884
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,780
That number is on your screen.

885
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,660
Send that money in and praise Bob, baby.

886
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,460
Yeah, well, you know, as soon as everyone on the phone,

887
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,740
the planet starts getting behind Bob, you know, all the Bobbies and the Gimme Bobs,

888
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,140
and it gets to be really a hip religion.

889
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,360
Well, Bob will just sell it to the best, highest bidder and just get into something new anyway.

890
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,120
Probably Japanese.

891
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,520
Well, it wouldn't be any good.

892
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,920
It wouldn't be any good if there's too many members, though.

893
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,080
Oh, of course not.

894
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,320
No.

895
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:57,320
All right, but by that time, we would have made enough money that we would be able to drop out of sight

896
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:03,360
and let the church take another name, you know, change names and change disguises like it's been doing.

897
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,800
That's what we've been doing for the last 2,000 years.

898
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,460
Oh, okay.

899
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:11,340
Well, I just thought maybe Jonathan Swift and Anne Rand put together might have been your guiding light there.

900
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,260
Oh, actually, they probably did.

901
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,760
You'd have to put that to Bob.

902
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,620
Put that question to Bob.

903
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:24,980
If it wasn't in Colorado, you'd have it, you know, along with Congress.

904
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,000
Well, Congress is definitely a center.

905
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,840
I'm not sure of what.

906
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:36,620
Well, insanity and subgenius, you know.

907
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,120
Bob?

908
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,060
Yes?

909
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,480
I noticed that your friend Pete Franklin there was discussing the Cleveland Indians,

910
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,400
and he said that football reality begins this weekend.

911
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:55,340
And I took note of that, and I thought, you know, that guy must be a real subgenius

912
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:00,820
because a subgenius allows his reality to begin each weekend.

913
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:11,100
And, you know, really, you have your own reality, but the weekend is really the best place to start it out.

914
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:18,500
So, you know, I kind of admire that particular undeclared subgenius.

915
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:27,420
Well, I'll make sure, I'll certainly make sure that Pete gets the necessary literature here so that he can be attracted to this definite center of learning.

916
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,020
Okay.

917
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,040
We'll take another break.

918
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,800
We'll find out what's happening in traffic, and then we'll get right back to our discussion about the Church of the Subgenius.

919
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,160
Stand by.

920
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,740
We are going to explain the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

921
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,280
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer, he is the one for me.

922
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,940
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer, he is the one for me.

923
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,340
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer, he is the one for me.

924
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:00,020
The relating of spiritual declension is never a pretty sight or a pretty sight.

925
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:00,560
It's a pretty picture.

926
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:07,640
Continuing our discussion of the Church of the Subgenius on 3WE, stand by the explanation of the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

927
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,720
Hi, this is Craig DeLaw.

928
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,500
What's happening in traffic?

929
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,400
Here's Cassandra DeLaw.

930
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,760
I'm talking about the Church of the Subgenius, the Holy Scribe, Ivan Stempo of Cleveland.

931
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,740
And before we do run out of time, Ivan, I will have to ask you how this whole thing came about.

932
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:29,400
Was I would be talking about something like the elections in South Africa or a local political race or some such thing, and somebody would say, well, it all has to do with the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

933
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,480
Well, what doesn't?

934
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,560
Well, that's, let's see, I have to get the explanation.

935
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,020
Now, do you want to let that cat out of the bag and explain to people what that means?

936
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:46,600
Well, as the Hell's Angels once said, those who say don't know and those who know don't say, which makes me wonder why they said it to begin with.

937
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:54,400
But the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer is a sacred object in the Church of the Subgenius.

938
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,900
In fact, it transcends.

939
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,380
And really, it's sacred.

940
00:40:59,380 --> 00:40:59,380


941
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,860
It's far more important than most of the other elements of the Church.

942
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:13,620
You've seen the Arnold Palmer on Penn's local commercial and so forth.

943
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,480
The old tractor, yeah.

944
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:26,400
Well, he's a satanic imitation of the true bleeding head of Arnold Palmer, the decapitated head of the World Cup golfer, which is launched by the Church of the Subgenius.

945
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,840
Every equinox.

946
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:35,680
It's like clockwork and heals those who it passes over.

947
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,180
The people, well, occasionally it doesn't exactly heal them.

948
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,840
It kind of mutates them a bit.

949
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:48,680
But for the most part, it's a pretty beneficial supernatural object.

950
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,280
And it continues the Earth on its axis.

951
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,820
It absolutely, without the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer, this planet would stop.

952
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:07,980
It would spin off into space like the wildly rotating eye of a cow's head kept alive in a laboratory dish.

953
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,860
Bleeding head good, healed head bad.

954
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:11,560
Praise Bob.

955
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,440
Praise Bob.

956
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,440
I mean, listen.

957
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:27,500
There are people out there who would take a hockey puck and try to launch a bleeding toenail of Lee Trevino.

958
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:34,420
I mean, there are so many blasphemous extrapolations from this thing.

959
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,060
It's kind of sickening, really.

960
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:42,460
And as far as I'm concerned, anybody who wants to mess with the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer, they can back off my green, man.

961
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:49,580
I mean, you know, either you get it or you don't.

962
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,000
But this is a nonviolent religion.

963
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,100
Oh, absolutely.

964
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,360
We would not...

965
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,280
I mean, why fight over it when you can buy it?

966
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,080
Exactly.

967
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,860
Praise Bob.

968
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,560
Praise Bob.

969
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:05,460
Let us buy rather than conquer.

970
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,740
We'll conquer and buy both.

971
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,260
Why not?

972
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:08,780
Okay.

973
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:09,940
All right.

974
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:14,560
People, I'm sure, are going to come flocking to the church because...

975
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,720
You're living Jesus.

976
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,160
You're living Jesus.

977
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,040
You're living Jesus.

978
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,800
You're living Jesus.

979
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,760
You're living Jesus.

980
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,260
You're living Jesus.

981
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,480
The relating of spiritual declension is...

982
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:42,460
Because as foolish as Bob gets, as foolish as Bob gets, it's the wisdom of the ages.

983
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:52,560
It's the foolishness and the idiocy that has kept man from being satisfied with his lot in life.

984
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,720
It is that stupidity which is...

985
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:02,560
It is that stupidity which has caused man to build his great monuments, his mighty gas-powered engines and his nuclear reactors.

986
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:12,200
It is that which has given man his urge to master the entire Earth, no matter how nice it was before.

987
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:23,460
It is this mighty, sacred archetype of an urge that's in Bob and in all of us that makes us want to smite our brothers.

988
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,700
And from this...

989
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:28,520
And from this, my friends, if it weren't for that, where would us subgeniuses be?

990
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,660
We'd be like everybody else.

991
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,120
We'd be no different.

992
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,480
We'd have nothing to gripe about.

993
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:45,820
And without the mighty gripe power and the mighty hate, the hate for the normal that we can feed,

994
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:51,280
the hate that can make us go out and earn something for nothing,

995
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,680
the hate that will make us over-gain,

996
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:04,760
the hate that will overcome every last conspiracy attempt to hold us down that there's ever been.

997
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:12,180
In the long run, we may stay poor and broke, we may stay neurotic, or whatever we started out as,

998
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:17,360
or whatever we may fall into, but by God, we've got Bob and they ain't.

999
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:22,200
And for that, we can hate them! Hate them! Hate them!

1000
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,180
Call us and talk about what you'd wish. Go ahead.

1001
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:29,980
I might point out that a lot of people worry about the one-world government that the conspiracy is trying to get across on us,

1002
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:35,960
and we suspect that the only thing that can fight a one-world government is going to be a one-world religion.

1003
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,820
And of course, that's what the subgenius, the church of the subgenius is here for.

1004
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:46,760
All other gods besides Jehovah and his son Jesus Christ are strange gods.

1005
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:49,580
Sir, we absolutely believe in everything.

1006
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:52,300
We believe in it wholeheartedly.

1007
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,880
Oh, yeah, I was here on the last tape.

1008
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,300
This is where the little people come out and take your wallet.

1009
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,540
Oh, well, I didn't have much in my wallet that year anyway.

1010
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:41,220
But I tried. My family knows I tried. They imported all of their insides to this side of the nation. And you know what happened? The bottom fell out on them. Yep. It was coming across the Great Divide and the bottom fell right out on them.

1011
00:46:41,220 --> 00:47:02,660
It was like Death Valley in 81. Clogged up and choked up. They elected to stay in a burned out motel south of Icewater. Well, they were flying over Armpit. Yeah, that was that place. And the bottom fell out again.

1012
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:11,200
But this time, because they had that previous experience, they were able to use their survival guide in such a way to as not fall.

1013
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:24,980
Not to as hurt anybody. As you can see here in this slide, as they arrived at the Kewater International Airport with the entire party intact except for the dog who was eaten three days out.

1014
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:32,620
Again, Matt. And do you know what happened? And do you know what happened?

1015
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,600
This won't make too much sense, but it's not intended to.

1016
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,100
Well, I'm afraid of God.

1017
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,200
I'll tell you what, if you would, put your hands...

1018
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,420
Put your hands on the radio right now.

1019
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,500
Put your hands, put your hands on the radio.

1020
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,860
I'll tell you what you don't need too much of, and that's the word of Bob.

1021
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:58,460
Ten years from now, our pamphlets will take the place of federal reserve currency.

1022
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,060
That's what it might be.

1023
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:11,000
You can get those pieces of paper that Bob sent from P.O. Box. I'm going to read that number again to you folks. P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1024
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:11,200
P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1025
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:11,200


1026
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:11,200


1027
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,520
You can leave off the zip code, but send that dollar.

1028
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:17,100
God put money in that empty purse. Don't ever let it be broke again.

1029
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,160
You do what you do because you want to.

1030
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,300
I do what I do because...

1031
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,340
Because Bob...

1032
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,560
Bob told me to!

1033
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,140
Ah!

1034
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,460
I was...

1035
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,780
Get out of the car!

1036
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:40,860
They'll also tell us about the mysterious J.R. Bob Dobbs, who, as I understand it again, is the high muckety-muck of the Church of the Subgenius.

1037
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,420
Hello Bob!

1038
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,260
I'm serious, man, and I've got a question for Mr. Ivan Stang, please.

1039
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:48,620
I'm not surprised.

1040
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:57,900
Now, just put this question in perspective. Listen, Paul, you've got your two Germanys over there forging up some kind of ironclad prosperity pact.

1041
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,060
We already settled this problem earlier this evening.

1042
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:08,080
According to Garbatov, who came up over there in the Eastern Bloc, you've got your twelve-headed economic conspiracy...

1043
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:10,600
Your twelve-headed Michael Pippes? I know, we already solved that problem, didn't we?

1044
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:10,840
Shave it up over there in the Eastern Bloc. You've got your twelve-headed economic conspiracy... You're twelve-headed Michael Pippes? I know, we already solved that problem, didn't we?

1045
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,860
Shave it up over there in the Western Bloc. You've got your... We solved all the world's problems at 8 o'clock.

1046
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,080
Your Japanese over here...

1047
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:20,580
The twelve-headed octopus conspiracy of Western thought threatens to dominate the world.

1048
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:25,100
And we all know that, and those fifteen subgenius pamphlets that were smuggled into the Soviet Union only a decade ago.

1049
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,340
Look at the effect they've had.

1050
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,460
But, enough of that. What was the rest of your question?

1051
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,700
What time are you telling people the truth about Bob?

1052
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,420
Huh?

1053
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:40,840
I said, don't you think it's time you told these people the truth?

1054
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:44,420
Yeah, it probably is. Okay, well, we've got other things to do, though, this morning. It's a show.

1055
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:45,080
Good morning.

1056
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,460
Buddy, this radio station doesn't go that far.

1057
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,220
We don't use that...

1058
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,980
They can't hear us in Germany. They can't hear us in Moscow.

1059
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:02,780
But, friends, if you sent more money to the subgenius, we could raise our broadcasting power here to 85 billion watts.

1060
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,040
Stang. Stang, it's been months.

1061
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,780
Oh, no. No, it's been years, actually.

1062
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,460
Well, that's true. It has been.

1063
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:19,640
But that time of waiting will soon come to an end, and the shrouds and mummy wrappings will be removed.

1064
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,280
I must wonder, is my name still on that sacred computer?

1065
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:30,140
Am I going to be translated into that mothership? The hands of X-Day friends?

1066
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,020
We're moving the hand truck into position now.

1067
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:38,140
We're going to put a life-size statue of you on our ship,

1068
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,220
and a lifetime supply of crop.

1069
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:45,220
It's going to be saved in, you know, to make up for the fact that we can't actually get to you.

1070
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:48,360
But a reasonably worded postcard would help.

1071
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:57,220
But, of course, in doing so, we'll only be checking the safety standards to make our program better for you out there.

1072
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,560
This is Reverend Lodge and Reverend Ivan Stang.

1073
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,460
And Dr. Howell.

1074
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,240
Hey, wake up over there. Say goodbye.

1075
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:07,900
Goodbye.

1076
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,600
Well, isn't that a bit premature?

1077
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:16,240
Well, it is a little bit premature, but, you know, this is the premature show-bearer.

1078
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:17,700
Immaculation of Bob.

1079
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:24,500
Oh, yes, sir, rather. I'm having trouble reaching Venus on our long-range deep dish radar antenna.

1080
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:29,200
We'll be right back to our previous program in just a moment.

1081
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,140
Venus won't talk to you anymore.

1082
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:35,560
Come in, Klaxon. Come in, Klaxon. This is the Earth.

1083
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,560
Are you receiving us?

1084
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,520
Oh, he hung up on us. They hung up on us all the way from Venus.

1085
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,660
Well, folks, uh...

1086
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:43,940
This is an embarrassment.

1087
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,440
There's one in every solar system.

1088
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,680
We spent a lot of money on that.

1089
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:54,100
There's a policeman Bob and an escapist con artist crime-ridden Bob.

1090
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,680
There's a scissors Bob and a knife Bob.

1091
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:01,920
There's a shark Bob and a dull Bob. That was the ancient way of saying it.

1092
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,000
There's a cook Bob and a slob Bob.

1093
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,480
There's a sterile Bob and a fertile Bob.

1094
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:14,200
There's a lieutenant Bob and a corporal Bob.

1095
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,940
Well, there's a bad Bob and there's a good Bob.

1096
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,080
There's a real Bob and there's a suited Bob.

1097
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,500
You better watch out.

1098
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,940
Better watch out.

1099
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,400
Better watch out.

1100
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:36,020
Don't follow the wrong one, no.

1101
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:49,180
I have had direct contact with people from other planets.

1102
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,960
First our spaceship blew up and now our deep dish antenna.

1103
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,360
We can still order the New World in the catalog.

1104
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,800
That's quite true. Let's bring in a new planet now.

1105
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,380
For the doctors of the air, nothing's going to change.

1106
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,000
Nothing is too good.

1107
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,020
All right, let's heave it into position.

1108
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:06,800
Here goes.

1109
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:08,940
Whoa!

1110
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,180
That's better. God, it sure is wet. We must be on Venus.

1111
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:17,260
Up to the moon in an Apollo spacecraft,

1112
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,840
Apollo has six letters.

1113
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:24,160
Each of the astronauts' names has six letters.

1114
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,460
Lovell, Anders, Borman.

1115
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,600
Six, six, six.

1116
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,360
From space, six television transmissions were made.

1117
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,200
The moon trip was a six-day journey.

1118
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,680
The spacecraft was in six sections.

1119
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:45,760
The astronaut section plus the escape system was 66 feet tall.

1120
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:52,000
On occasion, an unidentified flying object has been reported by witnesses to be the source of the sound.

1121
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,960
Oh, no. Oh, Bob, what's that?

1122
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,740
Yawing, itching and yawing.

1123
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,580
Yes, well, we are going to have to check it.

1124
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:06,960
We'll have to check the pitch of the yaws on the roof just to make sure that the Balaponga earthquake did not damage our control facility.

1125
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,440
We're outside.

1126
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,440
And while we're out there, we'll...

1127
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,420
Super sonic nuclear satellites might go out of control and attack anything within reach.

1128
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,280
Attack anything yet living.

1129
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:22,200
And so let's attempt to connect with that super secret Soviet spy satellite now.

1130
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,260
Oh, there it is. There it is.

1131
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,040
It's moving into the ecliptic.

1132
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,560
See if you can triangulate on that little red...

1133
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,300
...winking light.

1134
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:34,760
Punch that button there and we'll bring the Soviet cosmonaut into focus.

1135
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,660
Oh, there's a whole raftload of them up there.

1136
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:41,840
Can you see the Earth? Is it a big blue Aggie, as they often claim?

1137
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,540
A big blue Smith Aggie.

1138
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,020
A Smith Aggie sandwich.

1139
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,880
Phone rang. There went another Smith Aggie.

1140
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,040
Where's Buzzle Nibbits? Come on.

1141
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,160
Hello?

1142
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,960
Oh, how does that shoot?

1143
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:01,280
Hello, Captain Edge.

1144
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,760
The home of Buzzle Nibbits.

1145
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,220
Are you okay?

1146
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,040
Well, sort of. Why not? Yeah, sure, we're okay.

1147
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,740
And, dear friends...

1148
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:28,620
Well, you know...

1149
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:33,400
...always, always the tapes come to an end not soon enough.

1150
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:40,980
And the show comes to an end far, far less than soon enough, I'm sure, for some of you.

1151
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:47,800
But, for you, you can stay tuned for real music.

1152
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:50,320
Yes, real talking music.

1153
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,700
Not like these other shows.

1154
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,620
And stay tuned for...

1155
00:55:57,830 --> 00:55:59,030
...night music.

1156
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:03,770
Yes, from Lisa Taylor and, uh...

1157
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:08,590
...and Logan. Yes, I'm sure you all remember them.

1158
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,910
Some better day.

1159
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:15,690
In the meantime, dear friends, we have to say goodnight.

1160
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:24,570
It's coming up on 12 o'clock here at K&ON 89.3 FM in Dallas, Texas, as you know.

1161
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:25,150
But...

1162
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:27,890
But what you may not have known was, uh...

1163
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:30,210
What is that post office box?

1164
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:31,830
One more time, Reverend Stang?

1165
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:33,690
Where you can write to Bob?

1166
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:34,690
What, what...

1167
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:36,070
I heard you.

1168
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,070
Here it is.

1169
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:39,650
And I know you have that pencil ready.

1170
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:43,610
Just write for free information from...

1171
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,650
...Bob at...

1172
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:53,530
...Post Office Box 140306.

1173
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:56,770
That's Box 140306.

1174
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,970
In Dallas, Texas.

1175
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:01,750
75214.

1176
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:03,950
Yes, that's right. 75214.

1177
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:05,610
Why, don't you believe me?

1178
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:10,290
I think they find it a bit hard to believe, don't they?

1179
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:11,230
Well, who cares?

1180
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,530
You'll find out all too soon.

1181
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:17,530
At least by July 5th, 1998.

1182
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:21,290
Seven o'clock in the morning, yeah, you'll wake up and go...

1183
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:25,690
Oh, now I understand what that subgenius show was all about.

1184
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:28,010
But it's too late now.

1185
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:29,810
Too late.

1186
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:32,490
It's 10 o'clock, or something like that, according to...

1187
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:39,270
...a sort of a cross-section reference of the 18 different wristwatches and the several wrong clocks there in the studio.

1188
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:40,030
And, uh...

1189
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:40,510
Uh...

1190
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:42,170
Stay tuned and thank you.

1191
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:47,610
...says, if there...

1192
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:50,530
If any two are the same, one must go.

1193
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:54,510
That's too bad. Sad, sad but true, yes.

1194
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:57,330
Okay. Well, a call here. Hello, Jim, you're on 3WE.

1195
00:57:58,610 --> 00:57:59,190
Hello, Jim.
