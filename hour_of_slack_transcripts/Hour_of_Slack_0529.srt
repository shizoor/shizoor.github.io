1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
It's time for toast!

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,760
No, it's not it's time for the church of the subgenius friends

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,460
And what kind of a church is that you ask?

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,680
And I'm afraid that that answer is sort of in the eye of the beholder

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:27,680
It's in the church you see is the ultimate Rorschach test some look at it and see the devil some a fascist cult

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,760
Other says excuse me a snake oil rip up some see screwed up hit me. Oh

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:39,880
You are about to participate in a great adventure

8
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:48,200
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,360
And remain with us for the next 30 million years

10
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,740
Yes, dear friends

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:11,540
And we're back we're back and oh how I wish I wish I really was back friends. Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry

12
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,660
I'm sorry. Um, I wish I was back on the air really in a radio station

13
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,720
Friends because we got kicked off the air here in Dallas. I had a show for for ten years here and

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,580
Oh, we were the wrong

15
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,960
ethnic group or something and they they you know, the subgenius is the

16
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:32,940
ultimate

17
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,560
minority and and you know, even the minorities hate minorities

18
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:46,280
Take the big the gorillas beating on the orangutan and the orangutans beating on the chimpanzee and the chimpanzees

19
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,240
beating on the gibbon and the gibbons whooping on the subgenius and

20
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,940
and

21
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,500
The nice thing about having a show

22
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,660
I think where you had to go to a stage?

23
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,860
And do it every week was that you had to do it every week. I hate this freedom stuff friends

24
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,120
I have the freedom to put together the show any time I want and

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,000
That's why we end up doing reruns a lot. Well, for instance, I've got to leave town

26
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,720
Tonight and I've got to get this show done in about one hour

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,900
so I'm gonna pretend I'm really on the air and just

28
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,940
I'm not gonna care about the mistakes I

29
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,580
did queue up a few tapes a few tapes, but we're just

30
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,100
Gonna we're gonna wing it on a wing and a prayer a prayer to Bob

31
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,420
But it's so it's kind of awkward to tell the truth pretending

32
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,180
There's a live audience pretending that you're really listening to to us

33
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:47,600
Preach the word of Bob right now because it makes me feel like I'm one of those little crazy militia guys

34
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,440
You know cooped up in his basement making tapes to send it and that's exactly what we're doing

35
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,760
I mean, there's 17 stations now

36
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,700
There have always been 17 stations it seems there

37
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,220
It's always 17 different stations that carry the hour of slack and we love those stations

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,200
but

39
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,840
But it just ain't the same having to do this militia style

40
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,060
because it reminds me of the militia guys and I they make me mad and

41
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,220
and it's not

42
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,740
Not for the reasons it may they make me mad because they're so naive about it. It's like oh, they've made this great discovery

43
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,140
There's a conspiracy that's out to get the little guy

44
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,980
Well, duh, some of us figured that out in the 60s

45
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,640
I guess it just took the rednecks of but what what twenty year how many years has been thirty years longer?

46
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,980
I don't hardly even remember

47
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,500
Citizens at Texas here from whence I speak is really full of

48
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:51,380
citizens common law courts a bunch of poe buckers and ne'er-do-wells who have declared the United States illegal

49
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,640
They haven't caught on that the conspiracy won hundreds of years ago and it's just playing cat's-eye

50
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,620
And mouse with them, you know, why don't they just put a big target on their faces and Walker and it's just an ego thing

51
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,820
for him, you know, they they

52
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,560
I'm gonna fight the man with my shotgun

53
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,920
You can't give me a break. It's I mean I like where they're coming from. But like we say about Charlie Manson

54
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,320
he had some good ideas, but they were on the wrong scale and

55
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:27,020
The church have I said this before on this show? The church should declare itself a sovereign nation. The Vatican did it, you know?

56
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,100
I mean we can demand that the UN and the Geneva conference

57
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,840
recognized the sovereign state of mind of the Church of the subgenius and the authority of J.R

58
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,800
Bob Dobbs high he popped his Royal Highness King Philo and Prime Minister Ivan stang yours truly

59
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:50,860
Been stanging the fur flung and nushin gingers out and the commander of the Armed Forces shall be G Gordon Gordon and the Son of God

60
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:57,000
The fightin Jesus shall do something and and they shall be accorded the same rights privileges as any heads of

61
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:04,280
State the right to place tariffs enforce our borders regulate trade immigration mint currency and complete autonomy

62
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,600
from all outer worlds

63
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,140
The right to declare war as well. We'll do all that stuff first and then we'll buy the land later

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,500
For I am NOT an animal I am NOT a man

65
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,540
I am a Yeti a descendant of the pygmy Yeti of the British Isles. Yes

66
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,880
Something like that friends. I'm not running music in the back

67
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,780
ground right now because

68
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:35,200
Well just because because that's what kind of a show this is we will be playing lots of music

69
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,260
I've got some great stuff here and some some wonderful rants. We got to Pope David and Myers

70
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,260
rant from New York and and

71
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:48,280
But I've had to tell you some news here before we proceed any further

72
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:56,600
This is just clipped out of the Dallas Morning News news around, Texas and the Southwest now get this

73
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,900
Bitten man uses snake for tourniquet

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:11,800
Edenburg, Texas a Rio Bravo man bitten by a poisonous coral snake killed the reptile by biting its head off and then

75
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,820
Skinned it using the skin for a tourniquet to keep the venom from spreading

76
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:26,860
Valentin grim Aldo's actions probably saved his life Edinburgh hospital official said mr. Grimaldo 40 and this is one tough son of a bitch

77
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,300
Friends was walking with his brother along US highway

79
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,320
Passerby drove. Mr. Grimaldo tourniquet in place to the hospital's emergency room

80
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:53,640
Official said mr. Grimaldo should make a full recovery his brother Fidel kept the snake's head as a keepsake

81
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,840
officials said now that is the

82
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,220
Kind of subgenius stalwartness that I want to see more from out of you people, you know

83
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,320
The snake bites him he says why are you sorry sack of hooey? I'm gonna bite you

84
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,480
I'm gonna bite you back bites the snake's head off and

85
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,320
skin but rip peels the skin or you can peel a snake pretty quick actually and

86
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,600
I've done it and and and then

87
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:26,700
Wrap it around that arm. It's a beautiful thing man. See there's always hope there is always hope things may seem

88
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,760
black and terrible this conspiracy may be down on you but

89
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:37,800
Bite its head off use it to skin to to keep the venom from spreading because as this

90
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,420
Poem here by Nen's low. Let's go ahead and put a little background music in here. This is

91
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:52,120
What this is it says relatively stupid music. Oh, it's probably not instrumentals though, but that's okay

92
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,600
We'll just keep it down real low. Let's just guess

93
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:56,920
I

94
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:17,400
And you too can friend can have a happy happy happy heart

95
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,000
because as this

96
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,160
As this poem by Nen's low said Nen's I've sent this music and he wrote this poem

97
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,340
to me

98
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,820
Are you standing at dumbass corner?

99
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:39,040
subgenius with troubled brow are you thinking of what is before you and all you are bearing now

100
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:44,560
Does all the world seem against you and you in the battle alone?

101
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,720
Remember at dumbass corner is just where you'll get the bone

102
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,540
Are you standing at dumbass corner your work before you spread?

103
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:00,940
You're lying and stealing unfinished and pressing upon heart and head

104
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,560
Longing for strength to do it

105
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,120
stretching out trembling hands

106
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,040
Remember at dumbass corner the smirking smoker stands

107
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,700
Are you standing at dumbass corner?

108
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,500
Then you're just in the very spot to learn the wondrous resources of him who careth not

109
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,060
No doubt to a brighter pathway

110
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,860
Your footsteps will soon be moved

111
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,800
But only at dumbass corner is one born every minute

112
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:34,940
proved

113
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:36,500
praise

114
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,460
out of this world

115
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,740
when I'm looking at you

116
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,660
I hear out of this world

117
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,040
Well that is pretty good

118
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,480
I'm gonna be stupid

119
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,800
Now what?

120
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,220
I'm gonna be stupid

121
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,220


122
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:04,220


123
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,360
Pokey in the eye

124
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,000
Kick you in the shin

125
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,700
Rip your lungs out

126
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,120
Slap you silly

127
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,720
Tear your shirt off

128
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,160
Disconnect your phone

129
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,640
Pull your hair out

130
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,980
Give you a paper cut

131
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,720
Spill your milk

132
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,440
Bounce your checks Burn your dinner

133
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,740
Pack your limbs off

134
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,240
Scratch your records

135
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,880
Bop you in the nose

136
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,200
Slap you silly

137
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,380
Inject you with a lethal toxin

138
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,600
Hide your car keys

139
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,040
Publish your private diary

140
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,260
Ring your doorbell

141
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,720
Call your dog silly names

142
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,000
Spot

143
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,920
Dent your fender

144
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,200
Rain in your parade

145
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,320
Ruin the ozone

146
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,560
Destroy your planet

147
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,200
B���-

148
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,620
Cool. Cool, man.

149
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,360
Pretty good mix there.

150
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,220
I've got this CD here that Negative Land sent to us and also distributes.

151
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:08,600
Negative Land, yes, is a distributor of this record called Head and Leg.

152
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,800
Oh, I'm sorry, a CD.

153
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,580
My kids really get after me for using that word record.

154
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,000
Hell, it's round and flat and it spins and sounds come off of it.

155
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,220
Just like some people's mouths.

156
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,220
Anyway, yeah, it's Head and Leg.

157
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,480
Spoken words, sound collage, music, and ambient noises,

158
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,220
which of course sounds real corny and stupid at first,

159
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,900
but it's a wonderful CD.

160
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,440
You'll probably hardly be able to find it anywhere.

161
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,560
You can write to Head and Leg.

162
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:47,000
At 90 Highland Avenue, Somerville, Massachusetts, 02143.

163
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,140
Now, see, if I didn't give you time to write that down,

164
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,440
what you can do is just take your true speech button

165
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,340
and pull that slider back and just play it again.

166
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,160
If you're listening over the internet.

167
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,080
We are, our internet broadcast is working better and better all the time.

168
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,840
You can now hear, oh, God, there's probably about a dozen hour slack shows that are on at any given,

169
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:16,760
any time of day, anywhere in the world, if you've got a decent, you know, sound card or something like that.

170
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,860
I know that's a lot to ask.

171
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,100
And it sounds horrible, by the way.

172
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,460
It sounds quite bad, which is one reason I'm not using background music right now.

173
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,420
I'm starting to cater to those, to the internet geeks,

174
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,400
because you internet geeks out there, there's more of you than there are listening to the broadcast, I think.

175
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,180
But let's see what else we have coming.

176
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,800
What is that tape doing in the background?

177
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,760
Hey, I kind of like that.

178
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,960
Nenslow has such wonderful choice of music, hate and so forth.

179
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,020
And now, where were we?

180
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,940
Where were we, dear friends?

181
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,340
Oh, I have one more.

182
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,620
No, I'll read it later.

183
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,540
I'll read it later.

184
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,480
Where is that thing I was about rightly fixing to play?

185
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,860
Here it is.

186
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,360
Okay.

187
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,740
Dr. Bizarro.

188
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,200
We'll continue with Dr.

189
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,800
Bizarro's Rock Opera.

190
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,660
The Big Machine.

191
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,340
Thank you.

192
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,620
Wow, I'm all nervous.

193
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,620
Trying my best.

194
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,760
Finally, we have Dr. Bizarro's Rock Opera.

195
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,320
Anything to metal, that's no, nothing to drank, nothing to beer.

196
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,580
Rather, I had expected the goshcare of this brother and his probably tumbler.

197
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:04,580


198
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,460
I am a lover of naiveté.

199
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,820
A이� Reid, a big world-class lazımónca who is known resthanded because of knocked-over

200
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,840
ี้

201
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:20,480
We are all part of the big machine

202
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,540
And if you let them

203
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,720
Search our heads

204
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,500
You'll be a normal

205
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,060
That's what we said

206
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,080
You'll be so crazy

207
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,560
They'll drive you insane

208
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,020
They'll put an X right

209
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,040
Inside your brain

210
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:53,380
We are all part of the big machine

211
00:14:53,900 --> 00:15:04,280
We are all part of the big machine

212
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:15,340
We are all part of the big machine

213
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:26,260
We are all part of the big machine

214
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:37,660
You are about to enter the world of virtual reality

215
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,060
Bye!

216
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,300
Behind the scenes of the typical average everyday American domestic bliss

217
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,280
You've all been suckered into

218
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,160
There exists a secret corporation of mysterious individuals

219
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,140
Called The Conspiracy

220
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,700
The members of this secret organization have

221
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,700
For many years infiltrated every level of society

222
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,840
And disguised themselves so as to go unnoticed

223
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,860
And move among you

224
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,820
To implement their master plan

225
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,180
To take over the world

226
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,740
And control your mind

227
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,000
To forever become a part of

228
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,620
The big machine

229
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,740
Is it Mr. Roboto?

230
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,240
Or a Clatubarado?

231
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,520
Or some new combination

232
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,420
Of a crumbling nation?

233
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,000
It's a new kind of device

234
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,620
For socialistical advice

235
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,200
Built to tame and control ya

236
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,060
And to control you

237
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,780
So you do what they told ya

238
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,060
So watch what you say

239
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,760
About the U.S. of A

240
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,520
Or they'll blow you away

241
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,920
Like the CIA

242
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,120
It's a JFK

243
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,060
It's a JFK

244
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,220
It's a JFK

245
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,020
It's a JFK

246
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,480
It's a JFK

247
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,260
It's a JFK

248
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:08,980
It's a JFK

249
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:08,980


250
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:08,980


251
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,380
It's a JFK

252
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,480
Well, they've made a decision

253
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,020
Carried out with precision

254
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,820
To counter subversion

255
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,700
With an anal insertion

256
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,880
By specific selection

257
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,340
For the final connection

258
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
To a new kind of device

259
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,780
So you all better think twice

260
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,000
So watch what you say

261
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,680
About the U.S. of A

262
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,440
Or they'll blow you away

263
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,800
Like the CIA

264
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,240
It's a JFK

265
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,840
And to RFK

266
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,120
And to MLK

267
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,260
By the CIA

268
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,480
We are all part of

269
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,860
The big machine

270
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,960
We are all part of

271
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,580
The big machine

272
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,740
The big machine

273
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,540
Nonfiction

274
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:56,540


275
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,740
Situated

276
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,860
LEF

277
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:06,960
High

278
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:07,940
High

279
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,880
earth to them and we'll leave and the pinks will burn and die and all that stuff. But,

280
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,960
uh, what was I getting to? Oh, um, you know, but in the meantime, what we can, what we,

281
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:26,180
you know, some, some occasionally some, uh, militia type will say, well, you guys are

282
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:33,300
just being silly. You're just, you're trivializing these important, uh, things. And, and, uh,

283
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:38,840
all we're trying to do is keep some, but keep subgeniuses from killing themselves.

284
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:46,680
Somewhere out there is some kid on the verge of just, you know, throwing it all away, giving

285
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:54,080
up and kid, you're not alone. Don't kill yourself yet. Go on to invent that cure for

286
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,440
kid. If you can just hang in there for a little while longer, you'll probably end up, uh,

287
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,060
you know, becoming the first, uh, good leader in history.

288
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:10,740
Or, or, um, you know, regular damn, uh, Martin Luther Dobbs or, or Louis Pasteur or something

289
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:17,920
like that. There is hope there, there is hope. And to prove it, here is some more Lou

290
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,260
Duchesne with his sympho flatulation. I hope.

291
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:32,980
This is the place to be. Fun living is the life for me.

292
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:43,860
Far and wide. Gee, Manhattan, just give me that countryside. Man. Now see, a subgenius

293
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:49,920
can, uh, you can take away, you can throw them in jail, take away their, um, electric

294
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,940
guitars and their radio equipment and so forth, but they've still got their armpit.

295
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,280
Hello friends and welcome. The sermon tonight is entitled, The Man Who Made Me a Man.

296
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,740
And I'm here to tell you that the subgenius is the one who made the world the deal with

297
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:13,860
Dobbs. Because the church of the subgenius is unlike any other religion, my friends.

298
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:24,100
It's not just a faith. It's a promise. A binding contract between you and the subgenius

299
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:30,780
foundation. Most religions give you nothing but assurances. You're supposed to trust them,

300
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,280
have faith in them, and pray. And I'm here to tell you that the subgenius is the one

301
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:33,280


302
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:33,540
who made me a man. I don't know if I'm lying to you, man, but it's a fact. Jamal, I see

303
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:42,260
you're right. Unfortunately, the word con means more than just conspiracy. It's slang

304
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:50,600
for confidence. Now confidence man, for those of you who haven't heard, is a man who lies

305
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:57,160
for a living. An actor who gains people's trust and then rips them off. Can you spot

306
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:03,260
a con artist by their appearance? Of course not. You identify them by their appearance.

307
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,640
by their reputation.

308
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,560
And the same holds true with religions, my friends.

309
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,740
The best way to spot the fakes

310
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,680
is to see how they treated their previous customers.

311
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,640
Take, for example, oh, Islam.

312
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,140
Muhammad promised to lead his followers

313
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,900
into what he called enlightenment.

314
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,960
He's had over a thousand years to do it,

315
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,240
but so far things are still pretty backward over there.

316
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,860
Now, they do have some interesting customs, all right,

317
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,760
but stoning people to death for having affairs

318
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,120
or cutting off their hands for thievery

319
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,880
isn't exactly what I call progressive.

320
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,240
Then, of course, there's the Jews.

321
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,460
Yahweh promised he would protect the Jews

322
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,300
and let them rule Israel forever in perpetuity.

323
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,720
That means without interruption.

324
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,020
But it didn't happen, my friends.

325
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,780
In the last millennium,

326
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:00,100
the Jews have ruled Israel for about 50 years.

327
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,940
And they only got that opportunity

328
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,960
out of sympathy from the Holocaust.

329
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,500
Now, me, I like to give gods the benefit of the doubt.

330
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,620
But if the Holocaust is what their god considers protection,

331
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,300
oh, I'd hate to see persecution.

332
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,140
And then, of course, there's the Christians.

333
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,580
God promised to send Jesus back to Earth

334
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,740
and reclaim the world.

335
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,800
The apostles expected that to mean in their lifetime.

336
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,200
When they started dying,

337
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,600
the date was moved back to when the very last apostle died.

338
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,060
When the last one croaked,

339
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,860
the church decided Jesus would return in exactly 100 years.

340
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,440
They've been moving the date back for centuries ever since.

341
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,560
Talk about patience.

342
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,320
When are these people going to realize they've been stood up?

343
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,740
The mainstream religions are filled with unfulfilled promises.

344
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,800
They just don't have any credibility.

345
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,300
According to the Bible, Old and New Testament,

346
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,700
God performed miracles for all to see,

347
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,620
not just subtle hints either,

348
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,300
but dramatic displays of power,

349
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,900
like bread falling from the sky

350
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,860
or the sea splitting in twain,

351
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,200
special effects that Steven Spielberg would be proud of.

352
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,000
But that hasn't happened for a long, long time.

353
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,100
It stopped long ago.

354
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,800
Why?

355
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,540
Did God get tired of Earth and move on?

356
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,820
Did he grow old and die?

357
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,360
Or perhaps, just perhaps,

358
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,520
it never happened in the first place.

359
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,460
It was all gossip that got exaggerated over time,

360
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,320
like Paul Bunyan and Kris Kringle.

361
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,180
Then somebody wrote it down,

362
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,220
and the next thing you know,

363
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,840
people are watching the skies for giant lumberjacks,

364
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,800
big blue oxes, or floating fat men with flying reindeer.

365
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,080
No one can prove these legends or lies

366
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,080
any more than they can prove a religion is false,

367
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,540
because you can't prove a negative.

368
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,400
But if you compare the promises,

369
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,000
from the promises made to the promises kept,

370
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,840
you have all the evidence you need

371
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,360
to make an intelligent decision.

372
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,060
The Bible says,

373
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,340
if they lie about the small things,

374
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,940
then assume they lie about the big things.

375
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,680
I say amen to that.

376
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,760
And I also say,

377
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,040
it takes one to know one,

378
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,880
because unlike the rip-off religions,

379
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,880
we, the subgenie, keep our promises.

380
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,460
We give a written warranty

381
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,420
that guarantees eternal salvation

382
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,440
or triple your money back.

383
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,280
Do the other religions give written guarantees?

384
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,860
Hell no.

385
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,460
They get bent out of shape

386
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,680
if you so much as ask too many questions.

387
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,460
Why, the other day,

388
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,980
I told a Christian about our money-back guarantee,

389
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,500
and his eyes grew real big,

390
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,360
and he said,

391
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,120
aha, you say it's a guarantee,

392
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,880
but you only offer it because you know it,

393
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,240
that if someone's dead,

394
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,860
they won't be able to come back and claim it.

395
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,060
Not so, I explained,

396
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,600
because if we're wrong and Christianity is right,

397
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,200
then all the Christians will return to life

398
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,940
on Judgment Day and demand payment.

399
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,460
He got all miffed and retorted,

400
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,480
Christians don't pay money for salvation.

401
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,900
If they did, they wouldn't be Christian.

402
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,980
I said, well, we wouldn't know about that,

403
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,440
because unlike your religion,

404
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,920
ours doesn't discriminate

405
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,760
based on race, sex, or religious preference.

406
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,860
They can be pink so long as their money is green.

407
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,520
And that shut him up real quick,

408
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,120
because only Bob's church

409
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,900
can afford to make guarantees like that,

410
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,440
since we know we're right.

411
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,840
We don't have to worry about 2,000 years

412
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,640
of dead Christians coming back for their money,

413
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,960
because we're equally certain

414
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,720
not only that our religion is right,

415
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,220
but that their religion is bogus.

416
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,340
Ours may not be as exciting a denomination

417
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,580
as the fantasy faiths.

418
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,720
We don't have towers of flame

419
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,160
or plagues of locusts.

420
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,840
Our God hasn't turned on us

421
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,820
or turned anyone into salt.

422
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,420
But what do these stories prove anyway?

423
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,860
Reality is always less exciting than fiction.

424
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,060
Everybody knows that.

425
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,860
Our miracles aren't as legendary as their miracles,

426
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,500
but our miracles happen.

427
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,160
And they happen this century, this decade,

428
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,060
to you and your generation,

429
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,140
not 2,000 years ago to a bunch of dead foreigners.

430
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,260
Why would you believe them over us?

431
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,420
We say trust no one until you see for yourself.

432
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,320
Come July 5th, 1998,

433
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,160
we're either going to put up or shut up.

434
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,820
Forget 20 centuries of,

435
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,180
he's coming, no, really, we mean it this time.

436
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,080
That's poop for pinheads.

437
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,140
We deliver results you can judge before you die.

438
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,960
We'll start you off with the miracle of slack

439
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,580
on a daily basis, no expertise required.

440
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,160
You don't have to be Muhammad or Moses

441
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,220
or Mary Madeline, for that matter.

442
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
Just be yourself

443
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,920
and reject the conspiracy way of doing business.

444
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,240
You'll get results you can taste, touch, see, smell, and hear.

445
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,040
So don't be conned by the con.

446
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,880
Make that deal with Dobbs today

447
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,000
and stop wasting your money on religions

448
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,520
with a proven track record of failure and disappointment.

449
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,100
Invest, invest your faith

450
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,600
in a religion that gives you a receipt,

451
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,420
a receipt, a money-back guarantee.

452
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,360
Because, my friends,

453
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,520
if your soul isn't worth a written warranty,

454
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,520
then what the hell is?

455
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,640
Herein is the word of Bob.

456
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,980
Praise Bob! Amen!

457
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,860
Oh, and praise Father Joe Mama,

458
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,000
also known as Papa Joe Mama,

459
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,000
the, oh, what a great preacher.

460
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,140
And, friends, you can probably,

461
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,040
I believe that you will be able to,

462
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,880
those who can get there,

463
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,240
to the Brushwood Folklore Center,

464
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,480
two events in July,

465
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,520
the X Day,

466
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,360
see, friends, we're practicing for salvation.

467
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,380
And Father Joe Mama knows from whence he speaketh,

468
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,260
because he just recently repented,

469
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,520
quit his job,

470
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,680
and slacked off.

471
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,240
Praise Bob!

472
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,700
And now the government is paying him

473
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,700
just as much not to work.

474
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,820
But, yes, on July 5th of every year from now on,

475
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,820
July 5th this year,

476
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,860
actually it's the 5th through the 7th,

477
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,120
we are holding the X Day drill

478
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,700
at Brushwood Folklore Center,

479
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,720
big campground in Sherman, New York.

480
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,740
And the only way you can get more information on that

481
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,760
is to write for the information from us here.

482
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,860
And I'm about to give the sacred address

483
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,520
of the church, of the subgenius,

484
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,020
and that is just write to Bob, friends,

485
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,660
just write to old Bob at

486
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,580
postofficebox1403.

487
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:50,800
That's the address.

488
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,160
Box140306,

489
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,560
Dallas, Texas,

490
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:56,780
75214.

491
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:58,800
Box140306,

492
00:29:59,060 --> 00:29:59,940
Dallas, Texas,

493
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,440
it's 75214.

494
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,200
Thank you.

495
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,920
All types of these subgenii have the yearning for slack,

496
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,220
frop,

497
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,100
all the subgenius products.

498
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,760
They have the Revelation X book,

499
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,720
the original Bob book,

500
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,660
the Bob comic books.

501
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,120
Every morning they get up

502
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,360
and they drink out of their Bob mug.

503
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,340
They got their frop pipe full of frop.

504
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,960
They got every little thing.

505
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,180
Their pad is a virtual slack shrine.

506
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,400
They even got the giant velvet Bob

507
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,420
right in the middle with all their Bob goodies.

508
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,320
They even have all the subgenius doctor bands,

509
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,460
more than I can even list.

510
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,260
Of course OBE, Kings of Feedback,

511
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,300
and the classics like Brother Cleave.

512
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,260
Hail Brother Cleave.

513
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,420
And doctors for Bob,

514
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,500
the swinging love corpses,

515
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,540
and you know, like Devo,

516
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,260
Negative Lance,

517
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:50,320


518
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:50,320


519
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:50,320


520
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:50,320


521
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:50,320


522
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:50,320


523
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:50,320


524
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,100
and of course my favorite doctor of all times,

525
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,080
Jimi Hendrix.

526
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,140
And hey, these buy me Bobs even bought him a four track

527
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,860
and a cheesy little Casio sampler and a dumpy little guitar,

528
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,180
and they're making doctor music for Bob.

529
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,860
Our right Reverend Ivan Stang even played their sacred

530
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,700
heap of slack tape on the Hour of Slack.

531
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,320
That's another thing.

532
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,360
I don't want to get into them,

533
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,120
but where is the Hour of Slack in Boston?

534
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,940
The closest thing we have is Dad Townsend in Maine.

535
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,520
We need the Hour of Slack in Boston.

536
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,480
That's a whole other rant though.

537
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,240
I got distracted.

538
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,200
Just kill me.

539
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,380
Please kill me.

540
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,680
And of course these buy me Bobs are on the internet.

541
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,900
Posting the alt slack every day,

542
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,960
some kind of babble slack shit,

543
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,160
who knows what, man.

544
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,300
They got him a web site.

545
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,140
They got a web page with little Bob pictures all over the place

546
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,280
and they're linked to the almighty sub slack of Slack.

547
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,080
What is that sub site of Slack?

548
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,440
But comes X Day,

549
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,200
they're going to be at some fashion revival on X Day Eve

550
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,420
moving around in all their fashion bobs.

551
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,500
Got a different t-shirt for every day.

552
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,120
They'll be humming the song.

553
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:48,860
Their description of theirfang has selenity crazy

554
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:48,860


555
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:49,340


556
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,280
R independence of these kids.

557
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,060
subgenius with their actual subgenius membership card. Who among us actually has one of these

558
00:32:55,060 --> 00:33:02,020
membership cards? This is your ticket to pleasure. You think, right? Don't count on it.

559
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,780
You're not cured yet.

560
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:15,480
What? Tape ran out. Friends, that was Bill T. Miller, of course, live. It was a live show,

561
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:24,000
a strange kind of live preaching. Friends, Bill Miller has the most doctored-up keyboard I ever

562
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,740
saw in my life. He just had this long keyboard in front of him. Every single key had some different

563
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:40,400
horrible little pertinent bit of a rant there. Oh, you can indeed get tapes. Bill Miller's CD,

564
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,880
The Outband Experience and Kings of Feedback CD,

565
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:54,740
the best way to get information about that is to write, no, to call 1-617-LICK-O-B-E,

566
00:33:55,020 --> 00:34:05,040
L-I-C-K-O-B-E, 1-617-LICK-O-B-E. Do it now. Seriously, his studio stuff is just amazing.

567
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,840
He's a professional studio subgenius. All right, okay, I'm halfway through the show,

568
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,520
and we're going to plunge ahead, but I don't have any

569
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:14,840
urgency.

570
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,060
I don't have any earthly idea of what it was that I was going to play next. There's so much

571
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,240
material. I'll tell you what, though, while we're thinking about addresses and things,

572
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:28,560
let me give you our new email address for the church, church headquarters here,

573
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:39,540
Hour of Slack, Subgenius Foundation. You can email us at slack at metronet.com. That's slack

574
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:45,460
at metronet.com. Metronet is spelled about the way you pronounce it.

575
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,680
I'll put the full name of the person who sent that email out, and we'll send him a request.

576
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,840
The address is surscrji.com. That's surscrji.com, and I've made a very detailed list of every埱

577
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:07,760
By the way, if you have cross test applications, obviously, if you have a handplant proposal,

578
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,020


579
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,020


580
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:15,420
They're worthy of the minimum as Afro, and they feel like this stuff was uneatable to them.

581
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:23,120
S-U-N-C dot E-D-U slash subgenius.

582
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,220
That's all in lowercase letters.

583
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:32,440
Sunsite, S-U-N-S-I-T-E dot U-N-C dot E-D-U slash subgenius.

584
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:37,220
And once again, friends, subgenius does not have an O in it.

585
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:42,040
Speaking of legal documents, well, there's the legal...

586
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,320
I could play the legal documents guy. Where is he?

587
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,440
Here's the... Oh, man, I love the legal...

588
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,440
Let's see what the legal documents guy's phone message was this week.

589
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,160
It says in the paper you have the ability to check right away

590
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,300
to see if a guy's education process was wrong.

591
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,540
It says you have the ability to improve a guy's education process.

592
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,940
You have, like, the equivalent of a ship or a stage,

593
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,760
and you're this, and you're this group of guys, and that.

594
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,420
So it's all explained in the paper.

595
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,780
Now, it says in the paper, back all the way to the late 70s,

596
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,040
that I'm allowed to...

597
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,400
to carry the news, I'm allowed to read the news,

598
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,780
to receive the news, to carry the mail.

599
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,640
In fact, I'm the guy in the paper that Northeast Ohio

600
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,400
is under restrictions that my brother and I are the only guys

601
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,740
allowed to smoke a cigarette.

602
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,540
And because of places of strange behavior,

603
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,640
they're terminally jealous.

604
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,960
Yes, sir, I'm the guy with the legal notice in advance in the paper.

605
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,300
You've got permission to serve.

606
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,860
And so I got a story.

607
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,580
I talked about who's allowed to carry the mail around Euclid,

608
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,100
and they're only allowed to carry it since my hearings

609
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,660
until they serve what guys.

610
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,220
And until we lift restrictions,

611
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,780
this place has been charged with strange behavior.

612
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,100
And my brother and I are out from under restrictions, supposedly.

613
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,460
Some clemency cop is still playing with me.

614
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,900
And then I have a legal notice, I believe, from you guys

615
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,960
right after my hearings.

616
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,380
And some people have, like, one word,

617
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,600
one right and a word under official,

618
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,660
like maritime, merchant marine talk and legal talk.

619
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,800
But I've got it all, man.

620
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,500
I'm investitured, invested.

621
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,760
I'm allowed to wear a vest, walleted,

622
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,460
cashier, cash, and purse, and satchel.

623
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,460
It's in my tools.

624
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,500
I'm allowed to have it.

625
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,700
I got an old case in my tools and trade secrets

626
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:32,400
and trade secrets and formula for success

627
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,760
in my tools and in the things I use in my...

628
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,120
And, yeah, I can carry white and green,

629
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,360
and I've got the purple space purple.

630
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,180
And, uh...

631
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,340
I got the documents.

632
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,100
I got the legal...

633
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,900
I'm the guy with the legal documents in the paper.

634
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:50,660
Yes.

635
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,820
From an answer machine, friends.

636
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,440
Probably ought to leave it at that.

637
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,560
I love the legal documents.

638
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,080
Got it, though.

639
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,220
And here's a legal document,

640
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,680
which our new business manager, Jesus,

641
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,480
had to dig up the other day.

642
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,240
We had to dig up our trademark papers.

643
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,580
You know, the main portrait of our leader, Bob Dobbs,

644
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,100
is that main picture of Bob,

645
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,180
smiling guy with a face.

646
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,600
That is actually a trademark,

647
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,760
that particular portrait of him,

648
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,160
owned by the Subgenius Foundation.

649
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,720
That's basically me.

650
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:24,800
And, uh...

651
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,500
But Jesus was digging through the old papers,

652
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,500
and I had forgotten about this.

653
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,920
This was, like, 15 years ago.

654
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,520
It was September 27, 1982.

655
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,740
And this is a letter from the Subgenius lawyer

656
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,820
to the patent office,

657
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,480
the patent and trademark office,

658
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,160
of the United States,

659
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,340
who had originally turned down the trademark on Bob.

660
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,820
Now, the end of the story is that they relented.

661
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,220
But this was a letter, um...

662
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:53,180
Let's see.

663
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,900
By official...

664
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,240
I want to talk like the legal documents guy.

665
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,760
By official action dated November 1983,

666
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,260
registration has again been refused

667
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,780
for the services specified.

668
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,320
The examiner, again asserting that applicant

669
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,300
must accept a definition of services

670
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,540
as drafted by the law.

671
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,180
Uh-oh.

672
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,440
Reconsideration is respectfully,

673
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,260
respectfully requested.

674
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,900
Applicant, in this application,

675
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,860
seeks registration of its mark for,

676
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:20,700
quote,

677
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,340
educational, entertainment, and religious services,

678
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,300
namely, exposing, promoting, and exploiting

679
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,780
the philosophy of the Church of the Subgenius,

680
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,060
distributing educational, entertainment,

681
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,340
and religious materials,

682
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,040
conducting seminars, conventions, and tent meetings,

683
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,080
exposing the conspiracy,

684
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,500
printing, publishing, and distributing

685
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,840
the theological, scientific,

686
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,040
and other works of J.R. Bob Dobbs

687
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,420
for benevolent, charitable, scientific, missionary,

688
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,160
and philanthropic purposes,

689
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,540
translating, editing, advertising,

690
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,880
and selling the works of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

691
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,540
his followers, and converts, and others

692
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,380
in agreement with and supporting of the philosophy

693
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,940
of Church of the Subgenius,

694
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,660
and soliciting money.

695
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,140
And that's all accurate and true.

696
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,340
These are documents registered with the government.

697
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,160
And that's basically what it does say

698
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,580
about the Church of the Subgenius.

699
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,680
In the halls of Congress.

700
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,840
Our lawyer continues,

701
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,320
although the specimens submitted

702
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,480
might well support other uses of the mark,

703
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,560
uses of the mark, that's Bob's face,

704
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,100
the services sought to be covered by this application

705
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,580
are clearly supported by the specimens submitted.

706
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,340
In other words, Bob's face clearly supports these things.

707
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,500
The examiner notes that the specimens state

708
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,160
that an applicant is, quote,

709
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,960
a sin-a-sac religion and a society for strange people, unquote.

710
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,680
The literature submitted as specimens further states

711
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,120
that the Church of the Subgenius

712
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,660
is beyond the shadow of a doubt the only true religion.

713
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,920
He's quoting the pamphlet.

714
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,280
Oh, that was the specimen.

715
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,720
Um, we perform miracles, answer any questions,

716
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,720
invoke demons, and have a direct etheric hotline

717
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,360
to space god Jehovah One through our

718
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:02,020
infra-psychic, trance-babbling personal savior J.R. Bob Dobbs.

719
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,300
And that's all simple legalese, right, friends?

720
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,540
Now, Webster's dictionary defines religion

721
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,840
as belief in a divine or superhuman power,

722
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,540
or powers to be obeyed and worshipped

723
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,200
as the creators and rulers of the universe,

724
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,240
and blah, blah, blah.

725
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,380
There can be no doubt that the Church of the Subgenius

726
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,580
is a religion as commonly defined,

727
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,020
albeit a rather unorthodox religion.

728
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:27,360
The Overman Identity Card, submitted as a specimen,

729
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,020
that's the membership card, friends,

730
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,020
the thing that gets you on the spaceships on X-Day

731
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,320
and dooms you if you don't have it.

732
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,880
The Overman Identity Card, submitted as specimen,

733
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,640
clearly shows that the Overman is entrusted, quote,

734
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,820
to perform all duties of the subgenius,

735
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,200
including sermonizing, harangues, invocations,

736
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,860
exorcisms, marriages, baptismal sacrifices,

737
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,260
seances, hypnosis, levitations,

738
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,060
the casting out of false prophets,

739
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,100
smitings, deflowerings, indoctrinations,

740
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,760
and the acceptance of donations.

741
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,780
Each of the services performed by the Overman

742
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,160
clearly falls within religious services,

743
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,920
as that term is commonly known and understood

744
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,940
by the ordinary person.

745
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,420
See, he's, our lawyer is trying to, to, um,

746
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,520
argue that this, he goes, obviously, educational,

747
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,020
quote, the terms educational, entertainment, and religion

748
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,140
have different connotations and meanings for different people.

749
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,160
However, the prejudices of one sect or group of people

750
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,220
cannot be used as a statutory standard

751
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,540
to deny registration of a mark, such as Bob's face,

752
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,580
used by another sect or group of people

753
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,640
who view these terms in a somewhat different light.

754
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,300
And, um, and he goes on to quote various other,

755
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,700
the case of Rose versus Reality or something like that.

756
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,680
And the specimens do support that this, uh, mark

757
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,720
is, uh, legitimately to be used and so forth and so on.

758
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,780
And in the end, we got our trademark,

759
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,620
and every few years we have to send them 500 bucks

760
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,880
to, uh, to keep, keep that booger in line.

761
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,220
But, well, heck, enough of that legalese,

762
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,780
uh, because I'm gonna go to, uh, some preaching again

763
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,680
from Pope David N. Meyer.

764
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,300
But first, some more music from the Klingons,

765
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,820
a subgenius band in Berlin.

766
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,820
Yes, Berli... not Berlin, Texas,

767
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:18,500
but Berlin, Germany, and, uh, praise the Klingons.

768
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,360
Oh.

769
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,300
Well, I guess so.

770
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,120
I guess the Klingons can't hardly do nothing

771
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,200
if they're not rewound or something.

772
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:27,700
Oh.

773
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,180
Too many people on this planet

774
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,400
There's too much dark shit on the street

775
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,660
There's too much bad news on the TV

776
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,820
Ain't no one that makes me wanna scream

777
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:02,560
Ah!

778
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,520
Ah!

779
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,560
Too much junk in the apartment

780
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,980
Too many things to do this week

781
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,180
Too many years of doing nothing

782
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,540
Too much time to send a fake

783
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,560
Well, here's the answer, why not do it again?

784
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,940
I like to take things too extreme

785
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:39,480
It's time to liven up the party

786
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,760
And kill the comfort of routine

787
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,640
We know on that path lies madness

788
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,360
Things worse than death lie in wait

789
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,900
I'll pay the price

790
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,700
For the spices of life

791
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,160
Gladly accessing my face

792
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,020
Too much

793
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,640
Oh, it's better than none, none

794
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:12,860
Much too much

795
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,320
Too much

796
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,760
Yeah, it's better than none, none

797
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,340
Much too much

798
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,980
Too many differences between us

799
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,900
Too much has happened in the past

800
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,140
I think I'm getting to the spirit

801
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,820
Take too much, move too fast

802
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,400
Well, here's the answer, how about doing it?

803
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:01,880
I like to take things too extreme

804
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:01,880


805
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:01,880


806
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:01,880


807
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:01,880


808
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:01,880


809
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:01,880


810
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:07,540
I like to take things too extreme

811
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,720
It's time to liven up the party

812
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,980
And kill the comfort of routine

813
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,720
Like this

814
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,880
Wives' men are temporary fiends

815
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,480
Always avoiding extremes

816
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,500
But moderation in all earthly things

817
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,660
Has taken the life out of me

818
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,840
Too much

819
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,300
It's better than not enough

820
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,840
Much too much

821
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,060
Too much

822
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,520
It's better than not enough

823
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,000
Much too much

824
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,220
Too much

825
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,700
It's better than not enough

826
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,080
Much too much

827
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,380
Too much

828
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,460
It's better than not enough

829
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,380
Much too much

830
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,600
Too much

831
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,580
Too much

832
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,940
Too much

833
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,460
Too much

834
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,440
Too much

835
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,320
Too much

836
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,500
Too much

837
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,160
Too much

838
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,100
Too much

839
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,840
Too much

840
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:44,420
It's beter than not enough

841
00:49:44,440 --> 00:50:03,580
Even then, children, even then, lo, yea, verily, I would walk down the street, perhaps in Seattle, Washington, perhaps in Boise, Idaho, and total strangers would come to me, children. They would come into my face, and they would say to me, Dave. They would say to me, Rev. Dave. They would say to me, come down, New York City, Dave.

842
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:17,280
Who is it that stands in the way of the conspiracy? And you know that I said to them, children, who is it, children, that stands in the way of the conspiracy?

843
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,640
You know, children, there was a train, a subway, I didn't quite catch that. Who is it that stands in their way?

844
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:33,180
That's right, children. And now, children, the other question they come to me and ask me, they say to me, Dave.

845
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:33,560
No!

846
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,500
They say to me, Rev. Dave.

847
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,880
They say to me, come down, New York City, Dave.

848
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,920
What must a subgenius have?

849
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,740
What must he have?

850
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,620
What must he have?

851
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,240
What must he have?

852
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,780
What must he have?

853
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,140
What must he have?

854
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,640
What must he have?

855
00:50:55,380 --> 00:51:00,020
That's right, children. A subgenius must have slack.

856
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:07,600
So, children, I want to talk to you about a new product. You know, the church of the subgenius has a vast and varied product line.

857
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,680
They're selling right over here. We have t-shirts, we have books, we have bumper stickers, we have buttons.

858
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,620
They're all worth every penny you pay for them, children. Every penny that you pay for them goes to fight the conspiracy.

859
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:23,760
Does it go to fight the conspiracy on the street, children? Does it go to fight the conspiracy in the sky, children?

860
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,340
No, it goes to fight the conspiracy in Dallas, children, in the coffers of the church.

861
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,000
And when Bob knows that you have tied unto Bob, you know that you have tied unto Bob.

862
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:37,260
That which is Bob. When Bob knows that you have taken him into your mind and your heart and your checkbook, then Bob fights the conspiracy.

863
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,440
But I'm selling a different kind of product tonight, children.

864
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,280
I'm selling a product that never wears out.

865
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:48,980
I'm selling a product in which interest will never flag.

866
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:52,960
I'm selling a product that you already know and love.

867
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:58,900
I'm selling a product that will bring you greater happiness than any other product you can buy, children.

868
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:02,500
And that's because my product is you.

869
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:06,060
You see, children, let me explain it to you, children.

870
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,760
One of the things the conspiracy has done...

871
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,600
Let me just look at my notes here.

872
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:18,080
One of the things the conspiracy has done, children, is to make certain conditions of modern life seem so normal that you don't recognize them as an aberration.

873
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:25,880
And one of the things the Church of the Subgenius has done is to bring certain crucial separations back together, children.

874
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,880
Because you see, the conspiracy has separated us.

875
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,460
It's separated you from you.

876
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,460
That's right, children. It's separated you from you.

877
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:42,300
The conspiracy, children, the tortures of day-to-day life, children, have given you anomie.

878
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:49,600
Now, children, those of you who remember the great, late, subgenius saint, Lester Bangs, might remember what he wrote about anomie.

879
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,740
Do you know what Lester Bangs wrote about anomie, children?

880
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,700
He defined anomie in the following manner.

881
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,340
There's only one of you, but he doesn't know.

882
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:58,860
Now, children, there's only one of you, but he doesn't know.

883
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:07,740
In the old days, in the old days, before the conspiracy was so mechanized, industrialized, and pervasive, there were prophets, if you will, of anomie.

884
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:13,660
Post-pre-industrial citizens who were experiencing that separation and found their own solutions.

885
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,080
And those solutions always lay in excess, children.

886
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,380
Why, your poes, your Baudelaires, your Rimbauds.

887
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,960
But now, children, everybody's got it every minute.

888
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:27,740
And nothing you do seems to satisfy you, children.

889
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,800
So what you do is what the conspiracy wants you to do, children.

890
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,200
And that is you purchase to close this separation.

891
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,860
You purchase to fill this void.

892
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:45,720
You purchase to pile up that unbridgeable canyon so for one moment you can step across it and embrace yourself.

893
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,280
And the conspiracy loves that, children.

894
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:51,680
It loves to see you spend your money on their useless products.

895
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:57,280
And when you feel that rising up in you, children, and you want to fight the conspiracy, you just remember this.

896
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,760
Why do you think they call it The Gap?

897
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,840
Now then, children, let me just take a look here.

898
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,880
Notes are a good thing when you don't have passion and you've only got God.

899
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:25,720
Now the other weapon that the conspiracy uses against you, children, is it raises the stakes day by day by day to make sure that no matter what you do, no matter what you accomplish,

900
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,260
you will always feel in the middle of the gap.

901
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,380
You will always feel inadequate and you will have to buy conspiracy products.

902
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:38,580
And the newest thing they're using on your children, you've noticed in the last four or five years, is an incredible bull market in useless beauty, children.

903
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,920
We're surrounded by beauty, children.

904
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,760
We're bombarded with beauty, children.

905
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,060
Beauty in the aim of the conspiracy.

906
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,200
Beauty to make you feel inadequate.

907
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,860
Beauty to make you buy those conspiracy products.

908
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,180
Now, children, look around this room.

909
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,000
Please, look around this room.

910
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:56,880
Gaze upon your neighbor.

911
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,120
In all frankness, children, we are not the beautiful people.

912
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,540
No, children, we are subgeniuses.

913
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:07,260
We are, by definition, disenfranchised children.

914
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,520
That's what makes you a subgenius.

915
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:18,740
Well, your attitude can lean you towards subgenius, but you are not a subgenius until you tithe unto Bob, that which is Bob.

916
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,060
Now, children, we don't care if you're beautiful.

917
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,900
We don't care if you're smart.

918
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,880
We don't care if you're trendy.

919
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,880
What we care about is that you've got $30 to give to Bob.

920
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,640
Now, this makes us as democratic a religion as you can find.

921
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:40,360
And when you tithe to Bob, that which is Bob's, you will get value for your dollar, children.

922
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,800
What good is $30 in today's market?

923
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,800
Well, children, it's just a pittance.

924
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:46,520
It's a bag of shells.

925
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,100
It's nothing.

926
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:54,780
But when you buy that book, children, when you buy Revelation X, available at finer bookstores everywhere,

927
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:58,160
when you get that $30 membership, children, you will get satisfaction.

928
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,940
You will get comfort.

929
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,200
You will get peace of mind.

930
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:05,580
And who knows, children, if your mind is right, you might even get a little slack.

931
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:10,480
But best of all, children, what you'll get is yourself.

932
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:13,500
Thank you, DK.

933
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,060
Now, children, people come to me on the street, and they say to me, Dave.

934
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:20,680
Dave!

935
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,000
They say to me, Rev. Dave!

936
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:22,600
Rev. Dave!

937
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,760
They say to me, pull the ball, New Yorkers!

938
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:25,240
New York City Dave!

939
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,880
New York City Dave!

940
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:27,220
New York City Dave!

941
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:35,060
What are we going to do with our $30, with our membership, when the church, like everything else, goes out of style?

942
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,080
Oh, children, let me explain it to you, children.

943
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:43,240
The conspiracy makes you sick of everything, so you'll keep buying.

944
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:47,720
The conspiracy is a vast, omnivorous, gobbling mall.

945
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:52,340
And it sits right here in the center, children, and it gobbles up everything on the fringe.

946
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:53,820
And it pulls it in.

947
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,640
And it pulls it in.

948
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,460
And it spits it out and vomits it back to you in a way that's unrecognizable.

949
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:03,160
And that's why, however long ago, you loved this band, and now you don't because the whole conspiracy likes them.

950
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,200
Well, children, let me explain this to you real clearly.

951
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,060
You could cast your mind back, children.

952
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,480
Cast your mind back.

953
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,060
Listen to the calendar pages flip.

954
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,400
1981, children.

955
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,840
November of 1981.

956
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:27,240
1981, the world's first subgenius world convention.

957
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,780
DK Jones was there.

958
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,580
Now, children, think back to 1981.

959
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:39,940
Think back to your so-called pop culture movements that have come and gone since 1981.

960
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,860
Why, children, it boggles the mind.

961
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,340
Why, I believe you've had the latter days of your punk.

962
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:49,040
I believe you had your big hair bands.

963
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:49,780
Yeah!

964
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,480
I believe you had your grunge.

965
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,540
I believe you had your rap.

966
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,820
Had your punk come back again.

967
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:00,220
All of it started out there, children, and all of it ended up in the middle.

968
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,700
But 15 years later, the subgeniuses are still on the fringe.

969
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:06,980
Praise Bob!

970
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,480
Yes, yes, yes, yes, praise Bob.

971
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,880
Dear friends, Pope David Ed Meyer preaching.

972
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,600
I wish I didn't have to cut that off.

973
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,940
It goes on and on.

974
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,560
But there's so much I want to play, you know.

975
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:23,860
And there's so little time to play it in.

976
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:27,160
But it is time to play the sacred post office box.

977
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:38,300
Friends, you can write for information about everything we do from Bob at post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

978
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:43,360
And as Pope Meyer was saying, yep, it's been 15 years.

979
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,580
We're still on the fringe.

980
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,400
Still cranking this radio show out of a, well, it's not a basement.

981
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:49,720
It's not a basement anymore.

982
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:56,280
It's actually quite a well-equipped office in a tall Dallas skyscraper, an entire building owned by us.

983
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,420
And, well, we did just sign a deal with America Online and the Disney Corporation.

984
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:09,320
But with, and we did have a sort of a small merger with Polygram and Simon & Schuster.

985
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,980
But we own them now, you see.

986
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,460
And so don't worry.

987
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:17,040
When we turn into the conspiracy, it's not really the conspiracy, you understand.

988
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:28,040
Well, what can we end this show with as much as I, Susie the floozy has this wonderful long play that's been on Subgenius Radio.

989
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,240
But it hadn't been on Subgenius Radio anywhere but Atlanta.

990
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:31,960
And I wanted to play that.

991
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,120
I want to play this.

992
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:33,960
And I want to play everything.

993
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,800
But here's Joe.

994
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,040
Why don't they call it Pant?

995
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,300
Instead of Pants.

996
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,680
It's only a single piece of material.

997
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,000
Horny in the Pant.

998
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,600
Horny in the Pant.

999
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,240
Horny in the Pant.

1000
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,020
Horny, horny, horny horn.

1001
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,440
Horny in the Pant.

1002
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,700
Sometimes I call it the Cants.

1003
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,660
Horny in the Cants.

1004
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,040
Horny in the Cant.

1005
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,200
Horny, horny, horny horn.

1006
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:08,420
Horny in the Cant.

1007
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:09,420
Praise Joe.

1008
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:10,940
And good night.
