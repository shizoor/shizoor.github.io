1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
Tell St. Peter at the Golden Gate that you hate to make him wait, but you just gotta have another

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,460
Subgenius Hour of Slack!

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,060
What?

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:23,240
Uh, yes, dear friends, we're working on the Subgenius Online History class at maybelogic.net,

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:34,300
and therefore this Hour of Slack number 1,199 will actually be a rerun of Hour of Slack number 569,

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:41,920
which is actually a rerun of the ESO Swamp Radio Show from February 27th, 1997.

7
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,560
What are you?

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,400
Nobody.

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,120
Are you blind?

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,700
What are you?

11
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,960
What are you?

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,880
What manner of beast is that?

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,780
What the hell are you?

14
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,260
What are you?

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,200
What are you?

16
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,440
Every man and woman is a star.

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,220
And that's why Dave's head is a glowing gasp.

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,340
A gasp.

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,540
A gasp.

20
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,040


21
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,280
A gasp.

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,600
A gasp.

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:26,680
A gasp.

24
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:26,680


25
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:26,680


26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:33,920
All of their heads were glowing bags of hydrogen, and they walked around town wearing their bags.

27
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,520
And one little day, one little man said,

28
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,620
Your head is much bigger than mine.

29
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,680
You must have a much bigger bag.

30
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,920
Everybody is a star.

31
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,300
And yes, that man was the mayor of the town.

32
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,320
He had a great yellow giant for a head.

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,800
Unfortunately,

34
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,200
Dave, the village idiot

35
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,140
had what is known as a dwarf

36
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,820
star for a head

37
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,140
in fact it had collapsed

38
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,320
so suddenly and compacted

39
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,860
so tremendously

40
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,100
that it, although it had not quite

41
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,440
formed a black hole

42
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,720
the density of

43
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,260
the head of Dave

44
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,940
you know every man and woman is a star

45
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,340
Dave was a dwarf star

46
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,920
well one

47
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,420
square

48
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,000
oh millimeter or so

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,780
of the interior of Dave's head

50
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,080
was of such a dense

51
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,960
molecular, densely packed

52
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,520
molecular

53
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,860
structure that

54
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,840
that tiny tiny fragment

55
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,100
would be heavy enough on our planet

56
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,580
that if you dropped it

57
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,780
it would bore its way all the way

58
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,960
to the center of the earth

59
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,880
this is why Dave was not allowed

60
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,320
in most towns

61
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,600
his head being

62
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,740
altogether heavier than the

63
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,040
most nearby planets

64
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,980
his presence

65
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,080
tended to cause disruptions

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,040
in the orbits of other

67
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,720
inhabited

68
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,840
star systems

69
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,040
other planets that might have even cities

70
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,260
and old

71
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,960
civilizations that had lasted for thousands

72
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,500
of years

73
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,960
merely the gravitational

74
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,160
waves caused by the thickness

75
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,940
of Dave's skull

76
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,520
would destroy and wipe out

77
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,960
these entire civilizations

78
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,800
and that's why when Dave

79
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,060
would beg for a dollar

80
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,380
for a bottle of beer

81
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,140
most people in town

82
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,400
would go ahead and give him the dollar

83
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,220
spare change buddy

84
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,800
what the hell are you

85
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,720
cause every time he got a headache

86
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,500
everybody's got some kind of personal deformity

87
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,100
so my bag's a little bigger than yours

88
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,360
you know

89
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,280
and what's the difference between helium and hydrogen

90
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,240
my fucking corpus callosum

91
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,040
excuse my language

92
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,100
oh my god it's not even 12 o'clock

93
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,740
hmm

94
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,540
the townsfolk and the other

95
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,440
planets

96
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,060
civilized galactic federations

97
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,200
and so forth had to pretty much put up with Dave

98
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,940
because whenever he got a headache

99
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,680
it would cause earthquakes in their capital city

100
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,360
oh my time alone's doing nothing

101
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,960
this except he's doing nothing

102
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,840
this is aspen she's doing nothing

103
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,740
this old idiot herbal extract ain't doing nothing

104
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,480
I feel like my skull is spinning

105
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,460
I feel like the weight of the universe

106
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,100
is expanding out through my very

107
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,040
very very

108
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,180
my back

109
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,020
did you ever feel that way friend

110
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,780
did you ever feel like

111
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,280
the problems of the world

112
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,920
were weighing down on you so much

113
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,420
that your head was self collapsing

114
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,940
into dwarf star density

115
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,820
have you ever felt that way

116
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,760
well if you haven't

117
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,800
then you're probably not a subgenius

118
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,320
it's so dense in here

119
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,480
you lucky bastard

120
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,560
it's just like the yolk of an egg

121
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,220
she bastard

122
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,320
what did I forget

123
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,820
you can't say she bastard

124
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,360
she

125
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,860
she

126
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,740
she

127
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,180
it's like

128
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,720
it's like

129
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:46,720


130
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,800
like a little psychic yellow of an egg in here

131
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,020
it keeps me warm

132
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,260
it keeps me nurtured

133
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,500
that's all I need

134
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
I am a star

135
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,680
see everybody's brain

136
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,840
I don't even know those people

137
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,980
I don't need to drink Tylenol

138
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,200
I don't even snort that stuff

139
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,780
I'm different than that

140
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,160
I'm going here in my back

141
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,020
we've taken good care to raise you up here Dave

142
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,220
oh by the way

143
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:07,920
Dave Dave

144
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,280
there's something we needed to

145
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,780
Dave there's something

146
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,880
I hate to interrupt your

147
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,420
you

148
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,600
your fun little monologue

149
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,140
there but

150
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,420
you've heard about cloning and so forth

151
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,260
and the replaceable body parts

152
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,180
and well you actually Dave

153
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,180
are the clone of a master Dave

154
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,060
who is a very rich powerful man

155
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,360
who happens to have

156
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,440
just destroyed his liver through hard drink

157
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,980
and it's time for his replacement liver

158
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,220
and yes you were cloned from him

159
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,700
and have been raised as a poor bethlehemian

160
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,100
and a pathetic street wino

161
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,620
just kept alive

162
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,080
you and several other clones

163
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,140
several others have already been used for other parts

164
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,460
Dave I'm afraid your life is

165
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,660
the goal of your life is

166
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,980
come around

167
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,140
it's time for you to give up

168
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,320
that which you were bred for

169
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,840
which in this case is your liver

170
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,560
wait a minute

171
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,800
isn't cloning wonderful

172
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,180
too bad nobody cloned you eh Dave

173
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,520
wait a minute

174
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,400
you'd love the rich Dave

175
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,700
he looks just like you

176
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,960
and runs General Motors now I think

177
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,200
what

178
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,320
now wait a minute

179
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,880
I don't know whether I'm having a psychic echo spasm

180
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,820
or if I'm having some kind of corticolizing

181
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,360
I'm so on the corner

182
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
and I'm panhandling

183
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,480
and I see your voice

184
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,440
that say I'm cloned from somebody else

185
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,320
who's rich and powerful

186
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,520
and come on out from behind there

187
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,340
my little leg yoke protects me

188
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,400
my little helium hydrogen exchange key

189
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,800
how could it break in here

190
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:40,980
hey

191
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,020
hey where'd he go

192
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,460
hey a little voice

193
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,980
little garbage can

194
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,440
come back here

195
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,260
man

196
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,560
nobody around here

197
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,240
yoohoo

198
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,220
maybe I'm just sucking a weird dream or something

199
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,900
I gotta stop doing them methamphetamines

200
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,040
I'm just ripping my brain apart

201
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,720
I gotta stop snoring gasoline

202
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,500
I gotta stop

203
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,040
licking the bottoms of these allspice

204
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,840
I gotta stop

205
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,240
nail clippings in my undercheeks

206
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,940
and re-spooking

207
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,840
I gotta do something

208
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:15,960
I gotta do something

209
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,620
I gotta do something man

210
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,160
maybe

211
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,780
maybe it's a self-concussive realization

212
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,500
maybe it wasn't a little voice

213
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:22,880
maybe I

214
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,440
I am cloned from some rich and powerful person

215
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,780
I could take over

216
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,040
I could take over the church of the subgenius man

217
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,740
and make a lucrative mola

218
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,500
yeah

219
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,100
I'll be standing on top of everything

220
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,860
I could

221
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,940
topple a little petty giant

222
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,000
knit a little tie

223
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,500
that little two boots

224
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,300
wherever I'm staying

225
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,620
it's weird how these little voices in my head

226
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,520
always sound like him

227
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:45,960
I don't know

228
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,440
I don't know

229
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:46,980
well gentlemen

230
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,800
as you can see

231
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,980
by our subject

232
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,460
lonesome cowboy Dave

233
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,060
the syringe implantable transponder

234
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,040
works beautifully

235
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,320
he seems to think

236
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,760
that there are voices in his head

237
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,340
in this case my voice was used

238
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,180
of course as the project chief

239
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,060
but it is amazing

240
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,180
is it not gentlemen

241
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,180
that our general electric tiny microchip

242
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,960
the size of a grain of rice

243
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,700
placed underneath his skin

244
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,560
injected with a

245
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,240
a vaccination

246
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,640
in his childhood

247
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,800
has allowed us

248
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,760
to dictate

249
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,640
as voices in his head

250
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,820
his entire life

251
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,380
you know there's no difference

252
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,040
in principle

253
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,560
gentlemen

254
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,920
between being forced

255
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,040
to carry a microchip

256
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,320
in your plastic card

257
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,960
in your wallet

258
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,520
or the little pellet

259
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,060
that we put in Dave's teeth

260
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,560
the principle

261
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,100
that big sister

262
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,300
has the right to track you

263
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:40,840
is inherent

264
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,080
in both

265
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,960
and the only difference

266
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,620
is a layer

267
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,620
of skin

268
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,540
or in Dave's teeth

269
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,580
in this case a skull

270
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,200
a very very thick

271
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,720
layer of bony carapace

272
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,960
let's turn the voices back on

273
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,620
Dr. Reverend Steng

274
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,080
I was wondering

275
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,560
yes yes

276
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,600
there seem to be

277
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,100
I've noticed in the literature

278
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,160
yes Dr. Bronner

279
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,540
I read all of your papers

280
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,220
and I am quite convinced

281
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,440
that what you have done

282
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,060
to this man

283
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,880
is a remarkable disservice

284
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,180
I see and hear

285
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,700
a picture perfect example

286
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,840
of a man whose personality

287
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,820
which was not in a good shape

288
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,520
to begin with

289
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,220
has been totally destroyed

290
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,520
and has been destroyed

291
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,620
immersed in your

292
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,440
falter world religion

293
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,100
you expect us to experiment

294
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,780
on animals

295
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,840
poor innocent animals

296
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,300
why not

297
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,140
I agree

298
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,760
Dave volunteered

299
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,820
for this thing

300
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,140
I see nowhere

301
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,940
in the transcript

302
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,840
you have given me

303
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,560
an example of Dave

304
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,280
ever giving his permission

305
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,220
written or otherwise

306
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,060
for you to conduct

307
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,180
this experiment on him

308
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,900
it seems totally remarkable

309
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,540
to me

310
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,720
how a man of your stature

311
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,240
could conduct

312
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,000
such an experiment

313
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,300
and receive grants

314
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,620
and so much money

315
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,000
to do it

316
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,020
Dr. Bronner

317
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,060
I think you've heard

318
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:45,520
the experiment

319
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,300
and I think

320
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,300


321
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,300


322
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,660
if you're going

323
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,640
to make an omelette

324
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,240
you have to

325
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,980
break a few eggs

326
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,380
I don't see

327
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:53,960
I mean

328
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,920
to a certain extent

329
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,300
this Dave

330
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,920
lonesome cowboy Dave

331
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,300
character

332
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,000
is little more

333
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,700
than a human egg

334
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,440
an omelette

335
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,340
so to speak

336
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,520
bubbling on the hot

337
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,860
sidewalk of life

338
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,800
how could you call

339
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,500
a human being

340
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,640
a fellow human being

341
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,020
an omelette

342
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,960
he's not a human being

343
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,320
he's a subgenius

344
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,600
he's a subgenius

345
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,340
he's a subgenius

346
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:15,500
he's a subgenius

347
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:15,500


348
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:15,500


349
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,280
I'm sorry

350
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,040
but your rules

351
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,220
don't apply to us

352
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,540
Dr. Stein

353
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,240
I agree with your work

354
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,900
can I say one word

355
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,000
yes Dr. Sotomayor

356
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,160
I appreciate

357
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,900
what I have been doing

358
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,660
the last few years

359
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,400
especially

360
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,080
I mean

361
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,520
Mark of the Year

362
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,220
to work with

363
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,580
lonesome cowboy Dave

364
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,620
and other people

365
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,060
Einstein

366
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,780
they infect

367
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,560
the whole Cleveland

368
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:38,940
project

369
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,980
I would like to know

370
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,420
if you can help me

371
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,920
find a possible

372
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,580
bank grant

373
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,280
for I have

374
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,980
a similar project

375
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,340
a country project

376
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,640
I would like to do

377
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,780
a similar size city

378
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,480
in southern Japan

379
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,560
oh well

380
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,960
I'll tell you

381
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,980
the investment opportunities

382
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,280
if you will connect

383
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:55,860
of course

384
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,560
I assume there's

385
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,140
fetus research

386
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,980
in your country

387
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,200
probably considerable

388
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
amount of fetus

389
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,080
organ trade

390
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,140
going on there

391
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,060
yes

392
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,160
I have no problem

393
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,060
with human donor

394
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,020
have you also

395
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,620
considered

396
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,800
genetic cloning

397
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,200
research

398
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,160
cloning research

399
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,520
for

400
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,380
to

401
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,620
well that's another thing

402
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,260
Dr. Sotomayor

403
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,500
there was quite out of line

404
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,280
complaining about

405
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,580
so-called human being

406
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,360
even if Dave

407
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,200
were a human being

408
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,060
this is a clone

409
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,080
of a human being

410
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,460
the original Dave

411
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,260
the master Dave

412
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,380
sitting over here

413
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:25,900
to my right

414
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,860
yeah that's very

415
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,460
very nice tie

416
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,200
you have there

417
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,360
Captain Dave

418
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
thanks for having me

419
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,000
the master Dave

420
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,860
there obviously

421
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,520
he was born

422
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,760
with the same rights

423
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,860
according to human being

424
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,440
or a subtenuous

425
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,380
his clone

426
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:40,880
however

427
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,660
I mean

428
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,740
how can one person

429
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,020
have more than

430
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,820
one set of rights

431
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,180
so

432
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,020
therefore the clone

433
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,960
being more or less

434
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,660
the same person

435
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,000
is going to have to

436
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,560
find his own

437
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,460
set of rights

438
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,920
Ivan do you mind

439
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,960
if I get a little

440
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,460
personal

441
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,240
postulation in here

442
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,980
I'll show a little

443
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,700
of my own perspective

444
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,560
after all being

445
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:58,980
the clone

446
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,380
donor

447
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,640
Lonesome Cowboy Dave

448
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,700
is not a human being

449
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,020
in the same way

450
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,820
you or I

451
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,360
would call

452
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,180
say perhaps

453
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,500
the Reverend Hare

454
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:08,800
or

455
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,280
Dr. Sagamoto

456
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,180
a human being

457
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,380
he's an experiment

458
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,720
conducted by the church

459
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,100
to reincur

460
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,240
the reprogramming

461
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,700
of thousands more people

462
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,280
and to stop this

463
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,880
X day thing

464
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,740
that we've been

465
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,880
we've all been talking about

466
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,720
that's all I have to say

467
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,740
Dr. Brunner can complain

468
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,520
all he wants

469
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,320
but the process

470
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
has been set in motion

471
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,340
Dave is contagious

472
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,860
everywhere he goes

473
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,900
in the city of Cleveland

474
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,940
we're going to see

475
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,420
the same

476
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,260
progress

477
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,220
in the disease

478
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,240
the virus

479
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,100
if you want to call it

480
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,440
a disease

481
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,700
we like to think of it

482
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,420
as a

483
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,660
new

484
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,460
oh just some

485
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,300
we're adding

486
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,120
some artistic

487
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,820
details

488
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,760
to the

489
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:44,980
fabric

490
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,800
of human reality

491
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,620
that's all

492
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,280
we're just doing

493
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,560
a little window dressing

494
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,380
improving

495
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,840
on God's

496
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,520
handiwork

497
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,660
why not

498
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,160
God gave us

499
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,680
that right

500
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,280
did he not

501
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,240
he made us

502
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,060
as unto gods

503
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,080
every man and woman

504
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,720
is a star

505
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,180
I believe

506
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,620
our secret leader

507
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,560
Alistair Crowley

508
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,920
Hubbard once said

509
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,180
I remember

510
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:08,760
I sit there

511
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,640
Parsons

512
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,300
at that nudist

513
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,160
oh yes

514
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,740
yes sir

515
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,540
Dr. Stefano Grappelli

516
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,400
of the Institute

517
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,620
of Psychic Research

518
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,340
in Rome

519
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,640
I was wondering

520
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,500
if you found

521
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,960
any sort of

522
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,760
repercussion

523
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,880
with the

524
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,780
lonesome cowboy Dave

525
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,140
perhaps

526
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,520
any psychic

527
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,840
example of violence

528
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,880
or trouble

529
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,520
with police

530
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:30,940
or

531
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,980
such a

532
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,640
psychological

533
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,600
exacerbation

534
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:35,680
yes

535
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,000
yes

536
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,900
I'm glad

537
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,380
that you asked

538
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:37,740
that question

539
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,060
there was

540
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,000
an extremely

541
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,460
unusual

542
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,400
side effect

543
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:40,980
to the treatment

544
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,880
by which

545
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,980
whenever Dave

546
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,880
would sneeze

547
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,380
for a minute

548
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,620
plates

549
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,480
for instance

550
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:45,980
in the kitchen

551
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,440
would fly

552
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,500
across the room

553
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,920
jump off the shelves

554
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,420
and smash

555
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,240
against the opposite

556
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,600
wall

557
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,860
one time

558
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,700
we were in the

559
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,260
front office

560
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,020
and the files

561
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,000
flew out of the

562
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,860
file cabinet drawers

563
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,920
every time Dave

564
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,640
sneezed

565
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,100
of course

566
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,640
we had to

567
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,980
put him down

568
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,900
whenever he was

569
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,540
around any kind

570
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:02,920
of expensive

571
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,320
equipment

572
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,760
out on the street

573
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,360
most people

574
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
hardly notice

575
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,040
there's so much

576
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,400
violence

577
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,060
mugging

578
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:09,840
down there

579
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,480
on the level

580
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,420
the level

581
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:11,920
where he

582
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,720
where the

583
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,660
experiments

584
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,180
are usually

585
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,800
conducted

586
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,060
Petri dish

587
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,420
one

588
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:20,940
you know

589
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,940
the sidewalk

590
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,460
I would like

591
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,140
to ask a question

592
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,860
also of you

593
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,160
I am from

594
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,720
the institute

595
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,260
in Moscow

596
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,000
I won't need

597
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,120
to mention

598
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,780
the name

599
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,380
of the institute

600
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,500
where I'm familiar

601
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,160
with the

602
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,800
parapsychological

603
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,340
research

604
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,180
I've been doing

605
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,400
oh yes comrade

606
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,340
I would like

607
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,340
to say that

608
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,600
after the

609
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,720
upcoming election

610
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,320
will be a whole

611
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,020
different situation

612
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,620
in the form of

613
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,000
a union

614
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,160
and I'm

615
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,620
the common

616
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,580
of all of

617
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,040
the states

618
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,560
would be involved

619
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,080
in and

620
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,780
after what

621
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,300
you have said

622
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,020
reprogramming

623
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,140
making people

624
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,040
more malleable

625
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,520
pliable

626
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,600
will find

627
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,000
have to a

628
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,780
different problem

629
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,560
is there some

630
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,060
way we can

631
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,500
use your

632
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:57,940
research

633
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,640
and perhaps

634
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,100
make the

635
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,680
whole of

636
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:00,860
former

637
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,560
Soviet Union

638
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,140
similar

639
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,940
well comrade

640
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,460
as you know

641
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,140
Dobbsco

642
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,100
is marketing

643
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,060
the as we

644
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,400
call it

645
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,980
the electronic

646
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,680
leash

647
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,600
of these

648
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,260
implantable

649
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,100
biochips

650
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,460
to be any

651
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,400
corporate

652
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,780
or governmental

653
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,520
entity

654
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,340
we'd happily

655
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,240
assist

656
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,840
of course

657
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,920
our microchips

658
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,820
do have the

659
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,800
Dobbs trademark

660
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
built in

661
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,420
so that

662
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,700
although they

663
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,140
the subject's

664
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:28,340
allegiance

665
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,200
will be up

666
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,800
to the choice

667
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,260
of the

668
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,480
corporation

669
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,060
or governmental

670
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,820
entity

671
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,060
nevertheless

672
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,580
as you can

673
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,140
certainly understand

674
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,280
it's sort of

675
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,040
like the

676
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,160
Coca-Cola company

677
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,040
is going to

678
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,620
sell coke

679
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,320
in Russia

680
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,100
that's fine

681
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,600
but they're

682
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,000
going to have

683
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,600
their logo

684
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,100
on it

685
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,320
well

686
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,920
your people

687
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,600
will be

688
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,460
mind controlled

689
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,320
according to

690
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,920
your plans

691
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,620
however they

692
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,300
will respond

693
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,440
to the

694
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,640
smiling

695
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,460
face

696
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,060
image

697
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,520
of

698
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,680
Bob

699
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,280
that would

700
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,080
be

701
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,640
very

702
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,060
that is

703
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,480
fine with

704
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:00,660
us

705
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:00,960
thank you

706
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,340
very much

707
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:01,800
for answering

708
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,020
me

709
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,900
and as we

710
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,140
said

711
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,480
these

712
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,400
computer

713
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:05,800
chips

714
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,440
will link

715
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,040
the individual

716
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,660
up to a

717
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,020
vast

718
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,560
computer

719
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,220
database

720
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:09,920
so that

721
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,400
we can

722
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:10,860
in fact

723
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,240
follow

724
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,160
the

725
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,900
subject

726
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,640
and follow

727
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
their spending

728
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,120
their voting

729
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,020
habits

730
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,480
pretty much

731
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,080
their sexual

732
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,500
habits

733
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,000
up to a

734
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,360
point

735
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,260
we can

736
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:22,580
in fact

737
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:22,920
dictate

738
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,140
their sexual

739
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:24,560
habits

740
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,300
through the

741
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:25,880
voice in

742
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,160
the head

743
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,580
technique

744
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,520
we have

745
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,140
had some

746
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,860
subjects

747
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,160
they get

748
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,560
their ideas

749
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,000
from the

750
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,360
movies

751
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:31,920
or comic

752
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,160
books

753
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:32,580
or something

754
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,060
they pull

755
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,460
all their

756
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,080
teeth out

757
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,200
so as

758
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,800
they think

759
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,100
that this

760
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,820
will silence

761
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,560
the silent

762
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,260
radio in

763
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:39,580
their head

764
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:39,960
of course

765
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,080
that does

766
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,800
affect the

767
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,200
resonance

768
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,760
and we

769
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,120
have to

770
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,760
increase

771
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,680
the amplification

772
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,460
when they

773
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,340
pull out

774
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:46,700
all of

775
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,280
their teeth

776
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:47,920
but it's

777
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,240
rather

778
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,700
pointless

779
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,120
to tell

780
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,480
the truth

781
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,020
it's sad

782
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,360
I've noticed

783
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,620
Dave down

784
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,220
there is

785
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,800
bleeding

786
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,840
at the mouth

787
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,760
the one down

788
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,360
on the sidewalk

789
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,220
not the one

790
00:16:59,220 --> 00:16:59,480
here in the

791
00:16:59,480 --> 00:16:59,900
boardroom

792
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,300
certainly

793
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,460
I don't think

794
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:01,700
we're getting

795
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:01,980
enough

796
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,580
can you

797
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,640
enhance this

798
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,180
picture somehow

799
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,580
so we can

800
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:04,980
all see it

801
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,260
a little better

802
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:05,540
and bring up

803
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:05,920
the volume

804
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,220
somehow

805
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,100
zoom in on

806
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,100
screen 3

807
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:08,420

receptor

1080
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:50,920
holes

holes

1091
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,780
they used

1092
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,260

1107
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,080
the brain

1108
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,420
holes

1109
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,380
the brain

1110
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:17,740
holes

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,360
the brain

1112
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:18,560
holes

1113
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,140
are empty

1114
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,680
the brain

1115
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,040
holes

1116
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,960
are empty

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,280
is shining

1125
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,960

00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,200
the master

1129
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,040
molecule

1130
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,320
is gone

1131
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,660

anywhere

1139
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,680

1159
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,720
chair

1160
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,480

I told

1165
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:32,840
you when

1166
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,080
you were

1167
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,300

1168
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:33,780
and I

1169
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,840
told you

1170
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,060
when you

1171
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,520
were twelve

1172
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,040
and I

1173
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,220
told you

1174
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:37,460
as you

1175
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:37,880
were coming

1176
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,340
on

1177
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:38,820
up

1178
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,060
when you

1179
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,400
look

1180
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:41,780
scoured

1181
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,360
my son

1182
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,920
think of

1183
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,100
that

1184
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,980
glimmering

1185
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,480
pipe

1186
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,760
my work

1187
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,220
will be

1188
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,500
done

1189
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,080
I'm

1190
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,300
leaving

1191
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,660
soon

1192
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,140
I am

1193
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,020
there is

1194
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,420
a great

1195
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:58,840
mesh

1196
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,660
in your

1197
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,300
brain

1198
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,980
and this

1199
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,220
mesh

1200
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,000
is composed

1201
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,680
of tiny

1202
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,160
holes

1203
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,760
and these

1204
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,000
holes

1205
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,620
have a

1206
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:05,860
certain

1207
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,300
shape

1208
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,940
those are

1209
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,440
receptor

1210
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:08,880
holes

1211
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,520
and they're

1212
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,200
responsible

1213
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,940
for your

1214
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,140
sense of

1215
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,680
self

1216
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,280
and well

1217
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,900
being

1218
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,060
and pleasure

1219
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,280
there's a

1220
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:18,940
certain shape

1221
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,840
of a molecule

1222
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
that'll fall

1223
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,520
into those

1224
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,480
receptor holes

1225
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,260
and make

1226
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,480
you feel

1227
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,940
real good

1228
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,800
and that

1229
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,460
shape is

1230
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,220
a shape

1231
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,940
oddly enough

1232
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,020
of what

1233
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,280
looks to us

1234
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,960
just like a

1235
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,580
common pipe

1236
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,160
like a

1237
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,600
doctor

1238
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,080
grab

1239
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,360
out

1240
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:38,760
pipe

1241
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,620
and that's

1242
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,320
the way

1243
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:40,820
if you can

1244
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,840
find some

1245
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,520
way to get

1246
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,560
tiny pipe

1247
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,460
shaped molecules

1248
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,420
to fill

1249
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,340
those receptor

1250
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,320
holes inside

1251
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:47,780
that

1252
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,440
vacant mesh

1253
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,140
in your head

1254
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,380
well you'll

1255
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,460
probably feel

1256
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,300
so much better

1257
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:53,780
that you'll be

1258
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,260
able to do

1259
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,760
better on the

1260
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,100
job

1261
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,780
get a better

1262
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,220
job

1263
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,000
become like

1264
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,060
a great

1265
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,620
stock whiz

1266
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,180
or something

1267
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:00,820
and get rich

1268
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,320
overnight

1269
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,060
on some

1270
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,000
great idea

1271
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
perfect vision

1272
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,380
so of course

1273
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,800
at this point

1274
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,320
you're asking

1275
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,320
hey man

1276
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,480
where can I

1277
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,300
get some of

1278
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:11,920
them pipe

1279
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,840
shaped molecules

1280
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,240
is it like

1281
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:14,660
a pill

1282
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,480
or is it

1283
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:15,880
something you

1284
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,200
smoke

1285
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,080
hey Bernice

1286
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,460
I just want you

1287
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,060
to try this

1288
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,960
look what I got

1289
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,760
at the pharmacological

1290
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,480
well it's not

1291
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:23,960
a pill

1292
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,760
it's not a pipe

1293
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,500
you place it

1294
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,240
in your third eye

1295
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,700
it's the

1296
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,540
virtual

1297
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,940
heart noise

1298
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,380
trial

1299
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:30,920
of

1300
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,500
the

1301
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,560
the

1302
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:32,840
the

1303
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,120
the

1304
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,720
it's the

1305
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,440
emperor's

1306
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,160
new pipe

1307
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,240
you just

1308
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,680
here

1309
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,420
you see this

1310
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,280
thing

1311
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,300
that I'm

1312
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,160
holding in my

1313
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,660
hand

1314
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,800
there's

1315
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,780
nothing really

1316
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,600
in my hand

1317
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,300
but it's a

1318
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,720
virtual pipe

1319
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,840
there's no

1320
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,540
virtual in that

1321
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:54,760
pipe

1322
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,220
hey man

1323
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,320
let's all

1324
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,660
like smoke

1325
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,640
some of what's

1326
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,140
in this

1327
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,060
pipe

1328
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,380
in my hand

1329
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,720
oh yeah

1330
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,120
yeah man

1331
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,980
I see that

1332
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,500
pipe in your

1333
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:04,660
hand

1334
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,100
yeah let me

1335
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,560
have some of

1336
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,120
that virtual

1337
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,860
oh whoa

virtual

1358
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,360
pipe

1359
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,220

street drugs

1425
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,680
I don't want

1426
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,280
to get high

1427
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:37,740
anymore

1428
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,620
ever since

1429
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,260
I learned

1430
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:40,780
the word

1431
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,280

I've been ready

1433
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,600
not only to

1434
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,080
come back

1435
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,760
down to

1436
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,040
earth

1437
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,200

1438
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,880

1439
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,200

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,140
crust

1445
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,320

1446
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,200
lower crust

1447
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,520

00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,280

1451
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,340
how to go

1452
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:00,820
down

1453
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,800
since I

1454
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,580
gave up

1455
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,260
those

1456
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,380
getting high

1457
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,380

00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,380

1469
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,840

somehow

1481
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,080
they're not

1482
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,820
consuming my

1483
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,300

00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,140
there

1628
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,720
that he

1629
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,240
it is as

1630
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,880
if he is

1631
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,620
looking up

1632
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,620
from eight

1633
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,220
feet

1634
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:03,920
underground

1635
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,120
feel like

1636
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,420
they're

1637
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,440
made of

1638
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:06,940
mud

1639
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,660
feels like

1640
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,220
he's laying

1641
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:09,580
at the

1642
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:09,980
bottom

1643
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,300
of a

1644
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:10,680
hole

1645
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,020
in a

1646
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,520
box

1647
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:15,880
underground

1648
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,540
in the

1649
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:23,940
dark

1650
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,120
and the

1651
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,680
top of

1652
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,100
the box

1653
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:31,600
is only

1654
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,040
about an

1655
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,260
inch

1656
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:32,660
from his

1657
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:32,920
nose

1658
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,300
and it's

1659
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:34,620
a real

1660
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:34,940
tight

1661
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,260
fit

1662
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,100
and he

1663
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,460
doesn't

1664
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:36,660
know

1665
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:36,860
how

1666
00:29:36,860 --> 00:30:06,860


1667
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:36,860


1668
00:30:36,860 --> 00:31:06,860


1669
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:36,860


1670
00:31:36,860 --> 00:32:06,860


1671
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:36,860


1672
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,100
to

1673
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,100


1674
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,100


1675
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,100


1676
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,100


1677
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,660
and he

1678
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:37,660


1679
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:37,660


1680
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:37,700
what

1681
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:37,940
he's

1682
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,200
doing

1683
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,260
he's

1684
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:38,260


1685
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:38,260


1686
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:38,260


1687
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:38,260


1688
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:38,260


1689
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:38,260


1690
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:38,260


1691
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:38,740
the

1692
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,280
meat

1693
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,540
shackles

1694
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,820
give me

1695
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,220
the body

1696
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,880
like an

1697
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,120
old

1698
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:46,540
shoe

1699
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,500
welcome

1700
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,380
welcome

1701
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:48,920
to the

1702
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,160
other

1703
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,640
side

1704
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,740
remember

1705
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,160
me

1706
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,100
Benny

1707
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:52,880
Benny

1708
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,200
Gordon

1709
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,560
back

1710
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:53,740
in

1711
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:53,880
New

1712
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,180
York

1713
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:54,860
I was

1714
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,160
the guy

1715
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,300
who

1716
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:55,560
stole

1717
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:55,760
your

1718
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,080
shoes

1719
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,460
and hit

1720
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:56,580
him

1721
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:56,700
in

1722
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:56,780
the

1723
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,080
garbage

1724
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,480
can

1725
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,180
then

1726
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:58,340
you

1727
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:58,580
struck

1728
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:58,800
me

1729
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:58,900
in

1730
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:58,980
the

1731
00:32:58,980 --> 00:32:59,300
face

1732
00:32:59,300 --> 00:32:59,660
remember

1733
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,440
yeah

1734
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,140
I

1735
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:02,400
died

1736
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:02,860
later

1737
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,440
no

1738
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:03,800
thanks

1739
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,040
to

1740
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,280
you

1741
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,100
yeah

1742
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:11,100
side when they let me in Bellevue, they said I'd never be the same. I starved to death.

1743
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:21,440
I thought about you when I died. This don't look like the green carpets coming out. Kind

1744
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:30,300
of looks blood red. Hello, Dave. I'm sure you don't remember me. I was originally a

1745
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:40,420
tiny puppy that you tortured when you were six years old. Remember me now? Now I am Dog

1746
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:49,260
Demon, the bearer of vengeance for all torturers of tiny puppies. And meet my friend, the legless

1747
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:59,480
grasshopper. We've all come to tell you that we remember all the things you did in life.

1748
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,220
Yes.

1749
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:06,120
I don't think this is going to be very pleasant. If I'm supposed to recount all my incidences,

1750
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:14,000
so far I've only had three incidences. Oh, bad. I wonder what's next. Who's that weird

1751
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,640
looking woman? Grandma, I've never done nothing to you, really. I'm sorry about the stove.

1752
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:29,200
I'm sorry about the stove. It's too late for forgiveness now, Dave. It's too late now.

1753
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,280
It's too late.

1754
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,280


1755
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,280


1756
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,040
It's too late.

1757
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,480
She's on this figure and burned just the way I left her when I ran out of the house.

1758
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:47,220
Dave, remember your habit of sticking chewing gum under theater seats?

1759
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,180
Yes.

1760
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:56,120
I am a soul who once reached under the seat and touched your germ-ridden gum. Later to

1761
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,460
die of a cold.

1762
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,100
I'm sorry, bro.

1763
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:04,260
You know, I'm trying to keep myself clean and have good personal attributes like that

1764
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,500
and stuff, but you know, those things are so bourgeois.

1765
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,460
Hey, Dave, remember me, Butch?

1766
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,640
Yeah, Butch.

1767
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,140
Yeah.

1768
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:10,840
I'm sorry.

1769
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,140
Yeah, I bet you're sorry now, Dave.

1770
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,760
Get away.

1771
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,580
I didn't mean nothing.

1772
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,820
Maybe you shouldn't have stuck up behind me and pulled that little trick on me that one

1773
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,700
time, Dave.

1774
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,920
You know my personality, man.

1775
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,480
Push me in front of that car, Dave.

1776
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,000
Everybody in school knew I was a joke.

1777
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:33,120
Everybody thought that I just fell in front of that car, Dave.

1778
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:40,640
Were you jealous just because I was bigger and tougher and got all the girls and got decent

1779
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,280
grades and had friends and had parents and had money and had a life?

1780
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,960
Were you jealous, Dave?

1781
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,480
What, you need to look at the white?

1782
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,220
Yes.

1783
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:49,960
Yes.

1784
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,420
I hated you all.

1785
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,560
I hated that puppy for having hair.

1786
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,420
I hated Grandma for having food.

1787
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,200
And I hated you for having a car and girl friends.

1788
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,080
In fact, I still hate you.

1789
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,880
And that's why I don't mind being here.

1790
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:06,340
Dave, meet everyone of whom you have ever been jealous.

1791
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:10,380
They are here to gloat at your misfortune.

1792
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,520
Thousands and thousands of people gloating, gloating at your total humiliation here in

1793
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,740
the endless flames of, yes, let's say, in hell, Dave.

1794
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,360
You're dead and you're in hell.

1795
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,780
You see him, Facius, and you point fingers at me.

1796
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,200
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1797
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,300
And here are snapshots and tape recordings of every stupid or humiliating thing you've

1798
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:34,780
ever done.

1799
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:40,800
Here, the files of every callous and thoughtless thing you've ever said or done.

1800
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,200
Oh, man, they're flying by so fast.

1801
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,600
Here, every betrayal.

1802
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,580
I'm going to take you on a little animal.

1803
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,700
Here, every lie.

1804
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,400
Here, every time you've masturbated in an impure manner.

1805
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,380
Oh, man, my eyes.

1806
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,200
I'm going blind.

1807
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,860
I didn't know we had such good cameras, did you, in all those?

1808
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,420
You're all filling station restrooms, eh, Dave?

1809
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,400
All right.

1810
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
I don't know, but...

1811
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,160
Here, the endless file of the times you picked your nose.

1812
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,560
Here, the file of the times you wet your bed.

1813
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,180
Here, the files of the times you didn't wash behind your ears.

1814
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:20,400
Everything, everything in your entire life has been reconstructed, and you're going to

1815
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,860
have to relive every single moment of it over and over and over again inside this little

1816
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,540
black box.

1817
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,840
You can read me and we're going to remind the sort of YouTubers that you'll share your

1818
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,120
blackontos.

1819
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:37,960
Oh, man, I went back to my house just to talk to Kristin Mom.

1820
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:37,960


1821
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,260
She thought it was her ride on the field where everyone thought I couldn't go ten mejores.

1822
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,700
Heinz says, oh, Nick, you returned two years ago to theosters.

1823
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,220
Steinhardtρ на localities??

1824
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:52,420
mort merely strawberry?

1825
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,540
What the fact is, I had insulation here.

1826
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,460
site number kidding me out!?

1827
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,180
anyI don't know.

1828
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,620
Can we give Dave a chance to live his life again?

1829
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,080
Do you think he's learned his lesson?

1830
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,220
Oh, please, good sirs and dames.

1831
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:09,860
Let's flip a coin and see whether he gets the eternal salvation or not.

1832
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,480
All right, place the giant coin on the giant thumb.

1833
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,860
Set the catapult.

1834
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,140
Three, two, one, flip the coin.

1835
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,460
It is flying.

1836
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,220
Look at it.

1837
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,740
Flying miles up.

1838
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,140
Up, spinning end over end.

1839
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,480
Dave is pouring bullets of suspense out as the coin slopes.

1840
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,520
Oh, it's getting slower and slower.

1841
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,160
It's falling.

1842
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,260
It's falling back down to earth.

1843
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:51,520
It's coming down and it's landed right exactly on edge and it rolled and it came to rest and the coin is on edge.

1844
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,780
Hi.

1845
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,620
How shall Dave's fate?

1846
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,420
Be decided now.

1847
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,240
It's just more.

1848
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,100
We'll have to go through the suspense and flip the coin again.

1849
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:01,740
Okay, there it goes.

1850
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,680
It's just slow motion.

1851
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,120
Okay.

1852
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:04,860
Oh, that.

1853
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:15,520
And so the endless suspense went on for another million years as Dave waited to find out whether any of the coins would actually land.

1854
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,660
And one day, a million years later, it landed heads up.

1855
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,020
Dave, you have won.

1856
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,360
You have won.

1857
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:32,800
You were allowed to dig your way out of your coffin and back to the earth in the year 1 million AD.

1858
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:50,020
You have been forgiven by God and Satan and are resurrected into eternal life in whatever is left on the planet of your birth, where you now claw your way back up.

1859
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,420
There he's tearing the coffin open.

1860
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,680
He's digging his, choking his way.

1861
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:00,040
But we're using his front teeth to dig his way like an entrenching tool.

1862
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,580
And he's finally made out of the grave.

1863
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,620
He's coming through the surface of the graveyard.

1864
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,820
Dave is free.

1865
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,220
Dave has escaped.

1866
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,900
He has literally dug his way out of hell.

1867
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,620
I'm free.

1868
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,500
Hey, where can you get a good sandwich around here?

1869
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,480
Inch and Juter Pie.

1870
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:35,160
I might get one of those for you.

1871
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,100
I'm Point России.

1872
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,360
How much.

1873
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:40,560


1874
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:40,560


1875
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:47,400
I'm afraid of the knockout if he lives and dies outside this body.

1876
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,220
I haven't some.

1877
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:49,980
I'm spare.

1878
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,280
I'm free.

1879
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,260
Hey, baby. How you doing?

1880
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,300
You know, I got...

1881
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,760
Hey, how'd you just appear here at this spot?

1882
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,200
You know, I just had some pretty strange things happen to me.

1883
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:06,340
And, you know, this beautiful, gorgeous babe just appears as I imagine to think about it.

1884
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,240
It's called serendipity, Dave.

1885
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:11,540
Serendipity.

1886
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,640
Serendipity. Or slack. You can call it either one.

1887
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,080
Serendipity. I remember them guys when I was a little kid.

1888
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,000
They used to be in the Thomas Brothers, you know.

1889
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,020
You know, and one of them died of a heroin overdose, I think.

1890
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,640
Yeah, serendipity. I could die of a heroin overdose.

1891
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,600
That's my name, serendipity. How did you know?

1892
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,500
I didn't know, sir. I just kind of guessed it.

1893
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,600
Yeah, you know, I'm one of them intuitive kind of guys.

1894
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,660
You know, one of your strong, silent types.

1895
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,980
Yeah. Wow.

1896
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,100
Hope I ain't smelling too strong. I just crawled out of a graveyard.

1897
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:46,240
I think it kind of smells manly. I kind of like it.

1898
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,860
You know, some people say it smells more like a goat.

1899
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,640
But you in the mood for a cup of coffee?

1900
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,720
Well, sure. Espresso?

1901
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,580
Yeah. How about a cappuccino?

1902
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,600
Can we snuff it?

1903
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,560
Yeah, baby. We can do anything you want to.

1904
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,840
Especially with legs like that, we can snuff it too.

1905
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,000
Wow.

1906
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:10,480
Is that your naturalistic hair? Or is that some kind of falsified hair?

1907
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:14,080
I never saw that hue on a woman or on a human being.

1908
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,500
It's virtual hair.

1909
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,300
Virtual hair?

1910
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,600
Yes, virtual hair.

1911
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,280
You mean like it's feely-reely?

1912
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,120
It's sort of like a holodeck hair.

1913
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,860
You mean if I touch it, like, then I would automatically experience the sensation you was talking about in the aforementioned article?

1914
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,720
Well, kind of, yes. Like a hologram.

1915
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,880
Kind of, yes?

1916
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,880
Yes, kind of.

1917
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,660
What about, you sure that ain't a merkin?

1918
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:44,480
You sure that ain't a Bob Dobbs feely-reely virtual reality merkin?

1919
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,680
It really is.

1920
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,240
Oh, okay.

1921
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,560
It really is.

1922
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,320
It's a real merkin.

1923
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,200
Ha.

1924
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,800
You just lied to me.

1925
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,920
You know, I'm wondering again.

1926
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,960
It's a real virtual merkin.

1927
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:58,700
Oh.

1928
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,580
So then...

1929
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,200
Does some of this seem too good to be true, Dave?

1930
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,840
Yeah, well, the birds are singing and a woman in virtual work came up and just tried to ask me out on a date.

1931
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,460
Are you looking at gift horse in the mouth, Dave?

1932
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,160
No, I'm looking at...

1933
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:17,020
I mean, we let you out of hell to relive your life and now you're complaining that maybe it's all too perfect or something?

1934
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,780
No, I was just looking at the bus.

1935
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:18,940
Bus stop.

1936
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,520
I was reading the cards on the bus stop.

1937
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,060
Snacko Funeral Home.

1938
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:23,700
Georgia's Beans.

1939
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,800
Hey, wait a minute.

1940
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,280
Where'd the girl go?

1941
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,220
Hey, wait a minute.

1942
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,240
Oh, whatever.

1943
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,560
Well, Dave, we'll go ahead and admit it.

1944
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,000
It is.

1945
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,720
We put you in another one of those worlds where whatever you imagine is whatever you get.

1946
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:43,520
And as long as you were feeling pretty good, you were imagining pretty good things and getting the girls and so forth.

1947
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:48,380
But what are you imagining now that we've browbeaten you down and made you feel insecure?

1948
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:48,720
Again.

1949
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,320
Again, eh, Dave?

1950
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,220
What kind of reality are you creating for yourself now, you poor, pathetic loser, eh?

1951
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:01,480
He's surrounded by snakes and hush puppies and old, rotten...

1952
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,200
I know this is all full of it now.

1953
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,160
I'm surrounded by snakes and hush puppies.

1954
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,720
And everybody knows you don't eat no hush puppies with no snake.

1955
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,020
You eat no snake.

1956
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,980
You eat cougar pie and...

1957
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,120
We confused him.

1958
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,560
And his entire...

1959
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,480
Reality collapsed around him.

1960
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,840
A huge snake.

1961
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,920
We made him afraid.

1962
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,420
And that of which he was most afraid surrounded him.

1963
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:30,240
The moral of the story is, kids, you make your own reality.

1964
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,300
Every man and woman is a star.

1965
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:38,640
And if that was so, then how come it hurts when you stub your toe and how come your head ain't on fire?

1966
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,660
These are the eternal questions.

1967
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,280
To be answered only by the eternal verities.

1968
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,780
Death and taxes and Bob.

1969
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:56,180
The three things that you can depend on.

1970
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,320
Old ragged bones.

1971
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,160
Old ragged shoes.

1972
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:04,180
I am a vagabond.

1973
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,360
A vagabond.

1974
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,140
Free as the wind.

1975
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,400
Hey, buddy over here.

1976
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,460
I got some snakes and hush puppies.

1977
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,000
You hungry?

1978
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,480
You feel like curling your toes up and squirming?

1979
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,460
Come on over here.

1980
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,060
I got it.

1981
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,300
Hey, you over there.

1982
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,300
I got lemonade, too.

1983
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,600
You look at my parts.

1984
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,940
Hey, you look like a demon.

1985
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,500
You, you.

1986
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,180
Say.

1987
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:25,740
Say.

1988
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,840
Say, Dave.

1989
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,260
I'm a demon.

1990
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:33,520
I noticed that you took all those lemons we handed you and made lemonade.

1991
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:40,600
We noticed that you had that glass that was half empty and magically made it half full.

1992
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,140
Yeah, and I got the one-eared eyeball pointing down like many convicts do.

1993
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,040
But that doesn't explain it.

1994
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,680
How come my life is such a mess, man?

1995
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,600
I'm done squirming by you.

1996
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,240
I bought your lemons with real U.S. money.

1997
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,800
David, it's part of the seeking.

1998
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,040
It's part of the journey.

1999
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,960
You have to pay your dues.

2000
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:05,100
In order to truly soar through heaven, you must first embrace the porcelain bowls of hell.

2001
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,500
Yeah, I'm like some kind of mythic knight, Percival guy.

2002
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,240
Yeah, I don't mind, sir.

2003
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,020
Yes, it's the holy grail of slack.

2004
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:18,760
And you're getting so close having gone through the terrible gauntlet of anti-slack.

2005
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,740
Surely you must be almost to your goal of enlightenment.

2006
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,060
Nirvana.

2007
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:25,340
And it's true.

2008
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,920
Here comes the nirvana.

2009
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,180
By the way, Dave, you knew that nirvana means nothing, right?

2010
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,940
Yeah, I knew it meant nothing.

2011
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,420
And that's what I'm ready for, man.

2012
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,320
Life's a nothing.

2013
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,660
Because every time I get me something good, it turns out to be something bad.

2014
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,800
And every time I get me something bad, it turns out worse.

2015
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,560
So it's like a shifting sandy beach of $20 bills.

2016
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,800
It keeps on changing and changing and changing and changing.

2017
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,660
And I don't need nothing, blessed sweet oblivion.

2018
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:48,740
I just need to get out of here.

2019
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:48,740


2020
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:48,740


2021
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:48,740


2022
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:48,740


2023
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,000
Here then is your reward, Dave.

2024
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:57,580
You asked for it from Bob, God, and all the others.

2025
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:04,440
Back into the little black box eight feet underground in the cold and dark.

2026
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:08,180
Here, Dave, is your nirvana.

2027
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,780
No longer to face the woes and travails of life.

2028
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,980
You may lie here in total slack and repose.

2029
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,660
Yes, this is the slack.

2030
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,240
This is the slack that Bob promised.

2031
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:29,120
An eternity perfectly aware inside a closed black box, feeling the corruptigating worms

2032
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:36,140
shoo their way through your desiccated, decaying flesh and finally to feel your bones dissolve

2033
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:44,360
into powder as the box caves in and you have achieved nirvana and final enlightenment as

2034
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,560
worm experiment.

2035
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,380
Thank you.

2036
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:47,360
Thank you.

2037
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,420
Thank you.

2038
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,260
Thank you.

2039
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:02,900
Thank you.

2040
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,040
Thank you.

2041
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:05,240
Thank you.

2042
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:15,840
You're happy, aren't you?

2043
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:15,840


2044
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:15,840


2045
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:15,840


2046
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:15,840


2047
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:15,840


2048
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:15,840


2049
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:15,840


2050
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:15,840


2051
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,200
Maybe if only I could speak voice like that, she may even be the life and this is-

2052
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:17,460


2053
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:17,460


2054
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:17,460


2055
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:17,740
parents.

2056
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:17,740


2057
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,160
Rebecca just gave her a pair of Speck placards as free.

2058
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:18,640
She didn't know how to survive, telling her that she was the Creepchat for the

2059
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,660
last time.

2060
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:24,600
He sailed in the 701

2061
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,020
And anybody knew

2062
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:32,460
There was something in his face

2063
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,680
Loneliness could not erase

2064
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:50,100
No thoughts, no sensations

2065
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:54,680
No feelings, no recurrent memory

2066
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,960
It's simply a moldy spatula

2067
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:02,480
And those little worms kind of itch a little bit

2068
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,540
As they crawl in and out

2069
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,660
Oh yeah, yeah

2070
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,600
Just me and the worms

2071
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,780
Just me and the worms

2072
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:14,060
Like a broken pup

2073
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:17,580
He looked up from his cup

2074
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:21,120
And drank his morning coffee

2075
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:25,200
Wiped the dribble from his chin

2076
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,220
There is nothing

2077
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,580
There is nothing

2078
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:35,660
There is nothing

2079
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,460
There is nothing

2080
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,180
Nada and nada and nada

2081
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,820
Except

2082
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,180
When his eyes met mine

2083
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,600
He made a little whine

2084
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,680
He came with an angel too

2085
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,360
Then he whispered

2086
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,460
I hate you

2087
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:02,540
I hate you

2088
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,860
Our nada

2089
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:05,420
Who aren't in nada

2090
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,240

wouldn't be enough

2104
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,460
Ya say you not having boyfriend

2105
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:31,920
Hoy!

2106
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,080
How did he know?

2107
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:52,780
How did he know?

2108
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:54,600
How did he know?

2109
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,200
How did he know?

2110
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,000
Once I had some pets

2111
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,500
I let them starve to death

2112
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:06,000
It was a funny little monkey

2113
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,420
And a big white Easter bunny

2114
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,780
They lived in little cages

2115
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,500
And sometimes in rages

2116
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,880
I'd turn them upside down

2117
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,980
And drag my monkey all around

2118
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:27,440
And drag my monkey all around

2119
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,860
And drag my monkey all around

2120
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,480
And drag my monkey all around

2121
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:37,720
And drag my monkey all around

2122
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:57,360
You shouldn't have dragged me around like that, Dave

2123
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,360
And drag my monkey all around

2124
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:01,380
You shouldn't have dragged me around like that, Dave

2125
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:01,380


2126
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:02,480
You're my best friend

2127
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:02,480


2128
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:02,480


2129
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,500
I drag my monkey all around.

2130
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,060
I drag my monkey all around.

2131
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:12,520
Now ye shall be dragged around.

2132
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:16,580
I drag my monkey all around.

2133
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:24,020
Look at monkey dragging Dave around his cage.

2134
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,120
Let him be dragged.

2135
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,420
Let him all be dragged.

2136
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,840
Let his armpit hairs be braided by a tired chimpanzee.

2137
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:34,980
No?

2138
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:35,980
No?

2139
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,740
Yes.

00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:38,440

Don't do it, man.

Contaminated.

Contaminated.

cry out, are you looking at my neck?

00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,080
They shall be struck down by the Archangel

2196
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:01,460
Bill.

2197
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,560
Praise Bill.

2198
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,000
The Bill genius

2199
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,560
must be lax.

2200
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,040
There is only

2201
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,400
one gene that will work, though.

2202
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,720
It's critical we get the gene.

2203
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,160
We must not let Bob

2204
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,260
get to the gene before the ceremony.

2205
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,280
The gene must still be a virgin

2206
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,200
when the time is nigh for

2207
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,420
its arisal.

2208
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,360
We need a virgin gene

2209
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,940
clean of any impurities.

2210
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,020
That's the only way this will work.

2211
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,460
Where can we find the untainted gene?

2212
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,340
The unsullied, pure

2213
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,100
DNA formulae?

2214
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,720
Oh, man.

2215
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,380
I know where you can find it.

2216
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,380
Where?

2217
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,380
Where, man? Tell us.

2218
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,460
It's in my head.

2219
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:47,820
It's in my

2220
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,300
words. Words

2221
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,100
are like worms.

2222
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,260
And they crawl

2223
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,200
in your brain. I think he's right.

2224
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:56,100
And they wriggle.

2225
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,560
I think he does have it.

2226
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,340
I think he has the perfect

2227
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,900
undetaminated, completely

2228
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,820
crushed gene.

2229
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,560
It's like

2230
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,700
helium and hydrogen

2231
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,820
in the stars in your brain, man.

2232
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:13,500
It's true. This man's brain

2233
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,220
is so densely compacted that

2234
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,380
the interior of it is like a dwarf star.

2235
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,100
We've found what we need.

2236
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,720
He's the gene genie.

2237
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,860
He wasn't a pathetic loser

2238
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:23,740
after all.

2239
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,660
He was the one.

2240
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,920
He was the one.

2241
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:29,580
He was the one.

2242
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:32,320
After all his tortures and torment,

2243
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,460
it turned out that the gene,

2244
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,460
the perfect, unsullied,

2245
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,100
untainted gene, was

2246
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,660
in fact buried inside

2247
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,400
lonesome cowboy Dave's head.

2248
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,580
Praise Bob, the world is safe.

2249
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,800
Remove the gene.

2250
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,220
This will make Dr. Von Neumann very happy,

2251
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,020
Reverend Stang.

2252
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:54,420
This will make Dr. Von Neumann very happy.

2253
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,300
We have retrieved the gene.

2254
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:56,640
We have retrieved the gene

2255
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,340
from inside the head of lonesome cowboy Dave.

2256
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,240
He's dead now.

2257
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:05,480
And we, the conspiracy of overlords,

2258
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,560
disguised as rebels

2259
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,000
against the conspiracy of overlords,

2260
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,280
have once again won.

2261
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,200
The world is indeed our oyster.

2262
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,280
The world is our oyster,

2263
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,260
one might say.

2264
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,140
Here it's clam or some sort of shellfish.

2265
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,000
We all enjoy shellfish.

2266
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,540
Let's have some more, shall we?

2267
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,920
Yes, let's slip a few fresh in there.

2268
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,240
More raw planets down our throats.

2269
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,580
We have no love.

2270
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,080
We have no heart.

2271
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,320
We have no, uh, what do we have?

2272
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,140
Everything we need.

2273
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,020
Is that Dave corpse?

2274
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,740
Mumbling something again?

2275
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,480
I thought we removed

2276
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,120
the perfect gene from his head.

2277
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,220
I thought he was dead now.

2278
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,380
I told you before.

2279
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,400
Do not leave the corpse dead.

2280
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,320
If it does not become putrescent,

2281
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,680
the experiment will not work

2282
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,820
and he will come back to life.

2283
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:06,900
Oh, my God.

2284
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,120
Chop off its head

2285
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,640
and stuff its mouth with garlic.

2286
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:10,400
It's too late.

2287
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,240
It's too late.

2288
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,840
He's already eaten all the garlic

2289
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,920
and chopped off his own head.

2290
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,040
He's coming back to life.

2291
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,060
And here he is,

2292
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,600
lonesome cowboy Dave on guitar.

2293
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,880
Lonesome cowboy Dave

2294
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,460
and the...

2295
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,500
The corruptigating worms.

2296
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,000
There can only be one.

2297
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,220
There can only be

2298
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,000
one.

2299
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,520
One.

2300
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,660
As Dave,

2301
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,400
the resurrected Dave,

2302
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,920
without the perfect gene

2303
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,720
and with his head now hollowed out,

2304
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:44,900
emptied and expanded.

2305
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,260
And his corpus callosum,

2306
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,460
the perfect conical shape

2307
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,680
so that we can impact it

2308
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,260
with all the necessary documents.

2309
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,520
He now freed

2310
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,800
from his...

2311
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:55,820
...tasks.

2312
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,420
He rides off into the sunset

2313
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,140
on his tricycle.

2314
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,100
Side-settled,

2315
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,360
wearing that funny conical hat,

2316
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,140
thinking somehow

2317
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,760
he has made it.

2318
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,880
But in fact,

2319
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,240
it's made him.

2320
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:16,880
...

2321
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:24,820
...

2322
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:25,300
...

2323
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:25,420
...

2324
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:25,420


2325
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:25,420


2326
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,020
...

2327
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:28,580
...

2328
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,720
...

2329
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:32,980
...

2330
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:33,200
...

2331
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,000
...

2332
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:36,000


2333
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,320
Ever feel like you should have just said

2334
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,100
no to that magic

2335
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,940
carpet ride to electric

2336
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:45,920
ladyland?

2337
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:49,140
Ever feel so heavy?

2338
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,220
Ever feel like your thighs

2339
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:53,120
are so sick your muscles are

2340
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,860
weak and your neck

2341
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:55,000
...

2342
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:55,520
...

2343
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,000
...

2344
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,440
...

2345
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2346
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2347
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2348
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2349
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2350
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2351
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2352
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2353
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2354
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2355
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2356
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2357
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2358
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2359
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2360
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2361
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2362
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2363
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2364
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2365
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2366
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:58,440


2367
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,140
Ever feel disconnected and

2368
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,560
completely alone?

2369
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:03,060
Ever feel

2370
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:05,960
corrugated worms

2371
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,100
burrowing through your

2372
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:08,620
follicles?

2373
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:09,220
Well,

2374
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:10,940
if you have,

2375
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,960
we can't help you a bit.

2376
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,980
But we can help you get

2377
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,120
your mind off of it.

2378
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,080
So just write for free information

2379
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,000

00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:23,980

Got that pencil?

2384
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:32,440
about how to make money

2385
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,200
off of your corruptigating worms

2386
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,260
