1
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,700
Friends, this is where we have to seize fire.

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,500
One God, one aim, one destiny, one race.

3
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,860
Especially in this political climate right now where it's getting pretty ugly.

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:33,520
I mean, I know the Democrats and the Republicans are just apple and oranges.

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,740
But I think the Republican bearer right now, torchbearer, he is toxic.

6
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,400
And that's where I'm going to stop talking right now.

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,200
I've never in all of my 30-something years that I've been in this nation.

8
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,200
It's horrible.

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,840
It's just horrible.

10
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,480
It's plain horrible.

11
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,540
So we have to remember that we're all brothers and sisters.

12
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,680
And that's it.

13
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,380
Somebody else is one of just, you know, we've gone that road before.

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,060
And we're trying to undo it.

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,820
And we're doing pretty good at trying to overcome it.

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,360
But for somebody to appeal to the lowest common denominator and it's not good,

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
that is where things are really bad.

18
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,000
And we, you know, I wish,

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,660
I wish Jill Stein or a third party can come in.

20
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,820
Nobody's really thrilled about both candidates.

21
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,840
At this point, it's just a lesser of two evils, you know.

22
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,980
What do you chime in here?

23
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:37,840
What do you think?

24
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:46,140
Well, Charleston, I've been around, I've been around this country since 1953.

25
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,920
And I can remember the late 50s.

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,200
Yes.

27
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,820
And it's about like it was in the late 50s.

28
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:55,980
Yeah.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,520
We've gone back in time.

30
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,840
Yeah.

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,520
About 52 years, I'd say.

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,160
Yes.

33
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,320
You know, it's Georgia.

34
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,380
Who's running for president?

35
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,100
George Wallace.

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,800
Yeah.

37
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,700
George Wallace.

38
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,440
Yes.

39
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,620
Yes.

40
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,480
Who, by the way, eventually saw the light and changed, you know, before he, you know,

41
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,660
he left this earth.

42
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,180
But to see a millionaire who's somebody who's, by the way, he made his money ripping a whole

43
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,220
bunch of people off.

44
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,900
You're preaching to the saved, man.

45
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,860
You know, I've been following that guy's career since long before he got into politics,

46
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,060
long before he was on television.

47
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,860
Some of us actually knew who he was because we've been reading the papers that long.

48
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,440
Yes.

49
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:39,900
Yes.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But other people have no memory or a short memory or a very, very selective memory.

51
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,680
Yeah.

52
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:48,900
Yeah.

53
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,820
Yeah.

54
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,420
But don't worry.

55
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,620
Putin will stay out of the Ukraine.

56
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,460
He won't go in there.

57
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,380
He won't go in there.

58
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:55,820
Not going to happen.

59
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:55,980
Not going to happen.

60
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:55,980


61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,620
People won't go in there.

62
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,480
Let's hope not.

63
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,580
Let's hope not.

64
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,360
If he's right, if Trump is right about that, then he's just as right about every other

65
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,740
word that's coming out of his mouth.

66
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,160
Wow.

67
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,120
Wow.

68
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,060
I guess so.

69
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:06,900
Yeah.

70
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,280
You know, yeah.

71
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,620
I just, I just hope this is not the time for, I really want to see you, I want to see the

72
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,720
political system reform.

73
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,220
I want to see a viable third option.

74
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,620
But at this point, it's going to throw it into the other.

75
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,360
And we remember what happened in 2000.

76
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,260
With W, you know.

77
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:36,820
Well, I, on the second time that Bush, W, George W. Bush ran, I thought, well, there's no way

78
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,760
that Americans are so dumb they'll make that mistake again.

79
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,360
So I voted a third party.

80
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:41,840
Yeah.

81
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,580
Bush won by one vote.

82
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,680
So I admit it.

83
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,580
It's my fault.

84
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,920
The second Bush administration was all on me because I was dumb enough to have faith

85
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,760
that Americans wouldn't be that dumb.

86
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,720
So I wasted my vote.

87
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,100
Yeah.

88
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,520
Yeah.

89
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,820
I think it was Ralph Nader or some other insane guy at the time.

90
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,680
But it was, I was, I just, I wanted to vote for another party.

91
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,060
Yeah.

92
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,220
It was a dumb idea.

93
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:04,820
Yeah.

94
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,440
You know.

95
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,180
Yeah.

96
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,080
I threw it away.

97
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,260
And people are making the same mistake again.

98
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,340
They're talking about, I mean, they're making the same mistake again.

99
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,020
And you know what?

100
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,600
Nobody's really crazy about Hillary.

101
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,440
But then again, I don't even know why they hate her so much.

102
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,620
I think it's just.

103
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,500
Because she's a woman, you know, that they're dumping this whole.

104
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:28,860
And that's.

105
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,580
Well, remember that she's been lied about since the 90s.

106
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,620
There really is a vast right wing conspiracy that routinely.

107
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,420
I don't know if exactly they're lying because they believe it within their enclosed bubble.

108
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:42,920
Yes.

109
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:51,220
They believe anything bad about her and anything bad about their guy somehow becomes, well,

110
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,600
he was just kidding or what?

111
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,520
He changed his mind.

112
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:53,920
Yes.

113
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,600
Well, he's not.

114
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,560
He's not going to tell you his secret plans because he's not stupid.

115
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,160
Yeah.

116
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,280
Yeah, he is.

117
00:04:59,340 --> 00:04:59,820
Actually.

118
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,220
Yeah.

119
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:00,740
I'm afraid.

120
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,220
Yeah.

121
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,780
It's horrible to see.

122
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,460
Well, somebody has to represent the dumb asses, too.

123
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,660
I'm telling you.

124
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,540
I'm just surprised that there are so many illiterate dumb asses out there.

125
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,440
I'm really shocked.

126
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,160
Absolutely.

127
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,780
I just can't believe that they're doing this to a woman.

128
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,040
And it's all because of her really gender.

129
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,380
You know, all this nonsense.

130
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,400
Well, no.

131
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,920
A lot of it is because she's a liberal.

132
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,860
And liberal is one of the dirty words in the English language now.

133
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,740
Thanks to, oh, was that the liberal controlled media that made it into a dirty word?

134
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,960
Oh, how did that happen?

135
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,480
Yeah.

136
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,340
How contradictory.

137
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,260
Yeah.

138
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,240
How convoluted.

139
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:40,420
Yeah.

140
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,580
How convoluted.

141
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,040
And that's, you know, yeah, that's sad.

142
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,400
But anyway, it's time to move on into our slack, I think, according to our time.

143
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,000
But WCSB Cleveland, we'll keep on fighting the good fight.

144
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,060
I don't really see any lesser evil and what I don't think Hillary's evil guy.

145
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,740
We know who is not Hillary.

146
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,320
Really?

147
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,000
Really?

148
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,700
You know, that's my opinion.

149
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,560
Then some people can disagree with it.

150
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,260
But no, you can't disagree anymore.

151
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,460
We changed the Constitution.

152
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,620
That man has no right to criticize me.

153
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,540
As Trump said.

154
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,020
Yeah.

155
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,540
He has no right to say I didn't read the Constitution.

156
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,340
Absolutely.

157
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,520
Well, actually, in the Constitution.

158
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,480
It says he does have a right.

159
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,300
So maybe you didn't read it, Mr. Trump.

160
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:27,740
He didn't read it.

161
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,680
And, you know, come on.

162
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,640
Come on.

163
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,240
Let's put this woman through.

164
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,320
It's about time.

165
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:34,780
Jeez.

166
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,600
It's about time we see a woman president in this country.

167
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,600
Why are they rising up against her?

168
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:47,360
Well, I'd rather see Melania Trump because she's a hooker.

169
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,300
She is.

170
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,620
And Hillary is just, she's the sea hag.

171
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,240
Yeah.

172
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,580
She's so ugly.

173
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,860
Her hair looks bad.

174
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,540
Yeah.

175
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,980
Where's my other beard?

176
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,540
They're coming out of the woodwork.

177
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,880
My pants don't fit no more.

178
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,680
Why did that button pop off my pants?

179
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,180
Gay-itude is a lifestyle choice.

180
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,360
But obesity, that's just genetics.

181
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,320
I can't help it.

182
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,660
Yeah.

183
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,580
Yeah.

184
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,120
Yeah.

185
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,660
Yeah.

186
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,400
I know those rednecks pretty well, man.

187
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,500
But let's leave things of this world behind

188
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,960
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack

189
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,520
from the church of the subgenius.

190
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,960
Release your hold on this tenuous practical joke they call reality.

191
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,100
Let your body be sucked out of your ears

192
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,120
for we're going to take you deep, deep inside yourself

193
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,560
to the place of silence in the noise.

194
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,960
We're going deep.

195
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,300
Deeper.

196
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,240
Deeper into your consciousness.

197
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,080
Down past the membranes of the fabric of your very mind.

198
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,240
We bore down into the cranium,

199
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,800
drilling through the irrelevant memories of job and normality,

200
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,940
piercing the squamous epizootis rolling around

201
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,000
in the hollowed-out inside of the skull,

202
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,820
scraping along the edges of the birth canal

203
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,900
and stretching the imagination gland until it pops.

204
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,940
Now, let all your thoughts drain out through the brain.

205
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,300
Tumble down through the sinuses, slide down the esophagus,

206
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,880
and finally, let them plunge to the base of the soul itself,

207
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,700
located in the lowest organ of your body, the foot gland.

208
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,460
And finally, an idea, a key, an ultimate plan

209
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,100
is born at the very bottom of your mind.

210
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,640
And it is Bob.

211
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,340
Let there be slack.

212
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,320
See www.subgenius.com

213
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,360
It sounds great.

214
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,800
What sounds great?

215
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,320
To bring all your drugs,

216
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,760
bring all your froth,

217
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,000
you know, go on the radio.

218
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,660
You think it's hot?

219
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,060
I think it's bitter cold.

220
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,960
What is the matter?

221
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,920
Hal feels the wind blowing between his shows.

222
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:03,620
That's right.

223
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,980
Show last night, show before night, show after night.

224
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,680
The shows, I'm being pelted.

225
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,580
The shows, man.

226
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,400
There he is.

227
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,680
Hal's coming out on stage now.

228
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,820
Hey, everybody.

229
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,300
Hi, it's me.

230
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,520
I've got shows.

231
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,180
Do I?

232
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,340
It's the real man.

233
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,140
Oh, my.

234
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
He looks younger than I thought.

235
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,500
What?

236
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,280
Have you been listening to music that has passed its expiration date?

237
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,200
You need new vibrations in your ears.

238
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:50,300
Yeah.

239
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,840
ears, foreheads, they don't wait!

240
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,920
The rhythm's human dancing,

241
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,740
got you feeling less than fresh.

242
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,480
It's a catchy little number,

243
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,480
we think that you should catch!

244
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,100
Don't let your soundtrack sound stale.

245
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,780
Here's a rhythm that'll make you wag your tail.

246
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,040
Please give your complete attention!

247
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,840
Vanity is a new submission!

248
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,500
Close the lid!

249
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,420
Open the door!

250
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,780
Give me a kiss!

251
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,480
Give me some more!

252
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,420
Tell me what to do!

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,440
I like it when you tell me what to do!

254
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,320
Tell me what to do!

255
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,320
I like it when you tell me what to do!

256
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,080
Put it in front!

257
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,940
Put it back!

258
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,140
Tell me what you need!

259
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,140
I like it like that!

260
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,040
Tell me what to do!

261
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,140
I like it when you tell me what to do!

262
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,060
Tell me what to do!

263
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,200
Tell me what to do!

264
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,060
I like it when you tell me what to do!

265
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,860
Should I do it now?

266
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,820
Should I do it then?

267
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,120
Should I do it at all?

268
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,680
Should I do it again?

269
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,840
Tell me what to do!

270
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,880
I like it when you tell me what to do!

271
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,900
Tell me what to do

272
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,980
I like it when you tell me what to do

273
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,540
Should I move it here?

274
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,540
Should I bring it back?

275
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,400
Should I move it there?

276
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,340
Should I paint it black?

277
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,460
Tell me what to do

278
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,520
I like it when you tell me what to do

279
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,460
Tell me what to do

280
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,500
I like it when you tell me what to do

281
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,300
world

282
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,260
I like it when things go well

283
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:57,740
I like it when I

284
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,560
I like it when I

285
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,060
Like it when I

286
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:07,800
I like it when I

287
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:31,580
Thank you.

288
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,440
Thank you.

289
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,340
Thank you.

290
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,800
Thank you.

291
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,020
Thank you.

292
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,820
And I think it's going to be a long, long time.

293
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,840
The touchdown brings me around again to find I'm not the man they think I am.

294
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,160
Oh, no, no, no.

295
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,400
I'm Bob.

296
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,760
Starts with a B.

297
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,160
What is it, man?

298
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,400
I knew it when I came in here, man.

299
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,800
Ends with a B.

300
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,480
No, don't tell me.

301
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,700
Ten seconds, Bob.

302
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:45,760
Bob!

303
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,200
Bob!

304
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,500
Bob!

305
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,340
Bob!

306
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,200
Bob!

307
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,240
Bob!

308
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:49,780
Bob!

309
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,340
Well, it's really great to have you on the show tonight, Bob.

310
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,880
Well, it isn't that far out in Sullivan right on, Bob.

311
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,680
I am willing to admit that war has accomplished much in the projects of the world.

312
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:21,860
I'm willing to admit that there are certain crises in the forward march of history.

313
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,920
I'm willing to admit that perhaps it could not have been missed in any other way than by the force.

314
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:44,620
I'm willing to admit that war developed certain heroic traits in men

315
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,680
and furnishes a test for the evidence of the highest character.

316
00:17:51,980 --> 00:18:00,560
I am willing to admit that during the Revolution of 1917,

317
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:05,280
the revolutionaries did not have a choice but to cause most of the economic crisis that plagued our flesh,

318
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,280


319
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,300
As such, I don't think statues belong to men,

320
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,620
but to fathers and children.

321
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:21,600
Those who sacred arelaughing are paying more than everything they deserve!

322
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:21,840
.

323
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,900
La la la la la

324
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,760
Truffle trail sandwich

325
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,760
Sandwich or champagne

326
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,420
I am in so good a shot

327
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:00,520
With the eddies and currents in that protoplasm, the probe could drift thousands of kilometers.

328
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,780
I am the jolly happy scrotum

329
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:09,260
I come from jolly scrotum land

330
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,380
He is the happy jolly scrotum

331
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,600
He thinks that genitals are grand

332
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:31,220
I found a very strange tie-in between Alistair Crowley and the Church of the Subgenius.

333
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,180
I mean, of course it has...

334
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,840
A lot of people do.

335
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,380
Yeah, but I mean, the whole thing with the kid.

336
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,680
I mean, there's something really big behind that.

337
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,040
Mm-hmm.

338
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,300
Um...

339
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,940
I just...

340
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,720
I just don't even know what to say about it.

341
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,220
The kid?

342
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,240
Yeah, at the end of that movie with the Manly P. Hall guy in the 50s,

343
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,420
where that Bob figure comes in.

344
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,080
They're in the court with Vincent Price.

345
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,500
Um...

346
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,720
What was the name of that movie?

347
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,700
It's about the history of mankind.

348
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,720
And the movie ends with...

349
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,640
It's called The History of Mankind.

350
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,560
The History of Mankind.

351
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,760
Yeah, and the movie ends with that kid.

352
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,240
And the kid...

353
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,360
The little baby.

354
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,480
Yeah.

355
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,860
And that's Bob.

356
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,800
Yeah, the Bob's in The Stranger, too.

357
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,720
Orson Welles played Bob in that one.

358
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,480
I think I have a...

359
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,340
You don't see any Eddie.

360
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,580
That's not a grand thing.

361
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,860
Somebody, I mean, I will.

362
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,080
I will put together some sort of new occult order.

363
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,640
Eddie Haskell?

364
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,220
Yeah.

365
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,480
Someone tried it with Beaver, right?

366
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,380
Someone tried the Church of Beaver Cleaver.

367
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:33,940
Yeah.

368
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,860
The Church of Jainer.

369
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,280
Doesn't work.

370
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:35,800
Yeah.

371
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,220
It only works...

372
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,020
Those are all the Church of the Earth.

373
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,980
The Church of the Subgenius is the only one that really actually works.

374
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,860
Oh, I see the computers flashing in the position.

375
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,640
Well, I've noticed some strange coincidences with Bob's kids.

376
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,180
Rod and...

377
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,240
Was it Rod and Todd?

378
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,860
Or Rod and...

379
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,560
Bib and Bob.

380
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,020
No, it's mentioned in one of the books.

381
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,320
I mean, I see this extension of it based on his kid.

382
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,400
And it ties into Rahur Kruit.

383
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,840
Right, right.

384
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,640
The crowned and conquering child.

385
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,420
Exactly.

386
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,100
And Tyche.

387
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,200
See, now that's...

388
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,360
You've picked those up.

389
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,000
You've picked that up.

390
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,640
And you're right.

391
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:24,700
There's a lot of, you know, stitching together of concepts maybe previously developed in other places.

392
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,740
I mean, I even signed up to the...

393
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,400
So thanks.

394
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,080
Yes, exactly.

395
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,860
Because he's listening to KPFA.

396
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,160
God, I love this show.

397
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,060
I love the books.

398
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,800
KPFA.org.

399
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,220
And I don't see Eddie Paye anywhere.

400
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,000
I don't see anybody else coming in.

401
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,580
Yeah, what's going on?

402
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,100
Should we change over to the other show format?

403
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,520
Okay, we just did.

404
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,480
Now it's totally different.

405
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,060
I've got...

406
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,500
I've got...

407
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,180
I've got...

408
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,800
Let people know.

409
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:04,620
Like those sad guys driving around with their RVs.

410
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,100
Sized off the hockey ring.

411
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,600
Of the hockey arena.

412
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,180
Capable of holding...

413
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,980
30,000 people inside of it.

414
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,500
Like those the NHL teams play.

415
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,160
You know.

416
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,760
In the middle of Colorado desert.

417
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,460
Max's mom capacity.

418
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,420
Uh, 30,000 people, yes?

419
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,840
Not all of them wearing skates, you know.

420
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,260
Some of them only have sticks.

421
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,860
Some of them even don't have sticks.

422
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,100
They just kick the puck around with their feet.

423
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,900
Looking toenails.

424
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,800
Infested with fungus.

425
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,480
And other smelly food disease.

426
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,540
Think about the odor on a hot summer day.

427
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,300
.

428
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:03,420
.

429
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,440
.

430
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,440


431
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,440


432
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,440


433
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,440


434
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,440


435
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,440


436
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,440


437
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,040
.

438
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,040


439
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,580
.

440
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:13,580


441
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:16,700
.

442
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,220
.

443
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,980
Now getting back to the business at hand.

444
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,100
Bob is here.

445
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:28,400
And I don't know Bob that well, but I do know him to be a guy that just never stops coming.

446
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,840
And that's certainly good, but...

447
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,020
And let's see if we can get somewhere else with Bob.

448
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,820
And see who he is.

449
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,880
I'm interested.

450
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,320
I know a lot of you people know him.

451
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,180
Because he's been around a long time.

452
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,800
And some of you may have grown up with him somehow.

453
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,240
I've always respected Bob.

454
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,660
He's a difficult man to talk to.

455
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,160
And uh...

456
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,640
So let's take a listen to Bob.

457
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,460
.

458
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,300
Basically, Bob.

459
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,040
Watch in front of...

460
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,980
It was a diplomat.

461
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,280
So the whole audience was blue haired.

462
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:00,780
Bob being you.

463
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,200
Bob being third person.

464
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,300
I'm like...

465
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:03,880
.

466
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,200
.

467
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,960
Bob wouldn't do that.

468
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,680
That's not right for Bob.

469
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,400
I'd like to talk to Bob about that.

470
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,780
Bob's not comfortable talking about this.

471
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,600
Because when Bob leaves here, he puts his...

472
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:17,960
What do you call it?

473
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,120
A glock in the car.

474
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,000
Yeah, the glock.

475
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,400
Yeah.

476
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,220
Or a nine.

477
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,280
Do they still use nines?

478
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,540
Bob's people do.

479
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,040
They do?

480
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
They use nines?

481
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:25,960
And glocks.

482
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,300
Nines and glocks and a blunt.

483
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:27,880
And a blunt.

484
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,280
For the other thing.

485
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:29,960
.

486
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,720
For that other thing.

487
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,000
.

488
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,020
Bob's doing...

489
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,560
You're opening Bob.

490
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:35,340
.

491
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,080
.

492
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,220
.

493
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:36,220


494
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:36,220


495
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:36,220


496
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:36,220


497
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:36,220


498
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:36,660
.

499
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:36,960
.

500
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,020
.

501
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,080
.

502
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,100
.

503
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,180
.

504
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,240
.

505
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,260
.

506
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:37,300
.

507
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:37,320
.

508
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:37,360
.

509
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:37,500
.

510
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:37,500


511
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:37,540
.

512
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:37,620
.

513
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:37,620


514
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:37,640
.

515
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:37,720
.

516
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:39,840
.

517
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,220
.

518
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,380
.

519
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:41,380


520
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:41,380


521
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,180
.

522
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,440
.

523
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,700
.

524
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,200
.

525
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,320
.

526
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:47,420
.

527
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:47,620
.

528
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,760
.

529
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,560
.

530
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:07,580
.

531
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,420
.

532
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:08,440
.

533
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:09,820
.

534
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,180
me

535
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,820
I wanna die for God

536
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,880
I wanna

537
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,460
die in a holy

538
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,180
hole and drown

539
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,480
the faint boys in the

540
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,840
normal state

541
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,460
if we have to

542
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,320
if we have to

543
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,560
God can make them die

544
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,740
and we'll all

545
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,780
come back older

546
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,320
and we'll all

547
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,320
come back older

548
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,120
and we'll all

549
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,320
come back

550
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,740
older men

551
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,060
all over the

552
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,020
world

553
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,220
sing a gut to another kid

554
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,740
praise God

555
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,760
fill me Bob

556
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,240
I wanna die for

557
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:57,680
God

558
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,160
I wanna find us

559
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,520
the holy war

560
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,960
fulfill the faint boys

561
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,700
and the normal

562
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,600
state

563
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,720
if we have to

564
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,560
if we have to

565
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,480
we can make them

566
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,020
die and we'll all

567
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,680
come back older

568
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,420
and we'll all

569
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,180
come out older

570
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,220
men if we don't

571
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,700
come out older

572
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,340
men there ain't no

573
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,760
reason why

574
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,120
all rob's

575
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,680
chisms they will

576
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,660
fall beneath our

577
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,000
feet

578
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,000


579
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,200
men we'll all

580
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,260
come back older

581
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,280
men in victory

582
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,860
the race

583
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,140
music

584
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,800
music

585
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,380
music

586
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,540
music

587
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,120
music

588
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,220
music

589
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:53,460
music

590
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:53,720
music

591
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,880

600
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,280


601
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,280


602
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,280


603
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,280


604
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,280


605
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,280


606
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,820
I think it kind of scared him that we showed up this door.

607
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,300
But it's a complete mystery.

608
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,140
Yeah, Doug 3, we were numbering the Dugs then.

609
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:44,020
Before that song, there was a collage somewhere else with Bob,

610
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,080
with people talking.

611
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,420
That was cut up by Reverend Dr. Royal Decapitator.

612
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,360
We heard some puzzling evidence radio show,

613
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,100
and I think that was the large calling in to the puzzling evidence show

614
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,820
with Puzzling Evidence Dr. Howell and Dr. Philodrumon,

615
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,660
that we, of course, heard the Rudy Schwartz project

616
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:10,220
with a song called Surrey with the Durable Gelatin Sock.

617
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:18,740
The short piece called Bob Squad was by the Great Groovy Neptune.

618
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,560
There was a cut up, I don't know, Jethro Tull or something.

619
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,160
That was done by Lee Murr.

620
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,080
The 26th.

621
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:34,220
The 27-minute, or 27-second version of Oh Canada was the Psychoskeletons.

622
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,840
That was an old one, but it was preceded by a new instrumental

623
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,000
by the Psychoskeletons called New Shoes.

624
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,120
And the song and stuff at the very beginning, Tell Me What to Do,

625
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:51,460
was the band Exposed Four Heads,

626
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,800
who we'll be seeing at the Devotional soon,

627
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,780
August.

628
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,580
19th and 20th, I think.

629
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,240
And also the fantastic Plastics are going to be playing there.

630
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,700
I may have a bunch of bands, a bunch of real good bands.

631
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:12,060
The Spud Boys with Reverend Angry Larry standing in for Bob Mother's Ball.

632
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,620
What?

633
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,280
Although Bob Mother's Ball is also going to be there.

634
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:15,800
What?

635
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,820
Well, you didn't know Reverend Angry Larry is in the Spud Boys now.

636
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,040
I did not know that.

637
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,320
Yeah.

638
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,460
He's going to be doing their guitar parts.

639
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,780
Oh, man, that's going to be the best Spud Boys ever.

640
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,820
Well, the Spud Boys are always the best Spud Boys ever.

641
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,760
They only get to play together once a year.

642
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,140
I know.

643
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,800
So this will be interesting.

644
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:42,100
Now, aha, this deck here was placed on single play mode.

645
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,700
We don't like single play.

646
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,360
We don't like single play.

647
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,640
So we'll go up to seven.

648
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,240
Bernard Herrmann music there in the background.

649
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,200
Yes, yes.

650
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,580
Bernard Herrmann.

651
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:06,120
I'm going to probably keep that beginning of the show there where African Abstract went kind of long.

652
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,200
Because I started ranting about Trump.

653
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,740
And don't get me started.

654
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,620
Oops.

655
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,120
Too late.

656
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:21,220
In fact, you know, I've decided that Big Sister isn't the lesser of two evils.

657
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,520
Actually, I love Big Sister.

658
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,760
And Big Sister loves me.

659
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,640
And I know that because I'm hot.

660
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,720
I mean, I really it's actually we're very sweaty here.

661
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,860
Wouldn't you agree, Princess?

662
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,280
It's a bit clammy here.

663
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:39,520
Yeah.

664
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,940
The air conditioning seems to be off and and it's hot in the station.

665
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,860
And Hillary got me hot.

666
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,860
I mean, Big Sister.

667
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,060
Big Sister got me so hot.

668
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:55,800
And it wasn't it wasn't a professionalism of her presentation or so much.

669
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,080
It was just she dared to say.

670
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,480
Four words.

671
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:06,280
The filthiest sentence I've heard anybody in the mainstream media say in a long time.

672
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,620
Well, it was four.

673
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:14,180
It was a sentence of four words, but it had the one dirtiest word in the media.

674
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,140
She said she was looking at me across the television ocean right right at my eyes.

675
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,360
And she goes, I believe in science.

676
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,080
I believe in science.

677
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,080


678
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,080


679
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,080


680
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,080


681
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,080


682
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:35,060
And I said, man, fluids just started coming out of my body right then and there.

683
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:35,780
You saw it.

684
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,620
I saw it.

685
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,940
He's not exaggerating.

686
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,120
Right in front of Princess Wee.

687
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,100
I was slobbering.

688
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,060
I was spewing.

689
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,360
I've scrum was all over everywhere.

690
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:52,020
He had scrum everywhere because he was in ecstasy after she said that.

691
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,240
She said that word that dirty, dirty word science.

692
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,820
Now, the next day I noticed that.

693
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:01,420
The conservatives were saying, I know what science means.

694
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:07,140
That's libtard for give make them give all their money to Al Gore.

695
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,980
Because he invented the Internet.

696
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,780
He invented the Internet.

697
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,020
Have you ever heard that?

698
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,580
He did.

699
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,200
He really did.

700
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,220
He invented the Internet.

701
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,380
And.

702
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:26,980
Listeners, if you could see Reverend Stang when he laughs like that, it's almost makes you wet your pants.

703
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,420
My teeth actually buck out and it hurts.

704
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:39,820
I actually physically transform into that redneck that they tried to raise me to be when I was growing up in Fort Worth, Texas.

705
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,020
It's pretty scary, folks.

706
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:47,100
Learning how to how to use gun safety and ride a horse and all that.

707
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:54,720
And I do know gun safety and I do know how to ride a horse and I have a gun and I'm not at all worried.

708
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,580
You know, Obama's had eight years to take our guns away.

709
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:02,320
And all it's resulted is is an eight year gun sale at gun shows.

710
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,780
Not a single gun got touched.

711
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,380
That just proves he's incompetent and arrogant.

712
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:13,800
Actually, arrogant was a new word they learned because they knew that it was not cool to say uppity.

713
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,140
They wanted to say uppity.

714
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,540
But it just, you know, well, I'm sure you can now.

715
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,860
The times have changed.

716
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,980
It's become much more.

717
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:31,760
Well, you just can't stop them from from talking nasty, saying words like science.

718
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,380
You know, science really means when a libtard says science.

719
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:41,500
So what that means is you give all your money to Al Gore again and again because it's like the summer.

720
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,120
I'm surprised when summer's hot.

721
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,840
I can't believe it.

722
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:50,640
Oh, because liberalism is a mental illness.

723
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,700
Let me spell that for you.

724
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,960
M.I.N.

725
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:53,960


726
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,480
T.L.E.

727
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,980
E.L.L.

728
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,600
N.I.S.S.

729
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,340
Mental illness because they're illiterates.

730
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:03,900
Ignorant.

731
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,120
It's so ignorant.

732
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,600
But so you can't talk to a libtard because they already made up their mind.

733
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
You show them the facts.

734
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:10,560
That's right.

735
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,580
Hillary killed those four people and cackled about it over drinks.

736
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,340
Yes, she did.

737
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:23,500
And you try to tell them that and they just they just look at you and they don't even continue the conversation.

738
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,020
They don't try to argue with you.

739
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,060
They just still go ahead and vote.

740
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,900
But they won't be allowed to do that for long because after we get Mr.

741
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,360
Trump in there, then we're going to be singing a different song.

742
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,840
Then when you go to vote, you only get to vote for the smart people like him.

743
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,120
And he's the only smart one.

744
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,160
I'd say that I was smart.

745
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,800
But when I say what he says, it just sounds stupid.

746
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,720
Putin won't go in there.

747
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,380
Putin won't go into Ukraine.

748
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,320
See, it sounds stupid when I say it.

749
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,560
Because two years ago, he already did invade the Ukraine.

750
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,180
But see, Trump was just leading them on.

751
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,220
He's trying to make them think he doesn't know what's going on.

752
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,020
But that's because he's outsmarting them, see.

753
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,960
And they can't tell sarcasm.

754
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,560
He says he wants Russia to destroy the Democrats.

755
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,640
That's not anti-American.

756
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,920
He's just being funny.

757
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:15,960
Right, of course.

758
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,660
Because I do too.

759
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,820
I want all of them to die.

760
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,740
I want her locked up.

761
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,280
Because I'm an alcoholic and I don't have a job.

762
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:34,200
And it's the fault of the media and the libtards and those Clintons that did this to me.

763
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,580
Because they invented ISIS.

764
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,820
Because they made it weak.

765
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,720
They made us weak.

766
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,520
They invented it to bring down America.

767
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,140
Because they're all muslims.

768
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,400
Don't you laugh at my bug-eyed face, woman.

769
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,460
You're not supposed to be uppity like that.

770
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,000
Y'all should be seeing this.

771
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,200
If you would see this, you would be wetting your pants.

772
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:55,860
Quit being so arrogant, woman.

773
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,100
Shut your mouth.

774
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,000
Oh, she's kidding.

775
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,000
She just about hit me.

776
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,440
I'm so whipped.

777
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,820
I love you, big sister.

778
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,700
But really, I mean, that one word.

779
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,100
Science.

780
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,640
That's what you call emergentile subgenius pornography.

781
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,360
A strong woman talking about science.

782
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,240
That's so nasty.

783
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,780
Uh-oh.

784
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,540
Now I'm turning into Philo, turning into the Joker.

785
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,860
But somebody has to balance Philo.

786
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,960
Somebody has to be the balance.

787
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,280
That's right.

788
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,520
That's right.

789
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,000
That's me.

790
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,040
You put us on a teeter-totter, I don't know who'd win.

791
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,820
Because he'd probably cheat.

792
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,240
He would cheat.

793
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,440
He'd bounce and bounce until he cheated.

794
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,280
That's not cheating.

795
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,240
He'd think of some other way to cheat.

796
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:11,940
Before we even got to the playground, he would have put a lead weight on the bottom of my end of the teeter-totter.

797
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,720
And then he'd convince me to sit there.

798
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,780
Oh, this is a better end.

799
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,800
You know, I'm so generous.

800
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,840
That Philo drunk.

801
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,400
You can't trust a subgenius.

802
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,820
Except to lie or to disobey you.

803
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,320
And that's how you get him to do stuff.

804
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:33,500
You just tell him not to do something.

805
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,200
God, it worked like gangbusters at X-Day.

806
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,340
Only it backfired.

807
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,920
Only the problem was I was the one who cheated.

808
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,980
And he said not to do something.

809
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:43,820
And it backfired.

810
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,500
But we've already talked about that over and over again.

811
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,840
Or will.

812
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:54,420
And I've gotten so insecure about repeating myself.

813
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,380
I'm afraid to say much of anything.

814
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,080
Because how do I know I haven't already said it the last five shows in a row?

815
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,420
See, I did.

816
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,320
Didn't I just say, just what I'm saying now?

817
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,320
I know I said that.

818
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,420
Yeah, you probably did.

819
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,120
I should just quit.

820
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,060
I was going to ask Susie the floozy.

821
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,740
Should I quit?

822
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,540
Because I'm going deaf and I can't remember anything anymore.

823
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,460
I'm just an old man.

824
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,880
Maybe I should quit while I'm ahead.

825
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,160
Or before I get any much too much further behind.

826
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,100
You know, there's something missing from this picture.

827
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,640
I think I know.

828
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,360
I think I know the thing that's missing.

829
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,440
And it starts with a D.

830
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,600
No, it starts with an L.

831
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,500
Well, yeah, there's an L in there too.

832
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,200
And a C.

833
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:39,700
But.

834
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,080
L-C-D.

835
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,400
That's what I write down in my little notes.

836
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:46,800
Gaze.

837
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,060
But.

838
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,720
Oh, and yeah, I missed that on my notes on that puzzling evidence clip.

839
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,560
I think that was the large who's from Finland.

840
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,140
Yes.

841
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,140
And has an accent.

842
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,580
It did sound like the large.

843
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,300
And I think it was the large imitating Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

844
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,800
He said, even said something about eat our smelly feet or something.

845
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,360
That sounds just like something Dave would say.

846
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,440
He doesn't have to try.

847
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,420
He's kind of like the Finnish.

848
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:09,680
He's kind of like the Finnish.

849
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:09,680


850
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:09,680


851
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:09,680


852
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:09,680


853
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:09,680


854
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:09,680


855
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:09,680


856
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:09,820
And the language.

857
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,080
Dave.

858
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,020
Naturally.

859
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,120
Without trying.

860
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,820
We decided that when we met him.

861
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,000
He achieved achieving this, but without trying.

862
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,840
Well actually as Bob can do that.

863
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,460
When we met him, thanks to Tanya and Bucky.

864
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,460
Yeah.

865
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,860
And we can't even tell if they're listening because we can no longer see the flags of

866
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,900
the listening countries or their 90s as they walk past the camera.

867
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,520
No, but praise Tanya and Bucky anyway.

868
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:39,680
Sounds good.

869
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,800
So, well, I think I'm going to cut back to music because that's what I would do normally.

870
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,440
Because we have this song by the Fantastic Plastics.

871
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:56,140
I can't understand the lyrics to anything anymore because of my deepness.

872
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,020
So I hope there's no cuss words in here.

873
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,020
But they're such a nice couple.

874
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,980
I think it was a couple when we saw them.

875
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,980
And she's so pretty.

876
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,320
She looks just like a stewardess from 1965.

877
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,080
I'm not kidding either.

878
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,740
And I remember stewardesses in 1965.

879
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,960
They were all females then.

880
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,740
Isn't that funny?

881
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,300
That's why they were called stewardesses.

882
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:25,280
But see, the men had to move in and wanted equal pay.

883
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,320
Not just those.

884
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:04,700
So I just want you all to be happy that you performed to this 1,000 bucks bill,

885
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,480
because we've received a recordnad new record.

886
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:05,480


887
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:05,480


888
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:05,500
it doesn't matter which number you got.

889
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:05,560
The more you rock it, the faster you get on.

890
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:05,560


891
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:05,560


892
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:05,560


893
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:05,580
You're welcome.

894
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:05,680
He's the best.

895
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:05,680


896
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:06,840
And remember,

897
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,080
you're not stupid.

898
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,320
I knew you so good

899
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,580
I knew you so good

900
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,760
Mr. Computer

901
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,440
Mr. Computer

902
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:37,080
I work in a factory

903
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,860
Factory

904
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:43,080
And I build the machinery

905
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,020
Machinery

906
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,320
And I knew you so good

907
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,640
I knew you so good

908
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,320
I knew you so good

909
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,560
I knew you so good

910
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,540
Mr. Computer

911
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,580
Mr. Computer

912
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,420
Ditto, ditto

913
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,700
It's so simple, yeah, yeah

914
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,440
Ditto, ditto

915
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,640
It's so simple, yeah, yeah

916
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,700
Ones and zeros in your head

917
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,700
Add them up, you'll soon be dead

918
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,140
It's so simple with a

919
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,060
Ditto, ditto

920
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:37,060


921
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:37,060


922
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,360
Ditto, ditto

923
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,600
Yeah, yeah

924
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,840
My database

925
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,340
Told yours off

926
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,060
Then my computer

927
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,660
Shut right off

928
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,580
Oh no

929
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,040
My computer shut right off?

930
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,020
That was the Fantastic Plastics

931
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,560
And they will be performing

932
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,820
At the devotional

933
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,640
And Princess Wee

934
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,720
Made a little phone call

935
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,160
And reminded the Rewardian

936
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,960
That it is, in fact

937
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,960
Time to call the show

938
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,020
What an idiot I was

939
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,120
I thought it was

940
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,040
About ten after nine

941
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:26,520
He said was

942
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,180
This is our Dave

943
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,360
He's here with us now

944
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,320
I thought it was

945
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,620
About ten minutes after nine

946
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,240
I was like, well

947
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,460
I better start getting ready

948
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,020
Pretty soon

949
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,480
And then I get this call

950
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,280
From We Are Dose

951
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,160
Saying it's forty minutes

952
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:39,960
After the hour

953
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,580
Which, are you using

954
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,740
The sundial in your backyard

955
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,860
At nine-thirty at night

956
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,500
Or the sundial in your

957
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,720
Front yard at nine-thirty

958
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,740
Those things where the sand

959
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:52,460
Goes, you turn them

960
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,040
Upside down

961
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,360
The sand goes up backwards

962
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:56,840
An hourglass

963
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,100
An hourglass

964
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,040
An hourglass, yeah

965
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,560
I'm wearing one right now

966
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,360
It feels like a sausage

967
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,060
Or something

968
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,700
Stuck in the side of my head

969
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,240
I don't know

970
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,340
Maybe that was the reason

971
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,620
Why I dysfunculated

972
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,120
I didn't mean it

973
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:11,800
I really didn't

974
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,640
Was there something important

975
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,540
We were talking about

976
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,980
That I missed even that too?

977
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,760
Yeah, you missed

978
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,160
A Finnish subgenius

979
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,660
From Finland

980
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,640
Calling into the

981
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,720
Puzzling Evidence show

982
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,120
And imitating you

983
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,260
Oh, that's very good

984
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:26,940
Because I just

985
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,480
I just wrote me a story

986
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,540
About a Finnish monument

987
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,060
Which is listing to the left

988
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,460
That's not a political statement either

989
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,380
It's just the way it is

990
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,400
A Finnish historical monument

991
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,640
Of all the immigrants

992
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,640
In Fairport Harbor

993
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,560
Got eliminated by the wind

994
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:44,620
Goodness

995
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:44,920
Something

996
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,120
That doesn't sound good

997
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:47,460
I don't know

998
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,300
I just shaved my scrotum

999
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,360
What do I know about anything?

1000
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,080
You know, I guess

1001
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,340
We played a song about that too

1002
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,300
There has been a song

1003
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,200
About a scrotum this evening, Dave

1004
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,520
There was a song about

1005
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,480
See, I'm synchronistically lapsed out

1006
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,100
And stuck right in

1007
00:45:59,100 --> 00:45:59,880
Even though I was

1008
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,840
Where did I go for 25 minutes?

1009
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,960
Then it makes no sense to me

1010
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,680
I don't know

1011
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,140
Well, that was the good part of the show

1012
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,820
No, that was the empty part

1013
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,340
With no Dave in

1014
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,640
Actually, we had

1015
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,300
Charleston Okafor on earlier

1016
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,460
Because his show

1017
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,400
Kind of lapsed over

1018
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,780
Because he asked me what I thought

1019
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,440
Right as his show was ending

1020
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,140
And I started answering the question

1021
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,640
And it turned into another

1022
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,440
Five or ten minute discussion

1023
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,480
Oh, wow

1024
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,680
You have a lot of thoughts then, don't you?

1025
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,900
Well, no

1026
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,220
I was utilizing the thoughts of

1027
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,760
The people I grew up with

1028
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,140
In Fort Worth, Texas

1029
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,560
I'm able to tap into that

1030
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,200
And I can actually think

1031
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:49,740
Like

1032
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,700
A chimpanzee

1033
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,420
I would say

1034
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,040
It's a close call, yes

1035
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,360
What are those?

1036
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,540
Trimpanzees

1037
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:02,180
What are they called?

1038
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,640
Trimpanzees

1039
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,680
That's a new simian genus

1040
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:08,160
I get mixed up with the orangutans

1041
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,500
Because they also have that orange tone to them

1042
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,100
But really

1043
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,520
They're not the same as the ones on Monkey's Retreat

1044
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,920
Or whatever they called it in Spain

1045
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,720
Or what's the name of a planet of the eight

1046
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,600
I knew J. Fred Muggs

1047
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,540
And you, Mr. Trump, are no J. Fred Muggs

1048
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,120
Think like a trumpanzee

1049
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,360
Trumpanzee

1050
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,300
I knew Jojo the Monkey Boy

1051
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,680
And you, Mr. Trump, are no Jojo the Monkey Boy

1052
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,580
That might sound funny on paper

1053
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,800
But you know it could be true

1054
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,580
He could be Jojo the Monkey Boy's

1055
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,380
Distant caller

1056
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,580
There's possibility in this

1057
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,640
You must rescind your operations

1058
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,300
And refract on every

1059
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,980
Single total possibility

1060
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,200
Where would such an orangutan-like creature

1061
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,780
Have actually come from?

1062
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,440
Everybody knows

1063
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,460
Oh, Dad gave a million bucks to start his own business

1064
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,400
But where was he before that?

1065
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:05,600
Was he in the Chicago Zoo?

1066
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,800
Was he in the Bronx Zoo somewhere

1067
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,700
Trying to hide now?

1068
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,820
Or what was he doing?

1069
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,160
Man

1070
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,760
Eating bananas

1071
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,400
That's all we know

1072
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,940
Actually, there's a lot we know

1073
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,440
And the funny thing is

1074
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,760
My question has now been answered

1075
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,840
I've been wondering

1076
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,620
For months now

1077
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,040
Okay, when is the real

1078
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,520
Slapdown going to start?

1079
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,160
Because they've been handling this guy with kid gloves

1080
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,520
They've been just

1081
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,960
Giving him a pass on everything

1082
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,480
When do the gloves come off?

1083
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,460
And when do they pull out the old footage?

1084
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:44,680
When do they start pulling out the old lawsuits?

1085
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,400
When do they pull out all the

1086
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,840
And by golly

1087
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,140
It has started

1088
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:49,740
Yes

1089
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,020
And it started with the

1090
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:55,260
The King Ape himself

1091
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,500
Insisting that

1092
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,600
Even though he knows

1093
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,820
Doesn't know Putin

1094
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,680
Putin ain't gonna go in there

1095
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,020
He ain't gonna go in

1096
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:05,680
And if he does go in there

1097
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:05,680


1098
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,220
If he did go in

1099
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:06,680
That was all

1100
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,220
It was Obama was with him

1101
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:08,920
When that happened

1102
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,620
But it's okay

1103
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,680
Everything's gonna be okay

1104
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,300
Russia can be our friend

1105
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,080
Well, yeah

1106
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,600
What about all this Russia turmoil

1107
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,320
Versus these people

1108
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,680
The kind of people you grew up with

1109
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,340
In Fort Worth

1110
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,780
Who have hair on the back of their head

1111
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,400
I knew Peter the Great

1112
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,840
The Tsar of Russia

1113
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,300
And you, Mr. Trump

1114
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,740
Are no Peter the Great

1115
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:30,800
Well

1116
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,900
Ivan, a terrible possibly

1117
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,200
There's a lot more in common there

1118
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:35,660
With Ivan the Great

1119
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:36,160
Ivan the Terrible

1120
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,580
On the other hand

1121
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,100
I'm probably talking over the heads

1122
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:39,800
Of some people

1123
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,580
Because not everybody has a degree

1124
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,440
In Russian history

1125
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,380
Like I do

1126
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,980
Well, I have a degree in social sciences

1127
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,400
And I studied Soviet politics

1128
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,300
For three years

1129
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,680
While I was, you know

1130
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,260
Doddling around being an art major

1131
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,280
Not knowing what I was doing

1132
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,300
Except for playing in bands

1133
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,500
And drawing goofy pictures

1134
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,100
Oh, so that's what happened to you

1135
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,200
And I would say that

1136
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,660
On Facebook

1137
00:49:58,660 --> 00:49:59,620
They just recently

1138
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,220
Had a cartoon

1139
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,440
Not a cartoon

1140
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,020
There was a picture of a monkey

1141
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,580
And underneath it

1142
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,880
There was these Russian ships

1143
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,740
That they claimed were used as

1144
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,400
An enneagram

1145
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,840
A fosterator of our military prowess

1146
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,000
Like at the Democratic National Convention

1147
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,540
You know, has that ever proven

1148
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,720
To be a real news story?

1149
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:19,900
Oh, wait

1150
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:20,820
Because somebody

1151
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,860
Out the window of the convention

1152
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,080
They could see some

1153
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,280
Supposedly Russian ships

1154
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,220
And they formed a code

1155
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,700
Or something

1156
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:30,360
What was that?

1157
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,260
I didn't get that

1158
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,300
Well, no

1159
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,540
They showed ships

1160
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:35,280
Our military

1161
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,180
Might and action

1162
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,620
Here on the Pacific

1163
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:38,620
And then

1164
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,700
They show a bunch of ships

1165
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,440
And they're Russian ships

1166
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,020
And the idea was

1167
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:45,460
That some person

1168
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,560
Working in PR

1169
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,240
For the Democratic National Convention

1170
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,440
Went looking for some pictures

1171
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,700
Of American destroyers

1172
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,400
And battleships

1173
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,700
And put in

1174
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,100
A bunch of Russian ones

1175
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:55,500
Oh

1176
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,980
It seems so hard to believe

1177
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,620
That anybody could be so stupid

1178
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,560
And be so high up on the

1179
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,160
You know

1180
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,040
It doesn't matter

1181
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:03,880
He's not going to go into the Ukraine anyway

1182
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,420
Yeah

1183
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,640
Well, none of us are really hard

1184
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,800
But speculatively

1185
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,960
We're all kind of going to

1186
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,200
Be thinking about it

1187
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,620
Forever

1188
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,020
I didn't hear the thing

1189
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,340
About the Russian ships

1190
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,280
And to tell the truth

1191
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,700
If I'd seen them on television

1192
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,020
I wouldn't have jumped up

1193
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:18,200
And said

1194
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,160
Well, that's a bunch of damn Russian ships

1195
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,540
I just

1196
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:22,560
It's like

1197
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,140
If it's a long shot

1198
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,120
Of a battleship

1199
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,080
It's just going to look like

1200
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,400
A damn battleship to me

1201
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,580
They don't paint them

1202
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,680
In red, white, and blue

1203
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,820
Yeah, it's very suspect

1204
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:33,680
I wanted to see

1205
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,140
If it emerged

1206
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,260
Into a true news story

1207
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,220
It's just one of those

1208
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,620
Facebook news stories

1209
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:38,820
Oh, give me a break

1210
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,100
I can write Facebook

1211
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,440
In fact, I do it all the time

1212
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,180
I know, yeah

1213
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,540
You ever heard of Bob Dobbs?

1214
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,120
He's this guru

1215
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:44,960
From outer space

1216
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,720
He can do anything

1217
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,720
Give me money

1218
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,400
Yeah, that's why I asked you

1219
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:49,900
Because you're

1220
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:50,460
You're great

1221
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,020
You're great for

1222
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:52,600
You're

1223
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,060
You're great for

1224
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:54,960
And you're

1225
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,060
You're great ability

1226
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,400
To rescind

1227
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,380
The following message

1228
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,840
No, you're great ability

1229
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,060
To follow through

1230
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,000
On things like that

1231
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,120
Okay

1232
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,420
Director

1233
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,900
Jesus is my rind

1234
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,380
Jesus is my rind

1235
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:13,960
He protects me all the time

1236
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,640
I'm soft on the inside

1237
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,200
But he is my rind

1238
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,720
Yeah, he is your rind

1239
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,400
And I'm a grapefruit

1240
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,480
And without him

1241
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,480
Life's a grind

1242
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,580
Life's a grind

1243
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,980
And Jesus is my rind

1244
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:26,240
Yes

1245
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,520
Because I'm just a grapefruit boy

1246
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,420
See, we wrote a new Devo song

1247
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,100
Right there

1248
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,320
Yeah

1249
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,660
I'm glad you did

1250
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,180
We'll have to tell

1251
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,480
We'll have to tell Jerry Casale

1252
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:34,900
About that

1253
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,240
Well, I'm glad you did

1254
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,920
We owe it all to the sign

1255
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,420
That had the F missing

1256
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,340
From friends

1257
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,060
Oh, yeah

1258
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:40,660
That's right

1259
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,340
We were in Texas

1260
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:42,320
We drove by a church

1261
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,100
That said

1262
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,500
Jesus is your rind

1263
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,800
Because the F fell off

1264
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,560
And they never knew

1265
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,020
About the E to begin with

1266
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,240
It was pretty good

1267
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,940
Jesus is my rind

1268
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:54,280
Yeah

1269
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,340
He's my grapefruit

1270
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,100
Jesus and everything

1271
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,020
I love that

1272
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,220
He's my squeezer

1273
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,700
Jesus is my squeezer

1274
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,460
Now, this is

1275
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,240
Friends, listeners

1276
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,820
We don't have any problem

1277
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:04,700
With

1278
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:05,740
Jesus

1279
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,120
Not at all

1280
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:08,180
Or

1281
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,000
The Buddha

1282
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,400
Lucifer

1283
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,020
For that matter

1284
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:11,920
Or, well, no

1285
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,060
Lucifer or Bob

1286
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,540
It's just their fan club

1287
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,680
Don't you know

1288
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:17,760
How those Bobbies are?

1289
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,020
They're just so obnoxious

1290
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,680
They won't shut up about it

1291
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,160
So, you know

1292
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,340
Fanatics are the same

1293
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,400
In every

1294
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,840
In every culture

1295
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,360
And if you're a subgenius minister

1296
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,080
And you have followers

1297
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,840
Do you know what your job

1298
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,680
Is to do?

1299
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:34,680


1300
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:34,680


1301
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:37,740
In the face of those followers?

1302
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:41,340
To show them what subgeniuses do

1303
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:42,720
To followers?

1304
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,740
I think you know

1305
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,420
That's why it's spelled

1306
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,240
Job

1307
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,100
It's spelled J-A-W-B

1308
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,740
Because we want jobbers

1309
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,380
We want people who can jabber

1310
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,540
And who can just

1311
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:57,000
Endlessly go on about the power

1312
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,220
The mystique

1313
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,920
The intellectual capacity

1314
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,160
Of Bob

1315
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,120
The earnest one

1316
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,960
Always done for your earnest

1317
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,500
I'm sorry

1318
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,160
I'm sorry

1319
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,440
We're looking for people

1320
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,460
Who like to draw

1321
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:08,660
Flies

1322
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,880
And I did do that

1323
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:10,680
When it X'day

1324
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,920
And I'm not going to do it again

1325
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,120
See, again, Dave

1326
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:13,740
We're having trouble

1327
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,440
Remembering

1328
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,200
What we said

1329
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,200
On which show

1330
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,300
On which rant

1331
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,200
On which week

1332
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,840
And if it has been played yet

1333
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,800
We're looking for people

1334
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,860
Who know how to draw

1335
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,160
And then dot, dot, dot

1336
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:25,700
Flies

1337
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,720
That is so beautiful

1338
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,440
It's ageless

1339
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,500
And that's why

1340
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,280
It will be repeated

1341
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,020
Now and again

1342
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,300
And you can't

1343
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,300
You can't say

1344
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,480
Oh, we said that

1345
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,260
Last week

1346
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,360
We can never say it again

1347
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,600
It must be said

1348
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,420
Every day

1349
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,360
Every week

1350
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,220
We're looking for people

1351
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:43,280
Who like to draw

1352
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:44,680
Customers

1353
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,320
To our

1354
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,420
Shopping cart page

1355
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,460
Yeah, that's it

1356
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:51,640
No

1357
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,780
Remember those comic books

1358
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,540
In the back of every comic book

1359
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,940
The Ripoff Art Institute

1360
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,420
Trump Art School

1361
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,620
I joined them

1362
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,020
Can you draw this pirate?

1363
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,320
Can you draw this parrot?

1364
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:04,460
And you draw this pirate

1365
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:04,640
And you draw

1366
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,800
Really, you know

1367
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,360
Trace it

1368
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,180
And send it to them

1369
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:07,500
And they'd go

1370
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,900
Wow, you're a really great artist

1371
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,320
Send us 30 more dollars

1372
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:10,760
Yeah

1373
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,880
And we'll send you this book

1374
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,740
About how to draw

1375
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,140
You'll be in our art school

1376
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:15,440
Yeah

1377
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,020
I was dumb enough to do that

1378
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:17,720
When I was little

1379
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:18,440
I tried it

1380
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,280
Like

1381
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,380
I'm the world's greatest artist

1382
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:21,880
Man

1383
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,300
Here's a picture of

1384
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,040
Lucifer Hitler

1385
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,980
In a nazi suit

1386
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,300
Because I was interested

1387
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,420
In history at the time

1388
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,780
And I drew a picture

1389
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:32,940
Of Jesus Lucifer

1390
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,000
In a nazi suit

1391
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,300
No, I actually drew the lady

1392
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,200
The one with the

1393
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:38,620
Ski

1394
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,100
Ski list nose

1395
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:41,200
Right

1396
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,280
Yeah, there were several

1397
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,620
Different things you could draw

1398
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:44,760
There was an Indian

1399
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,540
A pirate

1400
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,020
A lady

1401
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:46,980
A bird

1402
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,680
A cute

1403
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:50,800
Like cartoon deer

1404
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:51,660
Bambi

1405
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,400
Actually, a couple of

1406
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,160
I saw on Facebook

1407
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,080
A couple of my

1408
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,760
Professional artist friends

1409
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,340
Did in fact draw that

1410
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,180
And did learn

1411
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,120
From that course

1412
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,000
A little bit

1413
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,440
They probably

1414
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,760
Paid a little bit much

1415
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,360
They could have gotten

1416
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:04,440
A little bit more money

1417
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:04,600
But they were

1418
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:04,600


1419
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,580
You know

1420
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,700
How to draw two circles

1421
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,600
And make them look like

1422
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,200
A fat guy

1423
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,560
And you know

1424
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,200
At the art store

1425
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,340
Those books were a dollar

1426
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,040
Back then

1427
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:15,700
I remember

1428
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,020
I still have one of those books

1429
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,000
I never did

1430
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:18,120
Learn my lessons

1431
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:18,520
Oh yeah, and how much

1432
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,520
Were Mad Magazine's

1433
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,260
Were only a quarter

1434
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:21,140
Remember those days

1435
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:22,260
When they were only a quarter

1436
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,540
And they didn't have ads

1437
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,020
No advertising in Mad Magazine

1438
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,680
Up until about five years ago

1439
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,460
And that was when

1440
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,200
Our subscription lapsed

1441
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:30,640
Yes

1442
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:31,980
Yes

1443
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,660
I think it was actually

1444
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:34,420
Closer to ten years ago

1445
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:34,980
Ten years ago

1446
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,360
But I will take your word for it

1447
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:36,380
Yeah

1448
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,560
You know you may be right

1449
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,580
You may be right

1450
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,620
We originally got a subscription

1451
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,860
To Mad for her nephew

1452
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,440
Because Mad Magazine

1453
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,400
Helps build young bodies

1454
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,700
Twelve different wives

1455
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:51,280
Well actually

1456
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,780
He I think when he was seven

1457
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:54,880
Requested it

1458
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,160
He requested

1459
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,820
But then we got one for us too

1460
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,920
And I got him a subscription then

1461
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,860
And I have maintained it since

1462
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,380
Oh but you didn't maintain

1463
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,240
Our Mad since

1464
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:03,500
No

1465
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,420
I was going to say

1466
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,460
You haven't been maintaining

1467
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,260
Very much

1468
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:06,940
You know I mean

1469
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,020
You're very well either

1470
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,680
Because I heard some stories

1471
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,240
About your screaming out the window

1472
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,540
At all hours of the morning

1473
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,580
So I don't think you've been

1474
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,880
Really involved

1475
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,280
Well now that was because

1476
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,200
That was because

1477
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,240
Back when I was about twelve

1478
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:24,000
Mad doubled as like a playboy

1479
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:28,120
The way the female figure

1480
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,600
Was drawn by some artist

1481
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,180
I'm thinking about you Dave Berg

1482
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:31,360
Oh yeah

1483
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,720
He was a jerk

1484
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,860
Oh he was a jerk

1485
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:36,680
But he could sure draw up dames

1486
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,440
And quite a few

1487
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,660
Oh and by the way

1488
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,560
Jack Davis died

1489
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,860
The great cartoonist Jack Davis

1490
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,100
Died this week

1491
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:50,280
He brought us many Mad Magazine covers

1492
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:54,020
And whole features

1493
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,520
And album covers

1494
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,180
And he was just

1495
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:57,940
He was everywhere

1496
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:00,020
My favorite one was

1497
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,340
The Norman Rockwell takeoff

1498
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:01,340


1499
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:01,340


1500
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:01,340


1501
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:01,340


1502
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:01,340


1503
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:01,340


1504
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:01,340


1505
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:01,340


1506
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:01,340


1507
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:01,340


1508
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:01,340


1509
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:01,340


1510
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:01,340


1511
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:01,340


1512
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,060
Where the man shot off his thumb

1513
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,440
At the Thanksgiving table

1514
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,320
Do you remember that one

1515
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:11,800
That was a Don Martin strip wasn't it

1516
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:12,840
Or are you thinking

1517
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,500
It was a cover

1518
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,580
A cover oh okay

1519
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,100
It was a cover

1520
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:16,800
And it looked like

1521
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,080
The Thanksgiving dinner

1522
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:18,520
The Norman Rockwell

1523
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,480
It was probably painted

1524
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,820
By Kelly Freese

1525
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:21,680
That's right

1526
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,240
Yes

1527
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,120
It was Kelly Freese

1528
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,520
It's strange that we know these names

1529
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,700
In some ways

1530
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,040
But really you know

1531
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,460
When we were twelve years old

1532
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,920
We read every single word

1533
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,860
On those magazines

1534
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,020
Including the artists

1535
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,000
And writers names

1536
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,520
And we remembered stuff

1537
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,920
From back then too

1538
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,460
The funniest response

1539
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,720
We could give to anybody

1540
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,880
Was what me worry

1541
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,400
And look at us now

1542
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,160
We're still worried

1543
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:47,940
And we're worried

1544
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:49,400
No kidding

1545
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,980
Actually I've seen

1546
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,360
A couple of good Mad covers

1547
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,740
Since the Trump Zoo

1548
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,300
Was opened up

1549
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,680
And the cages were unlocked

1550
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,740
And they quit

1551
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:00,440
You know they quit

1552
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:01,920
You know the shovelers

1553
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,040
Quit cleaning up

1554
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,760
After the creatures in there

1555
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,220
Now isn't there something

1556
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,520
About the Trumpster

1557
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,900
As some of the right wing

1558
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,040
People like to call him

1559
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,260
The Trumpster

1560
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:12,840
Didn't he get into

1561
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,880
A disvagary

1562
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,060
With the family

1563
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,800
Of the kid

1564
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,180
Who was a Muslim soldier

1565
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,100
Who saved the rest of the people

1566
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,580
That's been the biggest headlines

1567
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:23,880
For three days

1568
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,740
Yeah

1569
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,400
Well what's why

1570
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,500
Except to the people

1571
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,480
Who hear this show

1572
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,240
Three weeks from now

1573
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:30,440
There's a lot of people

1574
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:30,440


1575
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:30,440


1576
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:30,440


1577
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:30,440


1578
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:30,440


1579
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:30,440


1580
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:30,440


1581
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:30,440


1582
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:30,820
Who are going to be going

1583
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,240
Oh yeah I vaguely remember that

1584
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:32,860
Is that the kid

1585
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,420
That made the clock bomb

1586
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:35,460
In Texas

1587
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:36,880
Or is it

1588
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,440
There was something

1589
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,520
About a Muslim kid

1590
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,660
Or a guy that died

1591
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:40,700
Or some guy that

1592
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,520
Said Trump was a jerk

1593
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:42,840
That's right

1594
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:43,840
I can't remember

1595
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:44,700
Oh well that was

1596
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:45,380
A long time ago

1597
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:46,100
Three weeks ago

1598
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:47,060
Yeah right

1599
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,240
The cycles will have all

1600
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,220
Run through by then

1601
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:49,680
I'm sorry

1602
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,840
We're on WCSB in Cleveland

1603
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:53,780
Sometimes

1604
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,140
But then the same thing

1605
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:58,620
Ends up on WREK Atlanta

1606
00:59:58,620 --> 00:59:59,780
Or WORT

1607
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:00,440
And then we're on

1608
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:00,440


1609
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:00,440


1610
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:00,440


1611
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:00,920
WPAI in Madison

1612
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,660
Or friends I can't remember

1613
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,240
The call signs of

1614
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:13,480
In Knoxville

1615
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,720
And Florida

1616
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,840
You know the town Florida

1617
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,740
Yeah Florida

1618
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:23,620
I've got a list in my briefcase

1619
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,220
Brrr

1620
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,800
WFMU in New Jersey

1621
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,560
Their ghost station

1622
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,320
We were on WFMU

1623
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:30,420
We were on WFMU

1624
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:30,420


1625
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,840
For years and years and years

1626
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:34,700
But then like K&ON in Dallas

1627
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,880
They changed leadership

1628
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:38,840
They changed owners

1629
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:40,060
Concern it

1630
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,040
And since we weren't there

1631
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,060
To do pledge drives

1632
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,260
They cancelled the hour of

1633
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,600
Slack on WFMU

1634
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,520
That was their excuse

1635
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,500
Now it could be that

1636
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,840
The quality of the shows

1637
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,040
That particular year

1638
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,680
Were starting to get a bit

1639
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,920
Raggedy around the edges

1640
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:57,740
Not like now

1641
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,420
But yeah you know what I mean?

1642
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:00,600
It is

1643
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,980
Speaking of which

1644
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,040
My beloved Cleveland listeners

1645
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,860
There's going to be a pledge drive

1646
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,960
In October or November

1647
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,680
And we're not going to be here to do it

1648
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:11,580
And we're going to have to

1649
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,780
I'll have to play the old

1650
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,220
Pledge drive generic show

1651
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,380
And hope that somebody

1652
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,060
Probably Dr. Sinister can help

1653
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,640
To get some money in

1654
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,440
Because you know

1655
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,920
Time things are tight

1656
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,940
And what's also tight is time

1657
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,480
Don't you think we can do a show

1658
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,180
From far away?

1659
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,280
Oh yeah I guess we could

1660
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,420
We could call it. We could do a live show

1661
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,260
And call it in

1662
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,280
I keep forgetting about that

1663
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:32,820
We can phone it in

1664
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:33,960
They have phones in Texas

1665
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,340
Yes they have phones

1666
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,260
Yeah

1667
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,840
I even have one strapped to my hip

1668
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,680
Like a six gun now

1669
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:43,080
Yes we should do a real live

1670
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:44,500
Radiothon show

1671
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,520
So we can appeal to our listeners

1672
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,920
We still need a hostess twinkler

1673
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,840
To expand on the product

1674
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,200
Well we'll twinkle all we can

1675
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,020
Over the phone

1676
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:57,320
Friends you're listening to

1677
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:58,800
The subgenius radio ministry

1678
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,740
Hour of Slack

1679
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:02,000
Number 1581

1680
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,120
And we have to go now

1681
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,860
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1682
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,480
So Dave I have to say

1683
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,380
It's been a short one

1684
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:12,200
But next time you need to wear

1685
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,100
Your alarm watch

1686
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,360
Strapped to your eyeball

1687
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:16,680
Yes I definitely will

1688
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,800
I certainly wanted to be on

1689
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,560
For the entirety

1690
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,680
Because I thought I could

1691
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,160
And actually if I would have called

1692
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,640
Right when I got off work

1693
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,120
I would have made the entirety

1694
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,280
But since it is a short one

1695
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,360
And you know and I know
