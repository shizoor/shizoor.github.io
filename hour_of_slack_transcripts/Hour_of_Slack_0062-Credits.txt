Ladies and gentlemen, please leave your sub-suggested.
We're having operating difficulties, which has necessitated a delay in the beginning
of our Sunday movie, It's a Wonderful Life.
No trouble.
Just get set and get going.
Game on.
Recording.
Everything's going fine.
Okay.
We're out of here.
No problem.


Hello, Bob.
Hi.
Hello, Bob.
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.
Bob.
Bob?
Ray.
Bob.
You can read along with me in your book.
You will notice time to turn the page when you hear R2-D2 beep like this.
Let's begin now.
It was a dark time for the rebellion.
Prepare yourself.
You are about to be remade into a new being
through forbidden knowledge
previously kept secret for centuries
by the jealous priesthoods of many religions.
Caution.
Improper viewing techniques may lead in some persons
to dependency, seizures, cranial fits,
priapic conditions, micturition, sternutation,
subtle glandular mutations,
and in some territories, legal arrest.
Although only a small percentage of playback systems
or their owners have suffered permanent damage
from this signal,
the subgenius foundation incorporated
is not responsible for injuries or damages
inflicted by paranormal events
during tape play mode.
That's your key phrase.
It will trigger the entire message
without your being aware of it.
We are controlling transmission.
However, this brainwave-enfolding signal
is generally harmless
and should actually enhance your learning abilities
during the program.
Special interactive holothonic stereo effects
produced on the internet.

The Ultimate Cerebral Sync Lock Interocitor
are designed to trigger stem cleavage,
or brain division,
between the forebrain and hindbrain.
Using newly discovered break-thinking principles,
the viewer's brainwaves are locked into synchronization
with the tape's underlying suggestions
by means of neuroelectric pulses.
The demons you may see
during the initial hallucination sequence
are not real.
If you do not panic,
this phase will end after a few minutes.
The demons will be revealed.
And what exactly does this do for them?
It will help them forget everything they've learned
and prepares their mind for the slate-like impression,
the imprinting of the true subgenius.
For the next hour, sit quietly
and we will control all that you see and hear.
There is absolutely no other possibility.

A martyr for the cause

Who knew that the first shot
Was gonna be the last shot
But he's got a heart that's white
That can't smoke all through the night
And I know he made me hurt
But you know that
People are squinting
But I know
And he's coming again
Yes, dear friends,
this is Reverend Ivan Stanger
listening to the
Subgenius Radio Ministry
Hour of the Week.
And tonight,
you're listening to
the new record
from Reverend Cleve Duncan
and Slackmaster Cleve
and the Spirit of God,
Bob Ismalo.
He's coming again.
He can save us
from the many and bad
With just a shot
from his mighty side
If only he could make it back
From the land of the dead
By the hand of God
Until that happy day
We can only drink and say
Bob Ismalo
And he's coming again
I know he can make it
Without him we can't take it
We'll lose the pieces of our minds
To the pink boys and the wimps
Until the day we're all alone

We'll see
When he comes back
It'll be a world
We'll go back
Bob Ismalo
And he's coming again

Oh yeah dear friends
Slackmaster Cleave
And the Spurious Jive
Brand new one
A brand new one
I'm going to try to give credits
For the things we're playing
This is still
Well this is Cleave Jr. samples
Doing Harlem Nocturne
In the background
Oh that mighty preacher
Brother Cleave from Boston, Massachusetts
So we've got a gospel opening now
For the show
How about that
Hoo!
That's a mighty
Mighty
Mighty song
Oh yeah
Bob Dobbs was in Las Vegas
He'd been lucky
Again
It's funny
It seemed like he was
Always lucky on the slot machine
But Connie wasn't with him tonight
And he was a
I'm afraid friends
Bob was a little bit drunk
And he was walking along
With his hands in his pockets
Deep in his pockets
And he was thinking to himself
Huh
What do I do now?
Hmm
And right about then
Bob Dobbs was in Las Vegas
In the last minute
Oh yes dear friends
You know what Bob did there
You know I could just play this whole tape all night
You all would be perfectly satisfied
But this is the credits show
The credits for the Subgenius Radio Ministry
Is what it is
For many many shows
I've been meaning to play the credits tape
And we're going to be doing just that
Coming up here in a second
Oh, this is a laid back one.
It won't be for long.
Don't worry about that.
Last Thursday, believe it or not,
I heard the following people say praise Bob on the phone to me personally.
I'm bragging now.
This was Ken Kesey, David Osman of the Fireside Theater,
Robert Crum, R. Crum, the America's greatest cartoonist.
Ooh, Connie Dobbs.
And, oh gosh, who else?
Mark Mothersbaugh.
We had to recruit famous folks.
Oh, and Robert Anton Wilson, who talks with a Brooklyn accent.
I couldn't believe it.
We were recruiting famous weirdos to do blurbs
for the back cover of the new Subgenius book.
But you know what?
You know what's a lot more important than talking to those famous cool guys?
I also had chats with Brother Cleve
and Sterno Dox Kekever of Doctors for Bob
and D.K. Jones.
Who's music, who actually, who turned in those Elvis outtakes
and has a lot more coming up here.
He has a new album out tonight.
And Ahmed Fishmonger and Puzzling Evidence and Lies
and Popes Cecilia.
And see, that's what I mean.
Now, that's what this show's all about.
Finally, I'm going to play that credits tape for the hour of slack.
Ah!
Ah!
, that's not what this is, though.
I don't even need to give credits for this.
Actually, this is the soundtrack from, what is it?
Big Trouble in Little China.
Yeah, not a bad, not a bad, kind of a funny movie.
Anyway, you know, normally you play the credits tape at the end of a show,
but tonight it's going to be at the beginning of a show
because it's pretty much as weird as the rest of the show anyway.
It's ten minutes long and, you know, I could play the credits
or I could play this one extra piece of content.
But no, I'm going to play the credits tape.
So tonight the subject is the makers of the content,
which will be, indeed, the content itself.
And people always ask,
Reverend Stang, do you spend all week on this show?
No, I don't.
I usually spend about four hours on the average.
It was only two hours tonight.
Because I don't make all these tapes.
I just edit these tapes.
I don't even do all the editing.
You talk to Puzzling Evidence and Byron Werner
and some of these other guys.
I make some of them,
but let's just whip this incomprehensible cassette boy
into this lovely,
lovely, smelly slot here
and see what happens.
The voices, tapes, music, and editing
you've been listening to
come from
Lepo Abernathy.
It's Lepo Abernathy.

Who has the biggest network of any of the

And this is Reverend Ivan Stang.
Ah, yes.
Thank you and Praise Bob.
Oh and this is KNON 90.9 FM, Dallas, Texas.
The voice of the people.
And other things.
Praise Bob.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, we will proceed.
I'm going to open the rectum impropter, say-say, cataract.













cavity. I see the ViboVetzer is on. We have firm, steady respiration. We have respiration.
Look at those life signs. All right, give him room, give him room. Yes, that's the,
it's the, it's chain stokes breathing and Darth Vader respiration. Ah, you seem to have
severed the manubrium there. It'll heal, we'll just clip it in with a bone staple. All right,
we're getting the serum moved into place. We need six more units of blood here, doctor.
Six more units and we could use six more units.
Doctor.
Doctor.
Nurses, who are.
Nurses, too.
Yes, and six more units.
Six more units, sir.
All right, have me get around here on the other side of the table. Oh, watch out, will
you drop those cylinders? Nearly hit my feet.
How can you do this?
Excessive evasion.
What do you see here, doctor? There seems to be a white surface studded with, it's studded
with, what would you, they almost look like little seeds.
They almost look like there's something.
Something growing inside of them.
Yes, and this whole chamber is hollow. There's nothing in here.
That's his cranial cavity, doctor. You've gone in the wrong way again.
Indeed, I should have began at the distal instead of the proximal end. Well, we'll just
show him up again.
If this operation doesn't work, what are we going to do with the body?
Well, I've got a little dog who's getting on in years. He wouldn't be anyone's dog
show winner, but he's a fine little doggy and we're going to.
We're going to experiment on him and make him yelp.
Yes, callers, we are putting Wellman back into shape. We are creating the perfect masterpiece
here.
Positively, evidence will be as good as new.
The rebuilt Dini. Once upon a time, in an operating room so deep and dark, there lived
a doctor who tried to put back together you.
All right, I'm doing the best I can. Just keep the comments to a minimum, please. This
is hard enough. I don't want to, you know, I don't want to make this guy look so he wouldn't
want to go out on the beach and take off his bathing suit. You know, I did that. You owe
something to your patient.
Now what happened to the ashes from that cigar?
Here's six units of blood you ordered.
Oh, thanks. Put them in the microwave.
Insulator.
Okay. Now we're going to break the small bones of the right shoulder.
Bablomantic hygiene.
Yeah, messy job. But what we're going to replace with a steel substitute.
Yeah, we're going to make this guy bionic.
Yeah, sure, Hal. This is Dr. Hal Robbins and Gary Gbrogfran. That's Gary in the background.
Far better than he ever were before, might I say.
He'll walk this earth once more.
And you'll hear it right here, right here on the subgenius shows.
Yes, the subgenius show in California.
See, we're going to run into the subgenius shows all over the place here.
In fact, there was even one taped off the air here by Reverend Ann. I don't know.
The next few years were the years of Big John and Sparky.
And they were also years in which I gave more and more attention to the occult as well as to the growing flood of reports of
unidentified flying objects.
There's a tremendous body of literature in these general areas and much of it tends to overlap.
For example, go into it and you'll find links between the legends about Atlantis and the lost continent of Mu on the one hand
and diagnosis and cure of disease through spiritism on the other.
And then, first thing you know, you have Eastern religions and UFOs added to your mixed bag of curiosities.
Well, when Big John and Sparky became famous enough and I became famous enough,
I left Cincinnati and I moved to the New York area.
I leased a big 15-room house on 16 acres of wooded grounds for myself and my family.
And by then I was broadcasting only one hour a week.
I had plenty of time and I had plenty of money to read and to just study everything.
Everything I wanted for a couple of years.
And I began constructing my own religion.
But there was a problem.
And it was...
There always is.
Billy Graham came to New York for a giant crusade.
I talked about the crusade with one of my best drinking buddies, a gal who was the program director of a local radio station.
What radio station might that be?
What do you think about a new batch of talent, John?
It may well actually have been...
A new batch of talent?
Yeah, that's what keeps this subgenius church going, is the new batches of talent,
such as Sister Chris, who does a half-hour slack show on WFMU in New Jersey.
And she said...
And I say to myself now, every day, in every way, I am getting more slack.
Or as they say, I am slackable.
I am fallible.
And I am incorrigible.
I did meet with a vision of Bob in the bookstore in my travels down in the southern part of the USA.
I was in New Orleans.
And in a voodoo store, this card was written by Bartles' dangerous Bob Juju.
The card began to glow and dance about.
Then I saw a vision of the real Bob smiling at me.
And without moving.
And without moving his mouth, he said to me, stop the presses of the mayonnaise.
We need your soul before the...
Before life.
Limited time author, not available in any record store.
I wept.
And began to see right through the pink shell of the conspiracy poops.
Straight through to their gears and manifolds and exhaust systems.
I blew my nose into the clerk's sleeve and left.
Shutting Hosanna to the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.
Eeyay, eeyay, eeyay.
All right.
Two, three, four.
Lunch, one hour.
Joe.
We owe you.
Take it.
Take it.
Take it.
Take it.
Take it.
Take it.
прин têm a cent.

Huh ha.

Uh huh.

Oh.

Yes, friends.
Well, that was D.K. Jones.
I just got a call from somebody
that used to be at the station here going,
what is that you're playing?
And that's D.K. Jones.
He's going, well, where can I get a tape of that?
Friends, I'm afraid that the stuff
that I play on this subgenius hour of slack
is material that comes,
this is done by fellow reverends.
You know, what can I say?
This is part of the church doctrine.
You can't buy a record of that.
Maybe someday you can.
If the conspiracy didn't exist,
if people would give Bob a little bit more credit,
sure, you'd be able to buy all this stuff in the stores.
But, sorry, you just have to write for information.
From Bob at,
get that pencil ready, dear friends,
Bob, P.O. Box,
140306.
Dallas, Texas, 75214.
And all the subgenius hours of slack
all over the country are different,
although this is the one hour of slack
that benefits from all the other hour of slacks.
Praise Bob, praise Bob.
And this is one of them,
from St. Bleepo Abernathy
and St. Seth Deitch in Boston
with their,
actually it's called
the Asylum of Anti-Pinkness show.
This is show number two by them.
I like the graffiti on the wall here, though.
It's true.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
That's something like graffiti goes back 172 years.
This bathroom was in fact first constructed,
it was part of Grand Central Station,
and it was a supplementary bathroom
that was supposed to go into the main part.
But when they took out the third level,
if any of you read about the third level of Grand Central Station.
Oh, of course, the third level, yes.
It was like...
Andrew Carnegie then donated it to MIT College.
Of course, you gotta remember,
this is only a metaphysical bathroom.
This is actually one of the rooms in subgenius purgatory,
this bathroom,
and which we all live in,
though most of us are not aware,
most of us have not had our third nostrils opened to the degree
that we can actually see the porcelain walls
and the booths of this bathroom
that we actually all inhabit.
But we're here at the subgenius asylum of anti-pinkness.
Most people walk through this bathroom all the time.
They have peeled away those shrouds over your eyes
that allow you to understand.
And revel in the penis of it all.
And we are here in the pee room of the gods.
This is the biggest pee room ever.
It stretches off for miles into fog.
I mean, I can see the distance, that line of booths.
How long does that go?
They stopped counting back in 1943
when they lost the last expedition
that went all the way down to the end of it there.
There is, we understand, an attendant
that some people claim to have seen.
The little man with the towel over his arm.
You know what his name is too, don't you?
Ernesto.
Ernesto, he's been here for,
well, he inherited the job from his father and his grandfather.
Yeah, in fact, that David Mamet play,
they made fun of this bathroom, like a steam bath.
Yeah, but it wasn't, see, they, they, they, they,
They thought they were in it, but they weren't.
Yeah, well, see, they made it a steam bath, though,
and we actually know it's a men's room.
And so here it is in the sub-basement of the Walker Memorial.
Hey, Lepo, can we maybe get out of this place for a while?
Can we pull the shrouds back down and make the reality more normal?
Okay, let's see, we have the,
Wait, wait, wait, just make it,
wait, how is it when I press this button here, I don't,
This right here, the,
Ah!
Oh, okay.
Well, we're back, we're back in the studio here, WNBR.
Oh, wow.
I'm sorry, folks, that was a little sudden.
What do you mean WNBR?
Yeah, well,
A bunch of baloney.
Yeah, well, it can be tough.
I think before the show's over, I think we have to return to that room.
But in the meantime, why don't we, like, listen to this?
Not me.
Hello, this is Betty.
And Veronica.
As your Consumer Affairs staff,
we're here to pass on some household factoids to help make your day a little easier.
Factoid number one.
If a light bulb burns out, just hold it under cold running water for two to three minutes.
This often restores them.
Factoid number two.
Used tea bags are great for removing stains from walls or upholstery.
Tape tea bags over stained area.
Remove after one hour.
Wipe with damp sponge.
Factoid number three.
For last-minute clothing tears, try painting along the area with rubber cement.
Avoids a rigid look one always gets from cellophane tape.
And another handy tip.
Melted cheese is best for drawing coffee stains from clothes.
Potatoes soaked over a day.
Aluminumite and ketchup make a fine substitute for tomatoes and recipes.
And fluoride toothpaste can be substituted for roll-on deodorant.
Discontinue use if rash develops.
Stay tuned for other factoids you don't need.
But first, let's see what's happening with the song of the week.
And here's the song of the week.
Thank you, Bob.
Thank you, Bob.
This is Buck Nickit and the Jaybirds.
For cleansing my memory.
Thank you, Bob.
For helping me see.
And Bob, I'll follow you always.
That's right, Bob.
Until that next day.
Thank you, Bob.
Thank you, Bob.
For sending them pills.
Thank you, Bob.
For finding me willing.
Teenage girls.
And Bob, I'll follow you always.
That's right, Bob.
Until that next day.
Ah, yes, dear friend.
See?
All the famous subgeniuses aren't in other states.
This is our beloved, Dallas' own and very beloved Buck Nickit,
Pastor Buck Nickit of the Naked Church of the Subgenius,
with KY Boys singing there in the background.
Horrible, isn't it?
With the Jaybirds.
Oh, what a lovely tune.
But we go to Tennessee.
I like flowers, too.
But not as much as dreams.
I like territories.
Eager to beat type.
I like trees.
I like sensation.
I like me too.
Not as much as trees.
These are the great guys.
I like trees.
I like flowers, too.
It's just about me.
Trees and life and dreams.
I like flowers, too.
And not as much as trees.
Playing .
Trees.
And not as much as trees.
What a blessing.
Trees and life surprise me now.

I like trees, cloning them.





I like flowers too, but not as much as trees.
Here they go.
Trees, I like trees.
I like flowers too, but not as much as trees.
Trees, I like trees.
I like flowers too, but not as much as trees.
Trees, I like trees.
There they go.
I like trees.
I like trees.
I have a message for Robert Tucker.
Wake up!
Dear friends, this is Reverend O.N.A. Cannonby.
We'd like to ask you to please stand up.

He does the little B-O-B song that you hear often in the background on some of these shows,
these ugly, ugly shows.
Where am I?
Where am I?
Where's...
What?
What?
What?
This face!
I've given my life for this face!
You like pain?
No, I like pain.
He likes pain.
The pain comes strictly from my nose.
He likes it.
He likes it.

And Bob likes to scream.
Bob's many teaching techniques.
It's misriding.
He's misriding.
No.
No.
Bob and the word Bob teaches you to re-capture the slack that the conspiracy took away from
you the minute that doctor hit your butt when you were born.
Can you guys give the listeners a definition or some definitions of slack?
Slack by definition is indefinable.
It's an essence that if you have to ask what it is,
you've probably never had it.
Unless you think about it.
Those who say don't know and know.
The difference between slack and no slack was the time you were 14 and finally called that girl up.
And when she knew who you were,
when you identified yourself on the phone,
that was the beginning of slack.
But then again,
getting the date or anything like that was not slack.
It was that moment when suddenly something went the way you wanted it to go without you thinking about it.
It was something that was totally not involved when your feet were involved.
Rather than your head.
Slack is getting things to run smooth without trying.
That's it.
Without trying.
But you give up and you get everything.
It's like a submission of the self to the white overlighting in Buddhism.
The Atman surrenders to the holy oneness without thinking about it.
It's not give to get.
It's give up and get anyway.
It's repent, quit your job and get rich.
That's right.
Or get bad.
Or slack.
Or get even.
Or slack off.
Or get even.
Or get even.
Or get even.
Or get even.
Or get even.
And Bob and Bob will give you slack.
Bob watches over the drunkards, idiots, froth heads and all so do you.
Now once the yuccatism has been evocated.
And that's, and that's G. Gordon Gordon who was talking there along with Poonflang Dammerung and myself in some obscure Austin radio interview.
But, but shucks, you know.
That's what I say.
This is negative land.
They provide a lot of backgrounds.
I ought to mention Byron Werner who sends the found footage type tapes.
A lot of really great old preacher stuff.
Oddball sound effects.
Sort of like this.
Ah, I love it.
Boom.
Put those headphones on you fools if you don't have them on.
Okay kids, the car is packed.
Now go and get your father and we'll look at some more.
New houses.
One thing even more powerful than the beloved pills and froth of Bob.
For he has entrusted his chosen disciples, the doctors for Bob with the safe keeping and the cataclysmic launching of a power object.
A secret weapon compared to which thermonuclear weapons and even the arc of the covenant are but mere objects.
This ancient talisman is every subgenius' guarantee that triumph shall be ours.
For it is nothing less than the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.
Copyright 1986, Doctors for Bob and Hal Rowland.
Arnold Palmer is a clone, children.
A fake reproduction of this head.
This head which should be seen from below.
Stand back, children.
Behold the head!
This head, in fact, existed before the real Arnold Palmer.
This is no satire of Arnold Palmer.
Arnold Palmer is the satanic imitation of this.
Heelhead back!
Bleeding head!
Heelhead back!
Bleeding head!
Standing next to me on the breakfast tea is Arnold Palmer.
The winner of every meal.
major Open title in golf, including the United States Open, the British Open, and the Masters
Tournament. Arnold is going to teach you how to play golf in a new and easy and enjoyable
manner in the comfort of your own living room. Are the feet, Arnie, the only part of the
stance that need to be in position for that good swing we're talking about? Well, no,
Chris. I would say that the head position is also very important. The head is probably
as important as the feet in the stance, and keeping the head in a good, comfortable position
over the ball is very important. Now, you don't want to move the head up or down or
to either side during the swing.
We stand at a crossroad.
The tenuous
slack that a subgenius may occasionally enjoy could be rent to shreds at any moment, for
the human puppets of the elder gods continue their senseless plunge into madness and anti-slack,
dragging us and our whole beloved planet ever closer to the brink of destruction, be it
by the nuclear twist of Jehovah One, ecological disaster, or invasion by hostile aliens. Which
will it be?

I'll take you far away from here soon, but I'm always 난
Because if you use your own throat to swallow it with, what are you going to swallow?
If you swallow your own throat, what are you going to use to swallow it with?
You can't swallow your own throat.
You can't run from your own legs.
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because he's stupid.
You can't hide from God because he's bigger than you.
He's bigger than all infinity.
Help me, somebody.
She ain't got no legs.
Pull the lever and down you go.
Preacher, my legs are on fire.
I need some help.
I need some help.
Praise Dobbs.
You can't digest your own stomach.
How are you going to digest your own stomach?
Not a man or a woman in this auditorium tonight who can digest their own stomach.
You can't digest your own stomach.
You can't swallow your own throat.
You can't run from your own legs.
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because he's stupider than you.
You can't hide from God because he's bigger than you.
He's bigger than all reality.
Help me, somebody.
Pull the lever and down you go.
Preacher, my legs are on fire.
You can't hide from God because he's bigger than you.
Praise Dobbs.
You can't hide from God because he's bigger than you.

It's Bob.
Bob!
Bob!

Bob!
Today, we ain't got enough slack.
We ain't got enough slack.
Slack is what gives us breaks.
Breaks on the car.
Breaks on the train.
Breaks to make you go insane.
And slack is what brings you life.
Life takes away your slack.
Pussy waitresses take away your slack.
Arrogant cashiers take away your slack.
Insensitive employers take away your slack.
Withholding tax takes away your slack.
What gives you back your slack?
What gives you back your slack?
Bob!
Bob!
That's what gives you back your slack.
That's what gives you back your slack.
After I found Bob, I knew that everything was going to be all right from now on.
You see, the aliens had been tampering with my brain
and been making me think that Needy was the only way back.
Oh, but dear friends, you know, once the slack was getting...
Oh, yes, dear friends.
Now, that's Dr. Philo Drummond, and I'm going to cut him off
because just before him, while you were hearing the Pope of all New York,
Mr. M.D., David N. Meyer,
at that same time,
the Pope of all New York called.
I've got him on hold here, I believe on line one,
and it's been a long time since I've done phones,
but let's just see what happens here.
If I push in this...
Pope Meyer.
Pope Smith.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Finally, boy, you don't know what I... what...
Finally, boy, you don't know what I... what...
What an embarrassment I just went through over the air,
but praise Bob, it's worth it!
It is worth it.
Dear friends, this is David N. Meyer,
the second Pope of all New York, all Seattle, and all of Idaho.
Uh, Pacific Northwest.
Pope of the Pacific Northwest.
Well, you know, there's some contention as to who is Pope of New York now,
and I told them they were going to have to battle you on a tight wire,
strung between the World Trade Center buildings,
and I'm waiting to see it.
Well, Reverend...
I'm waiting.
I called because, in fact, your letter, as it should be,
was an inspiration to me in my lonely office here in Rain City,
and you said to me in that letter that you felt I should remain the undefeated Pope of all New York,
and indeed, I have heeded your word, and that I shall be.
Well, Pope Meyer, would you say a few words to our audience as to what it takes to be a Pope,
the fallibility of the Pope?
Well, fundamentally, what it takes to be a Pope is a...
interest in oneself. I think that's the most fundamental thing that renders a pope.
Praise Bob.
A pope has to see that his own slack derives from the attention he can accrue to himself.
Praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob.
Just as he will accrue the ire of the conspiracy via precisely the same path.
If you don't have slack for yourself, how are you going to give slack to others?
Praise Bob. Now, further, what a pope must have is the ability to fail.
To fail often and openly and freely and cleanly, and most importantly, he must be able to fail at being a pope.
He has to, friends. He doesn't, he doesn't, he can't just, it's not a matter of choice.
Bob said he has to fail.
Now, you know, Reverend Stang, you know, there's been a lot of your pointy-headed gimme-bob's that have,
talked a lot about this West Coast tour and would have you believe that the church was falling to pieces
after that West Coast tour, that there was a lot of bad blood between the popes.
But I've given this a great deal of thought, and if ego is what makes a pope,
yea, as mayonnaise makes a tuna sandwich, let me ask you a question.
Let me ask you a question.
Ask it. Fire away.
If you should make a tuna salad and one day, perhaps, you put a bit too much mayonnaise in that tuna salad,
does that, does that...
Does that, Reverend Stang, destroy tuna salad forever?
Does that defile all the tuna salad you may ever eat for the rest of your life?
Nay, nay. In fact, it may well teach an important lesson about tuna salad.
Precisely. Well said. Yea, verily.
Just so, too much ego on a tour does not destroy the church.
Nay, nay.
It just teaches a lesson.
It may cause for a bad time, but, you know, I mean, like Bob teaches,
it, it, the lessons of Bob are not...
Not easily taught. Not indeed.
Bob is a wise old dog.
And you can't, you can't fool him.
That's right.
You cannot fool Bob.
Now, I also wanted to let you know that I know your pledge drive is over,
but I'm calling tonight to pledge one million, yes, one million dollars.
One million, friends...
One million dollars.
Now, one, now, if you don't mind, may I ask, I mean, God,
it sounds like the Seattle, uh, popestry is going real well, then.
Well, of course, I won't be able to pay this million in...
in, you know, one lump.
I'll have to, like, you know, fulfill my pledge in, in installments over a period of time.
It can be scraped off your soul, but it seems to me,
why the church has already scraped so many barnacles off of your soul,
barnacles of love and hate and...
Well, I wanted... I also wanted to let the, uh, the, the listenership of the Hour of Slack know that the...
tonight, yes, a great miracle has passed.
The Pope of all New York and the Pacific Northwest
has finished...
his...
his first fantasy novel.
Praise Bob!
And this fantasy novel will be published by New American Library next October
called Halberd, Dream Warrior.
Uh, let me, let me remind you before we go too much further
that this is a non-profit station.
Well, I...
And, and we therefore can't tell you where to buy that book.
Well, I, I do not mention this for, for crass monetary gain...
And, and shall they be looking for the name, for the, for the name by the author, Pope David N. Meyer?
No, I...
I, at this point, uh, the name of the author is unclear.
Mr. Jay Frank Unclear.
I haven't chosen a name, but the point I wanted to make is...
is I'm not just calling to promote this book.
And you better do it quick because we've got two minutes of show left and a DJ waiting outside.
Well, the point I'm making is this book is chock full of Bob metaphor, Bob simile, Bob analogy, Bob character, and Bob teaching.
And any true student of Bob should buy this book only after he has purchased the book of the subgenius,
published by McGraw-Hill, and he will learn much...
Simon and Schuster now.
Excuse me, Simon and Schuster.
Praise Bob.
Well, do you, do you know that there are two unsold copies of the book of the subgenius in the humor section of the Tower Book here in Seattle?
That is a disgusting thought.
That there's, and there's probably two saveable, but as yet unsaved bums sleeping in cardboard boxes outside that very building...
I think...
...unable to purchase those books...
I think...
...or steal them.
...I think worse than that there are probably 200 self-satisfied, smug, upwardly mobile, yuppie college student pink boys and girls
basking in their own self-satisfaction when in fact if but two of them bought those books, yea, the former 198 could be saved.
Oh, friends, and someday that 144,000 of the chosen shall be lifted up in glory.
On the day of rupture, yes, X-Day 1998, which closes in upon us just as the end of this hour is closing in.
Frightening thought.
Actually, Pope...
Yes?
You know, this is a difficult moment.
It's 12 o'clock midnight here on KNON 90.9 FM in Dallas, Texas, and my, Ron Lindsey, the host of Soul Oldies, Soul Oldies, praise...
...you know, it's a show you could have had in the olden days.
Well, you know, I listened to Mr. Lindsey for a moment or two following you on one of the tapes that you sent me, and truly Mr. Lindsey has a golden throat from the brief amount that I heard.
He sure does, and he likes Bob, too, although he didn't like Bob enough to send that 20 bucks, which is...
Has he tied to Bob that which is Bob?
He does indeed in his own way.
Well, then praise him.
Well, I hear him honking outside.
So I'm going to hop off of this microphone, and so are you.
Praise Bob.
I've been doing the credit show, Pope Meyer.
This has been the credit show of the Church of the Subgenius, giving credit where credit is due.
And here is one man, friends, who certainly is a credit to Bob.
And don't forget, you, listening audience, your credit with Bob is only good if you pay the bill.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
We're going to head downstairs now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hooah!
I'm going to rip my brain asunder and twist the air from my throat.
Yes, dear friends, you found nothing like it till you find Bob.
Because the peace that Bob has told me one day that unless I free myself from meagre, they said,
Doctor, they said, Physician, heal the soul!
We are trying.
Oh, yeah.
Well, it's tough here.
There are too many sound effects.
Look out, look out!
Look out!
Ron is here. Ron Lindsay is here, friends.
Don't go away.
Who are those?
Perhaps this is as good a time as any
to take a few minutes to repeat a message
that seems frequently lost
in the hustle and bustle of our daily activity.
We're hoping to make a lot of money real fast.
And if we can wake up 10 more people out there
in the listening audience,
tonight we will have achieved our goal for the evening.
What is the church's priorities?
Slack. It's something we all need.
And I know that lots of people out there
listening right now are feeling
a terrible shortage of slack.
Slack is something you can't get enough of.
That's right. That's right.
And we can help them to get slack, George.
Man, the world is filled with a bunch of
kooky ideas and concepts about the Bible.
I predict that flying saucers will officially,
land on the lawn of the White House.
That's what I like about the word of God.
There's nothing fakey about this thing, man.
You talk about telling it like it is.
It hangs the dirty wash right out the front bay window
for everybody to see.
That's right.
And we want, when 1998 comes,
we want subgeniuses to be in positions of power
so that this alien technology is not abused.
Hi, girls.
That position.
Hey!
Have fun!
