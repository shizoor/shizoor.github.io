1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
We, the jury, find the defendant guilty.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,060
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,740
No! No! Guilty!

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,680
I'm not me! I'm...

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,820
The Self-Genius Power of Swag!

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,360
Click. Click.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,680
From PR News in Washington, I'm charged with a sex crime against Harvey Weinstein

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,080
and 13 members of a youth soccer team in July of 2006.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,400
President Trump denies all his sexual relationships were consensual.

10
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,360
Alive.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,080
Forecasters are expecting this month in New Mexico,

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,720
the National Interagency Fire Center says it's expected if a summer hits.

13
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,780
FBI agents rated PR News.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,740
The Dow 63-14-75-5-24-24-27.

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,540
PR is in trouble.

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,200
President Trump said you're listening to forcible sexual PR news.

17
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,300
We'll be right back.

18
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,940
Ten for a beanie, head for the fear.

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,500
Micro-webs won't find me here.

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,740
I detect a conspiracy smell.

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,260
I want to know who's at the wheel.

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,940
Who's at the wheel?

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,640
Who's at the reins?

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,980
Who's the little...

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,040
voice inside of my brain

26
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,720
Starts with a whisper

27
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,500
ends with a squeal

28
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,840
I wanna know who's

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,800
at the wheel

30
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,080
Fidel Johnson

31
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,900
Mafia spies, I don't really

32
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,900
think that Kennedy died

33
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,780
They took him to the moon

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,280
that would be so

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,160
but I'm pretty damn sure that they didn't

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,760
really go

37
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,200
Who's at the wheel? Who's at the range?

38
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,860
Who's that little voice

39
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,520
inside of my brain?

40
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,220
Starts with a whisper

41
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,980
ends with a squeal

42
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,360
I wanna know who's

43
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,280
at the wheel

44
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,280
Kenyan Muslims ruin

45
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,700
our lives, Al-Qaeda camps

46
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,360
drones in the sky

47
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,380
A man with a mustache

48
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,700
plotting a deal

49
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,320
I wanna know who's at the wheel

50
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,040
My paranoia

51
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,680
is an avalanche

52
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,160
When I find out I'm on a crap

53
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,120
in my pants

54
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,660
The hard, hard truth

55
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,320
The real, real deal

56
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,740
God, I fear nobody's at the wheel

57
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,440
Who's at the wheel?

58
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,040
Who's at the range?

59
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,760
Who's that little voice

60
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,460
inside of my brain?

61
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,080
Starts with a whisper

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,940
ends with a squeal

63
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,360
I wanna know who's at the wheel

64
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,120
Who's at the wheel?

65
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,880
Who's at the wheel?

66
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,040
Who's at the wheel?

67
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,880
Who's at the wheel?

68
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,480
Who's at the wheel?

69
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:07,820
Who's at the wheel?

70
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,040
Who's at the wheel?

71
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,460
I wanna know who's at the wheel

72
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:12,920
Who's at the wheel?

73
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:25,420
The Rainmakers could not be more timely in this day of Russian propelled boogaloo propaganda, friends.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,640
This...

75
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,920
might be kind of a sad hour of slack because it's not a rerun.

76
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,900
And these are sad times.

77
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:43,300
But we try to put the best face on the troubles and that face is of course the Bob face!

78
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,880
We put our Bob smile on.

79
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,840
The Dobbshead bandana mask helps

80
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,920
if it's in a place crowded with diseased humans.

81
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,360
And we face the future knowing that we're not alone.

82
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,300
We knew all along that the world was ending and only the subgeniuses will be saved.

83
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,420
Oh yes, Bob's promise rings true.

84
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:12,120
He said, Bob said in 1953, these prophetic words.

85
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,140
It's gonna be a bummer, man.

86
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,320
Can anyone say he was wrong in any single detail of that?

87
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,360
It's gonna be a bummer, man.

88
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,000
Prophecy fulfilled.

89
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,780
There'll be lots of music in this episode because there's a long center core of words.

90
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,740
And the music was picked in a thoughtful way to fit the theme.

91
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,820
And about the only music I could think of to perfectly fit the theme was pretty much all by the Rainmakers

92
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,360
plus Jimi Hendrix and some youthful girls and maybe one boy

93
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,420
in a new doctor band called the Sub G Kids.

94
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,740
But before we get too real, let's go see a monster movie

95
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,180
from the album of that same name by the Rainmakers.

96
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,100
It's as true today as it will be tomorrow.

97
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,520
From 2014, actually. The Rainmakers.

98
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,420
They're along the east coast to see the sea,

99
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:37,680
Get some great music out of them,

100
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,360
Toss in your

101
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,360


102
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,180
AUX

103
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,360
BUOT

104
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,380
DP

105
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,140
The details, devils into retail

106
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,480
If your soul's for sale, it's all gonna be gone

107
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,960
Pale politicians hiding in religion

108
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,300
Drag us to the ditch, it's all gonna be gone

109
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,720
In our monster movie

110
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,000
These monsters are real

111
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,220
In our monster movie

112
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,520
In the house on the hill

113
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,020
Ain't no salvation in a money nation

114
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,220
We ain't gonna eat you, it's all gonna be gone

115
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,980
Dollar bills, people, all you people

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,100
Our people gonna get out, it's all gonna be gone

117
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,480
In our monster movie

118
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,800
These monsters are real

119
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,240
In our monster movie

120
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,360
In the house on the hill

121
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,680
Everything about it is a puzzle

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,820
Subtracting sex, we're a puzzle

123
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,920
Nobody believes that it will survive

124
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,380
Party is alive

125
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,140
Bone-up

126
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,220
Bone suffering

127
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,060
Bone suffering

128
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,860
Bone suffering

129
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,040
Bone suffering

130
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,820
Bone suffering

131
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:45,000
Bone , bone, bone, bone, bone

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,540
Bone suffering

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh

134
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,000
Numb out to drama

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,220
In your melodrama

136
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,960
You're the limited

137
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,500
It's all gonna be gone

138
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,920
Jesus ain't a coming

139
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,980
Neither is your mama

140
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,020
Close up for the kill

141
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,280
It's all gonna be gone

142
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,300
In a monster movie

143
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,900
These monsters are real

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,220
In a monster movie

145
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,380
In the house on the hill

146
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:16,980
In a monster movie

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,940
In a monster movie

148
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:46,980
In a monster movie

149
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,260
In a monster movie

150
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,600
In a monster movie

151
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,940
In a monster movie

152
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,260
In a monster movie

153
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:31,580
In a monster movie

154
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:54,240
In a monster movie

155
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,700
In a monster movie

156
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,540
In a monster movie

157
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,000
In a monster movie

158
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,200
In a monster movie

159
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,740
In a monster movie

160
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,980
In a monster movie

161
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,220
In a monster movie

162
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,200
In a monster movie

163
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,260
In a monster movie

164
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,100
In a monster movie

165
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,820
In a monster movie

166
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:23,180
In a monster movie

167
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,580
And Lives Matter was my sister's suggestion.

168
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,280
She likes animals, though.

169
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,020
Probably not a good idea because both sides might shoot me.

170
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:41,280
And then, of course, there's always Slack Lives Matter, which would be an even worse idea.

171
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,340
I am going to go down there and check it out, though.

172
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:52,900
I could stand on one side with a gun, yelling and braying at the juvenile jokes,

173
00:11:53,220 --> 00:12:00,020
and then go over to the other side to bend the knee and bow my head while holding the gun to my own head and crying,

174
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,080
Why? Why? Why?

175
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,680
That was Philo's idea.

176
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,540
I thought of wearing realistic makeup, so I'd look like I'd just been beat all to hell

177
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,260
and hold up a sign.

178
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,040
A sign saying, Black and Blue Lives Matter.

179
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,820
But again, that would probably get me beat up for real by both sides.

180
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,820
They might politely take turns.

181
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,780
After you, demon crap, you go ahead and hit him first.

182
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,060
Oh no, Sir Repuke, I insist you have first go at him.

183
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,160
Well, if you insist.

184
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,900
Have at you, smartass, since you like bruises so much.

185
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,020
Indeed, how dare he besmirch our serious street fight

186
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,320
with the police.

187
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,360
Mirth and levity.

188
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,320
Yeah, I guess at last we found some common ground.

189
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,360
Beat up the smarty pants.

190
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,020
We could bring the dogs.

191
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,380
Everybody loves dogs, especially Claudia, the boxer pit bull,

192
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,480
who's almost completely black all over and so lovable.

193
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,440
And she could wear Black Lives Matters.

194
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,980
No, no, no, that could really be taken the wrong way.

195
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,100
The most common,

196
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,820
the most common response from dumbasses around here

197
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,380
to the whole BLM thing is usually along the lines of,

198
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,640
So you don't think cop lives matter?

199
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,740
You don't think white lives matter?

200
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,320
Why do you bring your hate of your own kind to this nice, peaceful town?

201
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:43,200
The gullible dumbasses are also spreading the probably Russian-originated lie

202
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,440
that, or,

203
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:45,520
or,

204
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:46,660
boogaloo.

205
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:54,780
The lie that violent thug professional looters will be bussed in from the big city in Dallas.

206
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,180
Quite a few people here fall for all that Russian fake anti-thighs hiring propaganda

207
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,120
that they send each other on Facebook.

208
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,680
And Fox math.

209
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:15,420
My immediate family, friends, is multiracial and I personally have had a gun problem.

210
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:21,600
I've been hit by a cop just because I had long hair and a t-shirt on with a flying saucer on it,

211
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,040
which made the cop say,

212
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,280
So you're in a cult?

213
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,940
I've also been chased by rednecks just for having long hair,

214
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,500
although that was 50 years ago.

215
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,780
And nowadays, half the rednecks and bikers have long hair.

216
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,580
Incidentally, I don't use the word redneck as a pejorative.

217
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It just simply means rural outdoor workers,

218
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,480
whose necks get red in the sun.

219
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,480
They call themselves rednecks proudly and I'm half redneck myself.

220
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:58,600
They might also be great historians or writers or musicians or scientists on the side when

221
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,620
they're not on their tractor.

222
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,580
Yeah, my neck is only about half red.

223
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,840
I actually did benefit quite a bit from slavery.

224
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,980
I was born a little more stained with the sins of my ancestors than most, I'm afraid.

225
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:14,980


226
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:14,980


227
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,220
My great-great uncle was Senator Cotton Ed Smith.

228
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:27,720
Wikipedia had this to say about Ellison Durant Cotton Ed Smith.

229
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,480
He was a Democratic Party politician from the U.S. state of South Carolina,

230
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,820
widely known for his virulently racist and segregationist views

231
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,560
and his advocacy of white supremacy.

232
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,980
He represented South Carolina in the United States,

233
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,920
and he was the first Republican to ever be elected to the United States Senate

234
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,740
from 1909 until 1944.

235
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,880
At that point, the Republicans and Democrats kind of traded places.

236
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,480
Anyway, that connection might have helped my father get into Harvard Law School.

237
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,260
Also, my mom was the one who came to this little all Democrat town in the 70s

238
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,100
and convinced them they were all actually Republicans.

239
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,660
But of course, I lived in East Cleveland for 20 years,

240
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:23,200
so at least half the neighbors and the people I worked with had lives that were black and mattered to me.

241
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,800
By the same token, the vast majority of my encounters with police officers have actually been positive.

242
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:39,620
But I've got to run now because I heard there was going to be a prayer vigil for cops in the square in about 20 minutes,

243
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,080
and I want to get out of here.

244
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,240
I'm going to go sniff that out on my way to the post office.

245
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,080
Well, friends, that turned out to be fake news.

246
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,000
There was no prayer vigil for cops or any other kind of prayer vigil,

247
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,660
just the usual fruit stands and little tiny farmer's market.

248
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,700
It was all just big talk.

249
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,920
However, there was a Trump-Pence sign on one stand, which was new.

250
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,160
I bought some fresh eggs from a different stand.

251
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,360
The Trump eggs hatch into little Trumps.

252
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:08,840
Okay.

253
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,820
That was in the morning of Saturday, June 13th.

254
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:17,320
Then we went to the Glen Rose Black Lives Matter vigil.

255
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,860
And what an anticlimax.

256
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,640
Everything was just as I predicted, uneventful.

257
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,540
Only actually it turned out a lot better than I expected.

258
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:36,600
With a couple of ridiculous exceptions, there was no counter protest, no patriot vigilantes with AK-47s.

259
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,680
I counted about 75.

260
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:38,820
I counted about 75.

261
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:44,740
I counted about 75 friendlies respectfully participating in the peaceful vigil in the town square,

262
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,200
listening to several speakers who were mostly Glen Rose citizens.

263
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,720
It was really touching at times and fairly boring at other times.

264
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,740
It was 7 o'clock in the evening and the weather was really nice.

265
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:06,060
Now, strangely, the busloads of hired antifa professional looters and outside agitators

266
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,820
predicted by the skeptical naysayers on the street,

267
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,440
on the Glen Rose Facebook pages, they never showed up.

268
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,840
I'm guessing maybe they had a flat.

269
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,820
Or maybe they got the wrong directions and went towards Glen Rose, Arkansas.

270
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:29,100
Not a single flaming trash can was slung through a single storefront, as was widely predicted.

271
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:38,800
Now, despite the public restrooms being locked, another threat that scandalized many of the pro-fa people on the road,

272
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:38,800


273
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:38,800


274
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:38,800


275
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,640
the local Facebook, viewed as a harbinger of disaster and a Democrat coup,

276
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,800
it was actually a very peaceful demonstration.

277
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,700
None of the roads were blocked, despite the dire predictions of some BLM critics.

278
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,940
And for some reason, parking was no different than any other Saturday evening in the town square.

279
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:07,980
But it was just uncanny how a bunch of young and old and 90% white Glen Rose natives

280
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,640
were able to gather for an hour and acknowledge that there are still some pretty serious disparities

281
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,140
due to racial prejudice that need to be addressed.

282
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:26,360
I guess the antifa must have surrendered and run away due to all the promises by Glen Rose pro-fa conservatives

283
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,540
that there would be, quote,

284
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,280
second amendment presence, unquote,

285
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,980
for the safety of this God-fearing town of 2,400 people.

286
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,960
To protect it from, quote,

287
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:46,080
you know, the teenagers and boomers talking on a little PA about nature and sustainability and justice and all that stuff.

288
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,540
Now, people who wanted to speak were invited up to the courthouse steps where there was a microphone on a stand

289
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,260
and a PA speaker about the size of a shoebox.

290
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,820
I had to stand practically next to the steps just to hear well, but I'm pretty deaf.

291
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,500
And I placed my location recorder near the little speaker,

292
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,520
so I have an okay recording of everything.

293
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,120
Don't worry, I won't force it on the radio audience.

294
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,500
I only really know a few of the folks who were there,

295
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,840
but I introduced myself to some of the organizers.

296
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,340
Since everybody's wearing face masks,

297
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,800
unless they were speaking on the microphone at the time,

298
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,900
it was kind of awkward and required the occasional lower face reveal.

299
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,240
At one point I said to somebody,

300
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,640
I recognize the upper half of your face from Facebook.

301
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:49,520
Now, my buddies on our secret non-Facebook internet club asked me for a live report.

302
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,600
And I told them the short version.

303
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,140
It was touching and boring both.

304
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:01,780
A big loud truck with Trump banners drove past three or four times honking.

305
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,400
That was the full extent of conflict.

306
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,460
It scared Princess Wee though.

307
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:13,000
And of course there were lots of good old boys standing around nearby just sort of observing.

308
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,600
But nobody was waving guns around or any of that.

309
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:26,800
Unlike a little town in Ohio where the locals, the conservative locals,

310
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,980
some of them were convinced that there were paid rioters coming in

311
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,540
and they actually beat up a whole bunch of the peaceniks.

312
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:41,400
But at the Glen Rose thing there was a preacher and a lot of Jesus and love stuff.

313
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:48,280
Which actually kind of made me tear up because there were some really authentic moments that happened.

314
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,660
As I told my buddies,

315
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:59,560
I've never seen so many attractive ladies of all ages in one place in Glen Rose.

316
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,660
Democrats appear to have healthier diets.

317
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,540
And I'm not judging by the turnout at this.

318
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,420
There were three black people there that I know of.

319
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,620
That's a lot for Glen Rose.

320
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:18,720
One was a councilman from Arlington who got on the mic and talked about his experience of racism.

321
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:25,800
One was a local guy who works at the grocery store who hadn't heard anything about this demonstration

322
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,360
and just stumbled upon it.

323
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:34,380
And was flabbergasted to see all these Glen Rose, Texas, small town rednecks acting like this.

324
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,780
And he was like, they actually gave a hoot about this stuff.

325
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,920
And he did a little spontaneous statement which was good.

326
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:50,000
One of the organizers and a few participants were young Latinas or Latinos.

327
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,840
Plain old Americans but not Anglos.

328
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:59,940
But honestly, for all intents and purposes, it was an almost all white, all local, 90% Christian,

329
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,340
probably half Republican, small crowd,

330
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,700
that basically said, here we are and this is what we think.

331
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,080
Black lives matter.

332
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,760
And also, it would be great if all lives got to be mattering equally somehow, someday.

333
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,480
Or something like that.

334
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,160
Basically, it was supposed to be an anti-fear message.

335
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:28,020
So, anyway, although there were a few guys in front of some stores across the street being sarcastic

336
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,820
and fist bumping occasionally,

337
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,320
there were none of the threatened, open carry, second hand,

338
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:37,440
second amendment biker individuals promised by Facebook loudmouth.

339
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,600
Just that one Trump truck that honked.

340
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,960
And somebody revved up their engine real loud a couple of times.

341
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:49,920
So, the promised civil war once again failed to materialize.

342
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,060
Instead, corny as this sounds to say,

343
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,580
for one evening, kind of like at Christmas,

344
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,800
the town square was exuding a vibe of love.

345
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,620
And it was pretty cool.

346
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,440
And gave me some slack.

347
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:19,000
Plus, again, I've never seen so many healthy and attractive looking ladies in the town of Glen Rose all in one place.

348
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:26,020
Now, a friend of mine, who happens to be a Republican,

349
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,800
responded somewhat snarkily to that.

350
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,500
He said,

351
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,820
I saw that report when I posted it on Facebook with pictures.

352
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,120
He said,

353
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,420
Yeah, because of your participation in that protest,

354
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,360
police brutality worldwide has utterly ceased.

355
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,340
Good job.

356
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:50,560
Well, it actually was Facebook brutality that spurred me personally.

357
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:57,060
Juvenile jackasses on the internet making threats to scare a 15 year old

358
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,020
is actually the main reason I went.

359
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:03,960
This vigil was originally started by a 15 year old girl.

360
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,220
And boy, did they bully her.

361
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,720
Oddly enough, the bullies didn't actually show up to speak of.

362
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,320
Oh, but today, the people who weren't there are all busy telling each other

363
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,520
that there were only a dozen people at the pathetic vigil.

364
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,280
And it's just the typical blatant lies.

365
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,500
The truth never fits their childish agendas.

366
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:34,720
Because the complex is actually not quite as simple as they are.

367
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,420
Another crusty old bastard, Dr. Piss-Off, said,

368
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,300
What? You said there was no cussing? WTF?

369
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,520
To which I said,

370
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:55,720
Not cussing is some liberal's way of letting the supposedly all-Christian apple pie opposition

371
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,480
let them be the class.

372
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:03,280
And of course, in vulgar vocabulary challenged troglodytic louts for a change.

373
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,460
Some time ago, I noticed that four-letter vulgarities had become normal

374
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,960
on everything from news headlines to children's cartoons.

375
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:16,580
And many youths and boomers alike can't get through a sentence

376
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:22,420
without using fuck the way uh was once used.

377
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,620
Of course, cussing is necessary.

378
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,620
But as a contrarian emergentile subgenius,

379
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,500
I've consciously switched over to using only archaic quaint euphemisms

380
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,180
from my grandparents' era.

381
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,740
Like, God darn it.

382
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,480
Tarnation.

383
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,720
What in Sam Hill.

384
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,920
Dad blasted.

385
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,560
Con sarnit.

386
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,380
That's just a bunch of hooey.

387
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,080
Etc. Etc.

388
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,860
But, uh,

389
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,280
my favorite response was

390
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,600
one subgenius, Reverend Thorpe, I said,

391
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,000
I think, said, uh,

392
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,540
The public restroom's being locked.

393
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,400
They'd infringed on your right to excremeditate.

394
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,960
I would make a big stink about that.

395
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,100
Yeah, man, then you're stepping on our religion.

396
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,200
And, uh, oh, somebody,

397
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,380
one of the critics on the Glen Rose Facebook page

398
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,260
sarcastically referred to

399
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,600
having accidentally parked in the anti-fa parking lot

400
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,680
with what to him were dramatic consequences.

401
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,840
And I thought, the poor guy, he mistook it

402
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,060
for the pro-fa parking lot.

403
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,600
Pro-fa! Where's that word been our whole lives?

404
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,120
And you're welcome to use it.

405
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,480
Anyway, congratulations to the Glen Rose nice folks

406
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,860
on a successful event.

407
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,360
And I was glad to hear it.

408
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,420
I think we're gonna have to half-meet a lot of them

409
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,320
since half their faces weren't visible.

410
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,520
And, uh, here's a little poem,

411
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,900
uh, just to change the subject.

412
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,100
This is, uh, from Pastor Prime

413
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,480
of the Mutant Mountain Boys band

414
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,140
that we see at the devotionals.

415
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,940
There once was a virus from Wuhan

416
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,800
Infected me while on my futon.

417
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,400
I laid there for weeks

418
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,800
While breathing in squeaks

419
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,960
But healed up by getting my snooze on.

420
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,500
Uh, yes, it is actually terrible.

421
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,060
And now back to our regularly scheduled subgenius programming.

422
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,040
I actually have no idea what that is at this point.

423
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,340
And now this.

424
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,860
Bud Light presents

425
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,280
The subgenius power of swag.

426
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,920
Real American heroes.

427
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,740
Today we salute you, real American heroes.

428
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
Don't stay in too long

429
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,520
Or everyone will shout

430
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,020
Finish quickly and come back.

431
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,280
Is the most important thing

432
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,200
In life for anybody?

433
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,680
The importance ofuges.

434
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:48,040

452
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,660
Sometimes, you gotta say,

453
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,200
FALCON!

454
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,160
From PR News in Washington, I'm, quote, very, very nervous.

455
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,320
I'm so nervous that local health officials are recommending people evacuate.

456
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,340
The Secretary of Veterans Affairs plans to fire four missiles over Japan and into waters around Guam.

457
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:55,460
Japan says it's the first test of a VA's nuclear warhead small enough to fit on a missile.

458
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,660
Congress has been trying for years to make it easier to fire.

459
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:03,800
Now, the county health department says it's seeing the highest air quality readings it's ever recorded.

460
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,200
For people who are vulnerable.

461
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,120
Vulnerable people include pregnant children and anyone over age five.

462
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,260
A Denver court has heard from the turkey.

463
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:18,320
She testified that she groped a former turkey, grabbing her and lifting her turkey skirt.

464
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,860
This turkey says it is unclear whether German turkeys are strained.

465
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:29,120
And Germany has warned its citizens about turkeys after a German turkey was arrested last month in Berlin.

466
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:34,120
The Dow is 2198, 25, 22, 2126.

467
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,480
The turkey says this is PR News.

468
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,140
Spoiler alert, you'll be stunned and strange.

469
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,140


470
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,140


471
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,660
A lot of people think of the oy y.

472
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:11,380


473
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:18,840
They're right

474
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,460
All the preacher men

475
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,220
The politicians

476
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,580
All the critics

477
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,180
And the things

478
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,800
They write

479
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,200
Out of my way

480
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,780
Out of my way

481
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,200
Out of my way

482
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,000
Hot rocket on wrecking day

483
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,900
And this is the call to arms

484
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,260
This is the call to hands

485
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,900
This is the call to the voices

486
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,180
And the minds of the people

487
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,400
In every land

488
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,780
Out of my way

489
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,100
Out of my way

490
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,320
Out of my way

491
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,580
Out of my way

492
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,560
Hot rocket on wrecking day

493
00:33:52,360 --> 00:34:11,760
And we're taking the history test

494
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,380
Of who's baddest and who is best

495
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,180
Lenin the brother

496
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,280
Lenin the son

497
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,360
Lenin the sister

498
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,780
Lenin the communist

499
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,740
Out of my way

500
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,040
Out of my way

501
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,220
Out of my way

502
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,540
Out of my way

503
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,560
Out of my way

504
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,460
Hot rocket on wrecking day

505
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,680
Wrecking day

506
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,540
Put the money in the mattress

507
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,600
Wrecking day

508
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,820
Put your pennies where they go

509
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,040
Wrecking day

510
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,740
Nothing left to believe in

511
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,340
Nothing left to wait for

512
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,280
And getting in to tell the truth

513
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,080
Was like pulling the wind

514
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,260
And I was like

515
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,060
I didn't take back

516
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,060


517
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,460
And I was like

518
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,920
I'm jeans

519
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,420
A long parar

520
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,500
Been pullin' him off

521
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,260
I've got all my

522
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:08,280
Again

523
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:08,280


524
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,360
This isn't the keepy

525
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,560
Get up

526
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,260
Out of my way

527
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,880
Oh, there's nothing left to wait for

528
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,080
Out of my way

529
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,580
Get out of my way

530
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,040
Get out of my way

531
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,280
Out of my way

532
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,760
Out of my way

533
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,980
Out of my way

534
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,220
Out of my way

535
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,780
Out of my way

536
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,300
It's all a lie.

537
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,540
We're being lied to.

538
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,700
Every day.

539
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,260
Every fucking day.

540
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,940
And we think that we have all the answers.

541
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,380
We don't have all the answers.

542
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,300
They won't give us the answers.

543
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,880
So how are we supposed to live our lives?

544
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,560
How are we supposed to live our lives?

545
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,460
I love your titty voice.

546
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,560
You are the answer to my problems.

547
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,980
All the misinformation.

548
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,640
All I need is real people in my life.

549
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,480
Authentic people.

550
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,380
Who have opinions.

551
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,140
Authentic people.

552
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,200
Exactly.

553
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,560
Who are not sheeple.

554
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,100
Sheeple.

555
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,600
Sheeple.

556
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,400
Sheeple.

557
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,240
They're out there.

558
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:47,580
They're out there.

559
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,420
They are.

560
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,480
They are.

561
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:50,880
They are.

562
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,060
And they just keep adding lies.

563
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,300
Lies.

564
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:58,580
Lies.

565
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,680
And for what?

566
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,260
Are they pussy?

567
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,800
I mean like on fire.

568
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,580
To keep us under their sun.

569
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,720
Oh, I know.

570
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,100
Right.

571
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:07,800
Right.

572
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,840
Because if they told the truth, they do.

573
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,020
There would be an uprising.

574
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,480
And kind of there already is.

575
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,060
You know.

576
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,120
All the time was this or that.

577
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:16,820
So.

578
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,240
Because we're kept in the dark.

579
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,180
How many times do we not hear something that's out there?

580
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:29,340
We only hear of these cases because someone was there to witness it.

581
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,060
How much is really being kept from us?

582
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,500
We're never going to know.

583
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,540
Unless maybe you become president and then you get to look at that book.

584
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,220
The book of secrets.

585
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,920
The book of secrets.

586
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:43,320
Yes.

587
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,200
They have all the answers to all the questions.

588
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,980
With all the scientific data to back it up.

589
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,820
You know what?

590
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,140
I just figured out the answer.

591
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:51,660
Uh.

592
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,940
We just gotta find a way to fuck Bo Gates.

593
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,540
He'll tell us everything.

594
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:09,880
That was It's All a Lie, an excerpt from Freedom of Speech by High Priestess Pucci and Reverend

595
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,780
Katana 007.

596
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,700
Who formed the band Sub G Kids.

597
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,660
With Reverend Negative.

598
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:24,020
That siren laden danger song earlier was also by the Sub G Kids.

599
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,800
Who, if I understand correctly, were streaming that on video also while they performed it.

600
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:40,120
And in between the PR news of Lemur and the song Reckoning Day by the Rainmakers from the 70s.

601
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,900
But now.

602
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,320
Well.

603
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,600
I play this long.

604
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:45,920
Jimmy.

605
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,080
Hendrix song every five years or so.

606
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,320
Just in case nobody's heard it.

607
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,960
It's probably been 10 years.

608
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,040
It's still considered one of the best guitar solo songs ever done.

609
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,040
The song Machine Gun by Jimmy Hendrix.

610
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:08,580
And this is the famous Fillmore East New Year's performance that was on the main band of Gypsy's album.

611
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:10,860
Happy New Year.

612
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,460
First of all.

613
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,380
We have about a million or two million more of them.

614
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:16,880
There is this one.

615
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,620
If we can get over this summer.

616
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

617
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,860
We have to dedicate this one to such a draggy scene that's going on.

618
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,620
All the soldiers that are fighting in Chicago and Milwaukee and New York.

619
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:27,960
Oh yes.

620
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,320
And all the soldiers fighting in Vietnam.

621
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,540
About to do a thing called Machine Gun.

622
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:34,760
Machine Gun.

623
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:37,700
.

624
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,840
Machine gun.

625
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,540
Machine gun.

626
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,180
Machine gun.

627
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,180


628
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,180

00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,220
Cross the waters

736
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,320
Steal the guns

737
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,720
Your time has come

738
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,940
Hoping and wishing and praying for a clean escape

739
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:20,780
From the worn out, torn out, burned out same old ways

740
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,500
Your time has come

741
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,300
To kill the giants

742
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,940
To die in peace

743
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,000
Oh, bum

744
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,820
Your time has come

745
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,940
Rock The Nibbles

746
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,440
Feet by Huawei

747
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,040
The Ask Cop

748
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:44,040


749
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:44,260
Into hell

750
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:47,640
Top of Switzerland

751
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,540
제일 진 끄인

752
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:56,540
There we go!

753
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:56,540


754
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:56,540


755
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:56,540


756
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:59,500
Hanging out a rhythm on my 50-50 gallon drum

757
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,760
Your time has come

758
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,620
To rock the ages

759
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,300
One child run

760
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,340
Your time has come

761
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,440
Your time has come

762
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,640
Your time has come

763
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,560
The Rainmakers from Monster Movie

764
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,540
This has been the Hour of Sorrow

765
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:00,000
And I'm Jack Slack from the Church of the Subgenius and others

766

This isn't the only subgenius radio show for instance

769
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,400
It got kind of big praise Bob

770

Subgenius.com

771
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:26,040
Gee I want to try Triology

772
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,580
All the kids are doing it mom

773
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:31,320
There's a Dobbs head in every bar

774
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,140
Yes an embedded Dobbs head of soap

775
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:37,480
Inside a bar of translucent soap

776
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,240
You can see Bob lurking inside

777
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,180
And it tells fortunes

778
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:45,120
As you rotate it swiftly under the water

779
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:50,020
Lathering away the conspiracy smudge and other schmata

780
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,140
If the Dobbs head comes up at the end

781
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,180
In the true perfect pipe placement position

782
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,020
You'll have good luck all day

783
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,620
If it comes up the other way

784
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,860
Twenty more years of winter

785
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:05,240
That's Triology Soaps.com

786
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,600

That's not nonsense

788
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,480
It's almost every scent you can think of

789
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,400
And they all have funny names

790
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:21,140

President Trump, the father of Michael Jackson

795
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,820
Had a significant but complicated role in American music

796
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:41,400
But he brushed aside questions about PR News

797
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,800
The Dow is 24th to 71

798
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,960
In Poland Bill says

Where are you going

820
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,080
Don't you know

821
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:54,080

This war isn't done

Hey Johnny Rev

Where are you going

831
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,840
Even though this battle wasn't won

832
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:09,680
There's nothing worth fighting for

833
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,740
Any way you cut it

834
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:14,700
Gonna leave that flag behind

All your courage

844
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,260
All your nerve

845
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,440
Tyrants arise

846
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,200
Armies go marching

847
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,080
Who will say

848
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,440
What needs to be heard

849
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,900
I'm hitching down to Memphis

Hey Johnny Rev, where will we find you

When they need somebody who'll stand

866
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:37,240
Guarding the gate, keys to the kingdom

867
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,640
Jingling freedom bells in your hand

868
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:46,160
Forward all my mail to the last frontier

869
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:49,420
Gonna kiss that cause goodbye

870
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:58,180
