1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,800
Sometimes I speak English, sometimes I don't.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,980
You were outside my house yesterday.

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,260
You frightened my wife.

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,740
What do you want?

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,060
Who are you?

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,080
Who are you?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,260
What?

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,960
Who are you?

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,820
Who are you?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,680
Who are you?

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,880
Who are you?

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,980
Who are you?

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,900
Who are you?

14
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,460
Who are you?

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,800
Who are you?

16
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,580
Are you a fish?

17
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,300
Are you a fish?

18
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:28,340
No.

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,580
Who are you?

20
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,160
Are you a snake?

21
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,400
No.

22
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,680
Are you a man?

23
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,860
Who are you?

24
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,800
Who are you?

25
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,460
No.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,580
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,920
Are you Nurgle?

28
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,440
Yes.

29
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,280
The subgenius powerhouse.

30
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,680
One of the worst moments you may ever experience.

31
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,940
Yes, it is.

32
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,320
How come?

33
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,280
Let's go sit down, talk this over.

34
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,160
From NPR News in Washington, I'm unlikely to endanger residents.

35
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,500
The White House has President Trump.

36
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,800
Tuesday.

37
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,240
But, quote, quote, the U.S. government has favorable PR news.

38
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,720
Organic peroxides are used to make PR news.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,940
And we expect these products will ignite at some point in the coming days.

40
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,080
And they all loved it.

41
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,600
The Dow Jones 39218765.

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:25,420
The Labor Department says the economy's created 156,000 percent over the 12 months ending in August, according to the latest jobs report from the government.

43
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,940
However, this is PR news in Washington.

44
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,040
Thank you, Lee Moore.

45
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:51,380
That dialogue at the very beginning is from the 1977 Australian end of the world movie called The Last Wave, directed by Peter Weir, as in we are dough, with Richard Chamberlain and some Australian Aborigine actors.

46
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,940
One of my favorite end of the world movies.

47
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,520
Next, our buddies.

48
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,200
Exposed forehead.

49
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,580
have a new song out.

50
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,140
And here it is called

51
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,020
Watch Out by Exposed Foreheads.

52
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,580
They're all around searching the surface

53
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,960
Freaking us out, making us nervous

54
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,040
We can't let our location be known

55
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,660
Let's escape on our own

56
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,700
Watch out, the second trap

57
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,240
Watch out, no time for that

58
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,860
Watch out, push to the limit

59
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,420
Watch out, step it in it

60
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:29,480
Watch out, step it in it

61
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Watch out, we stand together

62
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,100
All with all

63
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,780
We are here, one and all

64
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,760
Watch out, the second trap

65
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,300
Watch out, no time for that

66
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,900
Watch out, push to the limit

67
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,560
Watch out, step it in it

68
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,880
Jeff Sorry's

69
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,740
альная mortgage concern

70
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,740
We have fallen but we're gonna get up

71
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,040
Watch out, the second trap

72
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,320
Watch out, no time for that

73
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,560
Watch out, the second trap

74
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:26,560


75
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,000
Watch out, push to the limit

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,560
Push to the limit

77
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,460
Watch out, we're gonna get on

78
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:29,460


79
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:29,460


80
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,860
Step in, ladies.

81
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:57,060
Let's go, ladies.

82
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,620
Dim dawn, the wicked witch is dead.

83
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,000
Milagro!

84
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,100
Weight had been lifted.

85
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,520
Dear friend, do you think just maybe,

86
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:43,140
maybe this whole political ordeal has been affecting some of us more than we realized?

87
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,340
Psychosomatic?

88
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,620
Or just plain psycho?

89
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,760
I'm definitely still plenty paranoid.

90
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,900
My fevered mind came up with all kinds of sick scenarios.

91
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,220
The scariest one involved...

92
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,080
involving nuclear codes and deals with Russia.

93
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,820
Trump fired the guy in charge of the nuclear codes a couple of days ago,

94
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,540
possibly after realizing he'd lost.

95
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,600
Maybe he had a deal with Putin

96
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,400
to disable America's nukes near the end of his second term

97
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,020
and let the Russians nuke Democrat cities with impunity

98
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,200
and take over what's left of the country

99
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,840
in return for Trump's...

100
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,400
Trump's debts being forgiven

101
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,280
and he'd get a new 13-year-old girl every day in his secure St. Petersburg mansion.

102
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,680
But then it sunk in that he's gonna have to move the schedule up by four years.

103
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,600
Paranoid?

104
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,320
I sure hope so.

105
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,460
But I've...

106
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:57,780
You know, I've got to admit, I've been greatly cheered by lurking on right-wing websites and Facebook pages,

107
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,200
which I do anyway.

108
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,680
Uh, tasting.

109
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,560
The bitter tears of the poor shattered snowflakes

110
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,280
as they deny reality just as hard as their little tiny brains can.

111
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,680
Uh, that's been almost worth the wait.

112
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,280
Talk about pulling the wool over their own eyes.

113
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,260
Not like me, of course.

114
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,520
But what was totally worth the wait

115
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,840
was Sandy Boone's documentary feature film about the church,

116
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,580
which is on Amazon now, and, uh,

117
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,580
Voodoo...

118
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,220
Or is it Hulu?

119
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,320
Or Hoodoo?

120
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,940
Or whatever.

121
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,060
And YouTube and Roku, and I don't know what all.

122
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,160
Um...

123
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,480
It's...

124
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,140
It says what all at dobbstown.net.

125
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,140
I heard Netflix will be showing it soon.

126
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,920
The full title is J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

127
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:58,640
Although I think if you just type in subgenius, you'll get it and other odd related things.

128
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,500
...

129
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:06,220
Well, I hadn't even planned this episode, uh, number 1804.

130
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:12,600
But at least I was inspired to get back to Tarzan's radio station and do something live,

131
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,020
or at least not from 1986.

132
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,540
As much as I like those old-timey hours of slack.

133
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,540
Uh, so...

134
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:26,700
Well, oh, by the way, this music in the background is the Empire Jazz Orchestra,

135
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,680
an album called Symphonies in Riffs.

136
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,740
And it's actually really, really good music.

137
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:42,100
Anyway, I guess I need to go audition some of the mountain of contributions from total strangers

138
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,900
and new friends that have built up over the last month.

139
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,660
Uh...

140
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,020
When...

141
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:56,160
Actually, my back hurt too much for me to sit and listen to hours of stuff critically.

142
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,260
But first, this!

143
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,140
I'll try to get the audio.

144
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:14,200
Welcome to Film School Radio, the on-air online showcase for the best in independent documentary and foreign films.

145
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:20,680
Every Friday morning, from 9 to 10 AM Pacific and online at filmschoolradio.com.

146
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,580
I'm your host, Mike Kaspar.

147
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,740
What started out as a joke.

148
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:29,740


149
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:29,740


150
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,940
An inside joke among two self-proclaimed weirdos from Fort Worth, Texas,

151
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,980
soon becomes much more than they bargained for

152
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,060
when they decide to turn their conservative Southern ideology on its head

153
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,340
and invent a new religion all their own.

154
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,080
In J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

155
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,120
we go on quite a journey.

156
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,740
It is remarkable and it is fun and it is irreverent

157
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,280
and it's sometimes, in a weird way, serious as well.

158
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,460
So, I think that's a great way to sort of get our conversation started.

159
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,380
And I'm going to introduce to our audience the director, producer, and writer.

160
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:17,580
And that would be Sandy K. Boone, as well as the Right Reverend, Philo Drummond, or Steve Wilcox.

161
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,720
To both of you, welcome to Film School Radio.

162
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,000
Thank you.

163
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,380
Thanks, good to be here.

164
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,360
Yes, thank you so much.

165
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,620
Like I said, I just had so much fun with this film.

166
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:35,420
Let me start by asking the director, producer, and writer of J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

167
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,280
and that would be Sandy K. Boone,

168
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,500
how did you hear about this particular church?

169
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,560
How did you hear about all this?

170
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,600
Well, actually, my late husband was a member of the group,

171
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,580
and he met them.

172
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,020
He had a dear friend that was in Dallas, Texas,

173
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,960
and they came all together and they were playing.

174
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,600
He took him to go listen to a band.

175
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,560
He was in a band called the Pink Boys,

176
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,940
and they were all part of this group or knew this group.

177
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,060
And that's how we originally met.

178
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,000
So my late husband really was the reason he made the movie called Invasion of the Luminant People,

179
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,200
which was also inspired by the Church of the Subgenius.

180
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:20,040
And I'll use a lot of the clips of my late husband's movie in the Subgenius movie.

181
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,520
What year was this?

182
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,980
Was this fairly recent or was it back in the day?

183
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,980
When was that?

184
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,380
Oh, no, no, no.

185
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,160
That was...

186
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:33,160
The original movie was done in 1980, 80, 81.

187
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:33,920
Yeah.

188
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,420
For Invasion of the Luminant People.

189
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:41,040
But the group knew each other, 79, 80, that era.

190
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,900
And Funk was thriving.

191
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:49,500
And we were in Dallas, and then we had moved to Austin to go to film school here at UT.

192
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,960
Well, let's bring into our conversation Dr. Drummond.

193
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,180
Steve Wilcox, Dr. Drummond.

194
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:03,980
Tell us a little bit about your getting together with Reverend Ivan Stang, also known as Douglas Smith.

195
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,120
Tell us a little bit about the origin story of all of this.

196
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,060
Okay.

197
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,680
Well, we'd gotten together on just some kind of a group of people that were artistic and creative.

198
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,340
And we had these Sunday brunches.

199
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:21,060
And it was about the time of when Jim Jones had the thing going on in Guyana.

200
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,980
He talked 900 people into committing suicide drinking the Kool-Aid.

201
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,740
Where that expression came from now, right?

202
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:40,200
And so we decided that, you know, well, gosh, if he could talk 900 people into killing themselves, couldn't we talk 900 people into giving us a dollar?

203
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,480
You know, I mean, it's got to be simple.

204
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:51,460
And so Reverend Stang and I got the idea that we needed to start our own religious cult.

205
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,960
And actually, there was another, you know, another motivation going on.

206
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:55,960


207
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,540
He and I both thought that we were really funny guys.

208
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,920
And that we thought we ought to be able to write comedy.

209
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:17,800
And one of the things we thought might be a good vehicle to display our talents would be to put this silly pamphlet together that was recounting this secret organization.

210
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,780
So we spent a lot of time visiting with the Scientologist and Ken Carr.

211
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,940
And all these various people.

212
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:34,640
And we had these spinoff kind of organizations that were, you know, new agey, kind of new age, new world religions and things.

213
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,760
And we went to a lot of seminars.

214
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,920
And he and I would sit in the front row.

215
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,580
And we would be taking copious notes about what we ought to include in our religion.

216
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:54,040
You know, we had to make it kind of like a Frankenstein monster where we could take from every familiar trope from every major religion.

217
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,920
And mix it with all these weird things.

218
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,120
And mix it with all these weird offshoots.

219
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,740
These cult-like religions.

220
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,960
And come up with this pamphlet that we could leave places.

221
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:13,560
And actually the leaving was secondary to the mailing out to we mailed the initially mailed the pamphlet to 350 publishers.

222
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:17,220
Because we were still thinking we'd get a job, you know.

223
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,020
Somebody would sit and go, oh, this is funny.

224
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,240
We should hire these guys.

225
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,620
You know, like that really happens.

226
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,940
So, anyway, we were still young and naive.

227
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,300
And thought that was a possibility.

228
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,660
Actually, we were shooting for Saturday Night Live.

229
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,720
We thought that's where we ought to be writing comedy.

230
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,180
You know.

231
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,500
Yeah.

232
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,960
So, we put together this pamphlet.

233
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,400
We mailed it out.

234
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,680
And we started leaving it in places we didn't know what to do.

235
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,080
It was hard to find a distributor for something that weird.

236
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:48,560
And so, we kind of started leaving it in the same places that all the weird religious organizations did.

237
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,600
It was like a super Chick track we could leave in places.

238
00:16:52,600 --> 00:17:04,600
We even had a thing where we would visit local record stores and secondary type, you know, alternative stores and things like that.

239
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,600
And we would sneak in there and leave our pamphlets on their periodical shelf.

240
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,580
It was always interesting to me.

241
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:18,540
I wish I could have figured out what it would be like to be at the store when somebody brought it up to ring up.

242
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,040
And that was the first maybe the first time.

243
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,780
The person who was ringing it up, I'd even seen it.

244
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,600
But we called that drop lifting.

245
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,240
It was like the opposite of shoplifting, you know.

246
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,180
So, we did that for a while.

247
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,540
Thank you, ancient subgeniuses of the past.

248
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,620
And now, from the Dobstown Mirror, a word of caution.

249
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,020
That time when you alone felt the need.

250
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,400
And enjoyed.

251
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,920
It was like you were held hostage by angels.

252
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,180
And then released and told, go tell your people what you have seen.

253
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,080
Do tell.

254
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:14,160
And send your confessions to stang at subgenius dot com.

255
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,320
Or uncleonan at gmail dot com.

256
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,620
But remember, regarding every subgenius show, read this twice.

257
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,340
It's a fact.

258
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,900
Some of the cosmic truths of the Church of the Subgenius are downright disgusting.

259
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,760
Just remember that J.R. Bob Dobbs has chewed them up first before he spit them in our mouths.

260
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,880
Prior to that, it was even worse.

261
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,180
Not a bucket shop.

262
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:58,180
If you're stirring your coffee or tea, and you hit the inside of the mug, that's a sign that you'll have good luck that day.

263
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,260
If you don't hit the inside of the mug, that's a sign you'll make clever choices that day.

264
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,140
Invent your superstitions, such that you can't lose either way.

265
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,840
They're just as real as any other superstition.

266
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:21,160
If you're telling yourself stories, tell yourself stories that don't cause you to continue to feel more.

267
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,540
You'll be miserable.

268
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,420
Here's one.

269
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,780
A little saying.

270
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,780
From the same author of Dobbs' Docktown Mirror.

271
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,180
Rat in your path?

272
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,020
Good at math.

273
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,460
You can do it too, friends.

274
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:49,580
Our music in the background is Bernard Herrmann's classic score for the Mysterious Island.

275
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:55,820
The 1960's Ray Harryhausen classic, based on Jules Verne's.

276
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,080
Very different novel.

277
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,420
And, uh...

278
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,040
Now this.

279
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:49,580


280
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:54,240

281
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:10,360
And they're just giving Sixtus the exact same fantastical

282
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:10,360


283
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:25,360
Jack's interest, showing cleavage whilst bending over to pick up her pride.

284
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:34,200
Jack inserted a dandelion into the chest crack, marveling at the yellow reflection.

285
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,080
Butter, he said proudly with a beaming grin.

286
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:48,300
As the hand approached his face for a muddy slap, he glimpsed the tattoo.

287
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:57,660
Mother in a heart with an anchor, snake coiling and hissing around it.

288
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:12,580
Jack, on the ground, shakes his head and looks upon the sun-drenched silhouette of Jill, fists clenched, ready for battle.

289
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,880
I'm thirsty!

290
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,220
Get me something!

291
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,240
I'm having a drink, she demands.

292
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:32,740
Jack, being a lawyer and realizing the implications of a woman scorned, obediently travels down the hill to comply.

293
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:46,440
Jill hears the approaching sound from the idiot cat bells on his floppy, foppish hat and perks up in anticipation.

294
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,700
She is

295
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:59,700
Jack returns with a plastic one-gallon bottle of pure artisan spring water, guaranteed no preservatives, just water. Yes, ma'am, just water.

296
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,280
You stupid simpleton, Jill shrieks.

297
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,760
I said I wanted a drink.

298
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:18,100
Blurred vision is one thing, but your conversation is even worse without alcohol's precious numbing agent.

299
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,280
I said I wanted a drink. Blurred vision is one thing, but your conversation is even worse without alcohol's precious numbing agent.

300
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,200
Tee hee.

301
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,340
I'll need a kicked down hoe, just for the sake of my life.

302
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:30,900
It was a curiously strange sound as the plastic jug met the side of Jack's head.

303
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:39,460
Pressure, pop, the twist-off cap seal and water sprayed everywhere.

304
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,920
The bucket working in hell is completely St Sarah episode 7 and at the bank oh here we are.

305
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:42,920


306
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,980
Jill bathes in sweat a little, and reignit in aeds close up to her but she de der beyond the norm.

body, blood mingling with water, grass turning black.

309
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:03,740
She wringed her wet tank top out over him, and once again noticed the gleam from his

310
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,200
mouth, nearly blinding.

311
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:16,320
Jill pulled out her Popeil's pocket fisherman, only available for this short time, and if

312
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,220
you buy now will include a whale bone chicken scratcher free.

313
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,600
But that's not all.

314
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,240
Here's a prairie tooth pouch, in occasion black tie camouflage.

315
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:40,400
She extracted that shiny golden molar without a moan, and wiped the blood off on her predistressed

316
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,860
and frayed short shorts.

317
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,340
Now,

318
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:53,900
Falling back on her fat, gelatinous ass in the grass, Jill again looked upon her former

319
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,400
friend.

320
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:04,640
Blue mixing with red like a Lichtenstein painting, black outline and all, her ringed water dots

321
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,500
representing the pseudo-silk screening process.

322
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:23,620
She put out her foot, wrapped in classic 1970s dingo boots with patented stitching and genuine

323
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:31,180
leather currently found under vintage on eBay and kicked Jack down the hill.

324
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,020
He

325
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:41,180
He rolled, he tumbled, he bounced, and at one point she could swear that damn thing

326
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:41,600
jumped.

327
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,620
The climax wasn't all that exciting.

328
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,540
Just a quick puff of dust that settled quickly.

329
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,280
Jill licked her dry lips and lit a cigarette.

330
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:11,560
Water makes me thirsty, she mumbled and waved wearily at a circling, hovering net.

331
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:26,540
The extreme weirdo calling itself Sheridan did that, titled Jack and Jill from his double

332
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,640
CD called Didn't See That Coming.

333
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,260
The end.

334
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,440
That Sheridan guy is very original.

335
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:42,600
Now we're going to temporarily take a turn even further into scariness and horror with

336
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:50,680
a song by our pal MOLG and his band Cult of Zier from the excellent new album Better

337
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,900
Living Through Confirmation Bias, a song called Turn Black.

338
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,280
Turn Black.

339
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,120
Turn Black.

340
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,260
Turn Black.

341
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:00,260


342
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:06,740
Turn away my love, turn black.

343
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,640
Turn Black.

344
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:12,660


345
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,280
Turn Black.

346
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,180
Turn Black.

347
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,960
There's nothing here for you today.

348
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,460
Turn black.

349
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,580
Turn away my heart yearns black.

350
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,800
Turn black.

351
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:05,540
Turn away my love burns black.

352
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,400
Turn away.

353
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:20,180
I've gone fishing off the deep end today.

354
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:32,520
The kind of love is just a loathsome trap.

355
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,440
I paid the tax and tried to snatch it back.

356
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,140
Burn away.

357
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,800
Flame bright as the white.

358
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,780
Burn away.

359
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,400
Two as you pray.

360
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,540
Turn black.

361
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,260
Turn black.

362
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,800
Turn black.

363
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,160
Turn black.

364
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:48,780
Turn black.

365
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,020
Turn black.

366
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,420
Turn black.

367
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,720
Turn black.

368
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:54,720


369
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,320
Baby, I don't get all tired of it

370
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,760
Baby, I don't get all tired of it

371
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:54,280
Baby, I don't get all tired of it

372
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,320
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

373
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,440
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

374
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:54,160
At last, J.R. Bob Dobbs is like an emotional support animal

375
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,700
that will help you.

376
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,200
He will support all the emotions.

377
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:04,300
Blind rage, primal lust, existential terror, ultimate victory,

378
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,940
indifference to woe and people you don't like.

379
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,800
All emotions, not just the one that the conspiracy prescribes

380
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,620
is appropriate for you and your circumstance.

381
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,900
A religion that does not excuse any behavior.

382
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,520
Well, that's just leaving money on the table.

383
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,680
Sell yourself an indulgence.

384
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,840
You'll pay!

385
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,080
Praise Bob.

386
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,080
And now this.

387
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,440
From PR News in Washington, I'm in Kentucky.

388
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,320
Remember, we have to take this seriously.

389
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,140
That's PR's reporting.

390
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,880
Governor Rick says this is PR News.

391
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,240
In Florida, the Dow is 82-21-836.

392
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,860
Bob says not guilty.

393
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,280
Bob says this is PR News.

394
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,300
I have a big collection of rejection notes, rejection letters.

395
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,580
There's like a hundred of them.

396
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,820
A few of the people that had been peripherally involved

397
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,500
in some of those publishing organizations,

398
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,480
one of which was like rip-off press,

399
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,540
which was publishing underground comic books and things like that.

400
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,640
And we got the attention of some people like R. Crumb and Paul Mavridis

401
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,440
and a lot of our West Coast underground comics artists liked it a lot.

402
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,380
The story goes is that the publisher threw it in the trash.

403
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,440
Paul Mavridis retrieved it from the trash and gave it to Doug Wellman,

404
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,500
who was another early hierarchy member.

405
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,960
He's known as Puzzling Evidence.

406
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:40,120
And he was the one that kind of exposed us to the whole idea of this big tape network

407
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:46,120
that existed at the time, which got us involved in making a lot of recordings

408
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,240
and distributing recordings.

409
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,420
And this is kind of like pre-internet data.

410
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:53,000
So I don't know, maybe you were even aware of it.

411
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:59,060
I think that's probably some documentary material there for this giant tape network,

412
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:04,580
cassette tape network that existed back then when people could,

413
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,720
they'd make tapes and send it to these various people on this network

414
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,980
and then they would trade with other people.

415
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,780
And it was something that kind of at the time was very popular in underground circles.

416
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,400
So that's, he was one of the ones that got it.

417
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,920
And he was the one that started on the whole audio portion of the church.

418
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:29,520
But, you know, after the initial pamphlet, we got quite a bit of feedback,

419
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,460
only none of it had really any real money attached to it.

420
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,660
A lot of great attention from interesting people.

421
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:41,540
But so it wasn't too long after that that we started thinking about,

422
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:46,000
well, if we're really a cult, we better have another pamphlet.

423
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,060
We better have some testimonials.

424
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,580
We better have questionnaires.

425
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:56,560
We need all this ancillary type material that will prove, you know, okay,

426
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,400
well, we're actually a real cult.

427
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,780
Yeah, we may be kind of a joke cult, but it's still a serious joke.

428
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,280
And we take it seriously.

429
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:10,620
And so, you know, we went forth with sort of that perspective.

430
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,420
And it started to really roll quite a bit.

431
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:14,760
Yeah.

432
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,320
Well, just real quick.

433
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:18,840
There.

434
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,720
There is something about this.

435
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,320
And in fact, in the film, you pose that question.

436
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:32,700
You and Reverend Stang talk about the this idea that you could have been a Scientology if you had chosen to.

437
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,040
And I mean, you could have.

438
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,040
Now, this wasn't your predisposition.

439
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,480
It didn't at all.

440
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,880
But the idea that you were getting people who got what you were talking about.

441
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,060
I think that's the important part.

442
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,140
I'll sort of classify these people.

443
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,420
I'm a mature psychologist than I am.

444
00:35:49,500 --> 00:36:03,200
But there's sort of this anti-authoritarian, free-thinking people who had been diametrically opposed to joining a Scientology, however, would have been completely enthralled with the idea of joining an anti-Scientology cult.

445
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:03,840
Exactly.

446
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,340
Yeah.

447
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:04,880
So.

448
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:17,120
That was part of our main thrust at the very beginning is that we want to make this for, we want to make it for people who feel alienated by society, for people that are not joiners, people that are lonely.

449
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:17,120


450
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,520
People that don't want to join things.

451
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:33,220
How do you get the, how do you find those people and how do you tap into, not necessarily how do you do it, but those are the ones we were aiming at, you know, the, the, everybody who was like the rejections of society, you know?

452
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:44,420
And, and then we would like, kind of like Groucho Marx, you know, I wouldn't want to be a member of any club that would have me as a member, but, you know, those were the people we were looking for.

453
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,100
The ones that didn't want to be members.

454
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,500
The ones that didn't want to be members of the club that would have them as a member.

455
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:49,820
So.

456
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:59,160
Well, this is exactly why I wish I had been aware of you because I used, I used to use that line all the time to describe my own life back in that time.

457
00:36:59,240 --> 00:36:59,460
Yeah.

458
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:05,280
I was a big Groucho fan who was, who was also a classic anti-authoritarian, anti-joiner kind of guy.

459
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,540
His personality was such.

460
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,740
Oh yeah.

461
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,560
Skeptical response.

462
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,740
The subset of what J.R. Bob Dobbs will protect you from is limited.

463
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,080
But with the help of the people who are watching this.

464
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,580
Well defined.

465
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,960
You did read the contract before you signed, didn't you?

466
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:29,500
A top selling point is take over by hostile aliens from another planet.

467
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:35,320
That is a negotiation that Bob excels at year in, year out.

468
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:44,780
But did you know that once you're a subgenius, you are protected as if by magic from making the worst mistakes in your life?

469
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:48,320
The second worst and better, that's on you.

470
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,060
But the worst mistake just won't happen.

471
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,440
Thank you, Dobbs.town mirror.

472
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,280
Available from Dobbs.town.

473
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,780
You are enough.

474
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:10,180
This is an image recovered from the laptop of the late great Reverend Katahdin Lagoon.

475
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,800
It's one of his messages to you.

476
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,760
And what I'm looking at here is a photo.

477
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,120
A photograph of a US dollar bill with the phrase,

478
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,800
You are enough.

479
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,360
Written in the upper margin.

480
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,560
Thanks to old Uncle Onan and his newspaper.

481
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,300
And it really is on paper.

482
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:38,000
But here's something just made of sound waves from a polished sounding band called,

483
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,040
Forgive my Italian.

484
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,760
Piegatori di...

485
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,480
Cuccial.

486
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,820
Piegatori di Cuccial.

487
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,680
However, I don't think the band is Italian.

488
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,980
They're on SoundCloud and they wisely sent me the lyrics too.

489
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,660
All bands should do that.

490
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,680
Seriously.

491
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,260
If they send me a song.

492
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,000
The song is titled, So Happy.

493
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,400
Three more Volume.

494
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:29,400


495
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,300
Can stay until tじ.

496
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:30,300


497
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:30,900
Hey, 차.

498
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,800
You me and in a while.

499
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,500
Come here.

500
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:34,500


501
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,560
With electric music.

502
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,280
We are British people.

503
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,420
As a result, nakedguys are free.

504
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,880
What is limited Korean money.

505
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:42,880


506
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:42,880


507
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:42,880


508
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,160
onda, car.

509
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:55,420
This time will be, this time will be so happy

510
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:03,220
And we'll be, maybe we'll be, this time will be so happy

511
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,760
Bleeding hearts with busted brains

512
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,500
Neck on paddling, drug convictions

513
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:16,100
We can leave those busted brains behind

514
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:20,200
We can leave those larynthroglodytes

515
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,900
You can leave your television

516
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,920
You can leave your news subscription

517
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,580
You can have good education

518
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,040
Maybe even good race relations

519
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,600
This time will be, this time will be so happy

520
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:57,400
And we'll be, maybe we'll be, this time will be so happy

521
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,800
We won't take their mind for granted

522
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,480
We won't take their mind for granted

523
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,700
We won't take their fluoridation

524
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,260
We don't need the smart patrol

525
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:21,160
We can choose our medication

526
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,460
This time will be, this time will be so happy

527
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:41,460


528
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,780
This time will be so happy

529
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:51,600
And we'll be, maybe we'll be, this time will be so happy

530
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:59,140
Yeah we'll be, this time will be, this time will be so happy

531
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:07,080
And we'll be, maybe we'll be, this time will be so happy

532
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,460
Yeah we'll be, this time will be so happy

533
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:11,460


534
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:27,040
Friends, every now and then we actually get a letter in the mail, the snail mail.

535
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:32,640
And I got a really well-written one that I'm going to read on the air.

536
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,160
It's from Reverend Tyrannosaurus Blasphemous.

537
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,340
And it came with a $5 bill.

538
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,580
I'll have you know.

539
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,000
It even has clip art on it that I haven't seen before.

540
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,960
Brother, can you spare some slack?

541
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,200
Make America funny again.

542
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,300
Souls cleansed while you wait.

543
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,780
You may have already won.

544
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:01,760
This item inspected by number 13013.

545
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,700
Dear Reverend Stang, I hope this letter finds you well.

546
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,320
I recently watched and thoroughly enjoyed it.

547
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,120
I enjoyed the documentary J.R. Bob-Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius

548
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,620
and wanted to reach out while we're still on this planet together

549
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,940
to thank you and Philo for starting the church.

550
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,600
I think when people see how old we are, they go,

551
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,880
Oh, man, I need to, I need to, I've been putting this off.

552
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,040
He could croak any minute.

553
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:34,400
I don't recall exactly the year I joined the subgenius,

554
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,420
but it was during that wonderful lost time before the Internet changed everything.

555
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,220
I miss those days.

556
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,980
I miss the days of finding Jack Chick tracks in bathrooms

557
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:47,040
or reading Fact Sheet 5 and, of course, High Weirdness by Mail

558
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,500
to find the latest saucer, cult, or alternate religion to seek mail from.

559
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,100
The fringe was so serious, but in a funny way.

560
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,260
Now, in the Trump side down, it's serious in a terrifyingly fascist way

561
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,500
without a sense of humor.

562
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,240
What the hell happened?

563
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,000
I prefer conspiracies with a dash of humor.

564
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,420
This is a familiar lament.

565
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,460
2020 has been a hell of a year.

566
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,120
Multiple deaths in the family, one COVID-related.

567
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:25,200
My spouse with MS and bypass surgery for myself a few weeks back

568
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,900
have made it hard to keep the funny.

569
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:34,140
Yet, I have found funny, having joined a subgenius group on Facebook, of all things.

570
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:38,420
The genuine humor and oddity of my subgenius brothers and sisters

571
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,040
have helped weather the storm.

572
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,320
I've been a part of the fun with the panacea of laughter.

573
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,480
And in spite of any hardships, I do find myself blessed with an abundance of slack.

574
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,060
I do as I please and am living comfortably,

575
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,840
though my community is about as pink as they get.

576
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:56,760
For those of us who identify with the trickster spirit,

577
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:01,080
who realize the tarot's fool is also its ascended master,

578
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,820
it's our offbeat humor that gives us our power.

579
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,460
For we who never fit in and honestly didn't want to,

580
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,500
who saw the popular kids as a nightmarish existence,

581
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,900
the church of the subgenius gave us common ground.

582
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:21,840
I love this congregation of the misfit, the strange, and the odd.

583
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,880
I do too, even after 35 years of it.

584
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,520
We fight the corrupting conspiracy of normalcy,

585
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,880
fully aware the inmates have been running the asylum.

586
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,380
We get the joke, and by God, the joke is on them.

587
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,880
For all the evangelicals who,

588
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,800
quote, see the signs, unquote,

589
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,520
how many of them have noticed they've been voting for a political party

590
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,660
with a satanic elephant for their national symbol?

591
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:55,440
Do we really need to put the sixes in those stars for them to wake up?

592
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:01,280
It's the Republican logo with the stars across the elephant.

593
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,840
I don't think it would matter if they're not us, the few, the odd, the subgenius.

594
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,260
Thank you again for starting the greatest joke of all time.

595
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:09,860
Praise God.

596
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,800
From Reverend Tyrannosaurus Blasphemous.

597
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,480
Wow, and like I say, he sent five bucks.

598
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,520
Well, thank you, Reverend Blasphemous.

599
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,080
I should mention, though, that there are indeed Republican subgeniuses, plenty of them.

600
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,860
I don't think there's many QAnon subgeniuses.

601
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,140
Hey, I've got a hint for y'all.

602
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,060
I'm Q. I'm the one who's been doing those.

603
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:39,720
Ha ha ha.

604
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,680
I should take that back, because somebody will believe me.

605
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,420
They've believed weirder crap, let me tell you.

606
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:59,560
There's been times when I couldn't believe what people believed that I had said.

607
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,280
I mean, stuff I said, and they believed it.

608
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,460
Stuff that came from Church of the Subgenius.

609
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,980
They take it as gospel, as well they should.

610
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,160
But they...

611
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,560
They forget the other way they should take it.

612
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,260
And if they can't...

613
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,480
Well, I don't want to say it on the radio, but...

614
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,340
F*** them.

615
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:29,120
Anyway, friends, yes, this has been a long stretch, and of course it's not over.

616
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:36,640
It's kind of like we're entering Act Three of the National Twilight Zone nightmare.

617
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,320
Uh...

618
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:39,860
Oh, God.

619
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,880
And, um...

620
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,880
Let's hope it's funnier than the previous act.

621
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,200
You know what I'm saying?

622
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:56,200
And doesn't end in car crashes and explosions and, you know, bad monsters.

623
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,420
Cool monsters.

624
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,200
That's different.

625
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,480
Um...

626
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,500
Oh, and friends, have I mentioned Ask Dr. Howell?

627
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,020
It's now on Zoom every month.

628
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:08,300
Um...

629
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,800
I think it's the second...

630
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:10,360
Second Sunday?

631
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,080
You'll have to look at, uh...

632
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,020
What is it?

633
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:18,480
Gonzotronics.net slash A-D-H.

634
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,420
Ask Dr. Howell.

635
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,420
Oh, there'll be a link.

636
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,740
By the time you look at Subgenius.com, there'll be a link to it.

637
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,960
And possibly in the events section.

638
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,060
We haven't been doing many other events.

639
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,820
We did X Day all on Zoom.

640
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:33,860
And by the...

641
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:38,900
Incidentally, I recorded days of X Day.

642
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:39,360
I recorded days of X Day.

643
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:39,420
I recorded days of X Day.

644
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:39,420


645
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:39,680
I recorded days of X Day.

646
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:39,680


647
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,440
I recorded certain venues all day.

648
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,540
I recorded subtitles on time, and I recorded my own for Does Not Go Well Make-A-S Anytime.

649
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,700
To see, I recorded aUI flyers until, like, midday.

650
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,400
I actually did a YouTubeимся film and, um, 600 words a day.

651
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,120
But, you know, we have an amazing ceiling here, so don't get super Rita.

652
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:58,120


653
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:58,120


654
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:58,120


655
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,060
Dr. Howell put that here and it's both fantastic and've got backs.

656
00:48:59,060 --> 00:48:59,460
We learned a few things from this studio of ours.

657
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:05,160
You see, many of us can't have..

658
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,220
Ahaaa...

659
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:07,220


660
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,240
Dr. Rob.

661
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,220
I...

662
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:09,780
Well, the lighting is great though.

663
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:09,780


664
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,800
Oh, boy.

665
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:15,220
I know the radio stations really don't want that kind of audio coming over their airwaves.

666
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,140
It makes them look bad.

667
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:19,840
It makes people fiddle with their dial to see what's wrong with it.

668
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:25,540
And also it's really hard to edit because there's constant references to visual things

669
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:34,500
which are just frustrating to the subgenius listening on his car radio or her car radio or its.

670
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:34,940
Whatever.

671
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,240
I'm not even going to go there.

672
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,840
I wouldn't know how.

673
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:42,820
Anyway, praise Bob.

674
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:52,520
Everything's much, much better here on this end as long as I don't try to heave any more riding mowers out of ditches by myself.

675
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:57,520
Or chase armadillos around the yard while filming them.

676
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,180
Trying to get real good low angles.

677
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,060
God, I couldn't get out of bed for a week after that.

678
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,380
It's a pretty funny video though.

679
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:06,540
My YouTube channel, friends.

680
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,260
It's got a lot of wildlife pictures on it now.

681
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,520
But I've got so many projects to do, friends.

682
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:25,540
Eyelash, the second book that we published after Neighbor World, should be out in about a month or so.

683
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:30,120
It still needs a little more proofreading and one more proof copy.

684
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,540
And I haven't been good about that.

685
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:34,060
And.

686
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,240
I have all these books I want to put together.

687
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,260
Subgenius books.

688
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,340
Old stuff that nobody's ever seen.

689
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,240
And reprints of old stuff that people have seen.

690
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,260
And new stuff.

691
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,960
But I'm 67.

692
00:50:52,360 --> 00:51:00,340
I'm beginning to think maybe what I should do rather than try to finish all these projects myself in the next 10 years or so.

693
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,140
Is to get them ready for somebody else to finish.

694
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,280
It's going to take me 10 years just to get.

695
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:07,560
All these things.

696
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:08,360
I'm not.

697
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:08,940
Seriously.

698
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:15,300
There must be at least a dozen subgenius books that are basically already done.

699
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,040
On the creative end.

700
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:20,380
A lot of technical stuff has to be done.

701
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:23,060
And videos.

702
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:28,120
I want to do an addendum to Sandy's documentary about us.

703
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:32,140
I have 60 more hours of footage that nobody's seen.

704
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,860
And nobody's going to see most of it.

705
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,480
But I went out and interviewed people myself.

706
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:36,520


707
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:36,520


708
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,100
Like Lonesome Cowboy Dave and G. Gordon Gordon.

709
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,480
Who never ended up in the movie.

710
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:44,580
And there were about 25 people who got interviewed for that movie.

711
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,860
And weren't in it at all.

712
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,400
I don't have that footage.

713
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,200
But I could probably get it.

714
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:52,640
I don't know.

715
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,260
Anyway.

716
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,440
I'm just rattling and rattling.

717
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,940
Because I'm excited to be out of bed.

718
00:51:58,940 --> 00:51:59,940
And alive.

719
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,780
And at least.

720
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,520
At least.

721
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,320
At least Act 1 and 2 are over.

722
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,400
We'll see how Act 3 goes.

723
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,200
Meanwhile.

724
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:19,440
Thanks to the Empire Jazz Orchestra.

725
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:28,520
Some of whom are subgeniuses that we now see every week on the weekly Zoom chat.

726
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,880
That's another thing, friends.

727
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:34,200
You'll look at subgenius.com for the links to that.

728
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,440
I haven't been advertising it much.

729
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,520
But every Saturday.

730
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,080
Subgeniuses get together and just hang out on Zoom.

731
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,480
They don't talk about Bob much.

732
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,840
Or if at all.

733
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,900
You never know what they're going to be talking about.

734
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:52,020
Anyway.

735
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,420
Praise Bob.

736
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,400
Praise Bob.

737
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,580
Praise Bob.

738
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:02,860
Praise Bob.

739
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:02,860


740
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:02,860


741
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:02,860


742
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:03,100
Praise Bob.

743
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:03,380
Praise Bob.

744
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:03,940
Praise Bob.

745
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,260
And now this.

746
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:07,860
In any event.

747
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,960
We have more questions.

748
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,020
So Dr. Howell if you are ready.

749
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:12,340
I'm ready.

750
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:17,580
I'll try to answer them in a faster way if there are a lot of them.

751
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,280
Actually.

752
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,980
Let me really quickly play Reverend Stang's question for you.

753
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,800
I'm going to cue it up.

754
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,320
Let's have that one, yes.

755
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:24,960
It's an honor.

756
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:26,520
Dr. Howell.

757
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,500
There he is.

758
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:31,880
I came up with the greatest question ever for you the other night.

759
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,080
But I did find an interesting one just this morning.

760
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:33,080


761
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:33,080


762
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:33,080


763
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:33,080


764
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:33,080


765
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,100
I didn't write it down, and now I've forgotten it.

766
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:36,480
No.

767
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,380
What was it?

768
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:39,100
Oh, wait.

769
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:43,560
I think I remember you getting this question before.

770
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:45,360
Yeah, I get a lot of them.

771
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,440
Forget that one.

772
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,380
Over again.

773
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:54,860
Dr. Hal, why, starting yesterday, did the chronic pain in my back and neck suddenly go away?

774
00:53:54,860 --> 00:54:03,240
Why this inexplicable desire to roll over on my back and have sleepy Joe Biden rub my belly?

775
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:10,960
Why this strange compulsion to masturbate to Jill Biden and Kamala Harris?

776
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,580
Are these somehow connected?

777
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,360
Thank you for your answer.

778
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,540
And I'll pay you Tuesday.

779
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:23,800
That must be the second Tuesday of the month.

780
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,720
I mean, of the week.

781
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:30,840
Well, dear Reverend Stang, the question seems hauntingly familiar.

782
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:33,740
I have a feeling I even answered it earlier on this program.

783
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,620
But I'll certainly answer it again.

784
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,940
It seems to have two parts.

785
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,380
Why did the pain suddenly depart?

786
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:49,600
And the other one, why your desire to roll on your back like a puppy and allow your ventral

787
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:54,660
side to be massaged or manipulated by Joe Biden?

788
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:56,480
And Kamala Harris?

789
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:03,440
Or perhaps why you desire to manipulate yourself while thinking of the winners of the presidential

790
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,240
election?

791
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:08,200
All these matters are intimately connected.

792
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:15,780
Connected in your person through the interaction of your own nervous system and the careful

793
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,820
choice made by your brain.

794
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:23,860
Once again, not the conscious brain, which may wish for things.

795
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:24,740
But the.

796
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:31,140
The unconscious mind, which is to say the rest of your brain, which is able to delegate,

797
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:40,120
able to create and able to provide sensations in any order it pleases, if it is left alone

798
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:46,340
by the impulse to direct given by the conscious mind.

799
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:54,200
Your pain stopped because you, your somatic self, were tired of having the pain.

800
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:58,700
It is possible for the mind to take the pain away.

801
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:09,200
Yogis and other spiritual practitioners can control the pain they receive and decide when

802
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,820
and where it happens.

803
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:17,140
One spiritual exercise, which has a long Indian name I can't pronounce correctly, so I won't

804
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:24,840
try, involves taking all the pain and compressing it into a rotating ball just outside the mind.

805
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:24,840


806
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:24,840


807
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:24,840


808
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:24,860


809
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:24,860


810
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:28,420
You have to keep it inside your forehead and you're supposed to keep it there.

811
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,960
This works for some people.

812
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:37,060
But there has been a greater pain afflicting us all in the last four years.

813
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:46,080
A pain which the current election seems to have relieved, and let us hope it has because

814
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:51,720
the bad actors who produced it, the irritants who produced the pain, are still very much

815
00:56:51,720 --> 00:57:00,700
with us and on the scene. Our pain is their pleasure, let us remember. And as

816
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:07,340
William Blake said, there is a class of men whose sole delight is in destroying.

817
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:13,700
Since they seem temporarily to be leveraged from the scene, it is not

818
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:20,700
surprising that puppy-like you wish to lie on your back, present your belly, wag

819
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:28,420
your tail if only you have one, and be diddled by the victors in the election.

820
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:35,060
Let us hope that they are at least capable of doing this, since there are

821
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:41,960
many obstacles to the ultimate success which they and we would prefer.

822
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,600
And we heard a

823
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:50,680
little bit of a rumble.

824
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:58,280
We heard a little bit there from the November 8th, 2020 Ask Dr. Hal show on Zoom.

825
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:04,600
And that happens every month, second Sunday of every month, and you can find the

826
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:12,400
information right up top on subgenius.com or look at the events page.

827
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:20,680
In this previously unpublished photograph from 1985, we see a man who is a

828
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:27,340
false head of the World Cup golfer, the one true head of the World Cup golfer, and Corona.

829
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,060
Beer. 1985. Coincidence? I think not.

830
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,400
Subgenius.com. And now this.

831
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:43,060
Dr. Hal's World Cup Golf Show.

832
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:48,900
Dr. Hal's World Cup Golf Show.

833
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:53,200
Dr. Hal's World Cup Golf Show.

834
00:58:53,200 --> 00:59:03,200
Dr. Hal's World Cup Golf Show.
