1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:09,300
And now, the subgenius hour of slack.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:09,860
Slack.

3
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:39,700
Slacks.

4
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,220
Make a cool radio.

5
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,620
When I put them on, I'm ready to go.

6
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,860
Man, you ought to see me with my derby on.

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,400
I know that you would say he's gone.

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:48,940
Slacks.

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,600
Mostly in the head.

10
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,100
Slacks.

11
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,600
Well, that's what I said.

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,080
Slacks.

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,920
I'm the cat's pajama.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,240
Cause I run around with crazy little mama.

15
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,220
Slacks now.

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,020
Well, the girls all look when I go by.

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,920
Slacks.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,440
I wear red bow tie.

19
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,080
Slacks.

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,700
They say me old mom slacks with a cat chained down to my knees.

21
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,500
I ain't nothing but a real coo-coo-free slacks.

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:39,640
Slacks.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,880
Brrrr.

24
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:41,740
Slacks.

25
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,260
Brrrr.

26
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:43,780
Slacks.

27
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:44,900
Brr.

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:45,840
Slacks.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,260
Make a cool radio.

30
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,720
When I put them on, I'm ready to go.

31
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,060
When I put them on, I'm ready to go.

32
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,320
When I put them on, I'm ready to go.

33
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:54,780
Slacks.

34
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,240
Brrrr.

35
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,620
Slacks.

36
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,200
Brrrr.

37
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,740
Slacks.

38
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,000
Brrrr.

39
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,760
Slacks.

40
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,220
Brrrr.

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,660
Slacks.

42
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,200
Brrrr.

43
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:04,640
Slacks.

44
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,300
Brrrr.

45
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,460
Slacks.

46
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,880
Ah, joe.

47
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,280
суu.

48
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,940
And the sparkle tones, friends.

49
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,000
Well, tonight we're going back to 5X Day for the last time.

50
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,200
But it's an X-rated visit to that day of excuses.

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:30,140
This will be one of those hours of slack that falls off of the radar of the normals.

52
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,360
This will only be presented on the internet.

53
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,140
So we're free to cuss, cuss, cuss.

54
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,600
Actually, these are tapes from 5X Day.

55
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,340
And other places that they were too raunchy to use at all.

56
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,180
Even if I bleeped all the fucks and shits out of it, there wouldn't be anything left.

57
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,240
Anyway, friends, let's go back.

58
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,940
Back in time, not that far, to 7 o'clock in the morning, July 5th.

59
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:06,720
As the subgeniuses await the aliens on the morning of the beginning of the end of the world

60
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,580
that never really got started.

61
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,260
I got one thing to say, and it won't take long.

62
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,660
But Bob Dobbs done been here, took a good shit, and gone.

63
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,600
We're once again.

64
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,820
We're here.

65
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,460
We're Bob.

66
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,420
We're Bob.

67
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,360
Maybe we are supposed to build our own shit, Bob.

68
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,740
Maybe the disbeliever's right, Bob.

69
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,700
Maybe we're the fucking...

70
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:34,500
Huh?

71
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,160
Oh, well.

72
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,040
Yeah.

73
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,660
That's a pretty good...

74
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,220
You know, that's not a bad slogan for this year.

75
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,240
Just it's simple, it's short.

76
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,160
Or next year, actually, I guess.

77
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,800
But Bob, Connie's coming.

78
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,920
That's a bad one.

79
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,880
Yeah, that's okay.

80
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:03,000
Hey, it's 7 in the morning, man.

81
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,080
Oh, you're a yeti, you can dig it.

82
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:06,760
Hey.

83
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,300
Hey, it's 7 in the morning.

84
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,000
Hey, hey, hey!

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,020
10 in the morning, the first movie of the year!

86
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,960
And it's so easy to fix.

87
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,580
It helps with yourumbs, it does help with genes and everything.

88
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,300
We're going out there, we're going online, is it time to film?

89
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,340
We are the best, Bob.

90
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,820
We're a heavenly High School actress!

91
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,300
Let's go.

92
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,280
Yeah, thank you, Bob.

93
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,360
I was playing with kids.

94
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,600
I couldn't pick a number, let's 600,000, no?

95
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,040
Now, because of COVID-19, I can't go to school everyday,

96
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,540
and three days in a row, I just have to tbsp this job which is really tough.

97
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,580
Girl, I love this kind of stuff.

98
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:48,740
domestic deviation, Connie is our inspiration, a lovely leader in fighting love, sister Connie

99
00:04:48,740 --> 00:05:00,220
do we trust, to find domestic deviation, Connie is our inspiration, a lovely leader in fighting

100
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:17,440
love, sister Connie do we trust, sister Connie, sister Connie, sister Connie, sister Connie,

101
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:30,200
find domestic deviation, Connie is our inspiration, a lovely leader in fighting love, sister Connie

102
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:36,100
Sister Connie, do you trust your domestic deviation?

103
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,780
Connie is our inspiration,

104
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,600
a lovely leader in sighting lust.

105
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,820
And Sister Connie, do you trust?

106
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,280
Sister Connie, Sister Connie.

107
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,820
A Saint Inn, dear friends.

108
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,500
A Saint Inn in Helena Handbasket at 5X Day.

109
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,580
And now back to the disappointed Saint.

110
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:27,360
The subgenius UFO cultists, whose UFOs again didn't show up at 7 o'clock in the morning.

111
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,740
Although we did.

112
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,860
I gotta find a church that gets up later.

113
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,740
It'd be surprising if you picked something like 8.08 AM.

114
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,060
Yeah, 8.08 or 4.20.

115
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,820
Or how about 13.13.

116
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,080
Or 11.11.

117
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,140
You know, here we are trying to second guess J.R. Bob Dobbs,

118
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,580
the dumbest,

119
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,220
the dumbest creature in the universe, yet luckiest.

120
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,660
And trying to second guess the exes that are probably so advanced we can't understand them.

121
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,900
Or so simple we can't understand them.

122
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,580
See, there you are trying to second guess people who don't use logic or rationality at all.

123
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,020
That's why my own irrational theory has to be...

124
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,420
The good news is there'll be an X Day 6.

125
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,240
Oh yeah, I guess so.

126
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,660
I'm going back to my motel.

127
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,820
I'm going back to my motel.

128
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,860
I got a...

129
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,020
I got a good one.

130
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,020


131
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,020


132
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,300
I'm wearing these pajamas and I camped right next to this pavilion for real good reason.

133
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,400
I'm gonna take advantage of that.

134
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,220
I'm gonna go have my continental breakfast and catch up on my sleep here.

135
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,720
Yeah.

136
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,400
I think you're right, Mr. Seastead.

137
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,620
Damn.

138
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,940
Well, it wouldn't be the first religion that shit on me.

139
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,800
But at least with the other ones, there was that hope thing.

140
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,320
Oh.

141
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,660
Yeah, well, that was for the dumbasses.

142
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,520
This fails consistently.

143
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,240
Yeah.

144
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,560
You always get your fucking...

145
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,040
Fucked by Bob.

146
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,980
I think that's going to be the topic of a rant if I sell a voice later.

147
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,180
Fucked again.

148
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,240
Yeah, I was starting to lose my voice this afternoon.

149
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,960
I was doing my Chris Lee...

150
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,300
Well, now you ought to see my faith voice held.

151
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,920
Now you still have a faith that was trying not to sit on, too.

152
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,020
If you came back for this year, you'll never stop coming to this.

153
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,880
Never stop coming?

154
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,100
Never stop coming.

155
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,960
Never stop coming.

156
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,440
To Brushwood.

157
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,660
Oh.

158
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,020
You always have a big butt, Stang.

159
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,700
Whoops.

160
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,880
Well, of course, what would I do without it?

161
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,660
Going to Dobbs Town?

162
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,160
Are you guys going to the town?

163
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,760
Are you going to go light up some citizens and piss them out?

164
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,080
We already did that, but you pissed on the mansions.

165
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:13,820
Thank you, Reverend Susie the Floozy, who came to 5X Day all the way from WREK in Atlanta, Georgia.

166
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,220
You know, folks, many subgenius radio folks lived to try to...

167
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,660
to report on their oft-times sordid X-Day drill experiences.

168
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,780
What about this European revival I was reading something about?

169
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,660
I heard something about...

170
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,240
I read something about actual male fist effing...

171
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,740
Homosexual male fisting.

172
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,220
The kind of psychosexual...

173
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,200
The kind of gravy you want covered all over your handshake.

174
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,100
Someone's already getting it, so...

175
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,180
Yeah, the London X-Day...

176
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,080
Oh, that was sick.

177
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,320
Actually had more people show up.

178
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,220
We had about 200 at Brushwood.

179
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,800
They had 250 in London, but it was indoors, and they didn't have to pay nearly as much.

180
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:08,120
And there was, in fact, probably smellier displays of...

181
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,660
Yikes.

182
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,140
Dharma?

183
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,040
Discussing...

184
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,960
Sexual dharma.

185
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,120
Holy mackerel, Andy.

186
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,720
It can't get any smellier than two meerkats having a...

187
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,800
Pleasuring themselves.

188
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,520
They did allow cameras.

189
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,820
The Italian subgenius told me...

190
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,800
Reverend Slita told me that he was going to post some,

191
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,860
but he was going to censor the hidden arm...

192
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,880
The hidden forearm pictures.

193
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,320
Oh, my God.

194
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,020
Well, we don't even need to think of that to know what it means.

195
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,320
Wow.

196
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,720
I mean, somebody was actually hiding their forearm in a fold of human waste.

197
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,860
You were talking about...

198
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,340
No, but it's monkey...

199
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,720
There are monkeys that wouldn't do stuff that subgenius humans...

200
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,500
No, monkeys will not do that.

201
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,060
Monkeys will not...

202
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,420
They refuse.

203
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,340
I don't think you've ever...

204
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,280
It's not in the contract.

205
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,620
It's not approved.

206
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,480
Recorded of a monkey dipping his fist in a bucket of lube.

207
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,400
No, it has not been done, at least in this century.

208
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,940
There were perverted monkeys in the old days,

209
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,600
back when they tainted the water with, well, you know, with the oxide.

210
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,740
And this really...

211
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,620
Well, what else happened if that happened?

212
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,060
Another thing that happened was they went out to Avonbury...

213
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,780
Man, we can't even compete with that.

214
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,420
Avonbury.

215
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:18,420


216
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,000
Avonbury.

217
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,040


218
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,040


219
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,040


220
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,040


221
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,460
Avonbury Avenue.

222
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,920
A giant old monument like Stonehenge...

223
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,420
Oh, Avonbury.

224
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,000
...upon which at 7 in the morning on July 5th,

225
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,240
Papa Joe Mama launched a bleeding head of Arnold Palmer

226
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,640
at the Avonbury Mounds, the ancient Stonehenge-like mounds.

227
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,640
And the mists...

228
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,600
Was it on Solstice Day?

229
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,260
...were gone at 7 a.m.

230
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,960
And they...

231
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,880
Oh, oh, oh.

232
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,040
Apparently, they said, if I...

233
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,020
The line of the morning was,

234
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,540
if I cannot bang my head against the rock,

235
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,880
the rock will bang.

236
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,120
...itself against my head.

237
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,220
And I guess they all ended up with the rock...

238
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,740
See, now...

239
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,860
...the giant ancient rocks banging them on the heads

240
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,440
as the exodus failed to arrive.

241
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,880
Well, it sounds like a real moment of epiphany for some folks.

242
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,120
They're more into drinking over there

243
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,640
as opposed to the...

244
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,960
Well, yeah.

245
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,780
The meditative approach that the American subgeniuses do,

246
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,920
the sticking the sand...

247
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,400
...to pay for cactuses up their legs at wounds and so forth.

248
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,940
Well, you know, the thing is, I saw many weapons at X-Day.

249
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,160
And now assume the correct lotus position.

250
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,460
I saw M-16s and M-5s.

251
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,720
Yeah, it was kind of weird seeing all that.

252
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,280
It was weird.

253
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,240
It was weird.

254
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,240
A complete electromorphified vaporizer,

255
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,880
which vaporized many people.

256
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,800
Brain cells.

257
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,480
It was a brain cell vaporizer, but it didn't hurt your lungs.

258
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,880
Your lungs were fine.

259
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,800
And your snapback...

260
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,660
Your brain cells would be...

261
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,280
...coded...

262
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,520
Instant.

263
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,040
...with this drippy, sticky, green, skunkish, horrible...

264
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,720
And this guy just walked around like a ghostbuster,

265
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,840
just blasting people with this vaporizer...

266
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,980
...all week long.

267
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,300
And everybody in his path was just mumbling idiots.

268
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,360
Yeah, but healthy lungs.

269
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,100
Because the brain was not cleared for cannubial darkening.

270
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,940
That guy was...

271
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,380
Healthy lungs.

272
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,200
Yeah, that was a Mr. Troll.

273
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,740
They were breathing well.

274
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,640
The breathing was no problem, but there was a glaze over the eye.

275
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,100
Over the eye.

276
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,140
The one eye, of course.

277
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,640
The other eye.

278
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:18,640


279
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:18,640


280
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:18,640


281
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:18,640


282
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,440
The other eye wandered freely.

283
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,020
But that's why we had so many casualties by the pit.

284
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,860
The third eye.

285
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,040
The red eye, baby.

286
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,280
Oh, the third eye left many, many, many...

287
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,160
That's where the English side took the red eye flag.

288
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,060
You are one magnificent hunk of man-meat.

289
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,340
Fuck me hard.

290
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,480
No.

291
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What knockers.

292
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,620
Oh.

293
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,680
Thank you, doctor.

294
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,980
So many things you want to say, but can't.

295
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,400
So many anthropological observations.

296
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,500
And close hands.

297
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,700
Primate behavior.

298
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,940
I am the Carl Sagan of rock and roll, you know.

299
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:05,320
Well, you've been among these creatures long enough observing them that they don't even behave differently when you're around.

300
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:05,620
Right.

301
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,100
And rock and roll is just black slang for sex.

302
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,580
So is John.

303
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,540
I am the Carl Sagan of...

304
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,420
Of prof rock and roll.

305
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:15,860
Of sex.

306
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,060
Yeah.

307
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,700
Sex.

308
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,920
The old in and out.

309
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,260
The Carl Sagan of sex.

310
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,320
Well...

311
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,820
Boo-shaka-vaka-vaka.

312
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,180
Well, not really, but...

313
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,220
Yeah, I guess I would be.

314
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,560
Boo.

315
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,020
Boo.

316
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,020


317
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,080
I'm more the Mestopheles of a bad bowel movement.

318
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:29,220
You know, Carl is a total stoner.

319
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:36,960
You keep telling yourself about how you're a sexual scientist, Chaz, and tell the doctor that, and...

320
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,440
Yeah.

321
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,540
I'm a sexist.

322
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:38,760
That's all.

323
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,540
Isn't it all science, Chaz?

324
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,720
That's all it's about.

325
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,260
Tell the angry husbands that.

326
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,900
The firings of the scrote.

327
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,100
No.

328
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Tell the illegitimate children.

329
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,540
The misfiring of the brain.

330
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:45,820
Well, no.

331
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,040
I'm a sexist.

332
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,220
I'm...

333
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,680
I'm...

334
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,720
I've become the lonesome cowboy now.

335
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,280
Yeah.

336
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,380
I'm...

337
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:50,680
Yeah.

338
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,000
It's...

339
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,280
It's funny.

340
00:14:51,280 --> 00:15:03,300
Buddy, when you start getting those pink notices from those misbegotten children that want your support, whether it be of an athletic nature or just a plain old church supper where you strangle them and maybe put their bodies below in the basement...

341
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:03,660
Yeah.

342
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,480
You know that you don't want to spread your spore any further than you have.

343
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,680
The mankind already, according...

344
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,320
Is depleted.

345
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,600
Its spermatozoa has been depleted.

346
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,500
Bob spread his spore all over the place.

347
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,200
Bob has come...

348
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,620
Has come to redeem us.

349
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,340
For RDP...

350
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:16,620
No.

351
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,300
Bob the drummer.

352
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,000
Bob the drummer.

353
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,000


354
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,560
Yeah.

355
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:18,840
Yeah.

356
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,440
I think you had a problem with slack vampires, man.

357
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,160
Oh, yeah.

358
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,960
That happens a lot.

359
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,740
You hear?

360
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,660
Slack vampires, like, they'll dig right into your carotid artery and just start sucking away.

361
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,240
Yeah.

362
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,040
They're everywhere.

363
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,020
In my...

364
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,980
The tainted things.

365
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,440
My aura of view...

366
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:33,840
My aura of view...

367
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:33,940
My aura of view...

368
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:33,940


369
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:33,940


370
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:40,000
In my aura of view, I was able to see these slack vampires that were, like, following you around.

371
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,960
...Coming to your chest and...

372
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,140
...Following you around.

373
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,140


374
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,660
...And want to save your blare.

375
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,660
Because you were, like, the man.

376
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,540
...The coolest band and the coolest pants and everything cool.

377
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,580
So the slack vampires, naturally, are, you know, they're going, oh, here's a little font of slack.

378
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,520
You gotta watch for them.

379
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,240
They're like...

380
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,340
They're like...

381
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,040
...Slack fish.

382
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,740
They're like slack...

383
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,140
They're slack...

384
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,460
Slack blockers.

385
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,900
What do they call those fish that attach to sharks?

386
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,460
Piranhas.

387
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:01,780
Slam prays.

388
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,180
Oh, uh...

389
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,500
Yeah.

390
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,180
There's no...

391
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,800
Slam prays.

392
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:03,960
Slam prays.

393
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,280
Slam prays are from Lake Erie.

394
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:05,480
Yeah.

395
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:05,760
They're extinct.

396
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,680
They're called, um, pilot fish that are on, um, sharks.

397
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,820
Pilot fish.

398
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,120
That's their name.

399
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,900
How could they be from Lake Erie if they're on sharks?

400
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,060
No.

401
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,540
Slam prays are, are on Lake Erie and they're all died off.

402
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,880
Or no, they killed everything.

403
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,880
The pilot fish are on sharks.

404
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,780
Those circular mouths with the, uh...

405
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:20,960
Yeah, yeah.

406
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,420
...the endless row of tiny shark teeth.

407
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,580
And what are bad chats?

408
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:24,940
They're sucking...

409
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,820
...are the ones that look like they're left to the swimmers.

410
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,680
They suck.

411
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,020
They suck.

412
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,620
They suck majorly.

413
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,380
And on...

414
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,140
So you're...

415
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,860
And you're thinking they're going for your pelvic muscles.

416
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,060
...shark-like muscles.

417
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,040
And they'll suck in your brain suits.

418
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:36,660
...shark skin suit.

419
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:36,700
...suits.

420
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,100
And, uh...

421
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,500
...suits.

422
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:37,720


423
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:37,860


424
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,040
And, yeah, you have to swim really fast and do a lot of things.

425
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,040


426
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,620
You gotta darting.

427
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh, you gotta wear those frog flippers, man.

428
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,400
You gotta have like a hydro suit.

429
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,680
Sort of like the candira fish of South America which swims up your urethra.

430
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,940
It's such a narrow creature.

431
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:54,620
But a shark...

432
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,440
...we offer to all you rats a shaving towel into the river.

433
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,660
Because of this, a shark can never quite sleep.

434
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,220
You know, a shark cannot stop moving.

435
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,880
They have to keep moving to keep breathing.

436
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,580
That's right.

437
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,560
Well, even sharks get old and then calm down.

438
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:09,060
They only get rest when they go to the top of the ocean and then glide down slowly.

439
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,340
You can lay down, but you can't sleep.

440
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,020
It's hell back there.

441
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,060
Hey, what's another news story of why the fish are all washing up dead?

442
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,160
And when they do get down in their little shark bed...

443
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm sorry. I just thought I'd remember it.

444
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,600
Well, there's another little, like, you know...

445
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,000
...uh, the little...

446
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,240
...crab kind of thing.

447
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,760
A giant snow crab sort of sleeping in their bed or...

448
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,620
...sucking the toes of another giant snow crab.

449
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,600
Oh, El Gordo and Princess Party Girl.

450
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,280
You can go ahead and talk about them. They don't listen to this show.

451
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,540
And they're too small to gobble up if you're a shark.

452
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,920
You know, you don't care about that.

453
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,960
That's just gonna get stuck in your teeth.

454
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,300
Chas...

455
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,600
Those are the ones you toss back.

456
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,120
I thought...

457
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,100
Well, that just gets stuck in your teeth and then that jams up in your gums and that's no good.

458
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,380
Then you lose another row of teeth and have to throw them back.

459
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:49,520
No, no, you're...

460
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,120
And then next thing you know, your snout is as flabby as a porpoise's ass.

461
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,440
It's a dumbass thing, friends. You would understand.

462
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:06,080
And, uh, so, uh, that's enough, I guess, of, uh, inspirational, uh...

463
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,340
Yeah, I don't have too much inspirational blabbering to do because, uh...

464
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,380
Uh, I just want to party.

465
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,120
Woo!

466
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,460
Woo!

467
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,300
Woo!

468
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,160
Woo!

469
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,480
We do have, we do have some...

470
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:19,920
Rules.

471
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,900
Commitments. Rules.

472
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,500
Regulations.

473
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,740
Rules. Yes. Fuck them if they can't take a joke. That's the one rule you have to live by.

474
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,360
Also, you have to question authority.

475
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,520
Or else!

476
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,560
Or else!

477
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:32,840
Or else!

478
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,320
Or else!

479
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,180
Or else!

480
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:34,780


481
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,120


482
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:35,940
Or else!

483
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,660
Or else!

484
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:37,880
Or else!

485
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:37,880


486
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:37,880


487
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:37,880


488
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,180
Oh, that's the guy part you're supposed to do. I'm supposed to do the or else part.

489
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,820
Go!

490
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,980
We've got a real program, Dan.

491
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:45,880
We've got...

492
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,140
We've got...

493
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,060
I suppose we could start the auction. Here's a microbiology coloring book.

494
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:50,980
With a dead cow.

495
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,460
With a dead cow and anthrax bacillus on it.

496
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,040
It's...

497
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,900
You can color...

498
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,600
It's how to culture anthrax.

499
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:56,800
Huh?

500
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,160
The cover is How to Culture Anthrax.

501
00:18:59,380 --> 00:18:59,640
Yay!

502
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,360
That's good.

503
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,600
A timely children's book.

504
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,260
Introduction to protozoa. Whoa.

505
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,580
Keep flipping!

506
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:07,580


507
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,480
Hey, man.

508
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,220
It gets better.

509
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,580
Protozoa.

510
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,200
That's a taliban of proof.

511
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:17,720
Yeah!

512
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,420
These guys don't even have bat bones on them.

513
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,600
Whoa!

514
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,880
They're little prairie squids.

515
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,860
Yeah, little tiny...

516
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,120
A little tiny, preemie prairie squid.

517
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,020
Underage.

518
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,840
Bob really doesn't want us to fuck them.

519
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,740
Just take out...

520
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,280
If they come home you'll look to a protozoa.

521
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:35,520
I'm gonna...

522
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,580
I'm gonna get an under...

523
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,560
An underage pro.

524
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:37,560


525
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:37,560


526
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:37,560


527
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:37,560


528
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:37,560


529
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:37,560


530
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:37,560


531
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:37,560


532
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:37,560


533
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:37,560


534
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:37,560


535
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,900
I'm gonna get an underage prairie squid and I'm not gonna use the big red straps.

536
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,360
I'm gonna use big green straps.

537
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,640
Pleasure.

538
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,500
The following order is to be carried out immediately.

539
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,960
Why don't you go outside and play hide and go fuck yourself?

540
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,940
When a person is insane...

541
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,520
Insane.

542
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,260
Insane.

543
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:58,900
Insane.

544
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,700
As you clearly are.

545
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,800
You are being irrational.

546
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,740
The match ignited a pocket of intestinal gas and flames shot out the tube.

547
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,560
You people are insane.

548
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:07,560


549
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:07,560


550
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:07,560


551
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,240
On dope?

552
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,440
Ha hear ha!

553
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,320
You ever seen a grown man naked in a cockpit before?

554
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,180
No sir!

555
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,140
Do you know that you're insane?

556
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,740
You just stop and go, wow!

557
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,600
It's amazing how fucking crazy I really am.

558
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,340
Go back to bed.

559
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:31,780
Oh, a little cut up by revbrovt, made out of pieces, things posted on alt.binaryslack,

560
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,540
uh, oh by the way this background music is by the original doctor slova.

561
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,460
for Bob.

562
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,940
Yes, yes, yes.

563
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,400
Something good, good, good

564
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,900
is coming up, friends,

565
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,780
as we now go back

566
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,420
to waiting through the end of the world.

567
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,300
Bob promised us 40 gigs and a mule.

568
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,720
Yes, 40 big fat acres.

569
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,620
He promised us blue balls,

570
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,500
frustration,

571
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,580
a making up of our own reality.

572
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,320
This guy's got a problem.

573
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,660
A determination to do it on ourselves.

574
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,440
Was it you, you scroungy little fuck, huh?

575
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,100
He does.

576
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,560
My goodness gracious.

577
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,700
That's the kind of people

578
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,620
that are running our military?

579
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,360
I'd hate to enjoin or conjoin

580
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,760
with any one of those soldados.

581
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,180
I'm asking the fucking questions here, private.

582
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,820
Do you understand?

583
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,060
Sir, yes, sir.

584
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,340
Well, thank you very much.

585
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,740
Can I be in charge for a while?

586
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,900
Sir, yes, sir.

587
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,080
Are you shook up?

588
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,820
Are you nervous?

589
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,360
Sir, I am, sir.

590
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,640
Do I make you nervous?

591
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,320
Sir, sir, what?

592
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,160
Are you about to call me an ass?

593
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:36,500
Asshole!

594
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,700
Sir, no, sir!

595
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,980
How tall are you, private?

596
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,860
Sir, five foot nine, sir!

597
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,700
Five foot nine?

598
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,600
I didn't know they stacked shit that high.

599
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,220
You trying to squeeze an inch in on me somewhere, huh?

600
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,500
Sir, no, sir!

601
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,680
Bullshit, it looks to me like the best part of you

602
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,220
ran down to crack your mama's ass

603
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,140
and ended up as a brown stain on the mattress.

604
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,920
I think you've been cheated.

605
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,180
Where in hell are you from anyway, private?

606
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,680
Sir, Texas, sir!

607
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,240
Holy dog shit, Texas.

608
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,860
Only steers and queers come from Texas, private cowboy.

609
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,320
And you don't much look like a steer to me,

610
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,300
so that kind of narrows it down.

611
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,600
That's me on Altbot Slack.

612
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,320
You've become either a raging bull or a raging...

613
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,900
No, I'm here.

614
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,120
I'm trying to whip these people into shape, man.

615
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:17,580
There you go.

616
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,360
Us old-timers are not going to be around forever,

617
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,600
and somebody has to be trained.

618
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:27,200
I think Legume and me showed how to whip people into shape.

619
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,620
We have to live by example.

620
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,020
Just ask Nicky.

621
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,200
Just ask...

622
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,620
Well, we'll just leave the other names out of it.

623
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,300
You know, don't you?

624
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,360
Dr. Legume got an award this week for best...

625
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,640
Well, not best, but worst influence.

626
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,300
Yeah?

627
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,020
Ex-fluence.

628
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,340
And that's what it all is, ex-fluvia, man.

629
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,960
We're talking people now.

630
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,460
I knew it.

631
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,780
You got an award, too, but I can't remember now what it was for.

632
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,480
Who was declaring the award?

633
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,140
Lost brain cell or something like that.

634
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,780
Lost brain cell.

635
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,000
Who was declaring the award?

636
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,960
The elder bankers.

637
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,020
Oh, the elders of bank?

638
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,000
The elder bankers?

639
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,660
Yeah, who live in Mount Shambalalalala.

640
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,220
La la la la la la la la la la.

641
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,220
Mount Shastakola.

642
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,060
Mount...

643
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,700
More than rhyming.

644
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,620
When we hit the floor, you'll find out what this song is for.

645
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,860
Go to hardcore and tell your soul, I'll find rapport with your control.

646
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,180
Encore, encore, just scream for more.

647
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,400
My technique, you will adore, and when well done, the toe fucks I will wore you out.

648
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,440
And then you toe fucks I will wore you out, but I won't say a word.

649
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,720
Rest assured, when you're sobered and realize what has occurred,

650
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,920
you had sex with a rhyming nerd.

651
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,300
You let loose your inner demons, still can feel your pussy semen in your eyes, there's still a...

652
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,900
gleaming on your chin, there's still some semen screaming,

653
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,160
creaming though you work my time.

654
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,900
Well, it's so damn weird.

655
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,540
What you got to do with pleasure drove me crazy, that's for sure.

656
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,660
But you don't want to be a slut and let folks know I busted a nut twice on your face,

657
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,620
once in your butt has literally looked like a glazed donut.

658
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,800
What's that got to do with Bob, you want to know?

659
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,340
Are you just lobbing lines about your lob?

660
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,300
You slob.

661
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,100
What's that got to do with Bob, you want to know?

662
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,620
Are you just lobbing lines about your knob?

663
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,140
You slob to mob the cops and get a job,

664
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,340
point and sling for all to see,

665
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,640
J.R.R. Martin's setting you free.

666
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,920
Whether you're cute or flat, ugly, don't matter if you're slow like me.

667
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,480
Take a tip and understand, this war might not go as you planned.

668
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,000
No excess will include plans, so I just take no brand new plans.

669
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,620
We stand the pressure of the con and make the world through standing on a will,

670
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,240
admit you're not a farmer, you can do what you want, get slack!

671
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,160
If you can persuade, well then make sure that you're paying,

672
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,620
and profiting from what you make,

673
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,360
then you've got some love.

674
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,160
Five dollars for this.

675
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,060
She just looked at you with that sweet smile so fair,

676
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,660
she knew you paid thirty bucks just to smell her underwear.

677
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,840
Now your bunny's nuts are covered in that pink rash,

678
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,920
and you got sweet salvation, thirty dollars cash.

679
00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:01,100
Every night Connie's in my room, possessing my tits, my ass, my sweet little poop.

680
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:01,760
I'm a worker.

681
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,720
I'm a worker.

682
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,660
I'm a worker.

683
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,340
Down by the seaside.

684
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,000
I'm Pisces.

685
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,580
Fishy girl swimming in an ocean of slack.

686
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,240
I give it all away just to get more back,

687
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,780
and I'll keep giving away just to get me more.

688
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,180
Yes, Bob, dammit, I'm Connie's whore!

689
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,360
Fuck Bob.

690
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,340
Fuck Bob.

691
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,540
Fuck Bob!

692
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,600
Fuck Bob.

693
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,300
Slack must flow like snot from a cold-ridden three-year-old's nose.

694
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,260
Fuck Bob.

695
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,680
Fuck Bob.

696
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:49,400
May Bob be fucked up the ass with barbed wire.

697
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,760
Fuck Bob.

698
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,580
But you know, maybe that's just what he wants.

699
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,620
Eh, fuck it.

700
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,380
Bob's ass will flow like blood from Biblical plagues.

701
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,760
Fuck Bob.

702
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,180
The aisle will run red with the blood from Bob's ass.

703
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,860
Give me my fucking slack now.

704
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,360
Dammit, Bob.

705
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,060
Fuck Bob.

706
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,240
Fuck Bob.

707
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,700
The problem is, Bob needs to be shown his place.

708
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,080
Bob's place is on the business end of my razor wire strap-on.

709
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,280
Fuck Bob.

710
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,200
Fuck Bob.

711
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,780
You know what?

712
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,320
Bob could look like shit in my underwear.

713
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,700
These right here, Bob could do nothing with.

714
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,680
Bob isn't man enough for my undies.

715
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:54,280
The slack contained in the very vaginal secretions latent in any uberfem's undies is enough to kill Bob instantly.

716
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,740
Fuck Bob.

717
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,480
Fuck Bob.

718
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,820
Fuck Bob is nothing more than simply the butt plug in the ass of an unkempt rainbow child

719
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,220
who sold his ass to gay porn to support his co-cabin.

720
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:17,360
Fuck Bob isn't even worth the razor-striped underoos of a nine year old redneck boy.

721
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,100
Fuck Bob needs a job.

722
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,900
And you know what that job is, ladies and gentlemen?

723
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:28,260
Bob needs a job sucking my giant rubber cock.

724
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:42,280
I want Bob down on his knees in front of me, taking it in the ass from a seven foot tall Norwegian chicken, high heels with a giant purple strap on.

725
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:50,940
And while he's on his knees in front of me, you know what he can be doing? Sucking my giant rubber cock.

726
00:27:50,940 --> 00:28:00,640
Fuck Bob. Slightly crazed, I love the Norwegian women, but fuck Bob.

727
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,280
I hate Bob, and that's pretty obvious.

728
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:16,400
Mainly because I'm ten times the man Bob is, I'm about a thousand times the woman at least.

729
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,920
Bob keeps fucking his every dozen eggs.

730
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:29,360
But I've got an idea, let's fuck Bob over. You guys get the Singapore swing, I'll get the lead pipe, and we'll show Bob a thing or two.

731
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,320
Yeah.

732
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,900
You go first.

733
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,160
I will go first.

734
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:49,260
Bob came dressed like Sailor Moon came up to me, and he asked me, he had the gall to ask Kanye like me if he could give me oral pleasure.

735
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,480
I said, what the fuck.

736
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:56,040
Well, I dropped my drawers right there and showed him the glory of my dark jungle.

737
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,820
Bob's eyeballs fell right out of their sockets and rolled across the dusty ground.

738
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:07,340
I looked at him and said, get those back you fucker, or I want them later.

739
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:17,480
So there Bob was, crawling around on his hands as named, a little Sailor Scout skirt flapping in the winds.

740
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,920
I couldn't resist.

741
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:32,600
I pulled out my nine and a half inch space Connie strap-on of slack, and I gave Bob's little rosebud a stiff fucking, fuck Bob.

742
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:46,660
So there Bob was with this huge purple strap on his ass, screaming, Pisces fuck me harder, Pisces fuck me harder.

743
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,980
I was just disgusted with his candy ass.

744
00:29:51,380 --> 00:30:00,920
You know what, I looked at Bob, and I told him, put those little red panties back on you cunt, and suck my pussy like the bitch you are.

745
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,220
But you know what, Bob failed again, fucker.

746
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,020
Bob couldn't find the clitoris if it was in his fucking pipe.

747
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,740
Fuck Bob.

748
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,760
Fuck Bob.

749
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,140
See I've had Bob, the no good son of a bitch.

750
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,260
I've turned Bob down since then.

751
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:27,340
I said take my thirty dollars you fucker, go learn to eat pussy like a real woman.

752
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:34,560
I mean shit, I was drunk, Bob was being nice, he had on a nice pair of pantyhose.

753
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,740
But enough about that fucker.

754
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,700
Let's talk about Connie.

755
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,720
I see visions of Connie. Of course I do.

756
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,220
I am a vision of Connie.

757
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,660
I have titties that could feed a small South American nation.

758
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:02,540
I have ovaries of steel, and a cunt built like a brick house.

759
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,700
My uterus could nurture a full grown yeti.

760
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,280
I am a sweetie.

761
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,860
I'm a comb slut.

762
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,940
I'm an angel.

763
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,880
I'm a devil.

764
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,200
I am F-A-T fat.

765
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,180
And P-H-A-T fat.

766
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,260
I'm the succubus and the innocent.

767
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,680
I am a vision of Connie.

768
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,280
Connie herself.

769
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,520
And you know what?

770
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:50,000
So is every sweet, lickable, lovable, sexy uberfem in this church.

771
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,900
Very lickable, aren't they?

772
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,900
I don't see Connie though in the pages of Vogue magazine, my friends.

773
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,040
No, no, no, no.

774
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,680
I see Connie in beautiful, naturally occurring women with great wondrous beauty.

775
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,740
Dismutated imperfections.

776
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,780
Big, curvaceous asses.

777
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,660
Titties that bounce when they walk.

778
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,700
I want to see some fat on my women, and so does Connie.

779
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,020
No, no, no, my friends.

780
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:30,220
No cover girl for Revlon and the Clinique of Anorexia here.

781
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,520
No, no, no.

782
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:37,660
Those pink priestesses of pure anti-slack are put there by the con to keep you from the church.

783
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:37,800
You.

784
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,040
All of you.

785
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,100
From Connie.

786
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,400
And she lets that happen, you know.

787
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,760
Of course she does.

788
00:32:46,960 --> 00:33:00,560
Because if this filtering comes out, the only women who will be left after all the beauty ads and hype from the conspiracy are the true sex goddesses.

789
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,920
The true uberfems.

790
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,640
This is how Connie filters out the best females on this planet.

791
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,540
Not one true uberfem is once considered model material.

792
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:17,500
We're all too fat, too short, too skinny, too this, too that, too weird.

793
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:29,500
But as you know, as I know, too much is always better than not enough.

794
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:29,760


795
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:29,760


796
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:29,980
Now.

797
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,600
Ooh, doggies.

798
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:42,600
Reverend Pisces, friends, or actually Priestess Pisces, live at 5X Day.

799
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:48,460
Before that, we heard Reverend Floyd rehearsing his rap, which was never properly recorded.

800
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:54,700
Friends, Reverend Pisces, or Princess Pisces, is one of the Connie-ites of the church.

801
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:59,580
The gals who worship Connie more than Bob.

802
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,280
And the babes of the church.

803
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:07,780
And there's lots of them, as you can witness on the yearly subgenius calendars.

804
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:15,760
We had a beefcake calendar this year, as well as the traditional naked woman subgenius calendar.

805
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:22,080
Yes, you babes of the church, you better watch out, because we'll be watching you.

806
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,260
Uh, who else was right up front there, I remember?

807
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,040
Oh, yeah.

808
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,700
The, uh, the Evangelical, Princess Wee, of course, me.

809
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:31,780
Yeah.

810
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:31,900
Yeah.

811
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,280
It was a big blur.

812
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,380
There was a lot of people, a lot of people dancing.

813
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:39,800
It was, you had, it was the best-looking front row of babes I've ever seen at NX Day.

814
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,200
Yeah.

815
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,300
It was the, the.

816
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:41,580
Yeah.

817
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,160
There was a fine, fine front row there.

818
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,120
All the pagans must have been there, too, because when I went down to the roundhouse

819
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,680
later, they were all like, that was a great show, great show.

820
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,080
Oh, I could hear it all over the campground, too.

821
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:52,340
Yeah.

822
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,040
Even if they didn't want to come to get near the terrible subgeniuses.

823
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,020
Those men were.

824
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,020
Those men who never have sex.

825
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,900
Well, many of those people have had those.

826
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:02,860
Sexless.

827
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,780
The sexless geeks you must flee from.

828
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,200
The sexless geeks you must flee from.

829
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,520
Those sexless geeks will molest you.

830
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,040
So, who is the sexless geeks?

831
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,080
That's us.

832
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,020
Oh, that's us.

833
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,560
You, Dave.

834
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,660
But, but, but, we're, we're dangerous molesters at the same time.

835
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,660
Well, much in the way that we frogs have many different sexes, so are we all supposed

836
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,060
to be.

837
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,460
We're sexist macho sexist geeks.

838
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,220
Marxist?

839
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:25,860
Sexist?

840
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Sexless macho sexist geeks.

841
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,000


842
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,000


843
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,000


844
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,000


845
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,000


846
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,000


847
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,000


848
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:40,460
I first started watching bug porn when I was five.

849
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:48,720
Oh, it started out harmless enough, but soon I was popping in VCR after VCR tape of bugs

850
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,920
doing it any which way their little green brains could think of.

851
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,680
Butterfly O'Roll was my favorite.

852
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,980
To watch those little butters go to sleep.

853
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:57,980


854
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:03,320
Butterfly feet suck on the gas I know and the rat is shooting ant or beetle made me

855
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,700
cider spasm all over the walls.

856
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,220
I even hit the ceiling once.

857
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,000
Sick I know, but I couldn't stop.

858
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:17,140
Bug porn got in the way of girlfriends, boyfriends, family, and eating.

859
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,360
All I did was watch bug porn, bug porn, bug porn.

860
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:25,780
My penis was raw most of the time from friction burns.

861
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,960
I got to the point where I was like, oh, I'm going to die.

862
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:27,960


863
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:27,960


864
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:38,140
And I realized I don't like such things.

865
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,440
It made me wish I was eating stuff, like you and I, osm

866
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,540
is a really good song as well.

867
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,860
Oh, sometimes I want to open up my mouth, but I just can't.

868
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,140
Whenever I seldom just eye contact with them, I just let them draft a joke at me, so I didn't

869
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,800
have to be too careful.

870
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,000
I just wanted to smooth my shoes into the white color.

871
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,460
The immediate thing was to calm their nerves.

872
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,780
The road is getting裸 hatteer.

873
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:07,820
I even gave those red-headed ants a second chance, but now I tape up my pee-hole.

874
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:22,700
Addicted to the Insects, the world's first song about bug porn, by Heart Ignition.

875
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,180
Folks, it's just not the same without all the Jim Bae drummers.

876
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,740
Uh-uh.

877
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:45,840
We were playing this stuff at X-Day on the Club Tiki Banzai stage, the Bonobo A Go-Go,

878
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:55,040
with eight drummers and 40 or 50 dancers,

879
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,760
all in one little campground.

880
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,080
Campsite.

881
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,100
I'm just in a campsite.

882
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,080
That's all.

883
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,900
Campsite right by a swamp.

884
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,400
And, uh, yeah.

885
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,140
Yeah.

886
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,660
What a week.

887
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,800
What a week.

888
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,760
We built Monkey Island.

889
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,620
Here's what happened, actually, at X-Day, if you're curious.

890
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,540
And, uh, yeah, I'm still recording.

891
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,280
I even put a cue on it.

892
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,540
Uh, well, we built Monkey Island.

893
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,600
That's what we did.

894
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,080
And just presented it.

895
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,180
We just built, that's all we did.

896
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,540
We built Monkey Island.

897
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:45,500
And hot damn if the monkeys didn't just drop from the trees and, uh, populate that bastard.

898
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,060
Indeed it did.

899
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,860
But, uh, we built Monkey Island.

900
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:57,240
Me and my main, uh, me and my main man there.

901
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,540
And my main captain.

902
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,100
And my main drill instructor.

903
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,800
Dr. Katad and Lagune.

904
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,840
We inducted the recruits, too.

905
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,600
There was a lot of new recruits at X-Day.

906
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,300
We inducted them real right fine.

907
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,580
And we began the process of breaking them.

908
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,820
Others we had already begun the process of, and we did break them.

909
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,080
Uh, maybe not Saturday night at the big ESO show, but somewhere along the way.

910
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,780
Uh, many were broken.

00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:13,420
When sergeants begin speaking to you, your answer should begin with the word, sir, and end with the word, sir.

946
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,180
Do you understand me?

947
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,280
When sergeant Matthew Hall's asked you to repeat everything he said, you've been to the bed.

948
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,020
Do you understand me?

949
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,840
I'll tell him, you little fucking dude.

950
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,220
When I ask you again, you might be dumb.

951
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,760
Right, dude?

952
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,640
Get up here!

953
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,620
I don't want no teenage weed.

954
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,240
I just want my M14.

955
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,240
If I die in my combat suit,

956
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,420
they sound like pussies to me.

957
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,720
If you sound like pussies to sir,

958
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,220
now,

959
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,600
we're gonna give you

960
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,560
another chance!

961
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:28,740
You!

962
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,420
Lamby boy!

963
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,960
What's your fucking name?

964
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,040
Boy!

965
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,080
And I go!

966
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,280
And I go, sir!

967
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,520
Bullshit, Al Corvo!

968
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:47,720
You look like a simply pile of rat stuff!

969
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,460
And now all your name is?

970
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,640
Maverick Rat Stuff!

971
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,900
Do you understand me?

972
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,040
Sir, yes, sir!

973
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,160
Do you like me?

974
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,940
Sir, yes, sir!

975
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,080
Do you have a sucker?

976
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,620
You're a rat, my cock!

977
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,000
Sir, yes, sir!

978
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,580
Are you some kind of penis-bubbling homosexual?

979
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:02,900
No, sir!

980
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,040
No, sir!

981
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,300
No, sir!

982
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,380
Get down!

983
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,680
Get down!

984
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,000
Get down!

985
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,380
Get down!

986
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,020
Get down, y'all!

987
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:13,780
Yes, sir!

988
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,840
Yes, sir!

989
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,200
Yes, sir!

990
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,900
What about that one?

991
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,520
His name's Top Mojo.

992
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,300
Yes, sir!

993
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,460
Yes, sir!

994
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:34,720
Granada rhetoric, them, I'm sacking the

995
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,220
ice.

996
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,460
I don't want no teenage dream

997
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,940
I just want my M-40

998
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,720
If I die in the combat zone

999
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,520
Pack me up and ship me home

1000
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,360
If I'm 96 foot down

1001
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,600
Can you hear it hit the ground

1002
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,340
When you hit the bottom you hear me say

1003
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,580
Take my life

1004
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,440
You can't be saved

1005
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,800
If I wanna be a good instructor

1006
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,540
I wanna grab on my hair

1007
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,220
If I wanna be a good instructor

1008
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,600
I wanna wear my school be better

1009
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,100
And now

1010
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,920
One more time

1011
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,960
What's your name you monkey

1012
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,480
B coins

1013
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:06,900
Pass votes

1014
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,760
share we rockin'

1015
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,540
Oh my God

1016
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,260
Well what the hell different thing you got

1017
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,460
Do you have much in your ears

1018
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,260
A ton of less

1019
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,680
All you have is

1020
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:31,460


1021
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,880
You're crazy!

1022
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,320
What you're saying is okay!

1023
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,240
Bullshit!

1024
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,560
You're crazy!

1025
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,540
You're crazy!

1026
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,040
Bullshit!

1027
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,640
What you're saying is okay!

1028
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,040
You're crazy!

1029
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,080
What you're saying is okay!

1030
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,640
Bullshit!

1031
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:08,640


1032
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:08,640


1033
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:08,640


1034
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:08,640


1035
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:14,900
Bullshit!

1036
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,320
I know that I do have it

1037
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,780
14 years and I can't have it

1038
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,420
But I don't want no TV queen

1039
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,600
I just want my important

1040
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,380
Yeah, the heart

1041
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,860
Makes the world so far

1042
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,940
But your ass

1043
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,180
Pulled on some

1044
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,500
Superb stuff

1045
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,420
Cool little blue man group

1046
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,580
background here

1047
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,940
Yeah, the Bonobo

1048
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:41,500
Go Go

1049
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,600
Was the hot happening place

1050
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,720
At X Day

1051
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,680
One of the hot happening places

1052
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,600
And we certainly did jam it up

1053
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,500
Real right fine

1054
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:56,060
And man, I just can't tell you

1055
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,800
The things that happened there

1056
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,740
Just amazingly Bonobo

1057
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,800
Things that happened

1058
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,460
Which I had no part of

1059
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,220
Mostly

1060
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,400
All right, maybe a little bit

1061
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,140
One or two times

1062
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,220
But just as a

1063
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,420
Sort of overseer

1064
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:13,500
But the real

1065
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,960
But I didn't really get involved

1066
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,340
In any true Bonobo-ism

1067
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,200
Although other people sure did

1068
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:22,960
On my bed

1069
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,060
Come back from the hot tub

1070
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,120
Find some little hag

1071
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,880
Blowing my drummer on the bed

1072
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,060
Well, one of the drummers

1073
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:34,740
All right, somebody

1074
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:35,580
Not the drummers

1075
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,460
Can you say blowing?

1076
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,640
Probably not

1077
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:42,840
I'm not sure

1078
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:42,840


1079
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:42,840


1080
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:42,840


1081
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:44,380
I'm just a little bit

1082
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,280
Performing a lewd sex act

1083
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,040
In the public open eyes

1084
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,760
I'm like, what the hell's going on here?

1085
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:57,000
Like, get it the hell out of my bed, man

1086
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,820
Geez, old man

1087
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,060
I mean, I don't care

1088
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,260
If you wanna go have fun

1089
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,140
Go have fun

1090
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,580
What's the big deal?

1091
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,320
But not in my bed

1092
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:09,900
Come on

1093
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,840
I got a nice little thing here

1094
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,660
You know, one of them things

1095
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:14,540
You go down to Kmart

1096
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,600
You know, one of them queen-size

1097
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,420
Blow-up things on the stand

1098
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,520
You know, and I got one of those

1099
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,220
Under a lean-to

1100
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,020
And it's by the fire

1101
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,500
And it's a cozy place

1102
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,200
It's been my cozy little hideaway

1103
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,980
All summer long so far

1104
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:26,940
All spring and all summer

1105
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:31,440
But there was people defiling it

1106
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,420
And I was tired

1107
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,020
I wasn't in any kind of mood

1108
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,520
For this sort of open Bonobo-ism

1109
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,280
As the sun was coming up

1110
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,820
I also wanted to go to the

1111
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:42,820


1112
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:42,820


1113
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:42,820


1114
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:42,820


1115
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:42,820


1116
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:42,820


1117
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:42,820


1118
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,000
I wasn't in any mood to

1119
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,500
Sleep on a wet spot

1120
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,980
That someone else made

1121
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,060
So

1122
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,140
But I did play a lot of cowboy songs

1123
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,300
And I had fun doing that Saturday night

1124
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,240
And Friday night

1125
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,400
We had a pretty damn good jam too

1126
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,320
And Thursday night

1127
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,460
We had a really good dance party

1128
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,740
With the drummers and all that

1129
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,740
And, uh, boy

1130
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:05,140
It just

1131
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,040
Everybody wanted

1132
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,260
All the drummers came out

1133
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,480
All the pagans got together

1134
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,280
With the bobbies

1135
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,820
And there was a big truce

1136
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,800
And, uh, I was like

1137
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:12,800


1138
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:12,800


1139
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:12,800


1140
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:12,800


1141
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:12,800


1142
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:12,800


1143
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:12,800


1144
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:12,800


1145
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:12,800


1146
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:12,800


1147
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,900
There was even mating rituals

1148
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,300
Between bobbies and pagans

1149
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,780
That went on

1150
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,040
Yep

1151
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,900
But I just kind of kicked back

1152
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,140
And watched the monkeys on Monkey Island

1153
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,920
Swing from the vines

1154
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,000
Chitter chatter

1155
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,040
You know, that little

1156
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,800
Little chimp chitter chatter

1157
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,220
Chitter chatter

1158
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:42,340
Chitter chatter

1159
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,260
That kind of kept me up all night

1160
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,000
You know, some of that

1161
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,460
Chitter chatter of the chimps

1162
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:47,860
You know, the

1163
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:53,000
That

1164
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,580
You know what I mean

1165
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,460
It was just like

1166
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,040
You know, keeping me up

1167
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,080
But you get used to it after a while

1168
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,340
You sort of get used to

1169
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,560
The depravity of musicians

1170
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,920
But I did witness

1171
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,940
The goom actually pointed it out to me

1172
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,620
On Friday night

1173
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,200
It would have happened

1174
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,540
Right under my nose

1175
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,320
I never would have noticed

1176
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,680
Knew what was going on

1177
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,860
Uh, people were diving

1178
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,320
Literally

1179
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,180
Jumping

1180
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,360
Into the bonobo

1181
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,600
Cauldron

1182
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,400
Of depravity

1183
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,520
At 5X Day

1184
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,920
They were immersing themselves

1185
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:41,880
In the

1186
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:48,380
The sewage of our past DNA

1187
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,440
Back at age

1188
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,400
You hear about the new find?

1189
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,460
They're putting

1190
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,200
They're putting

1191
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,180
They found a skull

1192
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,020
That not quite ape

1193
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,380
Not quite human

1194
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:02,580
But definitely not ape

1195
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,020
But not all human

1196
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,420
Seven million years old

1197
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,400
And we've known

1198
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,820
For years and years

1199
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,860
That some divergence

1200
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:17,540
Happened

1201
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,160
Somewhere between

1202
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,700
Five million and ten million years ago

1203
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,800
But that's a five million year span

1204
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,620
And we didn't really know what

1205
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,940
You know, what the hell's going on there

1206
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:29,940
That's good music

1207
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,040
I'm just gonna keep that one going

1208
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,100
And uh

1209
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,940
We still don't know really

1210
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:36,940
It's very fuzzy in our

1211
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:38,820
You know, if you go to school for this stuff

1212
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,780
We don't really know what's happened

1213
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:41,900
In the last five years

1214
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,020
Five to ten million years

1215
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,360
Where we diverged

1216
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,480
From the chimps

1217
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,160
But we do know it happened

1218
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,540
Five to ten million years ago

1219
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,480
Hold on, I got

1220
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,820
Got a cough

1221
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,460
I still got a

1222
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:01,300
Little sore throat

1223
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,160
From last weekend

1224
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:03,840
But yeah

1225
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,040
So they find this skull

1226
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,380
And they just announced it

1227
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,540
Or put it in a paper today

1228
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:09,060
It was found last year sometime

1229
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:09,660
Actually

1230
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,260
It's probably been in all the science journals

1231
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:11,880
Already long ago

1232
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,240
And uh

1233
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,240
But there they are

1234
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,040
You know, we're not that far removed

1235
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,660
At all

1236
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:26,080
From that

1237
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,680
From that

1238
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,120
Half ape

1239
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,880
Half chimp

1240
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,400
Yeti sort of critter

1241
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,900
Somewhere in there

1242
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:37,500
So that's all we know

1243
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,860
Five to ten million years ago

1244
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,540
Aliens came down to the earth

1245
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,780
We don't exactly know when

1246
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,620
And mated with the chimps

1247
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:46,360
The bonobos

1248
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,660
And out popped the humans

1249
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:49,140
You know

1250
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,380
But now they're getting close to figuring

1251
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,860
You know, finding one of those first

1252
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,800
Yeti babies, I guess

1253
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,260
You know

1254
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,320
Or, you know

1255
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,540
And that's kind of cool

1256
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,220
But you know

1257
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:04,060
After spending a week in the woods

1258
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,100
With the whole church of the subgenius

1259
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,380
And the kind of

1260
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,520
People that it attracts

1261
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:16,240
You definitely see many instances

1262
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,780
There's many times

1263
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,020
In the short few days that you're there

1264
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,280
Just whatever

1265
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,360
Four days, something like that

1266
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,560
There's many instances

1267
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,520
In four short days

1268
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,940
Where you just look at what's happening

1269
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:30,280
And you go

1270
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,420
I mean, you can easily visualize

1271
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:35,680
One of them public television programs

1272
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,360
Where they morph into monkeys

1273
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,760
You know, chimps

1274
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,960
Because that's what they look like

1275
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,520
Going, I see a chimps

1276
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,340
I saw what I witnessed

1277
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:45,180
It looked like the chimps

1278
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,520
On Monkey Island

1279
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,220
And no different at all

1280
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,760
Except there was a lot less hair

1281
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,320
That's all

1282
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,140
And in some cases

1283
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,140
That wasn't true either

1284
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,320
Some cases there was just as much hair

1285
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,020
But most cases

1286
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,960
It was just a little less hair

1287
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:01,520
That's all

1288
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,420
A little more pink skin

1289
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:07,260
But definitely chimps

1290
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,400
No doubt about it

1291
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,220
Definitely chimps

1292
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,340
Saw it over and over

1293
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,140
And over

1294
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,120
But

1295
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:16,440
Anyway

1296
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,940
If this stuff ever gets out to

1297
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,600
The old church on the hour slap

1298
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,200
Or something

1299
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:25,060
I want to definitely thank all the people

1300
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:25,700
That donated

1301
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,760
If you're listening in

1302
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,000
To the Tranquility Base Fund

1303
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,680
That helped out a lot

1304
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,360
Thank all the people that brought stuff

1305
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,000
Brought swag

1306
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,200
Swaggly things

1307
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:39,780
To the

1308
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:41,500
Club's

1309
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:41,500


1310
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:41,500


1311
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,700
Tiki Banzai Bar

1312
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:44,680
Bottles of stuff

1313
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,120
And things to hang up

1314
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,460
And add to the display

1315
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,840
I want to thank all the drummers

1316
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,700
That jammed

1317
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,160
You know

1318
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,640
They're out there

1319
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,780
Though they ain't hearing my voice

1320
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:56,420
They're out in the woods right now

1321
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,280
They're drumming tonight

1322
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:58,800
I'm sure

1323
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,600
I guarantee you

1324
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,500
They're drumming going on

1325
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:01,720
Tonight

1326
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,160
Certainly tomorrow

1327
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,160
Because the big fests

1328
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:06,980
Are coming up now

1329
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:08,900
So you know

1330
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:10,000
Big thanks goes out

1331
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,860
To all them drummers

1332
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,400
And all the people

1333
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:11,720
That jam

1334
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,300
Big thanks goes out

1335
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,300
To all the people

1336
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:15,900
That danced

1337
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:16,740
You know

1338
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:17,500
Had a lot of fun

1339
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,700
At the big ESO show

1340
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,480
I certainly did

1341
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,620
I had fun

1342
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:24,520
I like

1343
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,260
I think it was

1344
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,000
Sister Decadence

1345
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,720
Putting one of the

1346
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,920
News group postings

1347
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:28,240
That I

1348
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,560
I changed costumes

1349
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,360
Almost

1350
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,920
Almost as much

1351
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,920
As Cher does

1352
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,840
But I think

1353
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,820
I have better costumes

1354
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,820
Though I just don't have

1355
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:38,580
Nice tits

1356
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:39,280
You know

1357
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:39,820
I think

1358
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,080
I'm going to have to

1359
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:44,080


1360
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,060
But I do have a weird look

1361
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:45,480
You know

1362
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,260
Like Cher does

1363
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,580
Got a uniquely weird look

1364
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:51,820
So

1365
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,620
But it was there

1366
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,280
There was there

1367
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,260
Back to the anthropology

1368
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,140
Of it all

1369
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,080
It was definitely

1370
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,240
A bonobo time

1371
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,500
That was had by all

1372
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,620
Bonobo go-go

1373
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,600
Was decked out

1374
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,260
To the hill

1375
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,400
And we had

1376
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,380
The gym

1377
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,040
Happening

1378
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:12,820
I'll tell you that

1379
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,740
Why are you going

1380
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:15,560
Deck state this year?

1381
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,300
We go

1382
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,980
To confront

1383
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,920
The chief enemies

1384
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,060
Of the people of the world

1385
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,860
The Yankee imperialists

1386
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,060
And their commander in chief

1387
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:29,380
The vulture from Texas

1388
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,920
It was merely a matter of hours

1389
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,200
Before the looting and arson

1390
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,240
Had spread through the city

1391
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,540
The first major fire

1392
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:36,600
Came at 6.30

1393
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,200
Man-hackers

1394
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:39,360
Man-hackers

1395
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,220
Man-hackers

1396
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,140
I think the people

1397
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:42,980
Are fed up

1398
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,880
Way up above their ear-line

1399
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,300
Of the muggings

1400
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,380
And the robberies

1401
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,360
And the murders

1402
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,660
And the hijacking

1403
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,480
And all this thing

1404
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,060
That's going on

1405
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,020
That's caused riots

1406
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,180
I think all races of people

1407
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,280
Feel that way about it

1408
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,040
Come on, baggy

1409
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:02,800
Get with the beat

1410
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,860
The bare necessities

1411
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:05,780
Of life

1412
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:06,840
Will come to you

1413
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,740
They'll come to me

1414
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,180
They'll come to you

1415
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,380
How about scratchin' your teeth?

1416
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:11,380


1417
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:11,380


1418
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:11,380


1419
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:11,380


1420
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:11,380


1421
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,380
And that old left shoulder

1422
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,460
While you're up there, Mowgli?

1423
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,780
Now just a hair lower

1424
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:16,260
There

1425
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,480
Right there

1426
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:18,200
That's it

1427
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,220
Oh

1428
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:20,880
This is new

1429
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,920
Oh, that's good

1430
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,920
Shit, we've got to get to a tree

1431
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,980
This calls for some big scratchin'

1432
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,200
You're a lot of work, Will-il

1433
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,020
Right on it

1434
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:33,160
Yeah

1435
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,000
Yeah

1436
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,200
Uh-huh

1437
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:35,780
Yeah

1438
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:36,820
That's delicious

1439
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,960
Uh-huh

1440
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:39,620
Oh

1441
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:40,020
Ooh

1442
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,920
Just a little bit

1443
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,020
Yeah

1444
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:43,160
Yeah

1445
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,680
Ha ha

1446
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,440
Huh

1447
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,200
Uh-huh

1448
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,500
Yeah

1449
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:48,880
Yeah

1450
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,340
Uh-huh

1451
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:50,020
Mm

1452
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,260
Uh-huh

1453
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:52,580
Huh

1454
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,000
Huh

1455
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,000


1456
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:53,940
Uh-huh

1457
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,020
Oh

1458
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:55,980
Yeah

1459
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:57,940
Uh-huh

1460
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:58,340
Yeah

1461
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:58,380
Yeah

1462
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,000
Uh-huh

1463
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:01,380
Uh-huh

1464
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,000
Heh

1465
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:05,840
Heh

1466
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,440
Heh

1467
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,140
Mm

1468
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:07,140


1469
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:07,140


1470
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:07,140


1471
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:07,900
Oh, man

1472
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,020
Sosodata's 5x day

1473
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,580
a sickening little collage

1474
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:20,780
of how Reverend Sosodata

1475
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,660
spent his 5x day drill

1476
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,020
and now friends

1477
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,560
to take us home

1478
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,140
take us on home

1479
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:30,320
Einstein's Secret Orchestra

1480
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,640
ESO Swamp Radio

1481
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,780
from beautiful WCSB Cleveland

1482
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,200
with yours truly

1483
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,420
Reverend Ivan Stang

1484
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,820
Doc Rock

1485
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,420
Professor Chaz Smith

1486
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:45,800
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1487
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,940
you know it's weird

1488
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:51,260
some people are disgusted

1489
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,860
by insectuals

1490
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,960
they hate bug porn

1491
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,940
and therefore

1492
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:59,380
I guess he was mad at you

1493
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,900
for not having been aborted

1494
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,440
for doing what you did

1495
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,080
that one time

1496
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,360
with that umbilical cord

1497
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,840
uh huh

1498
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:08,320
well

1499
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,220
spit it out

1500
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:09,760
I see it

1501
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,560
spit it out

1502
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:12,420
spit that thing out

1503
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:12,740
right now

1504
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:13,420
it's not gone man

1505
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:15,060
it's been swallowed years before

1506
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:16,340
look at these dendrites

1507
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,020
look at these small little snappy teeth

1508
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,200
does it look like I could chew

1509
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:19,640
an umbilical cord

1510
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,760
you can't look at your own dendrites

1511
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,220
like in the days of 1x

1512
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,580
like I could jump down

1513
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,500
and literally rip

1514
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,920
someone's umbilical cord out

1515
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,180
and perhaps play the floating baby

1516
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:30,120
and throw it through the air

1517
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,040
I'm incapable of such stuff now

1518
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,140
the floaty baby you say

1519
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,880
of course the floaty baby

1520
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,640
you think you can just say this stuff

1521
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,300
and then just have to say it

1522
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:38,300


1523
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:38,300


1524
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,700
and nobody take you up on

1525
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:40,380
check it out

1526
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,340
and ask what's up

1527
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:43,460
you're just gonna spew out this nonsense

1528
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,980
and nobody's gonna call you up on it

1529
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:46,140
right

1530
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,000
as if the floaty baby wasn't a real thing

1531
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,700
that everybody saw on X-Day

1532
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:50,760
floating over the horizon

1533
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,540
buzzing the brushwood campgrounds

1534
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:54,980
well I know I saw it

1535
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,580
dropping its diaper waste

1536
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:58,560
well I know I'm not allowed to see them

1537
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,520
its confused blatherings

1538
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,900
you're not allowed to see anything

1539
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,080
you never even see the UFOs that circle around here

1540
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,300
ever ever ever

1541
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:04,540
not me

1542
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,140
I mean there are people pointing skyward

1543
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,960
you know with one finger one place

1544
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,300
and you're not allowed to see them

1545
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:08,540
the other one

1546
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:08,940
the other one

1547
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,200
and you refuse to acknowledge this stuff

1548
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,060
and I wonder why

1549
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,080
you can't see them

1550
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:14,440
I can't

1551
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,960
we believe in the gods

1552
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,040
who don't want us to believe in them Dave

1553
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,740
and we believe in the gods

1554
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:23,100
who have ended this world as we know it

1555
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,220
and have given us this sandwich in return

1556
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:26,880
we're back to square one

1557
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,480
yes square one indeed

1558
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,740
and this world is ending

1559
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:34,020
this ESO radio stand-in is ending

1560
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,820
as the hour comes to a close

1561
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:38,300
and DJ A's fans will be gloating

1562
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,060
glad to know

1563
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,100
that he's back

1564
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,680
and urban lullabies will proceed

1565
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,400
as before

1566
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,580
as ever

1567
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:51,540
and as unto the end of time

1568
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:54,380
with your sack in the wind

1569
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,820
your head in the saddle

1570
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:58,060
how does all that stuff go?

1571
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:01,000
keep your proboscis in its normal situation

1572
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,680
keep your tangential awareness acute

1573
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,480
and keep your feet dry and fuzzy

1574
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,300
I bet you've always wanted to do this

1575
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:12,020
and any stray sacks all go to Princess We of course

1576
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:21,460
and keep your frustrated wanderings

1577
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:22,960
in a small circle

1578
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,420
so that you don't harm any of the other patients

1579
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,580
keep your feet

1580
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:29,520
forget it

1581
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:31,020
oh

1582
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,400
I'm slack

1583
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:45,720
P.O. Box 204206

1584
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:51,080
Austin, Texas 78720

1585
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:58,040
that's a box 204206

1586
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:04,920
Austin, Texas 78720

1587
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:13,820
And it's so calm at www.subgenius.com

1588
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,720
Praise Bob

1589
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:23,940
They didn't know how to wipe without actual toilet paper

1590
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:26,260
Everybody knows a good old dry leaf will do it just fine

1591
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:29,060
When my bandmates first got there, the other two guitar players

1592
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:31,740
They were like, they'd never been to this before

1593
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,720
And there was that little short guy

1594
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,460
Peter Pan, they called him

1595
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:38,000
Yeah, the little guy

1596
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,340
Reverend Zorro

1597
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:41,340
Oh, Reverend Zorro, the fox

1598
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:43,400
So cunning and free

1599
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:47,000
And he was standing there watching whatever was going on at the stage

1600
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,240
This was daytime still

1601
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:50,440
Still light out

1602
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,660
And John and Frank and I walked up to the stage

1603
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:58,820
And he was standing there and he was picking his ass

1604
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,600
Well, we all hooked fingers firmly up

1605
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:01,720
The chest

1606
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,080
You think that if you're really scratching it

1607
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,780
Was picking his ass, he would have picked a better one than that?

1608
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,240
That's what I can't understand

1609
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,880
And John and Frank just looked at each other

1610
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,860
And I didn't know what to say

1611
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:15,880
I began slowly picking their own muscles

1612
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:20,000
They were like, Chaz, man, what kind of fucking gig did you get here, man?

1613
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,160
They were, after all the asses, they were confused

1614
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,200
They thought he was a demon

1615
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:26,620
I mean, these are the guys I play in in a glam rock band

1616
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:28,240
That we go and play New York City all the time

1617
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,220
They're not ready for bold surrealism

1618
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:31,700
They kept asking, what's the deal?

1619
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:32,700
What's up with that guy?

1620
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:35,020
I didn't know what to say, what's up with that guy

1621
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,680
What was up with that guy?

1622
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:38,540
His finger

1623
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,520
He's a descendant of the Yeti

1624
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,980
His finger in his colon

1625
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:44,400
He's a genius

1626
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,200
He's closer to Bob than you are, Dave, I'll bet you

1627
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,400
Well, I'm sure he is

1628
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,480
I noticed there was much less hair on his chest

1629
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,060
And Bob was fond of depilation of the chest hairs

1630
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:56,720
Bob's an old crack picker from way back

1631
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,680
He smoked many a wedge in his days, unfortunately

1632
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,680
Yeah, for a long time

1633
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,800
There was a lot of hair

1634
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,080
There was a lot of hair
