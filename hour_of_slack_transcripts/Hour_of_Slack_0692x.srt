1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:08,640
30 seconds until the end of the world. Prepare to be boarded to a new one.

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,900
Uh, 20, 20, I hate this backwards stuff.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:31,860
15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:32,940
Yes!

5
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,480
Ah, brothers!

6
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,440
Well, it could be, you know, we could be awful over there.

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,180
Just keep conscious, right?

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:42,740
Mmm.

9
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:43,780
Ah!

10
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:54,460

Look out!

12
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,980
God is right behind you.

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,780
The soft genius.

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,260
Power of what?

15
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,140
Or any other, uh, uh, cute, uh, cute.

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:15,760
Rupture scene.

17
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,940
Take two!

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,180
Goodbye.

19
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,400
Goodbye.

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:19,760
Goodbye.

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,100
No lost ending.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:20,720
Earth.

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,940
I don't want to be ruptured.

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,200
Yes, dear friends.

25
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:25,540
Well.

26
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,020
I don't want to be ruptured with a feeling of deja vu.

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,920
I have my ticket!

28
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,180
I give you dollar!

29
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:35,600
No!

30
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,240
Oh!

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,220
Where are you?

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,880
I should pay!

33
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,280
Not again!

34
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,100
Oh, no!

35
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,640
Oh, no!

36
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,640
The bill is tight!

37
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,300
Waiter's order!

38
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:49,380
Here are just two once-a-day tickets!

39
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:49,380


40
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:49,560
We are breaking!

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:49,560


42
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:49,560


43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:49,560


44
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:49,560


45
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:49,560


46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,520
We could be off by...

47
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,120
I knew it was going to be...

48
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,880
Triplex day!

49
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,500
ultsÃ±osamosnosnos

50
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:55,540
No!

51
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,640
You have it on.

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,460
Triplex day!

53
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,740
Triplex day!

54
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,840
uh meet you fell into the 10th dimension how'd you like that did you did you follow any of that

55
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,780
probably not huh that's okay we didn't understand it either we were dubbing cds down from uh double

56
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,780
x day down in the studio and i don't even know how long it's you've been listening to

57
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:49,380
the symphonies of the planets that was part of the lesson the meditation period after the science

58
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:58,920
yes to let the the art of the science of god that's right the math of god in his great paint

59
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:07,780
brush and chisel everything's geometry god is a is just geometry oh yeah but who yeah but who

60
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,680
what taught god how to do that

61
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:17,420
geometry who taught god man see it's an endless recursive that i told you about nothing escher

62
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:24,200
bach it's an endless recursive formula nothing gives birth to itself from its mother something

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,480
that makes sense it does it well it doesn't exactly make sense but it sounds good and

64
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,660
they've been saying it for billions of years billions and billions of years

65
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,660
bullions i would like

66
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:48,160
to have billions of bullions of gold a sea of bullion i've sort of i've studied a sea of beef

67
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:58,240
bullion i've studied uh spiritualism of all kinds mysticism science history and uh i've decided that

68
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,760
the most important subject is money and i don't mean that in any crass way i mean it just as nobly

69
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,200
as i would mean any of the others it's just like money i've i've been everywhere

70
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,180
i've done everything and i want to get paid for it there's nothing left to do except get the check

71
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:22,140
well that's the final punch line of the church of the subgenius now isn't it it'd be whether the world ends or not

72
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:35,220
when bob laughs his way to the bank you know it it will be the greatest joke ever told if earth can make it to the punch line and by gobs we got another chance

73
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,760
we got another chance to make it the first time the world has heard from us

74
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:39,760


75
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:39,760


76
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:39,760


77
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:47,200
uh since this past weekend we fooled you that first time in 98 and we fooled you again you

78
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,280
thought you thought you're going to get off easy of course this could just be a tape recording

79
00:04:51,920 --> 00:05:00,280
well it is a tape recording now yeah but that's a moot point it's after july 5th 1999 the

80
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:08,060
exodus did not come and rupture the subgeniuses nor destroy the planet as our religion foretold

81
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,760
but

82
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:19,000
you were you were thinking you were going to get off easy but no it's you're going to be a slave to

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,640
the conspiracy for yet another year i guess they decided to rub it in but as they as the subgenius

84
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:34,220
faithful gathered on the hillside by the pavilion that morning that fateful morning at 7 8 well 703

85
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:39,260
and nothing had happened they started spontaneously chanting third

86
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:47,820

95
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,480
and the little sockets, the rockets in the sockets.

96
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,360
Just say, computer, do your stuff.

97
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:44,780
Yeah.

98
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,420
And, you know, grab your sweetie

99
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,880
or whatever kind of alien monster you're into,

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,440
species, by the tail,

101
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,880
and lean back and take off, baby.

102
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,200
Just like we did.

103
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,960
Sure, the exes didn't come again,

104
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,540
but, you know,

105
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,240
I'm not going to say the obvious that I could right then,

106
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,460
but, friends, I'll tell you,

107
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,700
we sure have been having a great time on this planet anyway.

108
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,480
I've just seen, stick around, it's been so slackful.

109
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,240
Yeah, especially, yeah, that was last weekend.

110
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,500
It was nothing like the year before.

111
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,780
Oh, there was so much excitement the first year,

112
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,800
you know, the world was definitely going to end,

113
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,020
and this time it was like, well,

114
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,340
now we know if the world's going to end,

115
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,580
what's the hurry?

116
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,320
And if the world's not going to end,

117
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,300
what's the hurry?

118
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,520
Either way, lay back, man.

119
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,880
Do what Bob said.

120
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,360
It's the path of least resistance.

121
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,500
Cruise, surf, you know, let the wind blow.

122
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,040
Bend like a reed in the wind, Daddy-O.

123
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,300
Inflate, rise, take a deep breath and float.

124
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,560
Church air, one soul per breath.

125
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,420
Yes, dear friends.

126
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,840
Well, at least, you know, we didn't get the escape vessels,

127
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,880
but at least we got a bunch of cans in here.

128
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,240
Yes, we got free candy.

129
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:11,580
I got my back.

130
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,280
I got all the slack money tonight.

131
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
I got my back.

132
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:14,860
Oh.

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,560
It's back.

134
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,300
I noticed inside there were some pills inside the head.

135
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,160
Pills.

136
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,500
Pills.

137
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,860
Look at the pills.

138
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,400
Pills.

139
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,680
There were pills inside Bob's head.

140
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,820
Oh, my.

141
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,400
The same thing that's inside Bob's head

142
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,980
would be inside these pills.

143
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,900
Let's see those pills.

144
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,680
Absolutely nothing at all.

145
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,100
The standard Dobbs pills,

146
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,880
they're the same ones that people have sworn,

147
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,900
by all these years.

148
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,440
When they're...

149
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,000
Church air.

150
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,640
Um...

151
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,180
Amazing.

152
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:42,900
Isn't it?

153
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,180
Pills.

154
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,560
They, uh, no longer...

155
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,680
I've developed a tolerance to these myself.

156
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Anybody want my pills?

157
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,480
These are pills?

158
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,500
They're suppository.

159
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:49,740
Yeah.

160
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,200
Yeah.

161
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,540
What's got...

162
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,480
Oh, the theft of Bob.

163
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,600
...dimensional substance with you,

164
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,740
smoking this pipe.

165
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,740
Do you think Little Theodore...

166
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,360
No!

167
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,760
No!

168
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,120
No!

169
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:00,960
Good Lord.

170
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,900
We are not a bunch of...

171
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:02,900


172
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,380
...but we got Little Theodore.

173
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:04,960
There you go.

174
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,380
We got Lust in space!

175
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,100
We got Lust in space.

176
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,860
He isn't in space! He isn't in space!

177
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,800
We've already lost in space before then.

178
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,240
Exactly.

179
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:11,820
Where are they?

180
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,560
Exactly.

181
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:12,820


182
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,240
They're already gone, Tammy.

183
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,300
Those aliens are sneaky.

184
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,400
Lust in space has their own stuff.

185
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,160
Exactly.

186
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,680
They already got them.

187
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,080
They built their own ship.

188
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,120
They built their own!

189
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,740
They built their own!

190
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,420
They built their own escape vessel.

191
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:24,780
Sure.

192
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,120
Maybe we didn't get our escape vessels,

193
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,360
but we got a hell of a fireworks show

194
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,440
that was dangerous,

195
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,280
and somebody could have been...

196
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,600
got hurt any second.

197
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,760
What excitement!

198
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,460
Dr. P, lose your shit!

199
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,620
Hey, sure, you may not have gotten your escape,

200
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,120
but you got to meet that one person that you know.

201
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,360
It's just you just don't know what you'd do

202
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,540
if you hadn't met that person.

203
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,760
Especially a year from now when you're married to him.

204
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:50,860
And...

205
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,140
And sure, maybe we didn't get our escape vessels yet.

206
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,940
There's still, you know, I mean...

207
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,580
Phil Jerome!

208
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,160
Third time's a charm!

209
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,840
I've built my own already!

210
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,720
Where were you?

211
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,020
Who's Phil Jerome?

212
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,040
But...

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,920
But, darling, since when do we need

214
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,600
some darned escape?

215
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,400
I mean, we're not going to be alien monsters and...

216
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,020
and big...

217
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,400
the demigod...

218
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,860
a holy man with pipes to tell us what to do.

219
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,280
By golly, we're subgeniuses.

220
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,920
We're self-amusing personalities.

221
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,780
And we need to ignore...

222
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,000
S.A.B.s.

223
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,420
We know...

224
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,120
We can...

225
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,820
By...

226
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,260
By gosh and by golly,

227
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,920
I think we can carry on and...

228
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,040
and show Bob and the exes that we are worthy.

229
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,080
And that goddamn the Jehovah's Witnesses

230
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,320
can't out-cook us.

231
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,180
That's right!

232
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,500
That's right!

233
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,000
That's right!

234
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,160
And we have total faith in J.R. Bob Dobbs.

235
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,900
And if he happens to fuck up,

236
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,120
well, we knew that he was the one holy man

237
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,680
that has the power to fail,

238
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,920
and fail again and again.

239
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,040
And if he doesn't,

240
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,540
I think I'm sure we may be $60 broker

241
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,800
per day while we were here.

242
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,280
But think how much richer Bob is.

243
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,440
Sure, the subgenius foundation itself may be,

244
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,300
you know...

245
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:05,980
I've seen the books.

246
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,540
I've seen the books.

247
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:06,880
I've seen the books.

248
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,200
What do you think?

249
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,740
I'm happy to have been double crossed on Dos Zecs

250
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,260
and I'll be even happier to get fucked on triple-X day.

251
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,540
By God, we may not have gotten our escape vessels,

252
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,900
but we got a new slogan.

253
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,540
ramen Indians

254
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:33,800
You may die.

255
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,660
That's the important thing.

256
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,320
At home.

257
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:37,800
Yeah.

258
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,240
You may die.

259
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,140
And remember.

260
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,180
Or will you live the rest of this day

261
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,200
as if this was the last day of your life

262
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,540
or as if you had all the time in the world, either one?

263
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,160
Yeah!

264
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,140
I certainly will and I'm gonna start

265
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,820
by going to bed, I guess.

266
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,100
What?

267
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
God damn it.

268
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,480
I spent my life driving for 10 fucking hours.

269
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,700
I was really hoping to be zapping

270
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,920
that hated fifth grade teacher.

271
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,900
Maybe I still had too much anti-slack in my heart.

272
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,080
Maybe we're all still dwelling on revenge.

273
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,140
When we should be thinking about forgiveness,

274
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,340
there has been, there have been moments of anger

275
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,100
during this weekend, but all of them that I know of,

276
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,740
mostly, have ended in forgiveness.

277
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,240
And, uh.

278
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,440
In love.

279
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,340
And, yes.

280
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,300
All about love.

281
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,020
Praise love!

282
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,940
All about love.

283
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,900
And even the occasional heartache.

284
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,040
Oh, screw it.

285
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,920
Ah, screw it.

286
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:31,920


287
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,280
No, no, no.

288
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,460
You're right, I'm so, I'm so-

289
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,580
And yeah, and we were all upset last year

290
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,960
when the Axis didn't arrive.

291
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,200
Bob let us down.

292
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,820
But hey, you know, if Bob can't screw up, who can?

293
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,520
I kinda felt that way about Bill Clinton.

294
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:49,700
Yeah.

295
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,320
You know, if the king of the universe

296
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,360
can't get some hanky-panky on the side,

297
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,840
then what did all those soldiers die for, friends?

298
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,860
And if-

299
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,220
If we can't get off Earth, then what do we get out of bed for?

300
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,220
We're going to get off.

301
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:11,920
Whether the aliens or Bob do it, we don't care.

302
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,660
We'll do it ourselves.

303
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,840
We've shown we can.

304
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,020
We can, yeah.

305
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,120
We only had a couple of casualties.

306
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,280
One car was destroyed by one of the incoming rockets.

307
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:30,800
A couple of rival cult compounds, I think, had their tent flaps caught on fire.

308
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,820
Yeah, right.

309
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,960
Oh, yeah, that wasn't my doing, though.

310
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,660
There was one pagan.

311
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,100
One was.

312
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,600
That one pagan whose tent kept coming in the path of rockets,

313
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,160
both from above and right across, directly across the grass.

314
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,960
He just seemed he sat out there in his easy chair and watched them come at him.

315
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,520
Yeah.

316
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,120
He was a slackful pagan.

317
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,040
Man, he was.

318
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,640
He just chilled out.

319
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,380
That rocket, that one rocket, man.

320
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,280
Friends, your host.

321
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,080
You can't even describe what happened to that one rocket.

322
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,640
Let me set the scene, friends.

323
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,020
It was Sunday afternoon before the world ended,

324
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:17,560
and your host, Commander Chaz, was in his full Dances with Rockets regalia,

325
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,180
a Native American headdress,

326
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,660
leading a procession of spicebags,

327
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,240
and rocket men, and savage earth men,

328
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,020
carrying standards of rocketry,

329
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,780
and a hell of a lot of psychedelically painted actual rockets,

330
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,840
and various other kinds of weapons.

331
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,640
There were potato cannons toted long behind,

332
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,380
chanting,

333
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,260
Build your own rocket ship.

334
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,940
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

335
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,660
Build.

336
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,020
Oh.

337
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,200
Oh.

338
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,060
Oh.

339
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,100
Oh.

340
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,100


341
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,100


342
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,100


343
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,100


344
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,100


345
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,100


346
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,100


347
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,620
Oh.

348
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:57,420


349
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,060
Now God.

350
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,060


351
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,660
We're teaching us,

352
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,580
I'm ELI,

353
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,600
about how to get robots

354
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,140
so that we arquers

355
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:15,220
off the track

356
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,220


357
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,220


358
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,680
I didn't know it was the sport-

359
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,520
or the B ì ëë¡,

360
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:17,900
orcultural circuit and ride

361
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,220
car.

362
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:18,220


363
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:18,680
I think right in my lane.

364
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,480
He was delighting

365
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,500
did both physical distance,

366
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:21,500


367
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:28,000
Joe and Bob Mosick officiate,

368
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,160
helping as Chaz officiated

369
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,540
and introduced each rocket one by one,

370
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,400
plugging their butts with that rocket motor,

371
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,500
sticking them sensually down that long, long shaft

372
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,020
of that miniature gantry.

373
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,980
The crowd would expectantly wait

374
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,840
while Chaz would nonchalantly and coolly, calmly

375
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,480
light that rocket bud.

376
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,920
And then he'd saunter away

377
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,260
and kind of whisper,

378
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,760
fire in the hole, baby.

379
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,920
And the audience would hold their breath

380
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,860
and that rocket would go,

381
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,260
psss, pt, pt, pt, pt.

382
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,600
It's out of here, baby.

383
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,940
And the whole crowd would tilt their heads up

384
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,200
and stare into the face of the sun

385
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,960
as the rocket reached to that mighty flame

386
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,900
flaming orb up there.

387
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,940
We're talking big motors.

388
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,020
Sometimes their heads would pop off

389
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,040
and little handkerchief would pop out

390
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,600
and they'd float down all slackful and nice

391
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,180
on a parachute.

392
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,560
Other times they'd tilt upside down

393
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,240
and come screaming straight down

394
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,200
metal-pointed tip first

395
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,800
at the hood of a Cadillac car

396
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,080
that might be parked

397
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,700
or a nice trailer

398
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,120
or the rented...

399
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,940
I had to give him a CD.

400
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,880
The rented van that I drove up there in.

401
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,960
Oh, yes.

402
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:46,960
But I...

403
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,760
I didn't drive back.

404
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,160
I decided I'd stay here

405
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,040
till the exes come.

406
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,540
I'm just gonna hang out

407
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,260
till the exes come back.

408
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,940
I have faith.

409
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,560
I'll prove my faith.

410
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,160
I do.

411
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,300
Good.

412
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,600
So that sets the scene.

413
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,740
Oh, yeah.

414
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,580
The Snake Rocket.

415
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,020
Well, in every dance of perfection

416
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,020
there's always some clumsy oaf

417
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,620
that just almost burns down the building

418
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,240
and, uh...

419
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:28,460
Why...

420
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,940
It was a six-foot-tall rocket

421
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,960
but very thin.

422
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,960
And it had a...

423
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,320
a G-80 Blue Thunder motor in it

424
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,720
which has not that much thrust

425
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,880
but it is about 25, 30 pounds of thrust.

426
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,660
The rocket, of course,

427
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,760
is only about two pounds.

428
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,600
And as it took off,

429
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,860
it got about 10 feet high,

430
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,220
dove down,

431
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,900
flew straight into the camp

432
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,200
of this sort of pagan subgenius guy

433
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,040
sitting in his big lawn chair

434
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,380
and started exploding all over the ground.

435
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:15,780
And...

436
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:15,860
And...

437
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,980
And he started dancing and firing up

438
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,220
and screeching louder than you can imagine.

439
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,120
And that guy, he just sat there.

440
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,940
He didn't even flinch.

441
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,620
This rocket was self-destructing,

442
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,260
catastrophic disaster,

443
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,620
10 feet in front of him.

444
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,720
And he just sat there with his beer in his hand.

445
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,100
And after it was all over,

446
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,520
he just kind of shook his head.

447
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,160
Maybe that was Bob in an overweight pagan suit.

448
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,340
But it sure was fun to watch.

449
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,060
Yeah, we launched him.

450
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,200
Friends X-Day was a wonderful success.

451
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,100
I wish that you could see the slides and videotapes

452
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,500
that I've got in my pocket right now.

453
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,720
WCSB Cleveland.

454
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,260
Where's Dave?

455
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,300
We all were prettier than last year.

456
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,160
And we had a prom, a lovely mutant prom, friends.

457
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,880
You know, we, a lot of us, Gene and I,

458
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,720
either don't remember our proms or wish we didn't or didn't even go.

459
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,920
And this year it was like a twisted, we turned the tables.

460
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,300
It was the exact opposite.

461
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,400
It was a funhouse mirror image of the high school from hell.

462
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,580
It was all the geeks and weirdos outnumbered the normals and populars

463
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,720
so much that there were none.

464
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,920
They were completely ostracized to the point where there was nothing

465
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,380
but ostracized weirdos and geeks having a party, man.

466
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,860
Oh, yes.

467
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,720
With Glenn Miller songs like any prom should have.

468
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,320
And friends, there was violence.

469
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,280
There was sickness.

470
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,980
There was, there was, there were moments when,

471
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:40,040
There was a lot of violence.

472
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,700
when I was seriously,

473
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,780
I was seriously terrified and my bowels are still kind of upset

474
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,620
at the punishment of Papa Joe Mama.

475
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,520
My friend, Papa Joe Mama,

476
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,180
I stood there and watched Friday Jones torture that man.

477
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,080
I videotaped while Friday Jones tortured a man.

478
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,860
You seem to be getting into videotaping that.

479
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,020
It's my way of, to tell the truth.

480
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,500
You're sticking that camera right in Papa Joe's face.

481
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,760
It's my way of not being involved.

482
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,100
It's my, it's my way of hiding.

483
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,580
It's like, it's the shell of,

484
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,080
the turtle that I am.

485
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,400
I'm hiding when I have that video camera.

486
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,720
No one can bother me, but I'm bothering everybody else.

487
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:25,260
Or at least, you know, I'm, you know how it is with the cameraman is in another dimension.

488
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,080
He's in the 10th dimension looking at all sides at once.

489
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,800
Little wiggles and squiggles.

490
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,940
Scares the heck out of me.

491
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,680
The fourth dimension and the sixth.

492
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,080
Those are the magical ones.

493
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,480
And the 10th.

494
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,200
Six plus four, 10.

495
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,780
Those are the magic numbers today.

496
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,260
They've displaced the three and the seven.

497
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,480
Six, four, 10.

498
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,980
Wiggles and squiggles.

499
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:18,840
Friends, atoms are nothing but little wiggles and squiggles in the middle of the ethers.

500
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,640
They're not really things.

501
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,200
You're not made of things.

502
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,300
You're not a thing.

503
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,180
You're just a pattern made of patterns.

504
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,880
You're nothing.

505
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,160
You're just a bunch of whirlpools held together in one whirlpool.

506
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:31,920
I'm nothing.

507
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,060
He's nothing.

508
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,880
The dog's nothing.

509
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,220
Everything came from nothing.

510
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,700
But Bob could just cough and blow up.

511
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,080
He could blow us all right off of the metaphysical table.

512
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:52,940
I mean, it's not as if it was all so densely compacted into one infinitesimally small point.

513
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,420
It was actually nothing.

514
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,660
Something from nothing.

515
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,540
That's the key.

516
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,660
As above, so below.

517
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,440
Or is it something?

518
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,480
All the way up, all the way down.

519
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,180
So big you can't go around it.

520
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,440
Where's that cowboy?

521
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,680
Are we supposed to be looking at the sky?

522
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:11,680


523
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,460
Are we looking at blinking lights on the phone or anything?

524
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah, I don't see any blinking.

525
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,560
I just, I don't know.

526
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,220
I just don't know.

527
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,040
Maybe no one actually, maybe it actually happened.

528
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,500
Maybe everybody else got ruptured but us.

529
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:27,100
We thought we were so slack, full and cool.

530
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,340
Thought we were Bob's chosen.

531
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,920
He took the rest of them.

532
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,700
Yep, the Bobbies.

533
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,060
The ones that we looked down upon and sneered at.

534
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,640
They were the ones who were lifted off.

535
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,460
And Dave, the most wretched of the lowly.

536
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,680
Of the forsaken.

537
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,560
The lonesomest.

538
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,640
Lonesome cowboy Dave.

539
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,040
Right.

540
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,560
Is now the least lonesome.

541
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,520
He's partying with the sexist.

542
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,260
It all makes sense.

543
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,820
He took the people who paid the way and left the people who took the pay.

544
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:05,260
Jesus said the meek shall inherit the earth and Zappa said the geeks shall inherit the earth.

545
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,140
And Jesus took the money and ran back to Dallas.

546
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,560
Centersville.

547
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:17,860
A real nice place to raise your kids up.

548
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,160
Quoteth the Reverend Howard Kalin.

549
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,940
Yeah, indeed.

550
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,740
Mark Vollman is not a member of the Church of the Subgenius.

551
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,940
He's only interested in carnal things.

552
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:41,080
But Howard Kalin of the Turtles and Flo and Eddie was a spiritual, he's a spiritual gentleman.

553
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,820
He's also rich as mine is price, Bob.

554
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,560
I'm going to go check the door.

555
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:46,960
Go ahead.

556
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,100
See if Dave's at the airlock.

557
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,440
Check the door.

558
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,300
This will be the 300th time today that Chaz is going to do that.

559
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,440
We're expecting him back.

560
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,840
He ain't coming back.

561
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,120
But I keep getting this beep on the radar here every now and then.

562
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,260
You gotta face it, man.

563
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,220
That's a booger.

564
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,820
That's a bogey.

565
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,420
You're...

566
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,980
Dave ain't coming back.

567
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,640
You gotta face it, dude.

568
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,960
I know he's your best friend.

569
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,360
But...

570
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,460
Where is he, man?

571
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,020
I know he's out there still.

572
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,960
He's gone, man.

573
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,100
It wasn't him.

574
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,640
I saw him eat it.

575
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,060
He's toast.

576
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,420
No, he jumped out of the way.

577
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,700
I saw him jump out of the way right at the last second.

578
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,180
No, you're kidding yourself, man.

579
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,540
His face, that was his face that was blown into your lap.

580
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:32,580
Oh.

581
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,080
I'm going to go look.

582
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,500
Well, you never know.

583
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,680
He'll be right back.

584
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,240
All right.

585
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,560
Oh, friends.

586
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,380
Oh, look, I've been left in the haunted station all by myself.

587
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,900
Dave ain't coming back.

588
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,640
You know why?

589
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,420
I made sure of that myself.

590
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,120
I've been wiping these rival weirdos out one by one.

591
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,200
Chad's the one.

592
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,400
He can't hear what I'm saying.

593
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,800
And I know you're not going to call in and tell him.

594
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,060
He-he-he-he.

595
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,680
Fools.

596
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:08,940
The blind earth fools stumbling and blinking in their pathetic three-dimensional, four-dimensional,

597
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,220
ten-dimensional...

598
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,400
Oh, Chad, ten dimensions, big deal.

599
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:12,680
Woo.

600
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,160
Oh, he's come back.

601
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:19,520
And, uh, yes, that's 75214, dear friends.

602
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,020
And you know what to do.

603
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,100
Mom's the word.

604
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,000
Ten dimensions.

605
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,460
The tape was running.

606
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,480
Ten dimensions.

607
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,580
Oh, my tape.

608
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,880
I have to check my tape.

609
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,800
How pathetic that you could only come up with ten.

610
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,720
Now, don't say...

611
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,320
If not ten, why not twenty?

612
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,980
I'm going to be listening as I go.

613
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,360
If not twenty, why not thirty?

614
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,440
There he goes out the door.

615
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,140
There.

616
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,700
We don't have to worry about him anymore.

617
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,280
Yeah, he's so close-minded.

618
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:54,200
He-he-he's over there, you know, just still thinking Bob's going to come back and all

619
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,720
that crap.

620
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,720
Man, geez.

621
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,180
I mean, all I care about is launching the goddamn rocket.

622
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,220
Let's get out of here.

623
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,000
Come on.

624
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:02,720
Let's go.

625
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,840
Oh, I think he's coming back.

626
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:06,840
Hold on.

627
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,520
Never mind.

628
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:09,960
He's dead.

629
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:09,960


630
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:09,960


631
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:09,960


632
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:09,960


633
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:09,960


634
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:09,960


635
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:09,960


636
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:09,960


637
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:09,960


638
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:09,960


639
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:09,960


640
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:09,960


641
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:09,960


642
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,660
Yeah, Bob's cool.

643
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,120
All that.

644
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:11,320
Yeah.

645
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:11,980
Bob.

646
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,600
Praise Bob.

647
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,720
No, no, not here.

648
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,280
Right on.

649
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,220
So, um, it's so touching and lovely and beautiful and, um...

650
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,380
Special.

651
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:24,680
Special.

652
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,000
Wow.

653
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,520
This is...

654
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,160
Oh!

655
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,780
Oh, what a sick production.

656
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,000
But is...

657
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,860
Are these silly two-dimensional and even three-dimensional pictures of Bob?

658
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,400
Are these...

659
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,160
Bob?

660
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,420
Yeah.

661
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:39,860
Yeah.

662
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:39,960
Yeah.

663
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:39,960


664
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:39,960


665
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:39,960


666
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:39,960


667
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,500
No.

668
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,040
And we beat the shit out of him.

669
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,160
No.

670
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,240
They are merely graven images of Bob.

671
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:51,800
Is this time control or is time control when we forget our... that... that horrible leash

672
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,900
attached to us?

673
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,300
The invisible fence around our necks?

674
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:02,740
Is it time control and escape, perhaps, truly when we just fought the conspiracy for a second

675
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:08,920
on... just for a few minutes while we're still clocked in, making that extra phone

676
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
call to the buddy?

677
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,420
When the boss isn't looking?

678
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,460
You know, maybe you get on your escape vessel every time you...

679
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,580
Cheat just a little.

680
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:25,920
Or, you know, or every time you do a senseless good deed and feel all...

681
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:33,260
Because every time you wipe out your bifold drug dealer down the block, you know, maybe

682
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,040
you're doing...

683
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,240
Maybe that's when you're upon your escape vessels.

684
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,480
Oh, doesn't that all sound...

685
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:39,880
It all sounds...

686
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,180
I mean, it's a different kind of thing.

687
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:41,320
It's a different kind of thing.

688
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:41,320


689
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:41,340
It's a different kind of thing.

690
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:41,340


691
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:41,340


692
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:41,340


693
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:41,340


694
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:41,620


695
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,000
Sort of.

696
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,700
Yeah.

697
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,760
It was worth the 30 bucks.

698
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,380
Nobody needs to ask for their money back.

699
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:45,680
Yeah.

700
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:45,980
It's...

701
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,640
Yeah.

702
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,420
First Frank Capra when we need it.

703
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,460
God bless America.

704
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,820
Praise Bob.

705
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,020
Praise Bob.

706
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:53,020


707
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:59,500
The blue bus is calling us.

708
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,900
It's okay, kids.

709
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,820
Come on, join us.

710
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,020
When...

711
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,780
And meet me at the back of the blue bus.

712
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,520
What's the matter, kid?

713
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,040
You afraid?

714
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Afraid your mom's gonna find out?

715
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,140
Don't you want to be cool?

716
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,820
Everybody's doing it.

717
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,940
Get on the bus.

718
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,900
I miss the Bob.

719
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:31,180
Hey, let's go join one of them UFO saucer cults and drink the Kool-Aid of Bob.

720
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,280
I heard that would take you to the other side.

721
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,600
Break on through, dude.

722
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,680
I want to get on the bus.

723
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,320
I want to get on the psychedelic bus.

724
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:39,500
I want to get on the bus.

725
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,000
I don't like steroids.

726
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,980
Now you got Aug Video, to now get a becoming evidence for alcohol.

00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,280


729
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,280


730
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,040
What else could explode if Bob and I paid our parents?

731
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,960
What the?

732
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,320
Obviously, in anotherÐ»Ñ We'd be involved in some thing.

733
00:29:53,720 --> 00:30:09,480

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,700
You pretend you don't like it.

736
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,860
Oh, in polite society, they act like it's not done.

737
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,360
And the little mudsuckers find their way.

738
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Oh, even the mayor, you know.

739
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,460
Even the burgarmeister does it.

740
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,060
Yeah.

741
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,980
They mud out.

742
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,540
Get them mudsuckers in the right place.

743
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,020
Even if they don't do it well,

744
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,460
they may have their own special way of doing it,

745
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,460
but they do it.

746
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,060
And they wallow.

747
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,460
They all...

748
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,560
Is it too late to suck up?

749
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,460
I want to be Bob.

750
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,540
He sits far all the time.

751
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,400
I want to be Bob.

752
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,780
He gave me things that's fine.

753
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,000
Don't want to be Jesus.

754
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,080
He always looks so sad.

755
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,460
Don't want to be Jesus.

756
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,700
He must have had an awful dad.

757
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,360
Never.

758
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,440
I want to be Bob.

759
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,620
Tell everyone about Slack.

760
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,960
I want to be Bob.

761
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,060
Let the pigs kiss my crack.

762
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,400
Don't want to be Jesus.

763
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,540
I want to be no slave.

764
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,880
Don't want to be Jesus.

765
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,320
He should have stayed in his grave.

766
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,920
I want to be Bob.

767
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,260
Never have to work a day.

768
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,280
I want to be Bob.

769
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,640
All eternity for play.

770
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,920
Don't want to be Jesus.

771
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,040
I want to carry no cross.

772
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,380
Don't want to be Jesus.

773
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,980
Don't want to be Jesus.

774
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,560
Don't want to speak to me on the bus.

775
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,420
I want to be Bob.

776
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,620
See everything else I'm clear.

777
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,800
I want to be Bob.

778
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,860
Shit isn't good in here.

779
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,340
Don't want to be Jesus.

780
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,400
Always trying to figure things out.

781
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,780
Don't want to be Jesus.

782
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,760
Who needs all them fucking cosmic doubts.

783
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,780
I want to be Bob.

784
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,180
Yeah, I want to be Bob.

785
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,000
I want to be Bob.

786
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,380
I don't even like it in New Zealand.

787
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:08,440
I want to be Bob.

788
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,080

00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,300


793
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,440
Ooming there taught me music,

794
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,880
But who gonna play Bob?

795
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:27,880


796
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:28,900
Yes, I should be tighten.

797

00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:28,900


800
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,320
Two.

801
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:34,720
Three.

802
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,520
Three.

803
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,440
Better yet come next day.

804
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,560
Oh, dear friends, little Theodore.

805
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,940
Little Theodore at XX Day.

806
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:04,600
Amazing that we're just cracking into the first of these recordings.

807
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,700
Unlike...

808
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:07,920
Meanwhile.

809
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:08,580
What?

810
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,000
What?

811
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,180
What?

812
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,720
What?

813
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,400
What?

814
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:37,640
What?

815
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,700
Oh, dear friends.

816
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:39,700


817
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,080
Oh, dear...

818
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,080


819
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,080


820
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,960
TheUR Squid I'm a little feet tall, little Astrid.

823
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,460
What?

824
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,040
Fuck you.

825
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,820
Shut up!

826
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,180
I drive my monkey

827
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:08,580
I drive my monkey

828
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,760
I drive my monkey

829
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:20,400
I drive my monkey all the way

830
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,980
Yeah!

831
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,040
Sax!

832
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,040
You heard it!

833
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,260
More violin in the monitor!

834
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,060
Ah, sax!

835
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,340
In another dimension!

836
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,380
Sax!

837
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,920
In another world!

838
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,000
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la!

839
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:19,820
Ah!

840
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,760
I'm high on the power of Venus!

841
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,720
Lots of good, a lot of time!

842
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:51,400
Ah!

843
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,340
Sax!

844
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,840
Well, I have no intention!

845
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,880
Sax!

846
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,160
Not with no thoughty girls!

847
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,500

00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,140

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,020
I tried and I tried!

850
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,280
Ah!

851
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,440
I will!

852
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,140
I tried!

853
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,720
Sax!

854
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,160

855
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,060

Sax!

858
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:19,900
Sax!

859
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:19,940


860
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:19,940


861
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:19,940


862
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:19,940


863
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:19,940


864
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:19,940


865
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:19,940


866
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:19,940


867
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:19,940


868
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:19,940


869
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:19,940


870
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:19,940


871
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:19,940


872
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,900
Come on, come on, come on!

873
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:25,900


874
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:26,400
Ah!

875
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,520
Ah!

876
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,420
Ah!

877
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:33,440
Ah!

878
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:36,060
I've said it, it was a pity!

879
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,640
Ah!

880
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,860
Ah!

881
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,420
Ah!

882
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:40,660
Ah!

883
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:40,660


884
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,880
Sax!

885
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,140
Sax!

886
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:45,140


887
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:45,780
Ah!

888
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,420
Ah!

889
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:46,740
Oh!

890
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:46,740


891
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:47,980
Ah!

892
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,780
Ah!

893
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:48,820
Ah!

894
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,580
Ah!

895
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,380
Ah!

896
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:50,380


897
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,400
All sex, will I have no retention?

898
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,720
Sex, in another dimension.

899
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,260
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

900
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,080
So long.

901
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,920
I do.

902
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,720
Bye-bye.

903
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,940
Oh, sex!

904
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:29,700
Sex!

905
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:41,740
Stein's Secret Orchestra, dear friends, at Dos Equis, a week ago.

906
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,480
Sex, in another dimension.

907
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,620
There may be time coming soon when you will not need that dangly-dingly

908
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,360
or that dangly-dingly.

909
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:50,640
No!

910
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,720
That pristine juicer you can, you hang from yourself.

911
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,320
That slimy eye, it's not good for pie in the sky.

912
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,040
Oh, I don't know.

913
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,040
We never were of Dallas, nor of any earthly place.

914
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:15,080
We are of our father's house on the escape vessels with Bob.

915
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:20,120
And though our father has left us locked in the bedroom,

916
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:24,340
yet one more year or century, as the case may be,

917
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,340
why, we still love our father, for we have no choice.

918
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,840
And because he locked us in the bedroom where there's that dresser

919
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,420
with the top drawer and those pictures in it.

920
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:40,780
Well, and that smelly stuff that he puts in his pipe.

921
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,500
Well.

922
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,900
That foul, that crap that has its own beard on it, almost.

923
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,180
Borkham Riff, I believe.

924
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,980
Borkham Riff?

925
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,760
That's what Bob smokes.

926
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,340
That's what assimilates Bob?

927
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:01,780
So what happened on your, how did you spend your subgenius holiday, July 5th?

928
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:02,660
Uh.

929
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,160
You weren't even awake at 7 a.m., were you?

930
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,020
None of them are?

931
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:07,880
No.

932
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,160
They were out there at Brushwood, the most holy of the holies.

933
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,220
Why, do you know how many, but Chaz here?

934
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,800
What were you doing at 7 a.m. when the aliens would have been rupturing?

935
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,160
How did you know?

936
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,160


937
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,160


938
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,340
There have been enough believers.

939
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:20,880
Hmm, Chaz?

940
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:21,520
Uh.

941
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,140
Had there been a quorum?

942
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,240
And, uh, what were you up to?

943
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,640
I don't even want to think about that.

944
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,820
What about Slack?

945
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,220
Let's not, let's not embarrass, uh, uh, Eagle Rocket Hunter.

946
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,480
Well, that's Michelle.

947
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,620
No, no, no.

948
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,760
What, what about Slack?

949
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,520
I mean, I figure that if the end of the world happens and I end up in a, in a realm of transcendent

950
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:48,060
bliss, you know, except when the loudspeaker speaks up and says, reality has ten dimensions,

951
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,140
uh, that's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

952
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:49,140


953
00:39:49,140 --> 00:40:19,100
But HQ or, uh, declining our archeology, juegos and all, can certainly wondrously help

954
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:19,100


955
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,820
probably hoping to see me get thrown naked into the pond again.

956
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,560
That wasn't about to happen.

957
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,200
Been there, done that.

958
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,340
We burned a few people that had sinned against Bob.

959
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,020
Nobody got crucified? Nobody got tarred and feathered?

960
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:37,360
Lookie here. Look who came flying in through the window.

961
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:43,280
If it ain't that no longer lonesome pimp cow man, Damus.

962
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:48,360
Well, it sounds like Santa Claus has come to town, I mean.

963
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,220
That's the guy.

964
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,520
You guys, you don't know what's going on.

965
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,220
You should be glad.

966
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,460
You should be glad, man.

967
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,500
Are you all right?

968
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,280
What is that all over you?

969
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,320
That stuff.

970
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,060
You're gross. It smells horrible.

971
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,460
Get out of here.

972
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,660
That stuff is the stuff that you would have been in if you would have gotten ruptured up, man.

973
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,040
Is that Bob's doddle?

974
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,440
No, that's not Bob's doddle.

975
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,980
That's his sputum. That's his jolly.

976
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,200
I can never tell the difference.

977
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,340
What are you saying?

978
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:18,900
What are you saying, Dave?

979
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,960
You ruptured?

980
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,740
Why do you think I'm so late, man?

981
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,780
Is that what that stain in your pants?

982
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,600
Why do you think he's walking that much?

983
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,440
Wait, Dave. Wait. I think I figured it out.

984
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,960
There's a big...

985
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,840
Oh, man. The solar wind is kicking up like crazy today.

986
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,760
Yeah, he did.

987
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,600
No, I'm not kidding. This is a real story on NASA.gov.

988
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,800
Them eyeballs are popping out.

989
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,920
The top story. Watch, watch.

990
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,020
It's true. Chaz has tuned in on stream seven.

991
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,280
I was out in the middle of the night.

992
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,060
Surf's up for the solar wind. Right there.

993
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,460
Right. Where? A dog.

994
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,080
I saw it on the website.

995
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,360
Even as we taught friends the miracle of Internet and television.

996
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,220
It looked like a little pink wave.

997
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,160
There it is.

998
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,860
That was the first thing I saw.

999
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:01,120
And I thought, man, that's awfully weird for the dark of night to see like this little pink, little tinkly wave.

1000
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,420
You know, those little sparkly things.

1001
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,640
So can people out in the cars now see it?

1002
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,160
No, the people in the cars, all of a sudden they disappeared.

1003
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,980
And this thing, it took me right up.

1004
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:09,600
Unmanned?

1005
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,420
No, it was not unmanned.

1006
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,280
It was filled with these most...

1007
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,260
You ever see them like minotaurs and stuff like that?

1008
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,020
Or they had these real dangly like nostrils and so forth?

1009
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,420
Oh, yeah.

1010
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:23,100
And some of them had big one eyes and some of them had...

1011
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:23,420
Yeah.

1012
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,080
And like...

1013
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,480
Sure.

1014
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,700
Didn't they look like Ray Harryhausen animation?

1015
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,760
There was actually a guy dressed up...

1016
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,400
Speaking of what you were saying, because I got off of this thing just very shortly afterwards.

1017
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,380
There was a guy who looked like an evil Santa Claus there.

1018
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,980
He had a Fu Manchu mustache and he had like his eyes pulled back.

1019
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,200
And these little kids would come and sit on his lap.

1020
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,620
And the minute they'd sit on his lap...

1021
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,540
Man, calm down, Dave.

1022
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,720
It was horrible.

1023
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,940
It was horrible what they'd done to him.

1024
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,960
And those little children have no rectal cavities, we can call them.

1025
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,360
They're all behind you all.

1026
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,840
But they were still alive and they're in these little cages now.

1027
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,860
That is crazy.

1028
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,900
And they didn't want to be ruptured.

1029
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,980
And they got Bob.

1030
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,180
They got Bob.

1031
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,260
People, people, I'm not kidding about this.

1032
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:04,700
They got him, man.

1033
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,760
I want you to...

1034
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,420
If you have a computer, I want you to log on to that.

1035
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,060
NASA.gov.

1036
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,920
It's all about doing this readout of this thing.

1037
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:11,380
Hold on.

1038
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,880
The son's about to...

1039
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,680
Look at this.

1040
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:14,540
He has been implanted.

1041
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:15,520
He has been implanted.

1042
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,420
No, no, it's not...

1043
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:19,420
Go to NASA.gov and go to the NASA search...

1044
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:19,760
And obey.

1045
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,720
And go to NASA search and put in solar comma images.

1046
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,680
And then click on the first one.

1047
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,560
And it'll take you to a bunch of images.

1048
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,060
And look at what's happening on the sun today.

1049
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,500
Yes, that's what's happening.

1050
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,940
It has to do with solar winds.

1051
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,760
And that's why it has to do with X-Day.

1052
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,620
And they got Bob, man.

1053
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:40,980
They got Bob.

1054
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,680
They got him in one of those little jars like what's his name?

1055
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,400
Like Donovan's brain, you know?

1056
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:46,560
Wait a minute.

1057
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:46,960
Hold on.

1058
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,820
You know, I always thought those solar winds were one of Bob's excuses.

1059
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,860
Whenever the computers were screwing up, he'd go, oh, it's just solar flares.

1060
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,580
No, I thought that was whenever there was a terrible smell all over the Earth that Bob

1061
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:59,420
was responsible for.

1062
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,640
He'd say it was just a solar wind.

1063
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:00,920
Yeah.

1064
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:01,460
Look.

1065
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,120
Look.

1066
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,380
It looks just like that.

1067
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:03,920
What?

1068
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,380
Good Lord, man.

1069
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:10,040
They've just brought into this radio studio a thing in a jar.

1070
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,520
It's actually a pig fetus, which we carefully concealed as a hairy head.

1071
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:13,660
No, it's not a pig.

1072
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,660
It's a human or a little.

1073
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,400
Oh.

1074
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,540
It's like one of those killing faces.

1075
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:20,640
Yeah.

1076
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,020
What the hell is this?

1077
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:22,300
It's a pet's patch.

1078
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:22,920
One of those dolls.

1079
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:23,920
Disgusting.

1080
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,280
Baby sage cabbage patch.

1081
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,200
It's an embalmed cabbage patch, Benzie.

1082
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:33,020
It's like the monkey's paw inside a jar of water.

1083
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:37,260
It's like a hideous LSD fetus, Benzie.

1084
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,240
That's not really one of those.

1085
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,560
You know, that's what we ought to do with that thing.

1086
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:43,580
Put up a big sign, charge 50 cents, see the hideous crack baby.

1087
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:43,640


1088
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:43,640


1089
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:43,640


1090
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:43,640


1091
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:43,640


1092
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:43,640


1093
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:43,640


1094
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:43,640


1095
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:43,640


1096
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:43,640


1097
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:43,640


1098
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:43,640


1099
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:43,640


1100
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,640
Yeah, well, we used to pay for the carnivores.

1101
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,660
When I was a kid, we had carnivores.

1102
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,040
You did do that.

1103
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,940
Did you see that Corman movie, the hideous crack baby?

1104
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,120
No, I...

1105
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:51,740
It was about three...

1106
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,800
Was that the one with the guy...

1107
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,040
Look at what's going on here.

1108
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,400
... bringing the head of two sluts?

1109
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,240
No, of hearts and livers.

1110
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,380
That is our son today.

1111
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,380
That is the star around which our...

1112
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,820
That image was taken in the last hour.

1113
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:03,900
Wait.

1114
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,000
I'm not kidding you.

1115
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,680
It is getting weird, man.

1116
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,880
It's an image of...

1117
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,300
It looks as if...

1118
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,220
Like a robot man.

1119
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,000
... the sun is in the process of rupturing or exploding.

1120
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:13,640
I'm not kidding you.

1121
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:13,640


1122
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:13,640


1123
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,540
So if you can't hear us anymore, if all of a sudden you hear a bunch of static in your

1124
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,340
speakers, we're going nova, baby.

1125
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:23,240
These eruptions on the sun must be the size of several earths.

1126
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:23,820
Look at this jet right there.

1127
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,400
... will be the city of Cleveland destroyed.

1128
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,160
Look at that.

1129
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,280
This is part of a 12-year cycle.

1130
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,540
I'm trying to tell you what they're trying to tell me.

1131
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,840
What is that black spike in the lower left-hand corner emerging from the sun?

1132
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:34,820
That is the...

1133
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,120
The black spike down.

1134
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:35,820
... that is the sun.

1135
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,080
That is the solar succubus.

1136
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:42,500
I've been trying to tell you guys, that thing is the ejaculi or the jolly of the sun.

1137
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,620
It is coming out of the sun.

1138
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:43,620


1139
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:43,620


1140
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:43,620


1141
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:48,040
It is coming out and it is creating, it is trying to create its own new life form on

1142
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,500
this planet, but we gotta go.

1143
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,540
These rocks have arrived...

1144
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,600
We gotta go.

1145
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:54,060
... instead of the exes, and they're even now...

1146
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:54,800
They are...

1147
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,760
And look at the shock waves coming off of that one right there.

1148
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,960
You got one wave, two wave, three shock waves.

1149
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,600
It literally looks as if tiny black holes have been shot into the solar surface with

1150
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:04,600


1151
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:09,860
You know, it is theoretically possible, it's theoretically possible to create tiny black

1152
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:10,900
holes, theoretically.

1153
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,460
That's right.

1154
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,860
In theory, you could do it.

1155
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,200
Right.

1156
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,560
I can't believe you guys.

1157
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,260
If they got a little too big...

1158
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:18,040
Let's go to another one.

1159
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,580
... they would become ever growing.

1160
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,740
Listen folks, these guys are looking at this on the internet and they're babbling away

1161
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:27,860
in awe of the science of their own church, which they have babbled so long.

1162
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,080
This is really going on, Stan.

1163
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,700
... are the main...

1164
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,080
This is, I mean, talk about...

1165
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:41,700
People worry about the power company getting shut off during the Y2K bug extermination.

1166
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,620
Man, the life is...

1167
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,140
Look at that.

1168
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,260
... the Lord God Almighty could turn off your power supply with a flick of his mighty

1169
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:49,300
...

1170
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,840
That's what he's going on.

1171
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,980
... that's 10 billion light years long.

1172
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:53,760
Yes, he is.

1173
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:57,600
He could shoot a black hole into the center of our sun with his cosmic t-shirt.

1174
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,580
Oh man, I don't know if they're going to get it.

1175
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:01,400
And you would never know what had happened.

1176
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,220
And it would be your iniquity.

1177
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,300
I should have doubted about it.

1178
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:04,320
And you're sick.

1179
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,000
I don't know, I guess it's 20 minutes ago because I lost 20 minutes.

1180
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,680
And your unwillingness.

1181
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,380
That's why the aliens didn't come.

1182
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:09,540
I was supposed to be here at midnight.

1183
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,620
It's because you didn't believe enough.

1184
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,600
You've got to clap your hands and say, I'm going to kill you.

1185
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:13,600


1186
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,640
I believe in them.

1187
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,920
I believe in them.

1188
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:15,960
I believe in them.

1189
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,080
I believe in them.

1190
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,340
Don't let the sun burn out.

1191
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,640
Look at that giant shadow coming across the sun.

1192
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,620
My God, it's a giant dragon.

1193
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,300
It's biting the chunk out of the sun.

1194
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,000
I don't understand that it's really happening.

1195
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,660
Think this has anything to do with the rockets we launched?

1196
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:32,480
If you just amnestize us just a couple days or weeks off, man, it's X-Day is really coming.

1197
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,740
And you don't want to be in them pleasure vehicles.

1198
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,760
Dave, that's a frightening thought.

1199
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,480
Dave, do you think this might have something to do with the rockets we launched?

1200
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,400
That's what I've been trying to tell you guys.

1201
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,640
We're in a whole mess.

1202
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,060
We're in a whole mess.

1203
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,440
We're in a whole mess.

1204
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:43,580
We're in a whole mess.

1205
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,000
We're in a whole mess of duty, Juan.

1206
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,020
That wasn't what he was trying to do.

1207
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,340
That is part of it, man.

1208
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,720
Everything's coming down in one big crunch.

1209
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:55,140
Well, I don't know if any of them actually reached the sun, if that's what you guys are

1210
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,520
inferring, but they claim they're getting too much metal, assuming something they were

1211
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,240
actually doing.

1212
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,360
And you was involved.

1213
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,620
No, Dave, you don't understand.

1214
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,940
It wasn't the rockets that we launched.

1215
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:04,940
It was the motors.

1216
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:09,100
We put a couple of big motors into the earth itself.

1217
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,020
They used some of that dark matter.

1218
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,540
You mean to tell me that's...

1219
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,320
Yeah, in the motors.

1220
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,340
You guys have a plan?

1221
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,760
I saw that on that cartoon show.

1222
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,360
I think the earth is moving closer to the sun.

1223
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:25,240
One pound of it weighs 10,000 pounds, and they used that in one of those rocket motors.

1224
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:29,120
And one of them misfired, the one that went towards that pagan's tent.

1225
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,660
I think the motor just kept burning its way down into the ground.

1226
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,360
It went to the center of the earth and it was shayed out into the sun.

1227
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,140
I'm getting depressed now.

1228
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,660
Those things are like slingshots, man.

1229
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,400
Orbit trajectories of black holes.

1230
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,820
And singularities.

1231
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,040
Things could only be XXX day now.

1232
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,680
We could be talking about something the size of a point.

1233
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:54,020
All I know is I just got abducted and I was trying to tell them what happened with X-Day

1234
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:54,460
and everything.

1235
00:48:54,980 --> 00:49:01,280
If this thing has landed in our sun, then not even Bob can save us now.

1236
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:01,360
I've got to suck oozing out of my pores now.

1237
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,800
I was thinking he'd accept him in one of those Curly Q things.

1238
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,380
What the hell are you mumbling about, Dave?

1239
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,660
Well, it's one of...

1240
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,180
I'm depressed, man, because...

1241
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,260
Take your pill.

1242
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,980
It's not a question of taking a pill.

1243
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,380
I'm not taking a pill.

1244
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:13,380


1245
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:13,380


1246
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,740
You don't want to go in them pleasure vehicles, Dane.

1247
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,380
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

1248
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:21,980
It's like the Santa Claus guy was saying, kind of, only it's ten times worse.

1249
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,080
You see...

1250
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:27,900
You mean you actually did make it with that Claus woman?

1251
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:28,840
No, no, no.

1252
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,120
There's no making or nothing.

1253
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:33,000
They just took me in there and they showed me what was really going on.

1254
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,240
It's like, remember at Auschwitz and then where they thought they were taking a shower

1255
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,100
and they were going to get all rubbed up, scrubby-dubby?

1256
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,200
Well, that's what they're luring us in with, see?

1257
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,380
They think, well, you come on board there and you're going to have your hearts to the bone.

1258
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:43,600
You don't know what you're going to desire.

1259
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,140
Whatever you think of them, you want.

1260
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,660
Yeah, that's what Bob promised us.

1261
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:46,900
Yes.

1262
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:51,000
Well, they also told me that they got you bejesus and you don't know what the hell you're

1263
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,980
talking about now because they've been controlling your mind for about 17 years now.

1264
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,460
Well, there's not much I can do about that now, is there?

1265
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,620
Well, see, what happened...

1266
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,180
I should be honored to be their tool.

1267
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,600
What happened was you started off.

1268
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,760
You discovered them and you knew what was going on.

1269
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,160
I'm chosen.

1270
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,700
And then after a while, they thought they would turn it into a joke at your behest and

1271
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,360
for you and by you, but at the same time, you were always being confused.

1272
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,260
controlled, see? And while you

1273
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,020
was being controlled, you got everybody

1274
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,500
all the rest of us controlled.

1275
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:21,240
But we're not really going

1276
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,200
into pleasure vehicles. We're going into like

1277
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,160
little torture domes. It's like a

1278
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,460
little hurricane on the sun.

1279
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,120
Yeah, man, that's all. Look at these.

1280
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,320
See, they're really, they're folding up here, see?

1281
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,260
They're getting rid of everything. They're going to

1282
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,300
start it all over again. It won't even look like

1283
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,320
stars and planets. Everything must go by 99.

1284
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,380
Everything is going to cut in.

1285
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,440
Oh, that big black spike that was

1286
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,300
coming out. It doesn't even look, the sun doesn't even look

1287
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,260
round anymore. It's not, see?

1288
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,320
It looks like a big saw blade.

1289
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,260
It's like part of it's starting to cave

1290
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,260
in a little bit. Yeah, it looks like a

1291
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,300
big saw blade. Like something's just eating it up

1292
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,840
or like some reaction's gone

1293
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,380
horribly wrong. It's spinning out

1294
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,960
and the things are coming out of it.

1295
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,300
People, we're not kidding you. You've got to log on to

1296
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,440
NASA.gov and get

1297
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,540
into the solar images.

1298
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,820
This cycle started 12 years ago.

1299
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,920
Some people actually saw it on the

1300
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,000
shores of Lake Erie. They said it looked

1301
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:11,320
like...

1302
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,900
The sun was spewing out a little

1303
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,440
thingy. And then the

1304
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,020
NASA and some other people at the weather control

1305
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:19,060
whatever they call it, meteorological services

1306
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,540
said there was a severe

1307
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,060
eruption on the sun. And they said

1308
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,680
well, we're going into a 12 year cycle

1309
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,820
and nobody knows how. It's 11 years, isn't it?

1310
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,720
Well, it must have been 11 years ago.

1311
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,020
The sun has an 11 year cycle. That makes a lot more

1312
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,900
sense, too. An 11 year cycle

1313
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,780
of destroying all life on Earth

1314
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,120
every 1 million years.

1315
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,540
Thanks, God.

1316
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,100
Thanks, God. Great. We just happened

1317
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,600
to come along. Finally, we invent

1318
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,000
the internet, writing and movies

1319
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,740
and MTV and all this cool

1320
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,860
stuff and, you know,

1321
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,300
aspirin. And then

1322
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,740
it's time for the 11 year

1323
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,720
cycle where the sun flares up

1324
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,760
and changes all life on Earth.

1325
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,720
Inflates just a little bit and

1326
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,760
belches out a little flame. Let's a

1327
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,680
new phylum take over and

1328
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,840
begin its long climb out of

1329
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,740
the muck. It's degraded to new shoes

1330
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,220
anyway. The prairie squid

1331
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,700
people of a million years from now

1332
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,280
will find the fossils of our skyscrapers

1333
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,680
and go, look, the bugs

1334
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,180
used to build hives.

1335
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,200
Well, they'll be just like when

1336
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,420
Charlton Heston was screaming about guns

1337
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,460
in the bathroom the other day going, look at

1338
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,440
what you did. No, what was that line?

1339
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,500
God damn you all

1340
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,120
the hell you blew it up.

1341
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,420
No, no, no. The planet of the apes.

1342
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,500
Yeah, that's what that's

1343
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,340
damn you. Damn you.

1344
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,600
That wasn't it.

1345
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,580
Damn you all

1346
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,360
the hell you did it. You

1347
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,160
finally went and did it. You blew

1348
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,420
it up. Okay, that was it.

1349
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,400
That was it.

1350
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,220
Blow it off or blow

1351
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:49,840
it up. Just don't blow it.

1352
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,420
Join the church of subgenius

1353
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,000
and don't let this happen again.

1354
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,180
When was the last time you

1355
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:58,360
sent that $30 to Bob?

1356
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,260
When was the last time?

1357
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,200
It's the end. You tied your

1358
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,380
shoes this morning, but the undertaker

1359
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,260
in hell is going to untie them

1360
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,260
tonight. You're in your shoes in a

1361
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,020
trash can. 90 zillion degree

1362
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,180
blue winds sweeping across

1363
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,160
the continent.

1364
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,980
The Aurora Borealis

1365
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,400
just kicking backwards.

1366
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:20,100
Fire is going out in space and it's going to

1367
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,480
lick across this planet.

1368
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,780
It's going to scour the planet.

1369
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,280
It's going to cleanse this planet.

1370
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,540
Weird little scooters like they have in Latin America.

1371
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:30,320
It's going to find the center

1372
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,620
and the saint of life.

1373
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:34,360
The virtuous and the filthful

1374
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,220
will all together be

1375
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,420
mixed in that one great...

1376
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,840
Great. Imagine if you was living

1377
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:40,740
in Panama or something.

1378
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,940
Mixing pot of souls.

1379
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,920
The slurry of the slugs of your souls.

1380
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,820
Just because of the weight of the solar magic.

1381
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:48,520
It's too late now.

1382
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,080
Here goes our atmosphere.

1383
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,280
Atmosphere's going there.

1384
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,040
It's breathing going on.

1385
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,420
How many days is it?

1386
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,380
Have a drink of water.

1387
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,480
Four days.

1388
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,820
Nostradamus predicted

1389
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,640
that the sun would go out

1390
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,080
in July of 1999.

1391
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,200
Did you know that?

1392
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:10,980
Well, oh, jeez.

1393
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,560
Here we are at the...

1394
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,680
We've come full circle.

1395
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,580
What can we actually say about the crux

1396
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,040
of the focal crux that we're in?

1397
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,700
And we're trying to make jokes about it,

1398
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,540
but it really is.

1399
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:25,300
Well, you know, when the entire solar system

1400
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,780
is obviously about to just go out,

1401
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,620
like snuff out like a candle,

1402
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,620
you might as well make jokes.

1403
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,940
What are we going to do?

1404
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,580
Put our heads between our legs

1405
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,860
and kiss our butts goodbye

1406
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,780
like that funny old nuclear war test?

1407
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:40,920
poster.

1408
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,520
I'm going to have

1409
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,500
Chorizo and eggs.

1410
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:43,620
That's what I'm going to do.

1411
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,580
This is the sound of the sun right now.

1412
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,560
You know, that sounds good.

1413
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,520
I'm going to have me

1414
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,580
some jalapenos in the egg.

1415
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,380
We've got about an hour left of reality.

1416
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,400
Do you think so?

1417
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,500
Ten minutes left of the show.

1418
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,640
If we finish the show

1419
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,360
in about ten minutes,

1420
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,940
I'll be up for some Chorizo and eggs.

1421
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,540
People, there's a tendril of sun gas

1422
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:58,800
heading our way.

1423
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,080
Is that still downloading?

1424
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:00,560
And you can...

1425
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,860
Yeah, it's still downloading.

1426
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:02,780
I think that's going to be

1427
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:03,400
the latest image.

1428
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,220
I'm amazed with this kind of solar activity

1429
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,360
that any of this Internet stuff works.

1430
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:09,300
Well, it's...

1431
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:09,760
It's...

1432
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,860
Because it's hardwired.

1433
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,400
And the Internet is hardwired.

1434
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:13,720
I'm sure the radio signals

1435
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,460
are getting interference by now.

1436
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:15,840
Yeah, right.

1437
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,020
They also said that they had

1438
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,900
a part of Steve Winstead's brain

1439
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:20,480
in the NASA studio itself.

1440
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:20,840
Well, that's why

1441
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,560
they're taking so long to load now.

1442
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:23,900
It's like the giant...

1443
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:24,720
It's like a bionic implant

1444
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,300
or something.

1445
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,900
It's like the giant pool cue

1446
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:27,760
of the Lord

1447
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,040
poking about to slam

1448
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,320
that big ball right into the Earth

1449
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,180
and knock us into the side pocket.

1450
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:33,820
No kidding.

1451
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:34,820
That's what it looks like to me.

1452
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:36,440
We'll go scattering those asteroids

1453
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,140
around in the Mars orbit.

1454
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,400
Whoa.

1455
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:40,580
That's what it looks like.

1456
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,060
Have a...

1457
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,100
Why not?

1458
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,040
Guess we're gonna be

1459
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,340
on this rocket ship,

1460
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,320
Spaceship Earth,

1461
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,960
only it's going somewhere else.

1462
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:48,480
Wow.

1463
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,300
That's what I...

1464
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,080
Looks like we're gonna be

1465
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,620
spun right out into space.

1466
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,580
We'll hope the sunlight's

1467
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:54,440
gonna reach us.

1468
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,040
What the hell are we gonna do, man?

1469
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,080
What the hell are you talking about?

1470
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,380
There ain't gonna be no more sun.

1471
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,460
And them pleasure vessels

1472
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,900
are full of torturistic,

1473
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:03,520
sadistic, demon-type guys.

1474
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,240
God, man, maybe...

1475
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,220
And you have been selling us all

1476
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,620
and yourself down the river

1477
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:09,420
for all these years,

1478
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:09,740
for a long time.

1479
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,880
For a lousy 30-buck tent.

1480
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,280
Do you think...

1481
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,320
Wait a minute.

1482
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,040
Maybe...

1483
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,360
Maybe...

1484
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,240
Do you think maybe

1485
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:15,980
I made a mistake?

1486
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,440
You were just gonna get

1487
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,700
burned out by the sun.

1488
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,080
Could Bob just be

1489
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,420
some charlatan and...

1490
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:22,700
No.

1491
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:23,180
They are taking

1492
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:24,000
some of us with them.

1493
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,500
...sold us out for...

1494
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,820
And it won't be fun.

1495
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,700
...firewood, so to speak?

1496
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,880
We're just a firework.

1497
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:30,920
Wait a minute.

1498
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,140
It's like we were...

1499
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,360
We're a sadistic thing, Stan.

1500
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:34,360
They torture...

1501
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,740
Like you said so many times,

1502
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,000
they eat our pain

1503
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,020
for pleasureisms.

1504
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:38,960
So we're the...

1505
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:39,420
No, it's like we...

1506
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:40,420
We're the pig fat

1507
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:41,200
and the griddle.

1508
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:41,620
That's it.

1509
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:42,120
Yeah.

1510
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:42,840
And this is their

1511
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,920
firework show.

1512
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,380
We're just the pig fat

1513
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,140
and the griddle.

1514
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:46,980
It's more like you guys

1515
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:47,760
were describing before,

1516
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,720
like a banquet is what

1517
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,560
they're gonna do to us,

1518
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,140
but it's a pain banquet,

1519
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,360
like they subject us

1520
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,660
to all kinds of humiliation

1521
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,220
and we're just the fat.

1522
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,180
I knew I never should've

1523
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,520
tortured those animals

1524
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,580
when I was a child.

1525
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,480
We're just the fat

1526
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,600
to cook something in.

1527
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,480
What's the...

1528
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,300
What's the real entree?

1529
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,080
Well, perhaps there's

1530
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,060
bigger fish to fry.

1531
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,740
Perhaps there is a God

1532
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:08,120
on this planet.

1533
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,300
War in heaven, friend.

1534
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,540
It's a war in heaven

1535
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,100
between the hires

1536
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,120
and the even hires than that.

1537
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,840
The archons are duking it out

1538
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,380
and we're getting

1539
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,160
into the shtick again.

1540
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:18,920
And we get these

1541
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,000
mysterious pictures

1542
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,400
of the sun on the internet

1543
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,140
that represent

1544
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,040
the battleground of the gods.

1545
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,580
Well, what can we as like

1546
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:26,920
flatulent Doris Drake

1547
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,200
crossdressers and people

1548
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:28,640
that just...

1549
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,840
Just pray?

1550
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:30,480
Pray.

1551
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,400
Oh, I don't know.

1552
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,040
Pray your little

1553
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,440
pathetic heart out.

1554
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:35,640
Ain't gonna do you any good,

1555
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,300
but it might make you

1556
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,220
feel a little better,

1557
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,160
so that's why

1558
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,920
we say all you can do now

1559
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,300
is pray.

1560
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:43,900
Do you remember

1561
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,040
the Neolish

1562
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,040
and the Big Lebowski

1563
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,900
and how, like, kind of,

1564
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:49,120
I don't know,

1565
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,140
silly they seemed?

1566
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,080
I was told

1567
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,560
to check it out.

1568
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,140
Well, they were

1569
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:54,920
just like stupid,

1570
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:55,840
you know, the Neolish

1571
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,260
and stuff,

1572
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,120
and I kind of maybe

1573
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,100
feel like maybe

1574
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:58,920
we're just stupid.

1575
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,000
You know what I mean?

1576
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:01,640
There's nothing...

1577
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,560
It's so Neal

1578
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,220
that we ain't got

1579
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,000
no Neolism

1580
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:04,820
for it to be about.

1581
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:05,440
I mean,

1582
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:06,680
it would be redundant.

1583
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,680
Nada, inada, inada.

1584
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,040
It creeps in this

1585
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:10,820
petty pace

1586
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,400
from day to day

1587
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,380
to the last...

1588
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,140
Oh, my.

1589
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:14,960
Now, that one looks

1590
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,920
like a nipple, doesn't it?

1591
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,580
That one looks

1592
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:18,960
like an avioli or something.

1593
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:20,320
All our CDs...

1594
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,580
Some womb-like things.

1595
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,000
...burned fools away

1596
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,140
to dusty erasure.

1597
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:26,780
Well, the thing

1598
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:27,940
is downloaded up now,

1599
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,540
and it looks like

1600
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,300
a human womb

1601
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,400
or maybe a hot nipple

1602
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:30,880
or something.

1603
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,360
Outbrief zipper.

1604
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:34,480
Unzip, zip, zip

1605
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,260
thine solar flares

1606
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,760
and flop out

1607
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,140
thine solar flares.

1608
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,340
Thine hydrogen

1609
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,440
peckers of doom.

1610
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,260
Hydrogen peckers

1611
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:44,820
of doom.

1612
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,540
That's what the band

1613
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:47,400
should have been named

1614
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,080
long ago,

1615
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,600
the hydrogen peckers

1616
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,200
of doom.

1617
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:51,160
A poor Trojan

1618
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:52,640
or player

1619
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,060
struts and frets

1620
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,220
and picks his nose

1621
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,820
upon the stage,

1622
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:00,800
exposes himself,

1623
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,660
and then is heard

1624
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:03,420
no more.

1625
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:04,320
Does a tale

1626
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,440
told by an idiot

1627
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,100
thrice told...

1628
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:07,500
You can't speak

1629
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:07,960
for yourself.

1630
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:08,700
Well, that's what

1631
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,840
I thought the soliloquy

1632
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,320
ended with.

1633
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,480
It was a tale

1634
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,460
told by an idiot

1635
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,840
full of sound and fury.

1636
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,120
Signifying...

1637
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,380
A signifying monkey.

1638
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,980
A signifying monkey

1639
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:18,600
is what we'd like

1640
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,420
to see right now.

1641
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:20,760
A signifying monkey.

1642
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,320
That's all

1643
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,120
this old show has been.

1644
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,060
It's not a cage

1645
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,040
full of signifying monkeys.

1646
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,420
This whole planet,

1647
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,480
this whole solar system,

1648
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,460
this whole history...

1649
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:32,980
I know that old

1650
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:33,700
rock and roll song.

1651
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:34,760
This whole evolution,

1652
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,500
the creation itself,

1653
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:37,680
a zoophilus.

1654
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:38,680
A zoophilus.

1655
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,020
A signifying monkey.

1656
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:41,200
Man, that guy was

1657
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,380
ahead of his time again.

1658
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,440
Pathetic little noise

1659
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,420
in their brief space

1660
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:46,560
upon the earth

1661
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,580
before the big light

1662
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:49,520
winked out.

1663
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,280
Night, night,

1664
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:51,760
little monkeys

1665
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,840
in your cage.

1666
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:53,680
Night, night,

1667
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:55,700
all your great skyscrapers,

1668
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:56,980
your achievements,

1669
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,140
your mighty books

1670
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:58,940
and discoveries,

1671
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,200
your symphonies,

1672
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:01,380
your armies,

1673
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,100
your concentration camps.

1674
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:04,400
All of it was...

1675
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,260
Your indoor plumbing,

1676
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,080
your toiletries,

1677
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:06,700
and your many...

1678
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:07,580
As a wink,

1679
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,420
delicacies,

1680
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,720
that no one could eat

1681
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,860
because you were starving.

1682
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,900
Dying ember

1683
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,120
in the middle

1684
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,200
of thousands

1685
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:17,380
and billions

1686
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,700
of light years

1687
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:19,740
of empty,

1688
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,020
cold space.

1689
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,960
Glowing, stinky hole

1690
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:23,900
in your third eye.

1691
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,460
You are about as important

1692
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,640
as a cork in the ocean,

1693
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,060
my friend.

1694
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,220
Think of a cockroach,

1695
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:29,720
if you would.

1696
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:30,860
I don't know if you want to

1697
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,780
think of one for too long,

1698
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:32,380
but just imagine

1699
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,620
the revulsion you feel

1700
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:34,580
when you swat one

1701
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:35,440
and brush it away

1702
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,040
from yourselves.

1703
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,360
Think of yourself

1704
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,680
as a mere cockroach

1705
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,040
compared to these weird

1706
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,100
exes, archons,

1707
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:42,300
whatever the hell they are.

1708
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,060
They don't notice you.

1709
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,940
They don't care about you.

1710
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,580
If you happen to hitch a ride

1711
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,040
and they don't swat you off,

1712
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,040
then count yourself lucky.

1713
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:53,260
But don't think

1714
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:56,100
you're some kind of a big deal

1715
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,620
just because God

1716
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,700
or some aliens

1717
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:00,300
happen to pick you up

1718
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,640
by the scruff of your neck

1719
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,420
and show you a thing or two.

1720
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:07,060
They're in there with you.

1721
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,160
They're in the room

1722
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:08,980
with you.

1723
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,780
You can't see them.

1724
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,340
You can't smell them.

1725
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,400
You can't taste them.

1726
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:15,800
But they're in the room

1727
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:16,360
with you.

1728
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,780
They blend with the walls,

1729
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:18,700
with the CDs,

1730
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,180
with the pono rack,

1731
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,080
with the...

1732
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:21,600
with the...
