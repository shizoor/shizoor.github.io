Now they're telling me I'm crazy over here because I don't sit there like a goddamn vegetable.
Don't make a bit of sense to me.
If that's what being crazy is, then I'm senseless, out of it, gone down the road, wacko.
But no more, no less. That's it.
We always have something very funny happens when we start.

From a badge or a gun, power comes from lying.
Lying big and getting the whole damn world to play along with you.
Once you got everybody agreeing with what they know and their hearts ain't true, you got them by the balls.
There's what, maybe 500 people in this hospital.
I could pump you full of bullets right now and I wouldn't even be arrested.

Who wants to be a millionaire?
Remain standing just for a second. Remain standing just for a minute. Let me pray for you, okay?
Lord Regis Philbin, is that your final answer?
Today, I want you to, I have nothing worthwhile to say.
You're not gonna get anywhere in life.
I wanna stir up.
I have come, I have come, and oh how I wish.
Burn wood on it every morning, four hours a day, seven days a week.
You know?
You know what, I can't tell you how many times I've had a wife or a husband in my office.
There's no hope.
Would you come?
Would you make that decision today.
You come, you come, you come, you come, you come, you come, you c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-p-c-km.

I would dig to really
to be able to go back
to the things when I was
just a little kid.
It was a groove then.
And I'd like to return
to all the things like
stickball and
basketball and
playing in the streets.
Bruno!
Tony, come out and play!
Man, it was a groove in those days.
Like that was out of sight, man.
You know, and you met a little girl
and she was your love, you know.
And it was so out of sight
you kind of ran down the street together.
I mean, love was love.
It was there, man.
We're sharing popcorn
and grooving with ice cream.
Because love, love
between two people, man,
it's...
it's just out of sight.
But let me say this.
Love between five people.
Now, that's heavy.
But that could be a groove.
Especially if one of those people
is me.
Dig it?
Because you should get together.
Everybody.
Get in your bed.
You grab her tit.
And you kiss her on the back
of her fucking neck.
And you say,
suck, suck, suck.
Because the world is a mess.
The world is built on sucking.
And you take two pencils,
stick them in her ears
and pull them down to you and say,
eat me, baby.
Eat me, baby.
Because the Lord said,
let me hear from you, brother Vinny.
Good God Almighty,
let me hold you.
Let me suck your cock.
And then take the Lord and say,
good God.
For everybody knows.
Everybody knows
that all we want to do is get high.
Get high and suck and fuck one another.
Because there's a whole lot more to do in this world.
You're digging to fuck around with your tailbone.
Man, you can go out there and groove.
And you can get high.
And you can,
take that one, Vinny.
Yes.
You can stop wasting your time, good God.
You know, the Lord said,
be good, be good.
And I'll give you good.
And I wonder if he did.
So let me hear from you, good God.
Let me hear from you.
Don't you excuse yourself, you fuck.
Now, let me say this.
With your left hand,
unbuckle your pants.
Let your pants drop to the floor.
Then take your young lady by the head.
Lay her on the floor and yell,
whip some skull on me, bitch.
Because you know,
you know,
you know that I'm the Lord.
And the Lord will praise me,
good God.
I believe in God.

Jimmy Swagger got caught shaking into a motel with a prostitute.
A motel.
I said a motel.
With a...
A possible scenario for Jimmy Swagger's pornographic encounter with a New Orleans prostitute in an appropriately tasteful motel.
Although Jimmy has no intention of actually...
Violating any of Gertie's well-traveled orifices with his shriveled evangelical wee-wee,
he does hope to engage in an assortment of water sports, including a thorough bowel cleansing with a three-quart rainbow rubber enema bag
equipped with a tapered chrome nozzle while Gertie bellows out the old rugged cross.
Jimmy asks Gertie to wear the blouse and skirt of an eighth-grade Catholic schoolgirl,
suck a raspberry tootsie pop,
and beg Jimmy to fuck her in the ass.
Jimmy masturbates on Pat Robertson campaign literature
while warning Gertie not to allow a pothead manipulated by Satan
to lure her into the work of the devil.
Gertie assures Jimmy that his two-inch-full erect penis is actually way above average
and well-veined besides.
Oh, God, Jimmy, you have a big cock.
Please give it to me, Jimmy.
Give me that throbbing hunk of manhood.
I've never seen one that big.
Really?
No fooling.
Yep, that sure is a big one.
As the three quarts of steamy, soapy liquid seizes control of his lower colon,
Jimmy evacuates his purulent sphincter into the crisper drawer of a nearby refrigerator and moans,
I have sinned against my father!
I have sinned against my family and my lord,
and I ask that he cleanse my soul with his precious blood.
Well, looks like enough of them bought it for us to pay off the mortgage.
Looks like enough of them bought it for us to pay for the rest of the jet.
Born-again Christians are dense as a brick, easy to do but the package is slick.
They've let us rape their daughters as long as we sanctify all of their hate.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wake up, you assholes!
Jimmy Swagger got caught checking into a motel with a prostitute.
Uh, yes dear friends, Jimmy Swagger by the Rudy Schwartz Project,
and welcome to Hour of Slack, X-rated show number 10,
full of too many words to mess with trying to cut the fucks and shits out for the fucks and shits of normal broadcast radio.
Before Rudy Schwartz Project, which by the way you can get more of at schwarztone.com,
we heard a cut-up by Lee Murr and, uh, oh, Stickball.
Damn, you know, I don't know who did Stickball.
It was by Tony Bruno, also known as P-Vert.
And, uh, but before that, some Noral Pref cut-ups and a little movie.
Clips provided by Moola Muttata and, uh, Lee Murr.
And now...
All the pricks, they moved to California.
They oughta call it Prick-a-fornia.
I am told that I have gasp.
I am bathed in a warm gasp.
I wish I could fully describe to you how I feel.
When I was a gypsy, it was very thick and heavy black hanging prominently displayed.
My hands able to force cum.
Supreme member, I am calm yet receptive.
More than a deck experience to me.
My heart stood still.
Let me trip.
I must trip.
Things arouse me that demand phenomena.
My trip will be achieved.
What trip?
The days before that.
Everything depends upon supreme member.
Cum great.
Cum cum cum one inch.
Beyond mediocrity.
But that one last inch is so difficult and seemingly impossible.
Extra push.
Extra push.
I will make you understand.
Get up on this.
Ah.
Push it.
And someone will go on with it.
Push it.
Romantic, isn't it?
Romantic, isn't it?
Push it.
Shut up and sit down.
Baby.
Baby.
Push it.
Baby.
Push it.
Pumping hard and hard like I wish you would.
Now push it.
Pick up on this.
Push it.
Wonderful.
So shake up.
Baby.

Pick up on this.
I've been told about you.
Pick up on this.
Red hot mama.
Pick up on this.
Down your.
Push it.
Down your mist.
Ah.
See.

I'm half rocking, watching new music.
You don't feel mad with deserves.
Due to the high cost of my fingers, this is a hit and I'm poor and I suck at it.
But you're smiling Like Mitch.
Hard like I wish you would
Now push it, push it
Baby, baby
Baby, yeah
First time I saw you, darling, I knew I was in love
Tell her, daddy
The way you took your wheelchair off that handicap ramp
Mmm, it's a mind blower
But now, baby, I miss ya, I miss ya
I miss all the times we played Marco Polo in the pool
Oh, yeah
Hiding your seat beneath the sheets
Oh, yeah
And just the smell of the oil in your wheelchair
I remember the day I saw you hobbling
Or we wobbling
You had a problem
You didn't have any legs just to smile some stumps
The smell of your feet, a touch of the hump
No, baby, love you, that's what we'd be making
Lodging like a sitting spin
Till your stumps started aching
Spin you around, roll you near
Turn you upside down, they'll hold my beer
You ain't got no name
I love you
Just the same
Oh, baby
You
You
Ain't got no name
I love you
Just the same
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You say nothing beats a great pair of legs
But somehow, baby, the day you walked out on my life
There's nothing I wanted more than
Than for you to come crawling back to me
When we started going dead
The people said they could believe it
That I could be so happy with a quadriplegic
We would wake up real early
And you could make me some eggs
Girl, I didn't care if you ain't got no legs
I loved you for you
And you loved me for me
Was it really hard for those unfortunate two
That the first time we made up
It was such an unfulfilling
The wind thus essentialized
Helped you cross the sea
When you broke out of my life
My heart just broke
I can still hear the noise of the squeaks in your spokes cost
You ain't got no name
I love you
Just the same
Oh, baby
You ain't got no name
I love you











Just the same
But I love you
Oh, baby
You ain't got no name
Oh, baby

But I love you
Oh, baby


Just the same
You ain't got no name













You Ain't Got No Legs by the Bloodhound Gang.
Thanks to Philo Drummond for providing that.
Before that, we heard two Norrell Preff cut-ups, and we're about to hear another.
Um, um, welcome.
Welcome, all you netizens out there, to our very first fucking podcast.
I can't even believe it.
It's such a pleasure and an act of extreme originality to jump onto this hype object bandwagon
and actually do our first actual fucking podcast.
Oh, by the way, my name is Spoo Chunks, and to my left is my co-fucking podcaster, Lon,
who incidentally is also my fucking wife.
Hey, everyone out there.
Fucking hey.
Welcome to our first fucking podcast.
I can't believe it.
The first thing I want to say is, fuck the FCC.
Can we say that?
Folks, I might as well let you know that Lon speaks her mind and is often a rather nasty little wench.
Fuck yeah.
I just sucked Spoo's cock before we started our first fucking podcast and swallowed for the first time.
Baby, what did it taste like?
Like chicken.
Well, like every other fucking podcast out there, we've got to tell you first that this is our very first fucking podcast
and that there will be many more to come.
Oh, many more to come.
Now stop that, Lon.
We need to get on topic now.
Oh, and what is the topic?
My sweet fucking podcasting partner.
I thought that what we talk about today is fucking podcasting, man.
All right, but let me get a few things off my chest first.
Let me tell you, fellas, Lon has quite a chest.
They call me Mickey Double D's at work.
Anyway, I was like telling some people at work like, hey, Spoo and I were going to do a fucking podcast
and they were like, no fucking way.
And I was like, way.
And now here we are doing our very first fucking podcast.
That rules.
Totally.
Totally.
Like what I want to do now is talk about fucking podcasting.
And how fucking great it is to be doing our own fucking podcast.
I still can't believe it.
Wait till all our friends hear about this.
I must now pay homage, you know, suck the virtual cock of the dude that started all this revolutionary shit.
You know, like that former hack VJ on the corporate owned MTV, now internet hack par excellence.
The dude what gave us a great review before even listening to our first fucking podcast.
The one, the only, Yellow Curry.
Oh, I used to get so hot and wet watching him on Headbangers Ball.
Oh, the long hair.
The spandex.
The leather boots.
The pretentious demeanor.
Hey, calm down, sister.
It's well known that Yellow Curry has an unfortunate condition known as micropenis.
Oh, but that's so sweet.
I'll bet it's a cute little thing.
But I thought you were a size queen, baby.
Yeah, in general, I really like a nice size dong to play with.
But hey, I can, well, like, you know, care for the small creatures out there, too.
Whatever.
I just want to thank Mr. Curry for creating this wonderful hype object out of what were previously just what?
What?
Downloads of MP3 files?
Give me a break.
Really?
What the fuck was that all about?
So now, thanks to Yellow, we can all fucking receive fucking podcasts with our fucking podcast software.
And what are podcasts?
I mean, I know what we're doing one right now.
I know we're doing one right now and all, but, like, technically speaking, what is a fucking podcast like?
It's an enigma wrapped up in a riddle, seasoned with generous bits of hyperbole embedded within a...
Did I say embedded?
Yes, you did.
Embedded within a conundrum.
Isn't it like an MP3 file that you download?
Technically speaking, yeah.
But now, instead of just going to a website or FTP site and downloading files, or maybe even using something like BitTorrent,
now, man, you open up your podcast software and subscribe to these fucking podcasts and get your MP3s, like, odd magically,
using RSS and XML and other stuff I have no clue about.
So, like, it's just an MP3 that you just download?
I guess it is.
It fucking is.
Anyway, we're really getting sidetracked here.
Baby, I wanted to talk about fucking podcasts.
So let's talk about podcasts.
Let's talk about fucking podcasting, then.
You know, like...
I want to talk about how liberating this fucking podcasting thing is.
How we can skirt past the FCC and say whatever the fuck we want.
Totally.
I'm, like, so amazed that we can say the words shit, cunt, motherfucker, twat, and stuff like that without worrying about the FCC breathing down our neck or blowing smoke up our asses.
And Lon has quite an ass, if I do say so myself, guys.
Oh, Spoo.
I think it's too big and round.
More cushion for the pushing, I always say.
Oh, quit it.
But let me tell you something stupid that happened at work today that just got me so fucking pissed off.
Okay.
Let her rip.
I was, like, in the break area around lunchtime, and I was, like, waiting to put my Canadian bacon hot pocket into the microwave.
But, like, I had to, like, fucking wait for these other two dweebs, one who was making popcorn and the other heating up a bowl of black bean soup or some shit like that.
So I'm standing there with my hot pocket pack and decide to make good use of my time.
I, like, set the package down and go to the bathroom, which is around the corner, to, like, first take a piss, but what turned into a gnarly old shit fest.
I couldn't, like, believe that that came out of me.
And it, like, wreathed around the bowl.
Oh, fuck.
Anyway, I had, like, came out of the bathroom and had to go to the break area.
Dweebs are gone.
Microwaves are free.
Score, I say, and open up the first microwave.
And fuck me, the whole inside was fucking splattered with black bean juice and gross soup debris everywhere.
I was so fucking grossed out.
I, like, shut the door and went to the second microwave, only to find a fully popped bag of popcorn still in there.
Fuck.
I couldn't believe it.
The first microwave looked like somebody took a shit in it.
And the other one still had a bag of horrible Redenbacher's in it.
So what did you do, sugar cakes?
Well, Popcorn Dweeb shortly came and got his popcorn.
He said he was sorry, and I said, yeah.
Then I, like, put my hot pockets in and pressed all the right buttons and waited the usual, like, three minutes and then took the pockets to my cubicle where I then waited for them to cool and then scarfed them up.
My little piggy wiggy.
Oh.
Ow.
Woo!
I'm a bad motherfucker!
Oh, yes, I am, you mother!
Come on!
Come on!
You've gone mental and you suck, so remember, I'm okay.
You're fucked.
You're fucked.
You've gone mental and you suck, and I'm okay.
You're fucked.
You're fucked.
You're fucked.
You're fucked.
Well, sugar you.
You stink, you're cool.
And he said I'm depressed.
I'm not depressed.
I'm a bad motherfucker!
Don't worry, I got the hot tub on!
You've gone mental and you suck, so remember, I'm okay.
You're fucked.
You're fucked.
You've gone mental and you suck, and I'm okay.
You're fucked.

And now another Norell Preffian piece
I can't pretend I have a very, very hard manhood for young men
Isn't that interesting?
It's been very difficult to try to find a woman in the gate of Sodom
We had young men come from all points in North America
We used young men that I know
And I thought it would just be wonderful
And I said I want it

And let me tell you, Sodom is at the door

It isn't easy to pound a nail in straight
If you hold your hand further back

Fifi wants to be included
It's awkward
Just think
This will be our hideout
And we can come up here to get away from everyone
And tell our secrets
Fifi is running away
Jay calls on Paul for help
And Paul decides to call the police
Yes, the police happen to be in the neighborhood
And picked up Jay's friend Carl
The boys
And Jay starts to work on Fifi
They look delicious
Mark goes along
It's Jay's first visit to the police station
And he's impressed
Jay handles Mark carefully
Mark has learned to be patient
Because he knows it's best for Jay to go see him
He's a little slow
And does it right
How good it is
This is the real thing
And a lot more exciting than a television program
Secretly, Jay plans to be really interested when he grows up
A pink one
Pink, pink, pink, pink
How good it is to have faded lavender

The Bacon for Tomorrow's Breakfast by the Rudy Schwartz Project,
and that was yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,
reciting words that were taken from the Larry Buchanan film,
Down on Us, which is a bad film about the murder of Jimi Hendrix,
Janis Joplin, and almost Jim Morrison,
by the CIA.
That's what the movie's about,
and it features a fake Jim Morrison reading fake Jim Morrison poetry.
That's what that was.
It was Larry Buchanan writing as Jim Morrison
for what turned out to be a Rudy Schwartz Project song.
And we will continue with more now.
You know the problem Hollywood is?
They make shit.

Now, it's easy to pick apart bad acting, short-sighted directing,
and the purely moronic stringing together of words
that many of the studios term as prose.
No, I'm talking about the lack of realism.
Realism.
Not a pervasive element in today's modern American cinematic vision.
Really, real heavy lyrics.
I'm not a fan of the old-fashioned
The toilet's flooded
The load won't fit
The toilet's flooded
With the great big
Shit!
The toilet's flooded
The load won't fit
The toilet's flooded
With the great big
Shit!
Party with this dude
Well, then instead
He just come over to use our head
He said I go out to the street



If I had to be
But I got a big old doo-doo inside of me
So he disappeared
But he wasn't gone long
Yesterday's lunch is still in our jawn
We didn't have a clue
Cause he didn't cut a fart
What he left an art bowl
Was a work of art
I said the toilet's flooded
The load won't fit
The toilet's flooded
With the great big shit!
The toilet's flooded
The load won't fit
The toilet's flooded
With the great big
Shit!
We all went in to take a peek
What happened next?
Knocked us right off our feet
It jumped out of the jar
It jumped out of the bowl
It had no morals
It had no soul
It slammed around our carpet
Like a mud-colored slug
Left a foul-smelling trail
That soiled the rug
I went and got a baseball bat
To kill that thing
But it shot around the house
Like ground-lightning
I said the toilet's flooded
The load won't fit
The toilet's flooded
With the great big
Shit!
The toilet's flooded
The load won't fit
The toilet's flooded
With the great big
Shit!
He took a record up
Known across the nation
Now we gotta use
The service station
The toilet's flooded
The load won't fit
The toilet's flooded
With the great big
Shit!
The toilet's flooded
The load won't fit
The toilet's flooded
With the great big
Shit!
The toilet's flooded
The load won't fit
The toilet's flooded
With the great big
Shit!
The toilet's flooded
The load won't fit
The toilet's flooded
With the great big
Ooh! Where's the great big shit??
K.I.O.D.
The toilet's flooded by the Limbo Maniacs
That was another great old tune
Covered by the Swingin' Love Corpses at one time
and I don't know if this...
We now will listen to some lessons in turdish.
President Turkey asked Congress for almost 75 billion turds this morning,
most of which would pay for Nancy Turd,
Sea of California.
PRs in Turkey turds a few miles north of the Turkey.
He talked with House Minority Whip Turd Sea of California
about the turdish lands.
Well, President Turkey,
special communication ended with no turds on the table.
So again, no turd was reached today.
But it's very, very tricky because the turds sent
an AWACS anti-turd early turning system here in Germany
as they saw after the 1991 turd war.
I wake up with a handful of hay every morning.
I wake up with a handful of hay every morning.
I'm a hateful guy.
I'm serious.
I'm really serious.
I'm like a mentally ill, criminally hateful guy
when I wake up in the morning.
I eat as soon as I can,
and then two hours later I'm always fine.
Everything's all right.
I guess I have hypoglycemia or something.
But because of this,
I understand the kook mentality pretty well.
I'm a kook until 10 o'clock every morning.
That's why I usually stay in bed until 10 o'clock,
just hating and hating.
Then I get over it.
It's the weirdest thing.
I really don't have anything against anybody.
But for a while there, I'm channeling all the other...
When you were a kid, did you ever wish you were a werewolf?
Like a teenager at the prom.
Or maybe not the prom.
Some school dance.
And everybody's partying and having fun,
and they're all normal, and they're all popular.
And the band is playing some sort of cool music,
and you're kind of getting into it.
But then you see that girl or that guy
that you thought might like you,
because they were kind of geeky too,
blowing the captain of the football team!
And suddenly, hey Jude,
doesn't have the same romantic meaning for you
that it has for everybody else.
And you start feeling like Michael Landon
in that old movie, I Was a Teenage Werewolf.
And you just, you know, you just...
The great thing...
Well?
You're not a werewolf, though.
That's the sad thing.
But, you can still kill them all.
That's the path of the kook, friends.
You guys talk about your dark magic.
But the guy that broke the first rule of sniper club
is the one who's really got that black magic shit down.
I'm into slack magic.
And friends, I haven't said a word
about it.
But I'm gonna tell you a little bit about
how you can get slack, or what slack is.
And that's because I'd be lying if I did.
Because only you know what slack is for you.
And only you know what you're best at doing.
So, you know, and maybe you don't know that yet,
but I'm sure you'll figure it out.
So good luck.
And tonight we'll all have probably the truest form
of slack there is, which is dinner.
Isn't it?
If you get down to it.
What would you, if you really had nothing else,
what would you, if you were stuck in a desert island,
what would you want to have the most?
Dinner.
So let's get things in perspective.
The world's not really that bad of a place yet.
And even if it is, we'll adjust to it like we have so far.
And I guess that's what the magic craft is all about.
Works for me.
And I don't even believe in it.
Thank you very much.
For being so patient.
We're gonna run.
Pull some frog man.
Frog man!
More feedback.
I am the frog man.
Woo!
I am the frog man.
Woo!
Oh, man.

George received from Billy, the hardest stab.
19.

How we had loved it.
Just a short stab.
19.
Nothing wiped out failures.
Get used to the idea.
19.
We need to get out of here.
We have felt ill will.

George W. came with two dogs.
19.
Was not too good.
In fact, it was dreadful.
19.
They dropped in.
Puff.
The hardest stab.
Jack came.
Get out of the way.
A perfectly strange, attractive woman came.
Came.
Came.
Came.
Came.
Came.

I never had a chance to say a word.
They just kept nodding.
Nodding.

Bob gave me a ten, then said, no.
I gave you a 20.
At least he gave you a ten.
Bob took a bite out of my sandwich when I wasn't looking.
At least he's left you some.
Bob stole my change off the bar.
At least he left your drink...
Bob stole my change off the bar.


Bob slipped my husband the tongue
At least it was just a tongue
Bob drank most of the vodka
Then filled the bottle with water
So it looked like there wasn't any missing
At least it wasn't pee
Bob borrowed my saw
And then gave it back all rusty
At least he gave it back
Bob ripped pages out of my copy of Sexual Secrets
At least he only ripped some of them out
Bob makes fun of my pants behind my back
At least it was behind your back
Bob farts and then says the dog did it
At least it wasn't really the dog
Oh, yes, dear friends, Princess We Are Doe and yours truly at Starwood 2005, I think.
And what we were, that routine we were doing
was something that Nenslow and Frater Sadi
jammed on text-wise on the newsgroup alt.slack
a long time ago.
We just ended up reading it, who knows why, but we did it.
Norrell Preff did the collage before that
and the ones which follow.
Oh, and I Am the Frat Man was a little bit there
from Rudy Schwartz Project and before that
some ranting from Winter Star of 2004
by yours truly.

That I know it ain't real
But I won't squeal

To support my fellow man

To kill all bald-haired women at will
