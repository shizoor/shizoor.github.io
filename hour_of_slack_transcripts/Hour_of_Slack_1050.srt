1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
But a fundamental part of the American way is our system.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,840
With your permission, we'd like to talk shop for just a moment.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:06,860
Radio shop.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,800
Recently, one of the foremost publications in the broadcasting field

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,640
polled five critics and editors.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,640
The question, which radio network programs do you rate tops?

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,820
When the answers from these five experts were tabulated,

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,960
the final ratings were radio programs.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,140
Let's put it another way.

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,980
The Self Genius Power of Swatch.

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,140
And now, listen in.

12
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,020
KKK.com.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,480
Thank you very much.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,580
Look what I found.

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,140
Come here.

16
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,920
What is it?

17
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,220
It looks like a well.

18
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,040
Well, I think it's an air shaft, but undoubtedly it will lead us somewhere.

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,100
Probably to the...

20
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,120
The Self Genius Power of Swatch.

21
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,520
Well then, what are we waiting for?

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,300
Come on.

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,580
Fight on a blackboard with your neck.

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,420
That was the major problem with Mr. Tulip, he thought,

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,100
as they made their way to the ground.

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,560
It wasn't...

27
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,680
It wasn't that he had a drugs habit.

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,060
He wanted to have a drugs habit.

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,280
What he had was a stupidity habit,

30
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,220
which cut in whenever he found anything being sold in little bags.

31
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,200
And this had resulted in Mr. Tulip seeking heaven

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,080
in flour, salt, baking powder, and pickled beef sandwiches.

33
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,820
In a street where 30 people were selling

34
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:57,300
clang, slip, chop, rhino, skunk, triplin, floats, honk,

35
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,460
double honk, gongers, and slack,

36
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,280
Mr. Tulip had an unerring way of finding the man

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,960
who was retailing curry powder

38
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,920
at what worked out as $600 a pound.

39
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,740
It was so ing embarrassing.

40
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,920
Currently, he was experimenting with the whole range

41
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,240
of recreational chemicals available to Ankh-Morpork's troll population,

42
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,740
because at least when dealing with trolls,

43
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,760
Mr. Tulip had a moderate chance of outsmarting somebody.

44
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,560
In theory, slab and honk shouldn't have any effect on the human body,

45
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:29,560


46
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:29,560


47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,060
the brain, apart from maybe dissolving it.

48
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,320
Mr. Tulip was hanging in there.

49
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,760
He'd tried normality once, and hadn't liked it.

50
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,440
President Bush is trapped inside a basement,

51
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,840
looking a little dazed,

52
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,680
only having sex with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld,

53
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,860
a little more drilling for immoral purposes,

54
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,900
ooooh, I'm not sad about having sex,

55
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,340
President Bush is 100% fool,

56
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,300
he has botched the operation in Iraq,

57
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,180
oh really, sorry,

58
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,000
murder, rape,

59
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,200
Bush specified that he has seen firsthand,

60
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,140
the war on error,

61
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:00,980
we're really sorry,

62
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,660
Rumsfeld said he intends to serve the President at his pleasure,

63
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,380
it would be like a merry-go-round,

64
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,180
first degree murder charges are likely,

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:08,760
good morning,

66
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,680
apologize for lying about having sex standing up,

67
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,800
it was all a lie,

68
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,220
sexual relations with

69
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,340
oddwadwadwad

70
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:15,740
has his

71
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,280
oddwad

72
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,180
continue the lie,

73
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,000
sexual abuse,

74
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,220
sneezing and coughing,

75
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,720
I am finding students on college campuses,

76
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,680
I am aware that police attempted to enter those rooms,

77
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,220
and I am now about to leave this news conference to learn the whole story.

78
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,660
What's this thing all about?

79
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,340
I don't know.

80
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,400
Well, then why did...

81
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,540
No, I guess...

82
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:31,960
How long ago?

83
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,060
Oh, I don't know, I wouldn't know about that.

84
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,960
Well, what's your...

85
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,500
Ohio, Cleveland, Ohio.

86
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,660
You notice that smell?

87
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,680
Yeah, I think I do.

88
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,260
I don't think that's any of your business.

89
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,920
Are you suggesting that prawns could travel by semaphore?

90
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,000
said the chief priest.

91
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,600
I suppose you might be able to flick them from...

92
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,700
I was endeavoring to point out the fact that information is also bought and sold,

93
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,240
said Lord Vetinari,

94
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,540
and also that what was once considered impossible is now quite easy.

95
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,240
Kings and lords come and go and leave nothing but statues in the desert,

96
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,300
while a couple of young men tinkering in a workshop change the way the world works.

97
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,840
He walked over to a table on which was spread out a map of the world.

98
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,500
It was a workman's map.

99
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,500
That is to say, it was a map used by someone who needed to refer to it a lot.

100
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,440
It was covered with notes and markers.

101
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,880
We've always looked beyond the walls for the invaders, he said.

102
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,160
We always thought change would come from outside.

103
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,540
I don't know.

104
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,480
Usually on the point of a sword.

105
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:38,580
And then we look around and find that it comes from the inside of the head of someone you wouldn't notice in the street.

106
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,920
In certain circumstances it may be convenient to remove the head,

107
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,560
but there seem to be such a lot of them these days.

108
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,600
He gestured towards the busy map.

109
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,200
A thousand years ago we thought the world was a bowl, he said.

110
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,740
Five hundred years ago we knew it was a globe.

111
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,700
Today we know it is flat and round and carried through space on the back of a turtle.

112
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,340
He turned and gave the high priest another smile.

113
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,120
Don't you wonder what shape it will turn out to be tomorrow?

114
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,220
But a family trait of all the red colours was not to let go of a thread until you've unravelled the whole garment.

115
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,960
Besides, they had these little pincer things, you know, and would probably hang on like...

116
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
What do?

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,300
Prawns! They'd hang on to...

118
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,720
You are taking them!

119
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,740
You are taking me rather too literally, Your Reverence, said Vetinari sharply.

120
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,800
Oh!

121
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:40,360
I was merely endeavouring to indicate that if we do not grab events by the collar they will have us by the throat.

122
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,020
It'll end in trouble, my lord, said Ridcully.

123
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,440
He'd found it a good general comment in practically any debate.

124
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,500
Besides, it was so often true.

125
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,780
Lord Vetinari sighed.

126
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,540
In my experience practically everything does, he said.

127
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,020
That is the nature of things.

128
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,620
All we can do is sing as we go.

129
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,920
You'd better pray to the Lord when you see those flying saucers.

130
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,320
It may be the coming of the judgment day.

131
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,120
It's a sign there's no doubt of the trouble that's about.

132
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,860
So I say, my friends, you'd better start to pray.

133
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,440
They're a terrifying sight.

134
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,860
As they fly on day and night.

135
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,380
It's a warning that with better men our way.

136
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,540
You'd better pray to the Lord when you see those flying saucers.

137
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,860
It may be the coming of the judgment day.

138
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,880
Ah, yes, dear friend, and the judgment day is definitely on its way.

139
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,340
It's an old-fashioned radio devival.

140
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,780
An old-fashioned radio ministry, friends.

141
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:03,800
We're live in the studio this year because Bob has blessed us.

142
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,120
Blessed us, friends.

143
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,280
And friends, you know what?

144
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,780
It's been all reruns for so long.

145
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:17,020
But it's fresh and new now because Bob let us finish the book, the new bauble, you might say.

146
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,700
It's done, friends.

147
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,340
The bauble-ogre-phon.

148
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,660
Did you say the bauble?

149
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,740
It's done?

150
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,580
It's done, Reverend Bleepa.

151
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,760
Reverend Bleepo, it's done.

152
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,700
The Hour of Slack is going to bring you something new.

153
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,740
Hey, that sounds familiar.

154
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,060
Say that again.

155
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,280
The Hour of Slack is going to bring you something new.

156
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,080
I could swear that that sounds familiar.

157
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,580
Like I've heard you somehow before say...

158
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,500
Say what?

159
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,720
I'm not saying anything.

160
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,720
The Hour of Slack.

161
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,660
No, no, you have to say the whole thing.

162
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,520
Wait a minute. Take two.

163
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,120
That was me?

164
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,100
Yeah, take two.

165
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,380
Try.

166
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,280
Try.

167
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:02,780
Try.

168
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,380
The subgenius Hour of Slack.

169
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,500
Yes.

170
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,720
And Reverend Bleepo Abernathy is in the studio.

171
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:22,600
And a special guest star, Reverend Baz Otherwise.

172
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,340
Famed for being one of the only girls on Alt.Slack.

173
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,460
Indeed.

174
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,540
And rumored to be the actual daughter of the Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

175
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,780
Could it be true?

176
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,840
The truth may or may not be revealed during this broadcast.

177
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,600
You mean those things reproduce?

178
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,520
What things reproduce?

179
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,580
Those subgenius things.

180
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,220
This is a much older one.

181
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,400
Those subgenius things, they reproduce?

182
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:51,740
They're not reproduced?

183
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,360
The first issuance you had was Barbara...

184
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,980
What was her name again?

185
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,700
Oh, Billingsley.

186
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,460
Barbara Billingsley.

187
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,040
That didn't work out at all.

188
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,720
As the beaver.

189
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,380
We had to reverse that whole thing.

190
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,320
And I had to go back in time and then I was reborn in 1958.

191
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,280
And then my daughter was born in 1988.

192
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,400
Is that so?

193
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,860
But she wasn't Barbara Billingsley.

194
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,940
No, no.

195
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,460
And that wasn't really my daughter.

196
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,220
Barbara Billingsley was, let's just say, somebody else's daughter at some point in time.

197
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,140
I'm not going to...

198
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,460
Look, you told us not to...

199
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,280
She was not Baz Otherwise!

200
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,560
Who was in the studio!

201
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,780
Say hello, Baz!

202
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,200
Hello.

203
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:47,820
Is it alright to ask how she feels about this abject finger-pointing, the blame-calling, the slandering?

204
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,900
She's not related to this.

205
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,540
I don't refer to it as that.

206
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,000
Person.

207
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,540
It was all very scientific and done with great research and alacrity.

208
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:03,900
And this was something we actually knew was going to happen back in 1964, I believe, when I was by a swimming pool in Tarrytown, New York.

209
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,240
I remember.

210
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,920
I recall the dream that I had had the previous evening.

211
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,120
What a dream it was.

212
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:09,960
Yes, yes.

213
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,300
And we knew that the young people of today then...

214
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,500
Well, no.

215
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,260
Then we knew that the young people of now, which is now...

216
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,880
Which is not the current era.

217
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,580
Not the 20th century, but the 21st century.

218
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,880
We would need 21st century subgeni to carry the word further, even before we even knew it existed.

219
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,660
But they're not the old people now.

220
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,640
They're not currently the old people who are the young people now.

221
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,160
These are the people of tomorrow.

222
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,160
These are the people who...

223
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,480
These are the tomorrow people!

224
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,520
Because the young people of today are the old people of tomorrow.

225
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,780
And we need old drooling subgeniuses around the year 2080.

226
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,740
Dick Cheney Drools.

227
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:56,040
Yes, well, beyond Dick Cheney's drooling, it's important that the young people of today be aware of other things.

228
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:01,340
The great Dada tradition that is not a part of the tradition.

229
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,420
And not only the Dada, but the Bull Dada.

230
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:03,940
The Bull.

231
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,360
Now, you boys go ahead and stand closer together.

232
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,220
Now, don't be shy.

233
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:07,920
Don't be shy.

234
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,360
Come on now.

235
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,520
You saw Brokeback Mountain.

236
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,220
Everything's cool.

237
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,340
I can feel his foot.

238
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,100
It's all hairy.

239
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,480
He's got a great hairy foot.

240
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,720
I mean, for a man his size, it's huge.

241
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,400
It means that it's very fuzzy.

242
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,040
Well, it's legendary actually in these parts.

243
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,560
But, you know, if they was part of the other one before that...

244
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,280
The legendary feet!

245
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,860
What's most important is that there's a new...

246
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,700
Yes, yes.

247
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,500
There's a new tome that the Reverend Stang has completed.

248
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,200
Well, with the help of 640 artists.

249
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,560
No, actually there's 690 art pieces.

250
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,380
Art pieces.

251
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,040
Yes.

252
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,940
There were some blind artists which you included in your tome, weren't there?

253
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,260
We had...

254
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:54,940
The subgenius artists are blind and yet they draw the coolest pictures because Bob gots

255
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,240
their hand!

256
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,300
And their actual blood is used in the printing ink.

257
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,400
Oh, he's got cramp from doing that.

258
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't get the cramps.

259
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,160
But their actual blood is used in the printing ink for these editions.

260
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,140
It's like Michael Tangelo.

261
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,600
They're blind and they use your blood.

262
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,140
Yep.

263
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,140
Some of it is turtle blood as was demonstrated by Terry Pratchett in the previous lecture.

264
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,580
That's right.

265
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,100
By the way, we should give credit there.

266
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:24,640
Those two things that sounded like British people reading were from the audiobook of

267
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,460
The Truth by Terry Pratchett, my Shorterpersav of the last six months.

268
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,620
But I'm telling you, I'm telling you, there's a reemergence, Reverend Stang.

269
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,620
I'm sensing a reemergence amongst the people of the world.

270
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:34,820
It's coming out.

271
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,460
I sense...

272
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,280
You see, there have been all these false sightings.

273
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:44,000
There have been things like the oblongs with the dad without the arms who is clearly ripped

274
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,700
off.

275
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,320
I will say this without hesitation.

276
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,160
The insight false smiling Bob.

277
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,600
What do you call those cartoons?

278
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,780
The cartoons?

279
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,280
Oh, yes.

280
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,200
Princess Wee and I came up with an acronym.

281
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,940
These so-called cartoons that totally torn the word of Bob asunder and then got it wrong.

282
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,220
I'm sorry.

283
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,820
Can I say that?

284
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,900
They've got it wrong.

285
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:07,820
C-C-A-R-T-O.

286
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,760
It's cartoons with two Cs.

287
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:16,300
It stands for Cable Comedies Adored Religiously by Timid Overweight Oldies.

288
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,360
The older nerds.

289
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:17,820
Praise the older nerds.

290
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,580
The writers of which are no doubt.

291
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,880
No doubt.

292
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,300
Those bastards.

293
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,160
May I say bastards?

294
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:23,660
Yes.

295
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,300
You may.

296
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:24,880
You may.

297
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:30,440
Those bastards are listening to us right now and making what we're saying into their

298
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,860
next so-called adult cartoon.

299
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,980
Could I just say one thing also?

300
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,600
I think this goes...

301
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,360
This is way beyond plagiarism.

302
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,100
I think what they're doing in connection with our government, releasing these statements

303
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,800
and encrypted in different ways.

304
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,080
Yes.

305
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,920
And reprinted and turned around and the next thing you know, you've got a millions, millions

306
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,260
of millions of these people not only misinformed but as dangerous as a loaded gun.

307
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:59,360
Well, they think it's a coded message that they're hearing in the cartoon.

308
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,420
They watch the cartoon and they think, hey, there's the coded message just for me.

309
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,460
They're ready to act anymore.

310
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,980
Yeah, but really all it makes them do is it makes them go out and buy more of that Coca-Cola

311
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,260
with the...

312
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,980
Well, and now...

313
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,260
What should they be buying?

314
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,660
Could some hear the message?

315
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,060
It's only October.

316
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,140
Yeah.

317
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:15,640
I think they should be buying the way they're doing it in the pop media.

318
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,400
Yup.

319
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:22,600
And the truly attuned visionaries know that the voices on the TV and the voices...

320
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:22,960
Are talking to them.

321
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,960
... are talking to them.

322
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,180
Yeah, this one's for you.

323
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,840
That one right there.

324
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:33,080
They played that song at that exact time in order to clench for sure the message that

325
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,320
you should take up that weapon and do that horrible deed that was going through your head.

326
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,980
You know who we're talking to and that's you.

327
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,680
Yeah.

328
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,840
You know we're talking to you.

329
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,280
You've been waiting for this command.

330
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:44,980
You creep, creep, psycho.

331
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,020
Yeah.

332
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,080
Listener, we love you, listeners.

333
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,000
Your aluminum foil hat won't protect you now.

334
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,940
Yeah, the aluminum foil hat.

335
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,400
Yeah, what he said.

336
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,940
Yeah, me too.

337
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:05,240
Now that I'm firmly aligned with the Illuminati, I think it's important that the work from within begun, you know, in earnest back in 1953.

338
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,160
That's right.

339
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,520
Yeah.

340
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,660
The church began in 19—Bob originally started preaching in 1953.

341
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:20,840
Yeah, and I think it's time that this is when the very head of Dobbs itself will rip—will start to actually rip through screens and burn itself on screens.

342
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,380
And people will have it on their HDTV screens that they paid $500.

343
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:38,260
You know, I actually have a Windows screen that has a miraculous Dobbs head that appeared on it sort of in dust and dead bug parts.

344
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,660
Yeah, well, see—

345
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,640
You think he thinks I'm—

346
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:41,880
I'm kidding.

347
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,960
I'm not making that up.

348
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,660
I have a photograph.

349
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,220
There have been sightings and there have been actual physical appurtenance appearances.

350
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,260
Dobbs, can I speak to Dobbs directly through this radio show for once?

351
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,860
He's speaking directly to you.

352
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,680
How could I stop you?

353
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,360
Okay.

354
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,020
All right.

355
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,160
Look, Bob, you said it a long time ago.

356
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:06,580
You said that it was going to take a whole lot longer than we ever imagined, and it was going to hurt a lot.

357
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,560
And, Bob, I just want you to know that you were right.

358
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,240
That it's taking a—

359
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,320
It's taking a really, really long time.

360
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,780
And it's very painful.

361
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,780
And I guess we got a few more—

362
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,000
We got, like, 7,000 more years or something.

363
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,760
Or more legions.

364
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,260
Or 6,000 and change until 86—

365
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,020
6,000 and change.

366
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,580
86, 61.

367
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,960
Well, now, that's just one theory.

368
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,240
X-Day could be tomorrow, my friend.

369
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,700
X-Day could be any moment.

370
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:35,460
X-Day could be awaiting us as soon as we leave this radio station.

371
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,400
X-Day, friend—

372
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,300
Why look over that cloud?

373
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,820
It's X-Day's waiting for us.

374
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,980
Why look over that cloud?

375
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,180
It could be as soon as we leave this radio station.

376
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,180


377
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,200
Why look over that cloud?

378
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,840
If you've been checking for X-Day on the roof of your mouth,

379
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,980
you may find Bob there.

380
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,940
X-Day could be tomorrow morning on your way to work.

381
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,020
Your car could be unmanned.

382
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,180
You could be unmanned even if you're not in a car.

383
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,160
Even if you're not a man.

384
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,580
Some people have DNA that's self-scarifying.

385
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,380
You wake up in the morning and your mouth is a vessel of lies.

386
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,340
It all depends on whether you've paid your dues unto Bob.

387
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,180
And we can't go into that in too much detail on this public-supported radio station.

388
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,680
And we can't go into that in too much detail on this public-supported radio station.

389
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:12,580
And we can't go into that in too much detail on this public-supported radio station.

390
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,880
Because that would be doing the public too much good to save your soul.

391
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,660
No, you can't do the public any good.

392
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,400
Or what you think of as a soul.

393
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,980
No, no, those who do the public good, well, we know what to do with them.

394
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,060
Those who actually accomplish something that's positive, well,

395
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,360
we don't want them to stick around too long.

396
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,520
Or if they do, well, we're going to make sure they have so much money

397
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,500
and so many drugs that they're hopelessly inebriated to the point

398
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,320
where they can't spread their message any further.

399
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:41,780
We have a list.

400
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,840
We're just going down, checking one off.

401
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,860
Like Santa Claus would.

402
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,680
We look at each name once or twice.

403
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,520
Much like the anti-Santa Claus, you might say.

404
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,220
Anti-Claus, yes.

405
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,440
Yes, Bob taketh away and Bob taketh away.

406
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,120
Yes.

407
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,120
Now, I just came across something in the galleys for the new bookstang.

408
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:08,400
Yes, we have brought the home-printed copy of the new subgenius book.

409
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,060
It's pretty frightening.

410
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,120
It's pretty overwhelming.

411
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,040
Oh, my God!

412
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,000
There's things here that no one has ever seen.

413
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,560
Let's see.

414
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,760
Okay.

415
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,280
First of all, I never knew about his utility belt.

416
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,420
Dobbs' utility belt?

417
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,200
Yeah, I did.

418
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,820
There's a lot of unusual stories about Bob's life.

419
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,900
Possibly apocryphal.

420
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,600
That one's for real.

421
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,040
Could you please read for the listeners here what the contents of Bob's utility belt are, please?

422
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,160
First, a combination atomic bomb slash blaster.

423
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,420
A blowgun clipped to his belt.

424
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:42,880
Okay.

425
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,520
A gun that shot tiny knives.

426
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,060
Okay.

427
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,680
A sword that was both a flamethrower and a mace dispenser.

428
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,200
Right.

429
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,800
An ICBM that released five million rubber-tipped darts.

430
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,440
Wow, five million, friends.

431
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:54,740
Five million.

432
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,520
Five million.

433
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,800
A bomb that ejected thousands of those snake springs they put in gag candy canisters.

434
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,540
This is in 1953, he had this.

435
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,360
High technology.

436
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,180
And poot bombs.

437
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,740
Yes, and now we don't even need that.

438
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,060
First of all, friends...

439
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,140
Oh, we always need poot bombs.

440
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,620
I think we can talk about this now.

441
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,140
You told me not to talk about this, but I'm going to talk about this thing.

442
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,580
It's about the light.

443
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,420
Okay?

444
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,220
Now, many people have talked about how, you know, there's a light at the end of the tunnel, etc., etc., etc.

445
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:29,300
But, well, you know, in the Scientology church, at the very, very highest levels, there's this whole thing about the thetans and all that,

446
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,360
and we're not supposed to talk about that either because they get upset.

447
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,700
At least reportedly.

448
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,480
This is what I've heard.

449
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,300
I'm not going to say that the Scientologists actually do this.

450
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,000
I just heard a story that they did.

451
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,420
I'll let you guess.

452
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,240
I've heard that.

453
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,380
Similar kind of thing.

454
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:40,600
I'm just saying.

455
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:40,600


456
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:40,600


457
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,220
It's actually a faint answer.

458
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:50,560
You know, but what actually happens is beyond FROP, at the very, very highest levels of subgenius...

459
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,360
Slack awareness.

460
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,000
Slack awareness is the actual ability...

461
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,620
Well, first, you start out smoking light.

462
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,800
Light itself.

463
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:04,760
You learn how to smoke it, and then it gets to the point where you don't even have to smoke it anymore.

464
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,600
You just look at a light, even a light in the sky, a light bulb, and you get off.

465
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,180
You're there.

466
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:11,880
You're there.

467
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,020
You're there.

468
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,480
That's why Bob says, give me a light.

469
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,280
Is that okay?

470
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,600
Did I tell that just now?

471
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:16,740
Yeah, Bob.

472
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,200
Well, that's, yeah, that's some of the new revelations that are included in this book.

473
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:25,660
These are the ones that happen to be included with the, between the lines.

474
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:25,800
Really?

475
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,640
I thought I just made that up.

476
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,620
You mean there are actually people or subgenius...

477
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,540
Well, the book changes from moment to moment.

478
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,140
Well, that's exactly it.

479
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,020
I got that from just from glancing through the book.

480
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,640
I figured that out.

481
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,260
But they look at light and become not only inebriated, but they...

482
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,020
No, they smoke light.

483
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,280
They smoke the light, but they start out...

484
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:40,420
But then they...

485
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:40,580
But then they...

486
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,140
They start out smoking it.

487
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:47,880
But then once you've adjust, once you've learned how it feels to use light that way,

488
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,860
then you can do it simply by looking at it.

489
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,020
This is not for young people, Baz.

490
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,880
This is not for you.

491
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,040
Just the smell of light will be enough to get you all...

492
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,400
Exactly.

493
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Or even somebody saying...

494
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:55,980
The third nostril...

495
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,860
Certain types of light.

496
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,820
Just saying the word, light.

497
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,480
See?

498
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:58,740
See?

499
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,820
It happened to him.

500
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,380
Yep.

501
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,200
Well, I've started young.

502
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,500
Wow.

503
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,500
See, I think, I think Stang's in on it.

504
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,120
He always pretends he's not in on it.

505
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,120


506
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,120


507
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,040
That's what they call him.

508
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,420
He's a...

509
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,420
Photon huffers.

510
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,180
He's a...

511
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:10,780
He always comes out with the really...

512
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,260
They're starting to rebel against you.

513
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,440
...the really upper echelons.

514
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:13,980
I really do.

515
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:14,520
Oh, of course.

516
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:14,940
Yeah.

517
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:15,540
Look at the...

518
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,280
He's always saying, oh, I'm just a scribe.

519
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,200
Look at the alien vertebrae behind there.

520
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,740
Look at the other side of his chair.

521
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,780
What do you think we do at the Bohemian Grove?

522
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,040
We don't drink.

523
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:25,920
Okay.

524
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,300
No, we...

525
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,880
We light up.

526
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,660
We light...

527
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,120
We light...

528
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,200
We light...

529
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,200


530
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,740
You know, when the...

531
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,380
It's better than Batman.

532
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:31,840
That's it.

533
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,780
It's better than Batman.

534
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,200
We take that...

535
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
The phrase, hey, lighten up, man.

536
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,580
We literally...

537
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,120
Our bodies become suffused with light energy.

538
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,040
Empowered, as we are, by Satan, the god of all evil and darkness.

539
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,320
Oh, is that it?

540
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,320


541
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:46,900
You didn't tell me that.

542
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,180
Yeah, yeah.

543
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:53,520
Actually, I didn't know that until this kook on the internet informed us that we were all Satanists.

544
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,100
Not only that.

545
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,580
Get this.

546
00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:00,180
We're Satanists and we're Freemasons and we're Jews and we're gay.

547
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:00,680
We're Christians, right?

548
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,020
Well, that explains everything.

549
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,280
So, this...

550
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,980
So, that just brings us all around...

551
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,240
And then we're white again and then we're everything, is really what it is.

552
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,500
Well, that's kind of what it is.

553
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,020
It's when you're...

554
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,100
Because we're Christians.

555
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,300
We're also straight.

556
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:10,940
That many things...

557
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,420
I know for a fact that we're also straight.

558
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:17,620
It all blurs together and it's like Bob is the combination of all good and all bad.

559
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,240
Well, Bob is the composite erasure.

560
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,960
Because we're also, as we know, we are saints, we are popes, we are martyrs, we are visionaries.

561
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,300
Have you cleared this one of the Unitarians?

562
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:26,600
We're white popes.

563
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,040
We're small...

564
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,000
I don't know.

565
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,180
We are epoptics in our own small way.

566
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,440
We cannot be Bob.

567
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,020
Right.

568
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:39,820
We cannot even be like Bob, but we can follow in the wake of his luck plane as he churns

569
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,160
through the oceans of the great score of all the Akashic records.

570
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,140
We can kind of surf behind him.

571
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:51,600
Yeah, in fact, J.R. Bob Dobbs, it says here, puts the er in der, the sent in incentive,

572
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,560
the dick in ridiculous, and the pipe in your mouth.

573
00:22:54,660 --> 00:23:01,080
He puts that pipe in your mouth, friends, but you don't ask what Bob's smoking in that pipe.

574
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,280
What he's smoking is you.

575
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,540
You dive into that pipe yourself.

576
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,860
You let Bob smoke you because that pipe is not...

577
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,380
It doesn't represent drugs.

578
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,720
It's not symbolic of marijuana.

579
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,080
That pipe is a tunnel of knowledge.

580
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,500
It is the path directly to Bob's lungs.

581
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,420
It's been a while since we did this.

582
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:25,680
And from thence to his very brain, my friend, you can be the thought in Bob's foul, foul,

583
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,160
wet dreams if you jump in that pipe and let him smoke you raw, baby.

584
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:37,460
Then did they come to him awash in spirits, falling and stumbling and calling out his name.

585
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,280
But he walked on from them.

586
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:48,080
Until he came unto Wanda and did know her a while, biding his time unto the return of his disciplinarians,

587
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,640
who were of a goodly number thereto.

588
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,640
Conniptions 123.

589
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,320
That was St. Kerry Thornley who wrote that, by the way.

590
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,680
Wow.

591
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,940
Yeah, it's a Thornley quote.

592
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,740
Reverend Jesse Sump was his subgenius name.

593
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,060
Wow.

594
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,360
Kerry Thornley, who was one of the co-subfounders of the Discordian tribe.

595
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,340
Yes, indeed. And he's still a member of the Discordian tribe.

596
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,580
To which we owe quite... I'm not sure what.

597
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,940
Did they still have that altar? The subgenius altar?

598
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,440
They stole the altar in Chicago in like, 82.

599
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,000
Did they give that back to you?

600
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,480
Oh, you're thinking of... We had a curse that we got it all back.

601
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,660
Oh, okay. You got that back.

602
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,340
Let me put it this way. Their houses burned down.

603
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,840
We got what we needed.

604
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,400
You don't mess with Bob, my friend!

605
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,360
Oh, I feel so relaxed now.

606
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
I think Bob just messed in the room.

607
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,460
I feel it.

608
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,540
Is that what that smell is?

609
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,900
I don't think that's what it is.

610
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:47,540
That explains a lot.

611
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,720
Bob. Bob. Bob.

612
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,360
Oh?

613
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,000
Well?

614
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,420
Let me tell you something, mister.

615
00:24:53,060 --> 00:25:00,880
Where is there a place for science in a town where they bury a Bob Bob Bob Bob head by the light of the moon to get rid of Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob?

616
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,440
Yes.

617
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,560
Let me tell you something, mister.

618
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,300
He tells the citizens how to think.

619
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:05,680
I know.

620
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,020
That's what I like.

621
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,340
He deserves it.

622
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,480
He's a magician.

623
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,220
You dirty little lying cheat.

624
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,980
It's called Bob if you want to investigate it.

625
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,340
Oh.

626
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,100
You're crazy.

627
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,100
I had the soil analyzed.

628
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,200
Bob.

629
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,700
You know, Bob, you're getting to be a pretty big fella.

630
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,640
You ought to know the medical terms for certain parts of the body.

631
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,120
To begin with, penis.

632
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:33,640
Yeah.

633
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,840
Come on in.

634
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,320
You know, your mother would give me the devil if she were home and saw me in the bathroom.

635
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:38,700
I'm not going to be with you this way.

636
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,140
Yeah.

637
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:39,820
Yes, sir.

638
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,020
Maybe.

639
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,800
Well, maybe.

640
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,740
This is a good idea.

641
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:44,840
Bob.

642
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,000
Oh, here's a match.

643
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,020
Your pipe's gone out again.

644
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:48,860
Well, thanks.

645
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,000
Watch it.

646
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,520
Well, Bob.

647
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,260
I guess that didn't make too much sense.

648
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,240
Golly.

649
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:02,220
You like the delicious, meaty flavor of Spam, the way it satisfies husky appetites.

650
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,300
Ours is a great heritage, a land of freedom and peace.

651
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,300


652
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,300


653
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,300


654
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,300


655
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,300


656
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,300


657
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,300


658
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:08,300


659
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,040
Out of our way of life come strange success stories.

660
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,140
And this is the way the story goes.

661
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,020
It all began some years ago when a kid was growing up in a small Midwestern town.

662
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,660
It seemed that no matter what he wanted to do, there was always a grinning Japanese policeman to tell him,

663
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,360
Oh, so sorry, no can do.

664
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,460
And with one punch, he knocked the grinning Jap policeman down in hopes of pocketing a few dollars.

665
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,160
And he liked it so much that he decided to study with his fists.

666
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,280
Almost all of continental Europe uses the metrics to determine the number of people who have been killed.

667
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,820
Most Japanese countryming has actual rockets, small ahí use of rockets, and one rocket will take three rockets at once.

Because they have achieved Dobstown,

683
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,400
I have to say,

684
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,940
now, the ladies have something to share with us.

685
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,360
Oh, no.

686
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,240
Yes. This concerns

687
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,900
the gospel of Connie and

688
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,180
new revelations. This is

689
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,980
unlike the Da Vinci Code

690
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,100
with all its false stories.

691
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,240
This is

692
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,780
the truth, friends.

693
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,260
The true revelations.

694
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,380
Without, you cannot forget

695
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,340
Connie. Without Connie,

696
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,500
there would be no Bob. But without Bob,

697
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,740
there'd be no church.

698
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,560
Connie said it. Bob yes-deared it.

699
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,800
That settles it.

700
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,060
Wow.

701
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,140
See, we never knew any of this,

702
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,680
before. This is all new.

703
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,180
I can actually feel certain parts of my

That's right between your eyeballs and up,

you know, by your nostrils.

707
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,960
This was the other level they promised us back in 1982.

708
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,680
Well, it wasn't much of a promise. They were all a bunch of damn liars.

709
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,860
But it is great that it is coming true.

710
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,200
Yeah. I don't think they had anything to do with it.

711
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,420
They were just writing it down and hoping.

712
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,120
You know what I'm saying?

713
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,540
Remember they said, be here now?

714
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,620
This is here, and this is now.

715
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,220
This is what he was talking about all that time.

716
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,140
How do you make the difference?

717
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,860
Yes, do that.

718
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,980
I don't know. It really rings.

719
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,280
How long have you been in Dobbstown, buddy boy?

720
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,980
Actually, I know some music

721
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,280
that would be much more appropriate

722
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,500
that would go with that.

723
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,680
But Dobbstown is relaxed and sort of laid back

724
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,820
with the nice Mexican trumpets there.

725
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,280
Why not?

726
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,020
And everybody has their own needs attended to.

727
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,860
There's really no problem

728
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,280
to speak of.

729
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,000
The towels are always hot.

730
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,720
It's kind of expensive.

731
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,060
Well, it's pricey.

732
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:06,520
Especially,

733
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:07,860
with fake money,

734
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,920
what difference does it make?

735
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,140
We all get Bob Bunny.

736
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,780
I hear the water is more expensive than the gas,

737
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,340
just like it's going to be down south.

738
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,620
Well, they have to superheat it

739
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,540
because of all the water there in Las Vegas and everything.

740
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,500
They have to superheat the water in Dobbstown.

741
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,780
The water is going to actually be more expensive than the gas.

742
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,200
In Dobbstown,

743
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,740
they give you two livers

744
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,700
so you can drink from the fountains of rum

745
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,180
all day long

746
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,620
and never feel a bad effect.

747
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,040
There's rivers of vodka

748
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,200
that run through Dobbstown.

749
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,860
There's streets paved with chocolate

750
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,020
that pot of old chocolate.

751
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,260
They give you an operation that gives you a nylon esophagus

752
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,480
that never wears out.

753
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,120
They give you the diverter

754
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,360
whereby you can eat and eat and eat

755
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,820
and just shuffle it off into a little sack

756
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,540
on the strap to your side.

757
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,840
You can name how many proboscises you want.

758
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,440
Say you want five noses

759
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,300
or something like that

760
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,960
so you can take on all the aromatics going on at all times.

761
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,020
Some of them are subliminal.

762
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,380
In Dobbstown, you can have everything!

763
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,840
But you can also have Connie.

764
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,360
That's what I like.

765
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,760
Everything plus Connie.

766
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,140
As many times and as often as you can have her.

767
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,520
Yes.

768
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,240
In fact, the problem becomes escaping from Connie after a while.

769
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,380
Yeah, but they had quite an affair, Bob and Connie.

770
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,000
You have to admit.

771
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,540
I mean, there's revelations about their affair,

772
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,760
you know, and the emerald seduction,

773
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,480
the tale of a great love.

774
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,120
Oh, no, actually, that's from a novel

775
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,380
that's really fictionalized.

776
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,740
Oh, it's not true?

777
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,240
No.

778
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,940
Well, no, it's apocryphal.

779
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,820
You put it that way.

780
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,960
Was it a novel written by Dobbs himself?

781
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,240
We're not sure.

782
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,960
It almost seems machine-written.

783
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,500
But it's from the 40s.

784
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,720
That's the weird thing about it.

785
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,320
Well, you've got to remember,

786
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,660
the mimeograph machine in what was IBM

787
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,040
and Farben and Germany's Hitler

788
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,860
and all those guys, or whatever his name was.

789
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,500
Yeah, Bob had access to all of that.

790
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:56,800
Yeah.

791
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,080
Yes, Bob worked for the conspiracy.

792
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,240
He's not proud of that.

793
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,400
And sometimes in Dobbstown,

794
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,940
there's three droogies named Alex and what's the...

795
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,500
Well, I have to say something about the young people,

796
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,340
about the droogies,

797
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,700
about the young subgeni coming up now.

798
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,580
And I certainly hope that Baz can help

799
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,440
bring them into the forefront here

800
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,380
because we're going to need them to take over.

801
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,320
We had a sign today, as far as I'm concerned.

802
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,840
Baz graduated her earthly high school today.

803
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,720
Praise Baz!

804
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:30,400
Yeah!

805
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,540
And all through the ceremony,

806
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,180
this is a true story.

807
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,640
This actually did happen today.

808
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,520
The skies were dark and thundery.

809
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,240
You heard rumble.

810
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,580
As they're like saying,

811
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,100
if we always come back forever,

812
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,560
then everything will be wonderful.

813
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,000
And, you know, whatever they say

814
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,900
in graduation ceremony exercises.

815
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,820
And the children of today are tomorrow's future.

816
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,300
You know, all that stuff that they say,

817
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,460
which is the same thing we say.

818
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,980
But, you know, in a more pedestrian fashion, let's say.

819
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,560
Anyway, all through the ceremony,

820
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,100
and the children are sort of looking nervously,

821
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,620
at the sky.

822
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,780
Well, they're not children, actually.

823
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,360
They're high schoolers.

824
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,660
They're 18 around.

825
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,040
And what happened was,

826
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,980
they were thinking that it was going to rain

827
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,020
all through the time.

828
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,720
And the moment that Baz's diploma was handed to her,

829
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,340
the clouds parted.

830
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,940
The sun came out.

831
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,540
And the water, the little puddles dried up.

832
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,140
And the worms retreated back into their holes.

833
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,440
It's like the miracle of Fatima.

834
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,100
It was.

835
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,460
It was.

836
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:37,940
It was.

837
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,080
And that's what I knew.

838
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,140
Only a UFO's appearance could explain such a miracle.

839
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,740
That's what I knew, that the young people,

840
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,220
the young subgenies,

841
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,040
I should say the young mutants.

842
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,180
Butants, we prefer to be called.

843
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:52,500
The beautiful young mutants will indeed take over.

844
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,320
This is a sign from Bob.

845
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,300
Yes.

846
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,060
I am glad you know that.

847
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,820
Most of the other students are going to some earthbound university.

848
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,740
I am headed for Dobbstown University.

849
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,920
That's where I got my doctorate.

850
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,040
Doctorate of Divinity.

851
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,860
People come to me every now and then they go,

852
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,260
Mr. Stang, as if, oh, I know you're not really a reverend.

853
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:15,960
I'm sorry.

854
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,460
If you're going to call me Mr., it's going to be Mr. Smith.

855
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,220
But my friend, I did not go to Dobbstown Divinity School

856
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,920
for six months for nothing.

857
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,520
I earned that reverendship, ministership fair and square.

858
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,580
Reverend Baz otherwise, she's a $30 subgenius minister.

859
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,080
She's going to be a minister.

860
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,560
She's going to be on board the saucers, whether she wants to be or not,

861
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,720
when they finally come.

862
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,500
Thanks, Bob, for that.

863
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,200
But, uh...

864
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,340
What, uh...

865
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,800
Is this the Elvis Costello?

866
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,080
Yes.

867
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,580
Is this the Elvis Presley version of Miracle Man?

868
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,560
No, it's not.

869
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,140
That's funny.

870
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,400
You're singing...

871
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,520
Stang.

872
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,920
Reverend Stang.

873
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,420
Yeah.

874
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,160
You're singing to yourself in the middle of the show.

875
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,540
I swore I wouldn't sing to you.

876
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,520
We were discussing your book.

877
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,260
Could you...

878
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,040
I swore I would not do that.

879
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,500
That's all right.

880
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,260
That's all right.

881
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,740
The keyboard player...

882
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,280
I will sing no more forever.

883
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,040
The keyboard player for that band.

884
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:22,700
Well, the attractions.

885
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,760
Steve Naive.

886
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,120
He's a...

887
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,220
Wasn't he a car-taring member?

888
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,000
He was a woman at one time.

889
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,040
He was a Swedish woman.

890
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,100
He was described in People magazine reading a copy of Book of the Subgenius.

891
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,060
But we don't know whether Steve Naive really...

892
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,980
Really liked it or not.

893
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:38,340
Oh.

894
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,220
We only know that it was reading it.

895
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,300
It was reading it.

896
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:41,640
Okay.

897
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,500
The blonde Ingeborg look is easy to...

898
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,260
Oh, is she doing the whole Wendy Carlos thing?

899
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,380
No, he's just doing the whole...

900
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,680
Just kind of like a Wendy...

901
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,760
No, like an Ingeborg.

902
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,600
No, we're making that up.

903
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:50,700
A Swedish...

904
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,320
It's not...

905
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,620
Don't spread that news around New York City, bleep-o.

906
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:54,900
Who knew?

907
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,420
Well, if you spread it in New York City, it would automatically be assumed to be true.

908
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,080
And it isn't.

909
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,700
Well, you know, the conspiracy is no fool.

910
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,060
I mean, it recognizes and rightfully fears the vast, untapped power...

911
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,080
That lurks within the potential uber-femme.

912
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,720
That is why, from the very moment a she-child emerges from the birth canal,

913
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,940
so much time and energy is spent on diverting the larval uber-femme

914
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,360
from recognizing and embracing her true identity and her destiny.

915
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,320
The Connieites of Dobstown are heard in the background.

916
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,540
This is Nancy Regalia's work that you will be able to see.

917
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,400
This is Nancy singing, in fact.

918
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,000
Yeah.

919
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,860
Oh, cool.

920
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,940
Well, you know, the first thing they do is they...

921
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,640
They try to force an unconscious identification with the color pink

922
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,540
onto these helpless infants, these poor mutant girls, butants.

923
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,580
From the moment they're squirted into this planet of clocks,

924
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,420
they are swaddled in pink blankets,

925
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,220
dressed in frilly pink party dresses,

926
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:58,900
and given pink diabetes-inducing, big-eyed, stuffed animals to play with.

927
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,760
It's sad.

928
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,920
The unavoidable equation is written on their delicate brain tissue...

929
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,780
Yes, see?

930
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,960
And even Baz...

931
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,920
My mom was a weirdo.

932
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,280
Baz was a tiny child.

933
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,600
She rejected the pink.

934
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,840
We knew...

935
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,100
Really?

936
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,160
Yes, she did.

937
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,080
I remember when they...

938
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,260
That's not very girlish.

939
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,460
No.

940
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,400
When they drove you guys out of Dobstown, she was crying,

941
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,900
but you bundled her up in your schnapps and whatever they call that thing,

942
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,140
and she was brave, like a true warrior princess.

943
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,260
You forgot.

944
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:30,480
Yep, and when she cried, it was only for joy.

945
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,780
And the unavoidable equation written on their delicate brain tissue

946
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,300
before they're even learned...

947
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,040
This is how cruel they are to the butant.

948
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,380
Yes.

949
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,840
Before they're even learned how to speak,

950
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,460
pink equals girl, girl equals pink.

951
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,360
This is false, isn't it, Baz?

952
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,080
Completely.

953
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,200
Doesn't that just cheese you off?

954
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,660
They tried to force this pink on you.

955
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,940
I've been anti-pink since four years old.

956
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,520
Yes.

957
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,580
Since I can remember.

958
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,140
Yes, and that's true, friends.

959
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,060
I don't think she has a pink item in her wardrobe.

960
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,480
She just has a natural aversion to pink, then.

961
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:01,680
Yep.

962
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,640
I think even once we ran out of socks and we had to, like, buy pink socks,

963
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,960
and she immediately...

964
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,780
Died them black.

965
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,600
I was barefoot.

966
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,160
Yes.

967
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,240
Well, now, you know, the term pink boy,

968
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,500
used as a derogatory term for humans,

969
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:19,000
does not refer to their color so much as the color of their soul.

970
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,820
Yes, well, that's the whole thing.

971
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,760
They've tried to inject this pink even into boys.

972
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,760
Oh, well, it's just the entire culture is permeated with...

973
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,580
It's permeated with it, yeah.

974
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:33,560
...with the most vomitingly mediocre pinkfulness.

975
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,600
We went to the Tarjay store.

976
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,360
Right.

977
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,060
In our neighborhood.

978
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:43,860
They had a special sale this winter on polar fleece blankets for, like, $9.

979
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,780
These enormous...

980
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,780
You were being fleeced.

981
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,860
...15-foot by 15-foot blankets.

982
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,160
But, of course, by the time the subgeniuses got there,

983
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,240
after, you know, 6 in the morning when all the normals were there,

984
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,940
when we got there at regular old good old subgenius time after having a, you know, a coffee...

985
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,640
Oh, three, a few minutes before midnight.

986
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,940
...the only blankets they would give us...

987
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,600
...were pink.

988
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,800
An instant.

989
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:06,860
...and bright.

990
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,060
Yes.

991
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,060


992
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,060


993
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,340
White, bright pink.

994
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,580
This is in the coldest of winter.

995
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,540
Subgenius, take these blankets.

996
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,780
Well, luckily...

997
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:14,920
Share a disease.

998
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:20,900
We were able to take the blankets home and run them through our alhemsal remogrifier,

999
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,820
and everything's fine now.

1000
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,160
We're not worried anymore.

1001
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,320
The pink has been rendered completely obtuse.

1002
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,500
Sterilized of pinkness.

1003
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:31,900
Removed.

1004
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,020
Well, not so much removed as...

1005
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,680
Eliminated.

1006
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,480
...made safe.

1007
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,520
Pinkness is what makes white bread white, you might say.

1008
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,020
Yes.

1009
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,420
It's what makes SUVs...

1010
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,200
Attractive to the normals, yeah.

1011
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,780
Yes, but unseemly.

1012
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:57,520
Although, if you have to haul a thousand kids around, it actually makes a lot of sense.

1013
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,860
Yes, well, of course, or like big planks of wood or whatever, if you're actually using...

1014
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:06,000
But no, driving around by yourself all high up on the little marshmallow hand seat,

1015
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,600
because if you've ever...

1016
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,280
Have you ever driven like a Cadillac Escalade?

1017
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,320
I've never driven one, no.

1018
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,600
Or ridden in one?

1019
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,680
It's like you're in a giant marshmallow hand.

1020
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,280
Sounds good.

1021
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:25,220
Way above every pedestrian and other car, and the marshmallow hand carries you wherever you want to go.

1022
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,180
All you have to do is aim it, and you never want to leave the marshmallow hand.

1023
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,740
Life in the marshmallow hand.

1024
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,680
It's always perfect inside this marshmallow hand.

1025
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,460
It makes a two-hour commute more fun than your life at home.

1026
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,000
Yes.

1027
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,500
Or on the job.

1028
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,460
It sounds so cushy.

1029
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,200
But it actually ends up making you more pink.

1030
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,100
Unless, of course, it's run by vegetable oil, but they don't have those yet.

1031
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,560
And it makes your bottom more cushy, too.

1032
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,220
Yes.

1033
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,840
Personally, I believe that every man should have...

1034
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,520
In pink slippers.

1035
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,640
Men, anyway, should have the right to drive anything they want, including military vehicles,

1036
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,440
armies, tanks...

1037
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,780
Oh, yes, I'm not saying that...

1038
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,240
With any sort of weapon on them.

1039
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:02,380
Vehicles are bad.

1040
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:06,360
See, we're against any kind of regulation as being itself.

1041
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,360
And therefore, technically, if you really did want to burn up all the gas in the world

1042
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,680
and pollute everything, then go for it, man.

1043
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,920
It's not going to be around that much longer.

1044
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,900
They're turning this planet back into Mars anyway.

1045
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,700
So, hence the pinkness coming out, at least in the psychic coloring of it.

1046
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:30,520
And why will they have to paint all these army trucks and planes and weapons of death pink?

1047
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,100
Right.

1048
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:31,600
Why?

1049
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,540
Because of the conspiracy.

1050
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,500
Of course.

1051
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,320
Because the true Martian.

1052
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,180
Is the red man.

1053
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,280
But the...

1054
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:38,500
No.

1055
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:44,680
Then there's this watered-down pinkness that has permeated our world, our land.

1056
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,840
Well, some say it's just the amniotic fluid of a retarded god.

1057
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,000
The amniotic brain fluids of a retarded god.

1058
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,720
Wait a second.

1059
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,420
Which it could be.

1060
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,360
Does that mean that pink is just really watered-down red?

1061
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,740
Meaning the commies are in charge?

1062
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,740
No, no, no, no.

1063
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,100
It's not political about that.

1064
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:00,780
Sends it to Harvard.

1065
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:01,500
It's...

1066
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,600
I was reading some...

1067
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,300
The commies did take over disguised as rich Republicans.

1068
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:06,460
That was...

1069
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:06,460


1070
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:06,460


1071
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:06,460


1072
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:06,460


1073
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:06,460


1074
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:06,460


1075
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:06,460


1076
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:06,460


1077
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:06,460


1078
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:06,460


1079
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,920
Like an industrialist disguised as Christians.

1080
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,900
That was Charlie McCarthyism.

1081
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:11,700
Yeah.

1082
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,220
Right.

1083
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:14,720
Puppets.

1084
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,120
But we're all puppets, friends.

1085
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:22,680
Now, some puppets get to manipulate other puppets.

1086
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,920
Are you...

1087
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,600
Is there any...

1088
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,780
Are you pulling anybody's strings?

1089
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,180
Sir, ma'am?

1090
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,500
Brother?

1091
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,000
Sister?

1092
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,500
Think about it.

1093
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,280
But somebody's sure pulling yours.

1094
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,560
We're talking to you.

1095
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,360
That means you're the lowest down on the line of puppets.

1096
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,040
It's puppets.

1097
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,260
It's puppets.

1098
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:36,440
It's puppets.

1099
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:36,440


1100
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,440
Far up as you can see.

1101
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:37,740
Yep.

1102
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,680
We're talking to you.

1103
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,340
At the top, there's some rich men, but they're not really the top.

1104
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:49,320
There's aliens manipulating them as puppets, and those aliens are being manipulated by

1105
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,160
Jehovah One.

1106
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:50,760
Oh, look.

1107
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,420
One's in a bear suit.

1108
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:55,120
And who knows who's throwing food into Jehovah One's fish tank?

1109
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:04,160
Who owns the universal fish tank and feeds the gods like we would feed our fish, and

1110
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,940
the gods don't even know that they're...

1111
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,420
Who is that?

1112
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:09,340
Nothing but fish in somebody else's tank.

1113
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,440
We are the awful issue to those gods.

1114
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,120
I think...

1115
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:15,940
There's just no end to the hierarchy, except that we're at the bottom, so there is an end

1116
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,520
on this end.

1117
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,780
We are the end of the chain.

1118
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:18,180
Maybe the bottom controls the top.

1119
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,800
Say it again, Baz?

1120
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,200
What's that?

1121
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,720
Maybe the bottom controls the top in an endless loop.

1122
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,200
As below, so below.

1123
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,080
The Butans are too damn smart.

1124
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,680
Well, we would hope...

1125
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:34,120
That would be a nice conceit, that somehow it comes full circle.

1126
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,400
But actually, we'd have to...

1127
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:41,520
We'd have to ask the zebra, while he's being consumed by the lion, if the circle of life

1128
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,340
really is all that fair.

1129
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,360
They don't...

1130
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,660
They left that part out of that...

1131
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:51,380
Yeah, they leave a lot out in the nice version of the circle of life.

1132
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,400
In the nice version, it's not a circle jerk at all.

1133
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:00,900
It's an actual ongoing, thought-provoking, well-informed plan for the future.

1134
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:05,900
But for those left behind, it's what I just said, a circle jerk.

1135
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,580
Yeah.

1136
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,260
It's futile.

1137
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,320
It's just futile.

1138
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:09,980
It's futile.

1139
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,580
There's no way out.

1140
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,200
There's no real...

1141
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,040
There's no way out, except for the...

1142
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,740
There's no way out.

1143
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,040
Well, there is.

1144
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,460
There is?

1145
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,040
There is a way out.

1146
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,520
There are several ways out.

1147
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:24,340
For one thing, I'm sure that after 10 or 12 million years, intelligent life on Earth

1148
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:27,060
may become peaceful and slackful on its own.

1149
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:34,780
Then there's the ex-day question, elements from outside coming in to take over their

1150
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,260
property.

1151
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah, man.

1152
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:36,900
What about ex-day?

1153
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,020
Right.

1154
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,840
To live in their skins, to take their shoes and their bowling balls.

1155
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:46,780
And of course, you can always just disappear into your own little world, your little hobby

1156
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:52,460
or your special diet and hide from all the rest, your little special favorite shows or

1157
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:57,020
your favorite websites and just ignore that terrible world around you.

1158
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,180
Eventually, you could be a brain in a jar, hallucinating your whole life.

1159
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,280
And what would be the difference?

1160
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:02,820
3000.

1161
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,320
Just insulate yourself away.

1162
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,860
So long as I have this book, I'll be okay.

1163
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,500
Well, as Joe Cosby said in that book, I like to think that if I was hallucinating

1164
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:17,160
my whole life inside of a jar, I'd hallucinate something where I got laid more often.

1165
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,920
So would he have got laid more often had he been hallucinating in a jar and reading Bob

1166
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,620
Lee or Fonda?

1167
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,840
Probably not.

1168
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,700
No, he'd have nightmares because there's so many cool monster pictures in there.

1169
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,380
There are some sexy pictures.

1170
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,140
The Connie section is really...

1171
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:32,700
Not a sexy nightmare.

1172
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,240
...real sexy.

1173
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,440
And the FROPS section, of course, is probably adults only.

1174
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,120
But then a lot of it is kind of scary.

1175
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,640
It'd be a good one to color.

1176
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:48,800
I wish that they would sell it with crayons so that people who couldn't read would...

1177
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,140
Well, color pages.

1178
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:49,600
Color.

1179
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:50,840
Or Sharpies.

1180
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,860
Right now, a page is shouting at me.

1181
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,540
Could you kill the music one second, please?

1182
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,620
Shut up, pink boy.

1183
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,060
Stop right now.

1184
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:02,120
Too many would-be zealots are still laboring under the impression that this is something...

1185
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:02,120


1186
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:02,120


1187
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:04,500
Some kind of parody of kook religions.

1188
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:10,020
While perhaps having properly grasped the full implications of the faith in Bob, some

1189
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:15,000
are yet prey to all manner of misconceptions about other basic subgenius doctrine.

1190
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,880
We're talking basic here.

1191
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:23,060
For instance, an otherwise ascended subgenius may understand the serious nature of, say,

1192
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:29,480
excremeditation yet still think that the concept of acubating is still simply a joke thrown

1193
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,540
into confused conspiracy censors.

1194
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:39,560
And there is no estimating how many rogue subgeniuses still do not believe in Bob at

1195
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,160
all.

1196
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,280
Bummer, man.

1197
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:42,660
That is...

1198
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,000
Special announcement.

1199
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:43,800
I just had to...

1200
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,200
A positive.

1201
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:50,240
I think I wrote that part myself about 25 years ago.

1202
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,240
But it still rings true.

1203
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,380
And it's never been said on the radio before.

1204
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,280
It still rings true.

1205
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,440
Or maybe it has.

1206
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,500
I think so.

1207
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,660
Long, long, long, long, long time ago.

1208
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,320
Long ago.

1209
00:45:59,320 --> 00:45:59,500
Long ago.

1210
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,720
That describes...

1211
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,620
Oh, it was a little older than Maz is, but not much.

1212
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,440
Wow.

1213
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,660
Okay, it was never said by me on the radio then.

1214
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,760
As a special announcement.

1215
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,480
I've been following Dobbs for...

1216
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,340
Gosh, would it be more than...

1217
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,160
Yeah, now more than half my life.

1218
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,380
Following with a butterfly in my hand.

1219
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,580
Now, but then think of my kids.

1220
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,800
They've been following Bob their entire lives.

1221
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:22,260
Yep.

1222
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,200
Yep, mine too.

1223
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,180
They didn't want to be.

1224
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:24,460
Yeah.

1225
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,980
But they couldn't help it.

1226
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,040
You know, it's just they're always in front of them.

1227
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,620
Wherever they think they're choosing to go, he always happens to be right in front.

1228
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,180
Yep.

1229
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,100
Yep.

1230
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:35,940
Irritating.

1231
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,460
Imagine how I feel.

1232
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:37,880
Frustrating as well.

1233
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,120
I have my boss...

1234
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:44,040
My boss's face is in front of me all the time, even at night when I close my eyes.

1235
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:44,600
Then you...

1236
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:48,400
And Dobbs' head glowing and smiling, grinning.

1237
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,860
And your nose in his butt at all times.

1238
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,720
Now that is really horrifying.

1239
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:57,640
Well, look, if I want to get that raise, I'm going to have to, you know, do what it

1240
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:57,940
takes.

1241
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,000
You get a raise out of that?

1242
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,740
I think, you know, the Reverend Baz represents your retirement plan.

1243
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,480
Right.

1244
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:04,900
Right.

1245
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:11,500
My nose and Bob's deep up, kissing Bob's nipple is my retirement plan.

1246
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,480
And the children will be able to take over and make everything right and fix all the

1247
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:15,860
problems.

1248
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,080
Thank goodness.

1249
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,980
The problems are created in me.

1250
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,160
That's what...

1251
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:26,020
You know, when I remember, Baz, when I was your age, I thought to myself, God, that older

1252
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,520
generation.

1253
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:27,680
They're so wasteful.

1254
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,880
They've just wrecked the world for us.

1255
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:37,460
There were twice as many of us, that generation, who actually proceeded to go ahead and wreck

1256
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,220
it even further.

1257
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:42,700
We knew better, and yet we went ahead and wrecked on any...

1258
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:49,800
Well, we recycled a few bottles and, you know, we let it mellow, but...

1259
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:53,580
We let it age like a genie's drool cup.

1260
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,960
We allowed it to...

1261
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,360
But we still drove to work!

1262
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,120
We sinned.

1263
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,560
We sinned against Slack.

1264
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,320
Well, we had to.

1265
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,220
I mean, the car was...

1266
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,060
I mean, the bus wasn't working that night and...

1267
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:08,040
And now your people, your generation's gonna have to diaper us, and I'm sorry.

1268
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,920
I'm saying it now before the Alzheimer's sets in.

1269
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,460
If they could only diaper us with Slack.

1270
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,580
But they're gonna get it right, see?

1271
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:17,740
That's what the sky meant this morning.

1272
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:17,760
Yeah, see?

1273
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,240
One of these days, these kids are gonna get it right.

1274
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:19,900
When I saw the sky...

1275
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:20,140
See?

1276
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,740
I can see it.

1277
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:22,680
It's on the horizon right now.

1278
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,000
I have thousands of millions of these kids, and they're all...

1279
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,020
They will hallucinate.

1280
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,420
They will hallucinate life where they get laid more.

1281
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,380
Well, in that jar.

1282
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:37,980
My worry is that so many of the youth seem to truly be living in the Matrix and liking

1283
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:38,200
it.

1284
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:43,640
I mean, the television shows are more real to some of these subgeniuses than their own

1285
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,340
lives are.

1286
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,540
That scares me.

1287
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,020
What the sovereigns tell no less.

1288
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,560
What everybody knows is what's really real is sci-fi novels.

1289
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,740
Well, the subgenius...

1290
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:54,240
You can spot the subgenius kids, because they're the ones reading books.

1291
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,360
Books?

1292
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:55,960
Books.

1293
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:56,280
Books.

1294
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,480
Or at least staring vacantly at them because of the subliminal messages.

1295
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,480
And also, you know, doing internet stuff or whatever.

1296
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,920
But I've spotted them.

1297
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:03,580
They read books.

1298
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:08,280
Science fiction books and other books and philosophy and all kinds of...

1299
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:08,760
Oh, God.

1300
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,560
I mean, voluntarily.

1301
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,240
Not just the ones, you know, from school.

1302
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,160
We don't want people to argue with Bob, though.

1303
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:13,860
All kinds of things.

1304
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,860
The weekly world news.

1305
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,580
But they read.

1306
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,700
They actually read words.

1307
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,820
On the other hand, look what reading did to us.

1308
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,000
It made us do this radio show.

1309
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,200
We just produced this book.

1310
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:23,700
It caused delusions on the brain.

1311
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:24,280
Yeah.

1312
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,000
Hey, down at the back of that book, there's a book called...

1313
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,280
Oh, yeah.

1314
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,500
...a picture of this room with Dave in it and Paul Krasner, I think.

1315
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:38,800
And there's also a lovely photograph of Dr. Philo Drummond with a microphone in his ear.

1316
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:39,140
Yes.

1317
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,240
Is that his ear?

1318
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,180
Yeah, that's the room.

1319
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:41,820
Now, that looks like a full-on beauty.

1320
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,620
There's a picture of the room we are in.

1321
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:43,880
I took that picture.

1322
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,920
You will actually see...

1323
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:50,100
If you buy this book when it comes out in October or so, you will actually see pictures

1324
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,880
of the inside of your radio right now.

1325
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,820
I can't believe it.

1326
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,460
You're lying.

1327
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,160
It's clever looking, isn't it?

1328
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,320
Actually, the little men inside the radio are finally...

1329
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,580
After what?

1330
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,220
The radio first emerged around 1912, 1915 as a public thing.

1331
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,680
Man in the box, let me in.

1332
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,900
Finally, you can see the little men inside.

1333
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
...the mysteries revealed...

1334
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,100
And they look just like Reverend Stang.

1335
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:11,920
...unfurled for you.

1336
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:15,240
And Philo Drummond and Cowboy Dave and Paul Krasner.

1337
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:19,880
Yeah, Paul Krasner, of course, is on the subgenius shows every other week.

1338
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:24,580
Can we mention that the art in this book is so exciting that I've already had a pre-ejaculatory

1339
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:25,980
state three times in a row?

1340
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,840
And I'm convinced otherwise?

1341
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,200
You actually see puzzling evidence.

1342
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,520
You actually see Dr. Gary Gebrogfran.

1343
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:37,860
You actually see Dr. Hal Robbins for the first time ever.

1344
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:38,140
Well, no.

1345
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:38,360
Yeah.

1346
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,380
Actually, that's them about 25 years ago.

1347
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,320
Handsome, weren't they?

1348
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:42,860
Yep.

1349
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,780
You'd never think it to look at them now.

1350
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,400
So were we all.

1351
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,260
Put faces on those voices you've heard so long.

1352
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:50,780
There's a lot.

1353
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:51,980
Yes.

1354
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,840
Some of us subgeniuses have known each other for a long time.

1355
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:59,480
I believe, Bleepo, that you and I met in the early 80s, 81 or so.

1356
00:50:59,560 --> 00:50:59,780
Yes, in Chicago.

1357
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:06,040
I first talked to you when I saw the Weirdo magazine article about the subgeniuses written

1358
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,620
by Jay Kinney, I think it was.

1359
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,180
No.

1360
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,460
No, not Jay Kinney.

1361
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:09,620
No.

1362
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:09,660
No.

1363
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,200
We...

1364
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:18,700
Jay Kinney wrote the one in Whole Earth Review, and Robert Crumb reprinted the subgenius pamphlets

1365
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,300
in the first issue of Weirdo.

1366
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,160
Oh, maybe that was it.

1367
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,460
And that was how the comic book readers...

1368
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:24,760
Right.

1369
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:24,820
Yeah.

1370
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,780
That's how it came unto Bob in the 80s.

1371
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,420
And then I wrote to you.

1372
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,100
I was working at a Boston radio station, and I wrote to you, because I was in the news

1373
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,560
department, supposed to put together a little intern news reports.

1374
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:32,760
That's right.

1375
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,580
You were going to cover a sci-fi convention that was next door.

1376
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:41,460
And I asked you if you subgenius guys did radio, sort of like, because I saw that you

1377
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:45,440
did print stuff really well, and I figured you probably did collage.

1378
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,420
But I didn't know you were that same...

1379
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:47,720
Never mind.

1380
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,260
I won't go into that.

1381
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,100
But anyway, so yeah.

1382
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,500
So I asked you if you did radio, and you said, sure, we do radio.

1383
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,760
And that's how you talked to me.

1384
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,120
Put your hands on the radio.

1385
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:05,060
And so I did a phone interview with you, and then you invited me to see you in Chicago.

1386
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:11,700
So I used the science fiction convention as an excuse to actually go see you.

1387
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:13,400
I was much more interested in going to see you.

1388
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:17,980
And I think I got the radio station to somehow kick in a nickel or two to send me there and

1389
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:18,180
back.

1390
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,200
And then I met you and all those mutants.

1391
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:22,760
I met the...

1392
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,980
There were a lot of strange mutants.

1393
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,300
Philo was there, and of course the great Jane Orr hyperclites.

1394
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:28,880
That's right.

1395
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,720
Jane Orr, that's where the classic line came from.

1396
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:37,020
They told me my mind was in this jar, and then they poured it down the sink.

1397
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,220
And that's been...

1398
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,000
That's how the church works, man.

1399
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,440
At its best.

1400
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:42,960
Yeah.

1401
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,180
Actually, and then others who became rich and famous.

1402
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,580
Strangely content.

1403
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,060
Sterno is rich and famous.

1404
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,700
But still a zombie though, isn't that correct?

1405
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:51,760
I mean, as far as the blood thing...

1406
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,740
Yeah, he still walked shuffling and walking.

1407
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:56,080
I'm now the least known famous person in New York City.

1408
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:57,380
You are now currently?

1409
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,220
Yeah, currently.

1410
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,440
Did they honor you in any way?

1411
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:02,460
I remember at Burl Hall in Brooklyn they said they were gonna have a celebration.

1412
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:06,880
They said they would put two bullets between your breasts if they had any or something.

1413
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:07,780
Something like that, yes.

1414
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,480
And then elected you the new...

1415
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:09,820
Yeah.

1416
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:11,480
That's all right.

1417
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:12,500
This will be a long one.

1418
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:14,100
That's what all the girls say.

1419
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,300
Well, we started a couple of minutes early, actually.

1420
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,200
So, yeah, it is a long one.

1421
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:20,940
Oh, man.

1422
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:22,720
Well, at least we've taken off.

1423
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:28,540
We've gone most of the saligubris and salient parts of this epic novel.

1424
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,120
Well, it's not really a novel per se.

1425
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,300
No, actually, we didn't even get into the heavy stuff.

1426
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,900
The first half of it is Bob and Connie.

1427
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,080
You know, everybody loves those two great characters.

1428
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:39,720
Oh, God.

1429
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,580
Love, love gods.

1430
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,620
Oh, that show of theirs.

1431
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:47,960
But then there are two chapters about the conspiracy and how to deal with it.

1432
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,740
Then there's an explanation.

1433
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:58,140
An explanation of X-Day and what really happened with naked pictures of me, by the way, back

1434
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,740
when I was sort of slim.

1435
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:03,120
Can you explain what's funny about each and every one of those pictures?

1436
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:03,900
Yes, I can, actually.

1437
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,700
On the stand.

1438
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,940
I could do it on the stand.

1439
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:11,180
I could do it to Judge Punch or Judge Judy or any of those puppets.

1440
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:21,140
And then it becomes even more serious because it tackles the subject of true slack and subicide.

1441
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:21,720
Oh, yeah.

1442
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:21,720


1443
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:29,120
I mean, the urge of so many lonely subgeniuses to jump off a bridge or off of an overpass

1444
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,800
into an oncoming car while wearing a Dobbs shirt and videotaping it.

1445
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,060
No.

1446
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,080
But we don't encourage that.

1447
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:41,320
And in fact, there's a whole quite touching chapter that will touch you there about why

1448
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,360
you really should leave it up to Bob.

1449
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,580
He's going to do it anyway.

1450
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,680
He's going to kill you anyway.

1451
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,720
Let the professionals do it.

1452
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,020
You're an amateur at suicide by definition.

1453
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:51,720
Yeah.

1454
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,180
There are no professionals at it except Bob.

1455
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,760
And he's going to, him or God, are going to get you in the end.

1456
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,040
So what's your hurry?

1457
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:02,980
That's our point.

1458
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,220
You don't know what's going to happen.

1459
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,020
If you're depressed, you think it's always going to be terrible.

1460
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:07,800
But you're crazy.

1461
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:08,280
You're wrong.

1462
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,120
You don't know.

1463
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,240
You might be sane tomorrow and everything will be cool.

1464
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:16,820
And you get to exercise, as it says here in the book from the 1959 Bobco board meeting,

1465
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,500
Bob will ask you to exercise glands you never knew existed.

1466
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:21,720
That's right.

1467
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:26,700
Now, do you have to know them in any sort of, do you have to know these glands?

1468
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,320
You'll learn those.

1469
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:32,920
You will intuit the existence of those new glands when you thumb through the book.

1470
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,440
Actually, if you notice, if you look at the animated right-hand page, have you noticed

1471
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:44,760
that there is a tiny Muta Bob image on the right-hand bottom, no, left-hand corner of

1472
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,560
every spread, every single page in there, so that you can flip it like an animated flip-it

1473
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,140
book, like a little movie.

1474
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:51,600
Oh, wow.

1475
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:56,500
I don't know if anybody noticed that we did that on Book of the Subgenius as well, but

1476
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:56,940
this time.

1477
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,900
If you do it fast enough, do you hear Walt Disney's voice?

1478
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,400
Yeah, you will start to, it will make, well, there's all kinds of effects that happen.

1479
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:08,500
If you put it in front of a barcode reader and flip it, you get a little computer game,

1480
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,080
if you can load it into your computer.

1481
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,520
Just a game you don't win any sort of credit or money.

1482
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:11,520


1483
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:11,940
It's a real sim.

1484
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:15,640
It only runs on a VIC-20 or an Atari or something, but it's cool.

1485
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,560
It's like Pong.

1486
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,780
And I've heard that if you actually, if you cut the book up and then arrange the

1487
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,100
little pictures in the right combination.

1488
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,260
Well, let's not go into that on the radio.

1489
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:29,360
It's unlikely that anybody's going to find the right combination.

1490
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,620
Should we warn people or?

1491
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,060
I hope not.

1492
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:37,340
Well, it's like casting a spell or a curse in some of the simple religions, you know.

1493
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,780
We don't want to get them started on that, though.

1494
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:43,160
Did you see the skin crawl that ran under?

1495
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,600
There was some sort of skin crawl.

1496
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,540
Oh, we caught it.

1497
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:46,540


1498
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,420
We found one of those in our bathroom today.

1499
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:49,560
Oh, yeah?

1500
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:49,700
Just one?

1501
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,080
We think she brought it back from Brushwood.

1502
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:52,680
Little skin crawlers, yeah.

1503
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,320
Yeah, yeah.

1504
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:57,820
Because if she didn't bring it back from Brushwood, she was at Brushwood this weekend singing,

1505
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:05,140
and if she didn't bring that thing back, that means our house is infested with skin crawlers.

1506
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,580
This was the kind with the flat tail, with the forks on the end.

1507
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,940
It's about six inches long.

1508
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,260
With like a jillion legs.

1509
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:12,880
Right.

1510
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,220
Did you learn anything from it?

1511
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,800
I mean, for crying out loud, you at least interrogated it.

1512
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,360
I didn't leave.

1513
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:16,540
I didn't leave.

1514
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,940
I didn't leave it in me long enough.

1515
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:18,840
I mean, you didn't just, well.

1516
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:19,520
I didn't.

1517
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:22,800
If you leave them, you have to leave them in you for a while to learn anything.

1518
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,140
For them to tell you this.

1519
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,160
You know, some people can get these things out of them without, you know, I'm sorry,

1520
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:28,680
I just didn't.

1521
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,680
I don't, look, I just, they give me the creeps.

1522
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,220
They make my skin crawl, you might say.

1523
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:35,460
Yeah, but imagine attaching a little electrode to one of them there.

1524
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,440
To interject some humor into the proceedings.

1525
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,480
Watching it jump, you know?

1526
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:44,500
Or just poking it with the end of a match head.

1527
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,540
Did you realize that because his soul was in it, it was in the end of a match head?

1528
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:46,540


1529
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,080
The soul was banned from both hell and heaven.

1530
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,500
Bob cannot die.

1531
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:51,640
That's the reason?

1532
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:52,600
I didn't know that.

1533
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:52,940
I didn't know that.

1534
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,180
To this day, we constantly find this spoiler.

1535
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,680
Actually, actually, if you had read your Revelation X, you would know that.

1536
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,200
Oh, I might have read that.

1537
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,400
That's a repeat from old doctrine.

1538
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:02,820
Oh, okay, forget it.

1539
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,260
You can't.

1540
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:03,600
Okay.

1541
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:04,540
Yeah, faithless.

1542
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:05,120
Hey, listen.

1543
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:05,760
The show's over.

1544
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:09,500
I have a, yeah, well, we don't know what's going to happen next, but I'm going

1545
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:15,720
to put on this amazing pre-recorded material from, well, the Buchanan brothers were singing

1546
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,140
in that Flying Saucers song, and I may continue that.

1547
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:22,020
These collages, of course, are by the great Fernanda Nanny Leamer.

1548
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:26,880
Oh, no, we're going to get into a section by Phineas Narco of National Cynical Radio,

1549
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:30,920
and I will, if nothing else, change the CD.

1550
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:31,420
Thank you.

1551
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:36,900
Many people think the saucers might be someone's foolish dreams.

1552
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,640
Or maybe they were sent down here from Mars.

1553
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,700
If you'll just stop and think you'd realize just what a fool they are.

1554
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:45,700


1555
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:45,700


1556
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:45,700


1557
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:45,700


1558
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:45,700


1559
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:45,700


1560
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:45,700


1561
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:45,700


1562
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:45,700


1563
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:45,700


1564
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:45,700


1565
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:49,780
Oh, it means they're more than atom bombs or falling stars.

1566
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:56,900
And though the war may be through, there's unrest and trouble brewing, and those flying

1567
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:05,000
saucers may be just a sign that if peace doesn't come, it will be the end of some.

1568
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,480
So repent today.

1569
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,440
We're running out of time.

1570
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:15,680
When you see a saucer fly like a comet through the sky, you should realize that it's not

1571
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:15,680


1572
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,660
worth the price you'll have to pay.

1573
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:23,860
You'd better pray to the Lord when you see those flying saucers.

1574
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:27,580
It may be the coming of the judgment day.
