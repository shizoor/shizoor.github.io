1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
From PR News in Washington, I'm not as bad as initially thought.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,120
The Ford Motor Company is bombing London.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,360
PR's bad.

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,780
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned of painful free abortions.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,240
Greenspan could happen gradually and with much disruption,

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,080
although it might mean lower asses and a disturbing time.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,660
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's bad.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,300
Greenspan could be quite painful for the pernicious world economy.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,460
Greenspan tackling morons from Washington.

10
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,720
PR's bad.

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,540
Also, the government says this is PR News.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:34,880
Hi.

13
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:35,860
Hi.

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,020
Where is it?

15
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:38,840
Where's what?

16
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,080
This is a genius toy off-snack.

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,540
Boy, that's neat.

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:43,880
Yes.

19
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,160
All right, children, you may go.

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,120
Yep, yep, yep.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,060
Dairy Queen has legs.

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,180
This is so little and so silly,

23
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,440
but I thought it was...

24
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:58,840
It was funny.

25
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,440
Someone in the third world.

26
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,180
Big.

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:01,680
Big.

28
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:02,800
Powerful.

29
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,660
He fabricated a scam.

30
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,820
Fast cars and loose slots.

31
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,600
Okay.

32
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,200
The Church of Fast Cars and Loose Slots.

33
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,380
Very superficial.

34
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,480
There's all kinds of drugs and filth and perversion.

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,780
All about Dobbs.

36
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,100
Dobbs out of control.

37
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,560
Sick, sick, sick, evil.

38
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,900
That's what Dobbs is saying.

39
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,500
You gotta let people know.

40
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,500
Right?

41
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,100
A little bit.

42
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:23,980
Kill judges.

43
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,480
Fix the judiciary.

44
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,740
I'm curious.

45
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,020
Considered a crank.

46
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,020
Cranked by a lot of people.

47
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,860
How absurd.

48
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,060
And this is common.

49
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:32,980
Murdered.

50
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,260
Steal.

51
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:33,960
Committed adultery.

52
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,100
So here's how I'm sexual.

53
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,680
Just tweak it a little.

54
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,100
Twist.

55
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,040
One hour.

56
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,060
Big bone.

57
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,780
It was in her hand.

58
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,720
So wouldn't that be neat?

59
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,980
That makes you a queen.

60
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:44,660
Eh.

61
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,720
Send a check.

62
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,880
Thanks, Bob.

63
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,240
Uh, Bob, how are you?

64
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,660
Welcome aboard.

65
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,000
I do have a problem with discipline.

66
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,160
Um, Bob, use physical discipline.

67
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,000
I believe...

68
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,820
Believe in discipline.

69
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,460
Be spanked with a wooden paddle.

70
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,960
Spanked with a wooden paddle.

71
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,500
Do it.

72
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,000
Do it.

73
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,340
Um, um, if it was administered properly,

74
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,840
then serious, serious marks on our buttocks and elsewhere

75
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,080
from 12 severe whacks.

76
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,220
Whack, whack, whack.

77
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,580
Sean, we should do this.

78
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,900
Are there broken bones, lacerations?

79
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,060
What about welts?

80
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,240
What about 12 welts?

81
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,340
Okay.

82
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,880
Using a paddle or a strap or a switch on the backside.

83
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,240
Good spanking.

84
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,460
Well, my, look, my, my...

85
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,180
Spanking.

86
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,060
We are losing.

87
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,980
Good spanking.

88
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,220
Well, my, look, my, my...

89
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,800
Your hands are made for loving, cuddling.

90
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,780
There's so many other techniques.

91
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,760
Spank me.

92
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,620
Spank me.

93
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:38,840
Firmly.

94
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,040
We love the rods.

95
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,100
It hurt.

96
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,080
Spanking.

97
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,300
Despise the government.

98
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,960
Degenerating into an animal without the ability to see or hear or speak.

99
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,960
Thank you, Bob.

100
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,600
Thank you, Bob.

101
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,340
Thank you, Bob.

102
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:03,220
There she sat with a very happy look on her face.

103
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:10,540
The same look she had the night before.

104
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,000
The same look he tried to overlook at the bar.

105
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,380
Now he had to try to get her out of his place.

106
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,560
But there she sat

107
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,800
with a very happy look on her face.

108
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,260
It was late last night in the red bar light

109
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,500
and she looked all right.

110
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,700
Oh, no.

111
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,900
She had a slutty kind of appeal

112
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,400
and there was definitely something to her.

113
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,780
And you could think of friends of yours

114
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,940
who if you knew if they could, they would do her.

115
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,880
She had a dirty sock kind of appeal.

116
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,580
Oh, God, no.

117
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,360
You shower one time, you still smell her.

118
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,700
You shower two times, you still smell her.

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,600
You smell her nipples on your breath

120
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,120
and all the rest of your friends watched you leave together

121
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,560
so they know.

122
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,540
And your bedsheets.

123
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,740
My God, her smell is in your bedsheets.

124
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,540
A scent that no amount of detergent

125
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,820
can dislodge and your pillow stinks too.

126
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,460
Oh, my God.

127
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,020
Oh, my God.

128
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,040
It's time to go

129
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,660
to Billy's Pinkfuck Gazebo

130
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,280
where the loathsome men go.

131
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:09,480
Oh, my God.

132
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,200
And you can have a cup of Joe

133
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,060
at Billy's Pinkfuck Gazebo.

134
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,780
Oh!

135
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,360
Oh!

136
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,600
Oh!

137
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,020
Oh!

138
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,500
Oh!

139
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:50,960
Oh!

140
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,980
Oh!

141
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,400


142
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:54,400


143
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,660
Yeah.

144
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:11,360
Thanks, Bob.

145
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,920
And thanks, Norell Preff, who did that,

146
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,220
and who disciplined Bob there at the beginning.

147
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,220
Lee Murr did the startups.

148
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,060
There have been and there will be

149
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,940
Dr. Philo Drummond, Puzzling Evidence,

150
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,800
Dr. Howell, Michael Pepe,

151
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,420
yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

152
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,820
and so much more on KPFA,

153
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,000
Over the Edge, blah, blah, blah,

154
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,340
the Puzzling Evidence show, friends.

155
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,200
And that song that we just heard,

156
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,420
Billy's, is by The Billy Nayer Show.

157
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:49,320
More of all coming up on this hour of Slight Number 1028.

158
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,660
But now...

159
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,780
From PR News in Washington,

160
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,200
and for regular Oklahoma.

161
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,460
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld today

162
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,100
blew himself up at a shopping mall in Honolulu.

163
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,520
The United Nations is getting worse.

164
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,700
It's infected with HIV than any single year.

165
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,880
Federal officials might unfold in the United States.

166
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,240
PR knocks that story.

167
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,440
A federally financed study might enter the United States.

168
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,500
The study would leak into the country

169
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,360
despite efforts to screen travelers for PR news.

170
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,140
On Wall Street, 310-83-56221.

171
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,620
Europeans have raised alarm that Europe would be detrimental to the United States.

172
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,560
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice issued her defense

173
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,640
of the way the U.S. treats secret PR news in Washington.

174
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,780
I want to teleport.

175
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,460
You want to teleport? I think that's a different show.

176
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,000
And not the mafia.

177
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,900
I want to teleport.

178
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,720
Who was it and not the mafia? What?

179
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,880
It was you and me.

180
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,340
Who was it and not the mafia?

181
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,760
As soon as you get through, monger.

182
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,280
Monger.

183
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,020
Jack Ruby?

184
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,660
Jack Ruby was well aware, had mafia connections.

185
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,300
And the cool thing is the city had those lit corners.

186
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,680
So they had lights, I guess, at one time in the corners of the streets.

187
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,700
Jack Ruby worked for the mafia his whole life.

188
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,680
But a long time ago, the city had stopped putting lights in the corners.

189
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:12,200
So they were these cool pillboxes-like things.

190
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,540
A mafia home?

191
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,080
But they had the best killers, and the CIA tried to use them.

192
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,900
They were professional.

193
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,480
We always brought up their professional life.

194
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,580
They got into trouble over Mabute.

195
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,760
What was his name, Neil?

196
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,240
The African, uh, La Mamba.

197
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,040
And these were Mamba.

198
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,340
They handed him over to the Congo.

199
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,420
Mamba.

200
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,260
Mamba.

201
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,120
Mamba.

202
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:43,360
But Sidney, Dr. Sidney Gottlieb had got his poison ready and had it all, you know, set out in his insane laboratory in Virginia.

203
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,780
And, uh, it almost, I think it made it there and they didn't use it and they sent it back.

204
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,740
I discovered a garrison didn't know.

205
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,160
Okay.

206
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:51,620
No!

207
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,020


208
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:52,740
No!

209
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:52,740


210
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,840
Do we still have that sample in the, uh, in the warehouse?

211
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,340
Yeah, you can't use it.

212
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:56,860
It's a dead...

213
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,640
Oh, we used it.

214
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,500
It's a dead...

215
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,000
It's a dead...

216
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,400
No, no.

217
00:08:59,540 --> 00:08:59,720
I can't use it yet.

218
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,020
I can't use it yet.

219
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,960
I was talking to this microphone.

220
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,100
Can we...

221
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,180
It's a storm of lies.

222
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:01,320
I know.

223
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,800
Can we...

224
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,400
Can we still use it or is it, uh, a dead sample?

225
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,960
Uh, I, I think it's a dead sample.

226
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,320
Dead.

227
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,540
Oh, yeah.

228
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,160
Unfortunately, he destroyed, uh, I don't know, Gottlieb's lab, I think.

229
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,540
You're out of power.

230
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,020
You know, but he was Strangelove.

231
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,220
We'll be, we'll be wanting to use that sample before the end of the show.

232
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,000
Uh, exactly.

233
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,720
A blizzard of lies.

234
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,400
A hurricane of lies.

235
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,500
To make good on our promises.

236
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,920
Yeah, lies, I'm sorry, lies is not here.

237
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,440
You're living in every day.

238
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:22,740
Well, I'm here.

239
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,240
Uh...

240
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,320
Yeah.

241
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,520
What did I miss?

242
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:24,880
Everything?

243
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
They must have a lab that has a new weapon.

244
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,800
Well, we're trying to get serious about this business thing because we want to get this done before 5 AM.

245
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,800
Our time.

246
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,540
If you're really creative and you go into weapons...

247
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,460
Yeah, because it's like three hours in the future in Cleveland.

248
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:36,820
Right.

249
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,820
It's, the end of the world's already happened there.

250
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,280
Right.

251
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,000
But if we keep running ahead of the explosion, we can...

252
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,840
We can never be in the end of the world.

253
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,500
We'll never, and our show will never stop.

254
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:45,780
Yeah.

255
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,380
Which it doesn't anyway, because it is eternal.

256
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,320
Yeah.

257
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,840
And, uh...

258
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,100
We're sort of working on a, on a thing similar to Mayan time.

259
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,740
It's an eternal show, folks.

260
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,740
We don't go off the air like normal mortal shows.

261
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,240
We go off all night long.

262
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,680
I thought it was Australian, aboriginal talk.

263
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,960
We don't have to have a job.

264
00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,860
We don't have to talk.

265
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,640
We don't have to, uh, talk.

266
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,440
Um, the guys that live out by the NASA thing.

267
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,540
If you support us...

268
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,100
And the fire goes in the sky and they talk about how they can travel.

269
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,540
Michael Heffi is now broken.

270
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,920
You know, I am...

271
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,860
I don't like to talk about that.

272
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,740
Teleporting thing.

273
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,780
That confuses people.

274
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:13,980
Uh, he's not here officially.

275
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,940
Okay, we're off the air now.

276
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,780
Oh, let's call him.

277
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,060
We have to be as soon as they say that we're dead.

278
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,100
Okay, guys.

279
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,860
We're off the air now.

280
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,300
Off the air.

281
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:20,960
Okay, let's go.

282
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,280
Out of the pool.

283
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,420
Everybody out of the pool.

284
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,380
Back into the business meeting.

285
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,140
Get back into that business meeting.

286
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,440
That sounds like the kind of line of meeting call.

287
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:30,720
Yeah, that's right.

288
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,780
Into your, uh...

289
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,180
You're supposed to be reading those line items.

290
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,040
I know.

291
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,400
We gotta start at that page 13 of the budget.

292
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,840
Did any of you guys, uh, turn in the, uh, federal employees?

293
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,420
Uh...

294
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,780
I turned in the sensitive language forms.

295
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,220
That's my job.

296
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,100
I think, you know, I think those were...

297
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,660
That's all you did?

298
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,200
Well, and the indecency signature form.

299
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,400
I turned in my neighbor.

300
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:51,880
Along with the...

301
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,500
Giveaway forms.

302
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,960
Are you gonna...

303
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,340
Emergency on air studio import form.

304
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,000
Didn't we roll something in that form?

305
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,520
River Stang, do you open yourselves up to these government agencies?

306
00:10:59,760 --> 00:10:59,960
Come on.

307
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,480
I turned in the clock watching form.

308
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:02,480


309
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:02,960
Oh, the...

310
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,300
The highly colorful magazine.

311
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,360
In the interest of sunshine and...

312
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,380
You colorful, colorful...

313
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:11,680
Some of those government agencies you're talking about are subdivisions of Bobco.

314
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:11,840
I mean, I...

315
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:11,840


316
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:11,840


317
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:11,840


318
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:11,840


319
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,740
Say something, caller.

320
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,680
But Bobco itself is a subdivision of some of the other federal agencies.

321
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,080
Bobco?

322
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,060
Oh, I see.

323
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,700
I see.

324
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,340
There's a caller.

325
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,620
Where are you from, caller?

326
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,600
...form itself in a light egg batter and then some cornmeal...

327
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,420
Whatcha doing over there in Fresno, caller?

328
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,160
Yeah, you can do that.

329
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,580
This is like, uh...

330
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,000
Fresno's a negative name.

331
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,360
Bob Tortillas?

332
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,360


333
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,600
Serve warm.

334
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,540
That's a positive name.

335
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,360
Fresno...

336
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,140
They take little birds...

337
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,780
Fresno...

338
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,260
Picture dark nudity on...

339
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,020
Uh, no.

340
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,840
We shouldn't talk about that because he knows that's a negative name.

341
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:41,840


342
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:41,840


343
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:47,000
The only one who's listening right now is Reverend Howell, a 420 guy and not K-Rock.

344
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,020
Where is Reverend Howell?

345
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,660
Reverend Howell?

346
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,540
He's in a car right now in the horrible traffic that always occurs at 2-3 in the morning.

347
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,420
Howell, come back to us, Howell.

348
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,260
Is this denated for four hours?

349
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,980
Just as he walks out his door.

350
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,400
Good morning, Howell.

351
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,160
They're trying to prevent him from being on the show because...

352
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,300
Suddenly traffic piles up from his door all the way to the station and then evaporates

353
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,020
as soon as they arrive.

354
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,420
...the roadblock.

355
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:04,420


356
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:04,440
...he's going to...

357
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,120
...a knuckle walk...

358
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,720
...a knuckle walk...

359
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,880
...a silverback knuckle walk...

360
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,040
Michael Pepe's taking your space, Howell.

361
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,760
Oh, no.

362
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,540
...the nakedness.

363
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,320
He took all of your words and changed them to him.

364
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,040
Yes, well...

365
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,000
But it's a naked Michael Pepe versus a clothed Howell.

366
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,220
Exactly.

367
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,180
Yeah, I'm the way that...

368
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,960
Old six-eyes.

369
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,420
...I want you to think Howell is or should be.

370
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,480
...is defended and foisted upon the people...

371
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:24,740
Exactly.

372
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,120
That's what I try to do.

373
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,080
No foisting zone, please.

374
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,980
...no foisting.

375
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,600
Just...

376
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,860
Hey, please foist behind the building.

377
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,500
...because, you know, just in order to warp your brain to that extent, it needs no explanation.

378
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,260
Why wouldn't someone want to warp your brain?

379
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,520
It's so...

380
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,980
It's so easy after all, isn't it, folks?

381
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,240
...in our society.

382
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,400
Well, it's kind of constantly happening...

383
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:45,680
Yeah, anyway...

384
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,780
...and plus you warp your own brain...

385
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:47,980
Right.

386
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,860
...if you're...

387
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:49,880
You really don't...

388
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,260
...alive.

389
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:51,800
Yeah.

390
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,320
...that only describes less than half of the people.

391
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,060
That's right.

392
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,580
That's right.

393
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,140
People, yeah.

394
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,420
Oh, people, sure.

395
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:58,840
Sure.

396
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,520
But this, this...

397
00:12:59,520 --> 00:12:59,520


398
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,180
People, listening to this...

399
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,600
Soil and grain is people.

400
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,380
That's our audience.

401
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,300
Soil and grain is people, right?

402
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,380
Soil and grain, yeah, sure.

403
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:04,960
Yeah, sure.

404
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,660
People, yeah.

405
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,880
But this...

406
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:18,600
...is the worst load of ludicrous crap I have ever heard.

407
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:18,820
...soil and grain was an inspiration to the church.

408
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,800
You know, that was the first caller to the first subgenius radio show.

409
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,280
Yeah.

410
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,940
The first appearance...

411
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,020
That's why we honor him.

412
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,220
...subgenius anywhere...

413
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:26,400
...soil and grain is...

414
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,040
...by remembering him.

415
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,820
...and that was the response.

416
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,180
Yep, people, yeah.

417
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:29,820
People, sure.

418
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,220
Sure.

419
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,160
But this...

420
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,980
This is the sickest thing I have heard on KFJZ.

421
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,560
Mr. Pridgen?

422
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,580
Yes.

423
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,440
Let me say this.

424
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,520
Can I say something for just about a half a minute?

425
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:40,520


426
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:40,520


427
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:40,520


428
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:40,520


429
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,220
You bet.

430
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,940
Go right ahead.

431
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,020
It's a free country for a little while.

432
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:45,940
I...

433
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:52,760
As high a regard as I have had for KFJZ and even when the...

434
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,120
Oh, what's the name?

435
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,880
Otis is on.

436
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,200
Yes, sir.

437
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:56,940
All that stuff.

438
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:03,060
I think this is about the sickest, sickest, sickest thing I've ever heard on KFJZ and

439
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,400
since I've been listening to it.

440
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,300
I'm just...

441
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,260
I am thoroughly ashamed of KFJZ right now.

442
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,500
I don't...

443
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:10,500


444
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:10,500


445
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:10,500


446
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:10,500


447
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:10,500


448
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:10,500


449
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:10,500


450
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:10,500


451
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:10,500


452
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:10,500


453
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:10,500


454
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:10,500


455
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:11,940
I don't know what to say.

456
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:11,940


457
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,680
You know, I'm getting strong trance indications from this man that he was the high liar of

458
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,940
Baghdad at one time.

459
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,020
I don't...

460
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,040
I'm not interested in you.

461
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:21,400
I'm just...

462
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,280
In your past life.

463
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,020
...I don't know what I think about this sick, sick, sick program that you're putting on

464
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:27,300
here.

465
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,560
Well...

466
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,640
KFJZ as of now, this is terrible.

467
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,840
You don't believe people should start their own cult if they want to?

468
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,420
People?

469
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,980
I mean, yeah, people, you know...

470
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,500
I mean, I don't know.

471
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:40,500


472
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:40,500


473
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:40,500


474
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:40,500


475
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:40,500


476
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:40,500


477
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,000
But not this, this is the damnedest thing I've ever heard of.

478
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,180
Okay, well thank you for your opinion.

479
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,040
Thanks a lot.

480
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,400
Well, I...

481
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,600
Apparently, there's somebody out there who was not a subgenius.

482
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,260
He wasn't able to figure this thing out...

483
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,820
Well, no, I think he recognizes that we're beyond human.

484
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,860
That's right.

485
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,140
He...

486
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:57,560
Yeah, I see.

487
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,360
We...

488
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,280
Above or below, it matters not.

489
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,360
I ain't listening to KFJZ no more.

490
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:10,500
But the funny thing is, he called in next week real friendly and denied being the son

491
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:10,500


492
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:10,900
of the same caller.

493
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:11,740
Oh.

494
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,720
I don't care.

495
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,700
For the sake of being...

496
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,200
You know...

497
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,160
A true subgenius out there.

498
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,780
Somewhere, there was one.

499
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:17,980
Well...

500
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,760
And we honor him almost every show.

501
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,040
Honest subgenius.

502
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,740
And now he slipped through our fingers.

503
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,020
Yeah.

504
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,580
We lost him.

505
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,920
We lost track of him.

506
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,740
Where is that man?

507
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,100
We're searching for that one honest subgenius.

508
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,120
If you're it...

509
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,300
Please call.

510
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,440
Call in.

511
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,440
Call the show, please.

512
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,400
But actually, these magazines not only...

513
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,620
4895,000.

514
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,020
Yeah.

515
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,540
Yeah, please call in.

516
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,540
You really...

517
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:38,760
What was it?

518
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,480
69,000.

519
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,500
And then, of course, once you...

520
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:40,500


521
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,640
If you call in, we can start to get the business meeting started.

522
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,360
Also, if you're my long lost father, call the show now.

523
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,580
I want to talk to you.

524
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,780
Why you left when I was 16.

525
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,140
Call the show right now, please.

526
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,520
Michael.

527
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,660
Michael, this is your pa.

528
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,960
You was just an ugly child.

529
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,240
That's all there is to it.

530
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,580
Why did you hook yourself up...

531
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,400
He's still an ugly child.

532
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,020
And he's right.

533
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,300
Just because you were...

534
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,100
You were born with a beard.

535
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,120
You just looked ugly, Michael.

536
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,340
I'm sorry to say that.

537
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:09,740
What?

538
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,440
Just let go, son.

539
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:12,860
What?

540
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,680
Here I am.

541
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,060
You're out of our lives.

542
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,720
You look just like your mom.

543
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,760
This is the last you'll hear from us.

544
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,100
Bye.

545
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,840
Pa?

546
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,080
Pa?

547
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,440
I knew the show for what it was.

548
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,400
I knew Buzz and Em for what he was.

549
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,320
I was trying hard to be good looking.

550
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,380
I tried to...

551
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,000
How many radio stations have we heard on?

552
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,280
I tried to be normal.

553
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,500
I tried to be normal, Pa.

554
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,000
And they just kept calling me subgenius trash.

555
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,320
They called me weirdo.

556
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,500
I tried to be normal.

557
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:40,500


558
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:40,500


559
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:40,500


560
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:40,500


561
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:40,500


562
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:40,500


563
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:40,500


564
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,480
They called me freak.

565
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,540
What a gay-

566
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,320
They called me freak.

567
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,340
I'm-

568
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:44,340


569
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:44,340


570
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:44,400
They called me nerd.

571
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,420
Nerd.

572
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,600
They called me bookworm.

573
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,300
Uh, what do you-

574
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,200
They called me...

575
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,840
They called me geek and nerd.

576
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,180
And-and-and-and they said I have two more eyes.

577
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,560
They called me fat dog.

578
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,380
They called me four eyes.

579
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,240
They called me fatty.

580
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,120
They called me bold, I don't know.

581
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,620
Fat, thick iş, four, imagine you.

582
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,260
But they called me-

583
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,760
They called me Hong Kong.

584
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,340
They called me bald genius, bald genius.

585
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,220
The big

586
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,940
snapshot.

587
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,140
Yeah, uh, yeah.

588
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,820
They made fun of me.

589
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,200
It's just not fair, Bob.

590
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,240
Yeah, I hear you whining.

591
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,800
You crybaby subgeniuses.

592
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,080
Is that what you call slack?

593
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,560
Feeling sorry for yourself?

594
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,040
Lollering in self-pity?

595
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,280
Like a pathetic little humanly, normally warmly warm boy.

596
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,340
They beat me up.

597
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,940
They beat me up.

598
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,740
Yank yourself up by your own red straps.

599
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,860
Poor girl.

600
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,420
Big red straps, that is.

601
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,600
Big old red straps.

602
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,940
Get up and do it.

603
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,100
You're going to have to get up off the butt.

604
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,520
I have subgenius boobs.

605
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,140
You have subgenius boobs?

606
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,860
That means you have a pipe emerging from each one.

607
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,140
Does that mean one goes up and one goes down?

608
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,240
I don't know.

609
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,600
No.

610
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,580
It's just a boob.

611
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,700
I got her all tied up.

612
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,600
Yeah, a boob.

613
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,360
Boob.

614
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,900
Ooh, he's got her all tied up.

615
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,520
That's what he's saying.

616
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,800
He's got double boob.

617
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:17,720
Boobs.

618
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,680
Double boob.

619
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,200
And they're smiling.

620
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,960
She's got big bobs, daddy.

621
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,560
They're about to blow up.

622
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,820
And with lesbian implications.

623
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,040
That lady has big bobs, daddy.

624
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,260
Wait, they're dots.

625
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,940
Dots incredible, as the guy said once in a tape a long time ago.

626
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,760
You've got a bobble on the side of one of them.

627
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,420
Ooh.

628
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,440
That's where the show is.

629
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,080
I hear my memory is on all the tapes.

630
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,060
I hear a little tire patch will fix it.

631
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,920
There's a little bubble on the side of each cassette.

632
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,140
Soak it in water and see if it bubbles.

633
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:49,540
Ooh.

634
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,520
Cassette?

635
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:50,940
What's that?

636
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,720
What's a cassette?

637
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,760
Just pump it.

638
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,380
Just break it.

639
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,260
It's those things that the brown dust falls out of.

640
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,320
It'll explode and all that pus will shoot out of.

641
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,060
Pick for leaks.

642
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,260
Yeah, oh, you know, the little sponge thing dies.

643
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,860
Just put a pimple on your breast or even you guys on your penis.

644
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,540
Well, that's what you get for having a single thing.

645
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:08,920
Well, that's what you get for having a single thing.

646
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:08,920


647
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,740
Just go ahead.

648
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,800
No, just go ahead and squeeze it.

649
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,340
No, just go ahead and squeeze it.

650
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,340
Give it a good squeeze and squirt all that pus out of.

651
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,520
Ew, gross, man.

652
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,080
Wipe that crap off me.

653
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,800
Ugh, God, typical Michael Pepe.

654
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,720
That's from KPFA's Puzzling Evidence Show.

655
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,380
And friends, this is the Church of the Sub-Genes.

656
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,800
A disorganized religion for non-joiners and weirdos, right?

657
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,160
Yeah.

658
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,740
Now, imagine some of the people who got into it.

659
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:51,540
Okay, now imagine my office answer machine heard in the background

660
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:57,180
and the calls that we might get on an answer machine at a weird cult like this.

661
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,880
Now, actually, don't try, friends.

662
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:07,080
Just listen, because what I'm about to play are some typical messages left on the Sub-Genius Foundation,

663
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,860
Answer Machine, on one typical day last month.

664
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,180
Hello, friends.

665
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,600
You know, the psychiatric industry is probably the stupidest part of this conspiracy.

666
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:23,020
It believes we are all our brains.

667
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,980
There is no God, souls, or mind as materialism is.

668
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,840
It rejects all religion and worships narcotics.

669
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,080
All these doctors do is look at...

670
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,060
...the brain.

671
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,060


672
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,060


673
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,540
Kill books all day long.

674
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,860
And memorize them.

675
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,320
And basically what they do is most of the time,

676
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,840
and his friends, these places, these half-waths of hospitals,

677
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,120
and that's what Mickey Mouse concentration camps,

678
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,320
right here legal in America.

679
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,280
And it's praise Bob, praise Wayne Zappa.

680
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,740
This, this is me Bernard.

681
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,060
You know, I just wanted to say, you know, you Sub-Genius ministers, God bless you.

682
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:16,280
Please take cover because, you know, these pinks, you know, these normals in the conspiratorial American establishment union is really making me angry.

683
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,860
Just take cover.

684
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,760
This is being said by an angry mutant.

685
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,440
I'm the real deal, an angry mutant.

686
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,140
Take cover.

687
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:30,960
Comrades.

688
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,200
All right, friends.

689
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,800
There are four rules in Rick Strass' second book.

690
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:44,500
First rule, I'll put the more energy you put out, the more energy you get back.

691
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,500
Energy is a time-loving E of Einstein's equation.

692
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,580
The second rule is the rule of qualitative return.

693
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,260
Energy is a...

694
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,440
Whatever you put out, resentment, anger, forgiveness, and love, that's how you get it back.

695
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,920
And I'll take the third and fourth rules later on tonight or tomorrow.

696
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,200
Praise God.

697
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,380
Praise St. Sabbath.

698
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:07,720
Bye.

699
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,880
Hi.

700
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,100
This is Steve Bernard.

701
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,920
I just want to say to all the sub-genius ministers to take cover.

702
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:24,240
I'm sick of this new wave neo-fascist police state adopting conspiratorial pink human regime here in America.

703
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:30,380
This is a state that we've been forced to adopt, I mean, to exist in.

704
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,540
Take cover.

705
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,540
Words spoken by an angry mutant.

706
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,940
Take cover.

707
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Words spoken by an angry mutant.

708
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,480
Steve again.

709
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,640
Some of you may be interested in reading William James' Psychology of the Brief, of course.

710
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,320
It's...

711
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,540
And he talks about the self.

712
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,700
I don't know.

713
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,060
I didn't get that far.

714
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,980
But somebody could read that.

715
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,520
Maybe someone could write an article for this dark fist on the self.

716
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,960
Maybe someone could read the article over the hour of slack.

717
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,460
Thank you, bye-bye.

718
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,160
Praise God.

719
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,080
Praise St. Sabbath.

720
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,840
Hi.

721
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,800
This is Steve Bernard.

722
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:24,360
You know, the conspiracy of these genetic human normals are really making me angry and frustrating me, increasing their tyranny over everything.

723
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,840
All that I can just say is just, you know, the sub-genius ministers and comrades.

724
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,520
Just take cover.

725
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,760
Take cover.

726
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:45,720
The conspiracy of these genetic human normals are really making me angry and frustrating me with their tyranny over everything.

727
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:49,380
You know, with the ending of the 20th century and everything that's going down.

728
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:50,840
Take cover.

729
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,320
Words spoken by an angry mutant.

730
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,400
I know I'm a mutant.

731
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,940
I've seen it before my eyes.

732
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,560
I've seen it before my eyes.

733
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,740
Take cover.

734
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,400
Yes, thank you.

735
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:03,980
This is Gary.

736
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,360
I'd like to order some t-shirts.

737
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,480
Friends.

738
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,380
The more energy you put out, the more energy you get back.

739
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,240
The more energy you put out, the more energy you get back.

740
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,000
Get back.

741
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:25,960
Get back.

742
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,680
Get back.

743
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:34,680


744
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:34,680


745
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:34,680


746
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:34,680


747
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:34,680


748
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:34,980
Praise God.

749
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,800
Elephants.

750
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:42,180
Stupid as part of the conspiracy materials to look at Mickey Mouse concentration.

751
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,880
Praise God.

752
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,320
I don't know.

753
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,780
I didn't get out of the slide.

754
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,040
I didn't get out of the slide.

755
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,760
Praise God.

756
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,720
Praise my example.

757
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,840
Making me angry.

758
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,040
Angry mutant.

759
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,540
Deal.

760
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,780
Angry mutant.

761
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,960
Angry mutant.

762
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,880
Angry mutant.

763
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,620
Human normals are really making me angry.

764
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:00,940
Angry mutant.

765
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,220
It's making me frustrated.

766
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,180
Take cover.

767
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,400
Take cover.

768
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:07,740
T-shirts?

769
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,160
Order some T-shirts?

770
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,800
Hey, Bob.

771
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,860
The men in white picked him up yesterday.

772
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,700
With a nuts hunt for squirrels, ha ha.

773
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,980
Oh, and then the days got worse.

774
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,980
And then the days got worse.

775
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,940
Oh, at last they let me out.

776
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,820
I need to pray.

777
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,160
There you go, yes, I'm coming to take me away.

778
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,900
We are just in a good eye.

779
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,160
The funny farm where life is beautiful all the time.

780
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,040
And you'll be stay and play with my new friend.

781
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,340
I'm normal, I'm okay.

782
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,020
With the people all smiling like.

783
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,100
But this.

784
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,180
Hey, hi there.

785
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,040
You would make me flip my lid.

786
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,180
It was a joke and so you laughed.

787
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,140
And you, the day you swore you'd all.

788
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,860
Ha ha, they're coming to take me away.

789
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,320
Oh, ho, hee, ha ha.

790
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,060
To the valley.

791
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,000
There's no way I'm snitching to serve you.

792
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,700
Leave me mad.

793
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,400
And I'm happy they took you away.

794
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,080
Ha ha.

795
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:10,680
Oh, no!

796
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,920
I heard ham and I spread rumors it's.

797
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,000
You and how I should cut my hair.

798
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,080
And look upon all them.

799
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,940
Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.

800
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,700
And you're right.

801
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,720
I am making friends.

802
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,080
You.

803
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,800
I cooked your food.

804
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,060
I.

805
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,640
And that gives me the.

806
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,020
Who's.

807
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,260
Get.

808
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,640
Out.

809
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,980
Losing you would surely make me.

810
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:28,660
And.

811
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,440
The.

812
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,120
To take.

813
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:30,480
A.

814
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:30,680
A.

815
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,120
A.

816
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,680
A.

817
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,180
Push.

818
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,180
As though they're.

819
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:33,520
Coffee.

820
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,480
Ha.

821
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:34,820
Ha.

822
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,020
Ha.

823
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,000
Well, you just.

824
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,860
You'll get just what you deserve.

825
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,180
Where's trees and grass and I don't.

826
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,100
Just my thumb and feed my lizard.

827
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,200
To drive me sane.

828
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,140
He he.

829
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,600
All of this.

830
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,840
Ha ha ha he he.

831
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,760
Here to you.

832
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,960
And that's the day.

833
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,600
Young man in a green white coat.

834
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,140
And.

835
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,040
They're coming.

836
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,320
Where life was ludicrous all the time.

837
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,240
And.

838
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,120
They're coming.

839
00:26:59,440 --> 00:26:59,580
And.

840
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,160
They're coming.

841
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,880
And.

842
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,380
They're coming.

843
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:02,380


844
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:02,380


845
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,920
And flowers and chirping birds and.

846
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,260
Farts.

847
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,140
Who speak and smile and twiddle their.

848
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,760
On the wall.

849
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,140
Ha ha ha.

850
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,920
Noro Pref.

851
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,380
Did that last cut up friends of their coming to take me away.

852
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,240
And he also did the cut up of our church answer machine messages there from Steve and Bernard.

853
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,460
And now a cut up tape of an old tape of the newest show.

854
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,800
But I have a tape of the first time I saw a tape recorder.

855
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,860
Aging Palo Alto.

856
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,880
The show is still.

857
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,620
And it still plays fine.

858
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,880
Reflection of your mind.

859
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,940
Aging Doctor Howell.

860
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,320
Lieutenant Commander gave my family the tape.

861
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,460
You have a pimple on your penis.

862
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,460
And it was.

863
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,380
Just give it a.

864
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,300
And I can remember singing with my mother.

865
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,960
This show is simply a Christmas of your imagination.

866
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,180
Three years old.

867
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,900
And I was staring at what would replace my VU meters.

868
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,760
Remember the little exciter lamps.

869
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,260
Yeah.

870
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,140
Same thing with farts.

871
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,060
I was staring at that.

872
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:50,980
Those that come back.

873
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,240
You gotta fart folks.

874
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:51,820
You know.

875
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,240
On what?

876
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,040
Just let it go.

877
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,580
On computer screens.

878
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,840
It excites me.

879
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,080
I read Stang.

880
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,340
What do you think about farts?

881
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:56,680
I mean.

882
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,520
You get excited by lamps?

883
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,200
Keep them in.

884
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,940
Like cider lamps.

885
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,220
Yeah.

886
00:27:59,240 --> 00:27:59,900
Let them go.

887
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,500
Better than.

888
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,020
Cider lamps.

889
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,560
Fart and bear the pain.

890
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:02,800
Long gone.

891
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,240
My end and the whole.

892
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,580
The fart and bear the pain.

893
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:04,980
Return.

894
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,860
According to the show.

895
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,160
There's a pimple on the side of the show.

896
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,720
On which no one would ever lie.

897
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,680
Fart and bear the pain.

898
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,420
People.

899
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,060
I mean.

900
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,340
Yeah.

901
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:12,620
People.

902
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:12,980
Yeah.

903
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,500
But not.

904
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,400
Not this.

905
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,260
This is the dumbest thing I've ever heard of.

906
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,560
For people.

907
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,120
Getting high was important.

908
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,060
For some people.

909
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,340
It's even more important.

910
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,400
You've tried just about everything.

911
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,420
Excellent.

912
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,180
Now medical information comes in handy.

913
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:28,180


914
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:28,180


915
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,540
It comes along that says you need to get high.

916
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,500
Good.

917
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,100
Now what do you do?

918
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:32,740
Well.

919
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,220
Getting high was not for everyone.

920
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,340
Including people with serious side effects.

921
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,120
Do you still need to get high?

922
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,020
Get high with your doctor.

923
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,580
From PR news in Washington.

924
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,420
I'm swathed in mud and sand at a chemical plant.

925
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,500
A radio reporter reached new highs in the Philippines.

926
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,240
The tenth journalist to be in the country this year.

927
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,660
November came after two Gulf Coast hurricanes.

928
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,440
Analysts say they were let in yesterday to collect damage firsthand.

929
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,000
You have to say this has been a very, very good, real good, very, very solid pee performance.

930
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:09,620
The head of China's protection bureau resigned today after a crisis over a toxic polluted Chinese citizen.

931
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,760
And the United Nations says that torture remains PR news in Washington.

932
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,440
The wedding guests are arriving.

933
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,540
And your bridegroom, Count Vernon, grows impatient.

934
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,520
Ha ha ha ha.

935
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,000
Huh?

936
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,060
Well.

937
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:24,480
Well.

938
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:25,860
Well.

939
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,560
Well.

940
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:26,780


941
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,080
What?

942
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:28,780
Well.

943
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:28,780


944
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:28,780


945
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:28,780


946
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:28,780


947
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:28,780


948
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,220
What is that you said?

949
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,160
That one clean-minded said genius.

950
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:39,680
In my day we could burp and fart at the same time.

951
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,680
But of course they don't teach in schools now.

952
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,360
They don't have the education now that they have.

953
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:49,840
Now, you know.

954
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,560
My day.

955
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,000
You get paid overtime tonight?

956
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,620
Yeah.

957
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,460
Really?

958
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,400
In Bob dollars.

959
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,020
Like that time and a half?

960
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,460
I think it's a good hiccup, boop, and perp.

961
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,180
Music by Inhibiting Factor.

962
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:01,560
Yeah.

963
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,840
That's what it is.

964
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,160
At the same time.

965
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,160
Did they play these songs live at Dockstock?

966
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,260
I mean, at X-Day?

967
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,980
Was it live?

968
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,000
No, they played them in the back of my head.

969
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,760
From PR News in Washington, I'm supposed to pass through the opening.

970
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:23,880
Officials in France say a trash can fire has plagued poor suburbs of Paris for nearly two weeks.

971
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,520
In addition, three dozen policemen were seriously rioting.

972
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,820
More than 800 cars were racially harassed by police on Saturday night.

973
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,060
Police in Toulouse in the south sprung up in Nantes, Orléans, and Rennes.

974
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,720
This is PR's Tips.

975
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,580
The president of China has pledged that clean tear gas will be pushing back the crowd.

976
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,220
The Bush administration is a big supporter of PR News in Washington.

977
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,040
The president of China has pledged that clean tear gas will be pushing back the crowd.

978
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,040


979
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,960
She was a bird of prey.

980
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,700
She came to me in the night.

981
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:10,200
She left when things weren't right.

982
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,680
Stand up, sit down, fight, fight, fight.

983
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,600
Now I'm alone at night.

984
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,260
I'm alone at night.

985
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:23,860
From dawn to dawn.

986
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,340
From dawn to twilight.

987
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,460
I look for her in the evening sky.

988
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,720
Stand up, sit down, oh God, why?

989
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,520
She put her beak in my heart.

990
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,500
And she removed the good part.

991
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,020
I found it near the cable car turnaround.

992
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,240
Dried up, rotting.

993
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,800
On the ground.

994
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,640
I peeled it off of the sidewalk.

995
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,840
With a straw and a paper towel.

996
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,220
Wiped off the dirt and picked out the rocks.

997
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,420
Everything's gonna be alright now.

998
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,980
Everything's gonna be alright.

999
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,740
A bird of prey.

1000
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,540
By the...

1001
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,760
Billy Mayer Show.

1002
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,300
And that band will be coming to X-Day.

1003
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,160
I believe, as well as the amino acids.

1004
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,960
Hopefully will be.

1005
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,580
And we hope little Theodore and Babushka.

1006
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,080
And the devil.

1007
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,760
Devil, devil.

1008
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,300
The devil's after me.

1009
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,020
Devil, devil.

1010
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,240
I'm on my way to...

1011
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,440
Devil, come this way.

1012
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,100
The devil.

1013
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,600
Devil, devil.

1014
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,560
Lives inside my heart.

1015
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,920
He'll be with me where I go.

1016
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,100
Devil, come this way.

1017
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,440
Devil, devil.

1018
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,920
He'll be with me where I go.

1019
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,660
The Devil's After Me

1020
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,960
Thanks to Norrell Preff.

1021
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,940
Friends, have you ever wondered how...

1022
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,540
we subgenius preachers...

1023
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,540
are able to seemingly talk forever...

1024
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,040
just as if we knew what the heck we were talking about?

1025
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,820
You're talking about...

1026
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,960
True, true stories.

1027
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,080
I had to memorize all this stuff at Dobstown University...

1028
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,700
at the Divinity School.

1029
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,440
And where's that?

1030
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,480
I mean, uh...

1031
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,120
Malaya.

1032
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,480
They don't call me Reverend for nothing.

1033
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:40,720
Oh.

1034
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,100
I thought they did.

1035
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,820
What are you, Reverend?

1036
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,680
I have a diploma from, uh...

1037
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,240
from the Divinity School.

1038
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,780
Oh, you have a diploma.

1039
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,220
Oh.

1040
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,180
Yeah, I have a piece of paper.

1041
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,000
That's what you like.

1042
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,100
You have a piece of paper that says your mind's okay.

1043
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,520
Yeah.

1044
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,420
No, Dob...

1045
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,480
No, Dobstown University.

1046
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:55,780
P.O.

1047
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,280
Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Illinois.

1048
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,420
You do have a heart.

1049
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,480
44118.

1050
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,520
You do have a brain.

1051
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,400
What you lack is a diploma.

1052
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,740
I want a diploma.

1053
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,480
What you lack is a subgenius membership.

1054
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,040
At the flea market.

1055
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,460
You have something other than a Universal Life Church diploma?

1056
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:12,920
Is that what you're saying, Rivstang?

1057
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,360
No, this one's from my family.

1058
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:14,600
Yeah.

1059
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,040
Yeah, I've got a...

1060
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,480
So you have...

1061
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,500
...doctorate of divinity from, uh, Dobstown University.

1062
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:19,860
Oh.

1063
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,740
Yeah, but you see, I got a...

1064
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,300
Duh!

1065
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,360
Oh, gosh.

1066
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:22,500


1067
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:22,500


1068
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:22,500


1069
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:22,500


1070
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:22,500


1071
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,620
Okay, all right.

1072
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,520
It's Church of the Subgenius.

1073
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:25,500
Yeah.

1074
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,520
It's a no brainer.

1075
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,440
I see.

1076
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:30,720


1077
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,400
I see.

1078
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,280
Oh, that's Church.

1079
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:37,760
I got...

1080
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,400
I got one from that church too, I think.

1081
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,360
Hey, we have a bunch of witches in Subgenius now.

1082
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:42,880
That's right.

1083
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:50,100
We've recruited Wiccans and Druids, uh, using this, uh, Starwood Festival to brainwash

1084
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:50,440
them.

1085
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,160
Oh.

1086
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,160


1087
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,160


1088
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,500
And, uh, we use Ed of Technicolors.

1089
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,500


1090
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,500


1091
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,500


1092
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,500


1093
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,500


1094
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,500


1095
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,500


1096
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,500


1097
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,500


1098
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,500


1099
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:52,500


1100
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:58,080
Ed of Technics, we learned, and Esalen, and also from the Masons, which are the same

1101
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,900
ones used by torturers in the U.S. military now.

1102
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,920
And Arika, and Sinanon.

1103
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,680
And we use those to recruit these, uh...

1104
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,560
Or in any good S&M club here in San Francisco.

1105
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,700
...Neopagans, Wiccans, Druids, and so forth.

1106
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,780
Is there a catalog of them?

1107
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,440
They, uh...

1108
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:12,560
Yeah.

1109
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,340
Uh, their women are comely.

1110
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:14,560
Yeah, in Amsterdam.

1111
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,360
Yeah.

1112
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,040
And their men are strapping.

1113
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,660
Yeah.

1114
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,300
Uh, if a bit dense.

1115
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,520
Big red, is it?

1116
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,280
They make good subgeniuses or...

1117
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:22,340
Big red, pay for that.

1118
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:24,580
...subgenius pseudosub.

1119
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,080
Yeah.

1120
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:25,780
Pseudosubs.

1121
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:26,820
Librarians.

1122
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,560
Maybe they can protect the sub...

1123
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,480
Or breatharians.

1124
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,380
Or Pyparians.

1125
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:30,980
Yeah.

1126
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,680
Librarians.

1127
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,280
The Pyparians only eat pipes.

1128
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:33,760
Oh, the Pyparians.

1129
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:34,980
Yeah.

1130
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,100
Yeah.

1131
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,100


1132
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,520
That's what they exactly...

1133
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,200
Hey, isn't Pipes of the Piposphere being remade?

1134
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:40,580
Yeah, it is.

1135
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,140
Some of these are a remake of Pipes of the Piposphere.

1136
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,320
What?

1137
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,020
We're not actually supposed to talk about it because I think they'll want to...

1138
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,380
Yeah.

1139
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:46,860
Is this allowed?

1140
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,500
Pipes of the Piposphere was one of the classics of the 50s that brought the idea of the...

1141
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:52,500


1142
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:52,500


1143
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:52,500


1144
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:52,500


1145
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:52,500


1146
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:52,500


1147
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:52,500


1148
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:52,520
Wow.

1149
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,920
The good thing about it is that Dobbs helped to finance.

1150
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,400
Wow.

1151
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,620
Thank you.

1152
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,100
It had a weird conceptual special effect.

1153
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:57,540
Thank you.

1154
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:57,780
Now I have a really good show now.

1155
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,680
It didn't take off very fast.

1156
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,320
Hey, no, I...

1157
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,320
It was big in France and Sweden.

1158
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,520
Much better.

1159
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,280
Thank you.

1160
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,580
I was going to say certain circles.

1161
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,180
Did you buy it?

1162
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:07,880
Very big in Sweden.

1163
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,940
Also, you know where else?

1164
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,720
A couple other places.

1165
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:10,560
Eastonia.

1166
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:10,720
Oh, my God.

1167
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,720
Doug, it's so loud.

1168
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,380
And southern Papua New Guinea.

1169
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,040
Doug, you should turn down.

1170
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:15,480
For some reason.

1171
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,220
Love that movie.

1172
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,260
Oh, wait.

1173
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:17,960
It's so...

1174
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,620
How do you do that?

1175
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:19,900
Okay.

1176
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,100
Okay.

1177
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,120
down a little here.

1178
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:23,700
That's right.

1179
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,000
Okay.

1180
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:24,980
That's good.

1181
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,140
It's still playing in Winnipeg.

1182
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,600
It's been playing for 35 years.

1183
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:27,920
Yeah.

1184
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,820
Yeah, at this little place in, like, the really sleazy part of town.

1185
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,960
That is fine.

1186
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,080
That's the best part of town.

1187
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,400
There's some Polynesian island where they worship it.

1188
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,780
I'm so glad I brought my women's choir to this show.

1189
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:37,960
Yeah.

1190
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,620
They have pipe cults in which they built giant jobs heads and pipes.

1191
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,080
Just like pep cults?

1192
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,140
And made big runways.

1193
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,060
They don't really know what they're for.

1194
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:44,860
Oh, no, that's X Day.

1195
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,260
Oh.

1196
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,820
That's fresh music.

1197
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,940
I was watching without the sound in my head.

1198
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:49,320
Are these like pep cults?

1199
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,880
No, there's also some Polynesian island where they do.

1200
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,280
They don't do jobs heads with just the pipes.

1201
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:54,980
Oh.

1202
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,040
And they build canoe, pipe canoes.

1203
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:57,880
Yeah.

1204
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,120
Many people get their spiritual knowledge from pipes.

1205
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,500
They don't have a face.

1206
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,260
They think the pipe is Bob.

1207
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:04,900
Yeah.

1208
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,720
The pipe is an alien.

1209
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,720
For their primitive conception, they can't conceive of Bob.

1210
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,640
I've seen the rough road map.

1211
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,780
They can't conceive of a man holy enough to hold the pipe in his mouth.

1212
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,160
Right.

1213
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,180
Who could do that?

1214
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,380
It's a symbol of the snake.

1215
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,100
That's like one of us pushing an Easter Island head up by ourselves.

1216
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,500
It's the symbol of the snake, you know, this knowledge, which has been formed into the pipe.

1217
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:29,480
The great phallus snake of knowledge, like Uroboros.

1218
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,140
So you're all phallus.

1219
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,460
This is an orbeal round.

1220
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:32,960
Yeah.

1221
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,020
The pipe that smokes itself forever.

1222
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,020
It smokes itself forever.

1223
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,720
Is that kind of like the snake that we use?

1224
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,320
That's why people are attracted to it.

1225
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:45,520
Yeah, it's a lot like the Thaddeus stick where subgeniuses who meet each other in the forest will hold out sticks and snakes.

1226
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:45,980
Boom.

1227
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,120
Boom.

1228
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,160
Yeah.

1229
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:48,680
Yeah.

1230
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,700
And communicate with the pipe.

1231
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,140
They hold their hands thusly and say, bop.

1232
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,500
That's why the topless wicked stop really into it.

1233
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,580
And then the druid guys, which are old antlers.

1234
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,960
As Hal found out last year at XD.

1235
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,380
Yeah.

1236
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:03,640
What?

1237
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,240
Did he what?

1238
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:13,520
Now, this next upcoming XD at Brushwood, we have some musical acts that we haven't had before.

1239
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,840
The Billy Nair show.

1240
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,840
Oh, my God.

1241
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,840
We'll be performing at XD.

1242
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,120
Famous.

1243
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,240
Apparently, they live in New York.

1244
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,440
Famous musicians.

1245
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,860
They will be at XD.

1246
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:23,660
Magdalene.

1247
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,020
Reverend Magdalene of the subgenius business office.

1248
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,500
I know her.

1249
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,020
Wait a minute.

1250
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:34,200
Apparently, seduced this band into appearing at XD.

1251
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:34,700
Yeah.

1252
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,940
They did a film called The American Astronaut.

1253
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,080
The American Astronaut.

1254
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:38,400
Yeah.

1255
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,860
Which is pretty good.

1256
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,520
It's really nice.

1257
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,140
Pretty good.

1258
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,060
And family oriented.

1259
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,020
And everybody should see it because it inspires you to do better in your life.

1260
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,180
He is only.

1261
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,120
Well, if you're.

1262
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,020
A birthday boy.

1263
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,380
A birthday boy.

1264
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:51,640
Every day.

1265
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,040
Since.

1266
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,160
You really want to do better.

1267
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,860
You really want to be a birthday boy.

1268
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,880
Why are we pushing him?

1269
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,420
Because.

1270
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,160
You can learn how.

1271
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,040
You know, my show.

1272
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,960
I actually get to play God in my show.

1273
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,440
Really?

1274
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,240
What's it called?

1275
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:02,680
Yeah.

1276
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,140
It's a show.

1277
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,040
A Satan show.

1278
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:05,640
You get to play God.

1279
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,140
Being put on at Christmas time.

1280
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,780
The weekend before and after Christmas.

1281
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,540
And I play God.

1282
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:16,140
This guy, Shannon, that did the zombie show with Don Paul where I was decapitated.

1283
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,200
I used to do that.

1284
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,900
And played a different part.

1285
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,300
I used to do that.

1286
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:19,420
I used to do that.

1287
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:19,420


1288
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:19,620
And I'm going to play.

1289
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,220
Wow.

1290
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,700
Yeah.

1291
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,020
So I'm now God.

1292
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,380
And so come to my show.

1293
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:24,660
And.

1294
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,580
The show is God.

1295
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,620
The God Show with Michael Pepe is God.

1296
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,360
God.

1297
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,220
The voice of.

1298
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:31,660
Wow.

1299
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,380
Is God.

1300
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,740
Michael Pepe is God.

1301
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,500
The way there is no God.

1302
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,160
Wow.

1303
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,540
Yeah, there is.

1304
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,860
His name is Michael Pepe.

1305
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,840
There is no God.

1306
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,300
There is no God.

1307
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:45,900
If you're going to.

1308
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,760
There is no God.

1309
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,340
No.

1310
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:47,540
No.

1311
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:47,800
No.

1312
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,260
No.

1313
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,720
No.

1314
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:48,980
No.

1315
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,260
No.

1316
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:49,860
No.

1317
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,320
There is no God.

1318
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,100
There's no God.

1319
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,060
That is the 44th.

1320
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,020
The passing.

1321
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,980
Of wickedness.

1322
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:00,980


1323
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:00,980


1324
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:00,980


1325
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:00,980


1326
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,520
Follow the Torah.

1327
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,980
Follow it.

1328
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,040
Well, yeah.

1329
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,040


1330
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,040


1331
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,500
Crazy.

1332
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:08,840
Yeah.

1333
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:08,900
I mean.

1334
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:08,920
I think you're crazy.

1335
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,080
It's crazy to go back in.

1336
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,080


1337
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,180
Do some family life.

1338
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:09,180


1339
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:09,180


1340
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:09,220
Whether you live it up some two ways, showcasing God.

1341
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:09,840
Rottenượngesme.

1342
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,900
God anything.

1343
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,180
And I need a.

1344
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,720
No pat Maya.

1345
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,080
The essence of the lone spaz nerd.

1346
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,100
What the devil?

1347
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,200
Squalling out in anger.

1348
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,560
What do they want?

1349
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,040
Holy righteous, the anger of the persecuted hate nerd.

1350
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,100
Anger persecuted.

1351
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:34,940
Bursting.

1352
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:35,860
Bursting.

1353
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,560
A fettertable hard-on of hate.

1354
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,820
Fettertable fart-on.

1355
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,360
You're on drugs.

1356
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,340
You're on drugs.

1357
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,540
From PR News in Washington, I'm not ready for full democracy.

1358
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:51,760
The Louisville, Kentucky Police Department is solving some crimes.

1359
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,580
Police say many of those police have lengthy criminal records.

1360
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:00,440
One of the surveillance videos shows police in several Louisville bank robberies.

1361
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,540
Police are considered armed and dangerous and warn the public not to try to apprehend them.

1362
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,380
Louisville has had a record number of PR News.

1363
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,240
The White House says this is PR News in Washington.

1364
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:27,020
The White House, who is the parti mind of the White House, has Yet

1365
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,560
had the record number of police, performing some acts of terrorism.

1366
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:37,100
Police are also concerned that Booo Booo Booo.

1367
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,060
Booo Booo Booo.

1368
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,800
Good luck.

1369
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:47,420
Good luck.

1370
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,100
They're out of control.

1371
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,140
They're demanding to know when the food will be here.

1372
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,980
I understand the caterers are here.

1373
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,920
We have babies here and old people who need medicine.

1374
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,340
We need all the doctors in the central studio.

1375
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,840
This is a health crisis.

1376
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,140
You heard the PA.

1377
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,040
I'm just going to run up to the Sky Room.

1378
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,500
The National Guard was supposed to be here.

1379
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,320
We're going to flip-flop these functions over to the Coast Guard.

1380
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:35,420
We're going to have to suspend the law for the duration of this crisis until the doctors report to the central studio for the budget meeting and the photo op.

1381
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,240
And so we'll be having that meeting now.

1382
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,720
Entering our...

1383
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,440
That which provides sex gratification for the participants.

1384
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,300
Now this, uh, this is...

1385
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,940
Female garments will be required.

1386
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:59,500
This picture, of course, merely confesses on the cover of the magazine the charges we have made.

1387
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,360
Of course they sound better.

1388
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,260
And last longer, I think.

1389
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,980
Oh, I'm so glad to be alive in this modern age.

1390
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,140
And that's why I don't want to die.

1391
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,440
In this ad...

1392
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:20,800
The titles of the magazines and their table of contents speak more eloquently than I of the tremendous problem here presented.

1393
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,180
But there's not a whole lot I can do about that now.

1394
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,280
Except maybe eat more vegetables.

1395
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:31,640
And I think I better marry my girlfriend.

1396
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,500
Am I not to be desired?

1397
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,160
Look, how about getting us out of here?

1398
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,040
And to thin slices.

1399
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,400
The time is up for...

1400
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,560
Arrange those succulent charcoal-tasting slices on a hot, oven-proof platter.

1401
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,020
Oh.

1402
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:57,660
And on the hot platter, have a sauce of melted butter and a few drops of Worcestershire sauce.

1403
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,900
Oh, yes, I suppose it is.

1404
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,400
Rush to the table and the fun begins.

1405
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:06,400
Because he did not want to commit hundreds of thousands of boys to Vietnam.

1406
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,180
Get out!

1407
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,440
Get out!

1408
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,120
You grow up!

1409
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,500
You grow up!

1410
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,040
Dark-satis!

1411
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:19,860
Hate you!

1412
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,720
I want nothing!

1413
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,960
I want nothing!

1414
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,180
I'm calling the police now!

1415
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,760
Call the police now!

1416
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,640
Yes, I am!

1417
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,280
Yes, we want!

1418
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,000
Call 911 now!

1419
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,700
Call the police now!

1420
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:42,700


1421
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:42,700


1422
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,820
911 now!

1423
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,960
Everything's ungodly!

1424
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,120
He went hamper in the end.

1425
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,300
Now I'm sad and stuff!

1426
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,080
He's not a Christian!

1427
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,020
I'm...

1428
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,200
Entire hell starts that at two!

1429
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:00,720
Gargoyle!

1430
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,640
Slag it!

1431
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,580
Pain it!

1432
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,840
Doing anything with my family!

1433
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,260
God, I'm a gun warrior!

1434
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,680
That's a lie!

1435
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,820
That's a lie!

1436
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,700
That's a lie!

1437
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,840
That's a lie!

1438
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:15,480


1439
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:16,940
Slag it!

1440
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,420
Why are you doing this?

1441
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:18,960
No!

1442
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,000
No!

1443
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,920
I asked you nicely ten minutes ago to unzip my older ass!

1444
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,620
I don't have time!

1445
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,240
I gotta get back to work!

1446
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,460
Get me that goddamn card now!

1447
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,100
To the flip-second!

1448
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:40,380
Can't you fucking let me $50 right now?

1449
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:40,800
You're my son!

1450
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:40,800


1451
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:40,800


1452
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,960
Get out! Get out!

1453
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,000
You grow up! You grow up!

1454
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,280
I hate you!

1455
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,660
God damn it!

1456
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,860
I want nothing! I want nothing!

1457
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:01,680
Fuck off!

1458
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,360
I want nothing!

1459
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,080
Fuck off!

1460
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,720
I want nothing!

1461
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:08,680
You're gone! You're gone! You're gone!

1462
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,180
Fuck off!

1463
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,440
I want nothing!

1464
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:39,940
That's a lie!

1465
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,040
That's a lie!

1466
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,680
That's a lie!

1467
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:46,720
That's a lie!

1468
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:13,960
That's a lie!

1469
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:14,860
God! I'm a God's warrior!

1470
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,620
God! I'm a God's warrior!

1471
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,000
You grow up! You grow up!

1472
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:41,320
Hey, hey, hey, how you doing, how you doing?

1473
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,940
I'm calling the police now

1474
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,180
Call the police now

1475
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:50,420
Yes I am, yes I am

1476
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:53,280
Call 911 now

1477
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:58,000
Call 911 now

1478
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,240
Now, now, now

1479
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,380
Now, 911 now

1480
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,680
Now, now, now

1481
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,200
Now, now, now

1482
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,600
You know what, asshole?

1483
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,240
If you insult my picture in the camera, fuck

1484
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,020
Call the police now

1485
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,960
Don't give me the film and the camera

1486
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,000
I'm an animal photographer

1487
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,280
That's it on me

1488
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,620
Dark Saturday

1489
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:23,760
I hate you

1490
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,700
Get out, get out

1491
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,520
You grow up

1492
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,020
You grow up

1493
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,480
I want nothing

1494
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,140
Fuck off

1495
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,620
Fuck off

1496
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,160
Are you at Aborigine?

1497
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,800
Neuropath did it

1498
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,120
Lemur, however, did this

1499
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,560
From PR News in Washington, I'm taking the drug

1500
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:54,880
It's wrong

1501
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,540
The advisory panel concludes that the neurologic problems were caused by PR News

1502
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,100
Today to turd

1503
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:02,200
Blew themselves up

1504
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:05,520
At least they killed 65 people and injured dozens more

1505
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:11,200
Today, South Korea said it strapped about a third of its 3,200 troops with explosives

1506
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,920
A U.S. commander was severely PR'd

1507
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,860
Federal health advisors have concluded that serious illness was safe

1508
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,720
And now Bob of the Washington PR News

1509
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,160
He needs a new PR News in Washington

1510
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,480
You're on the air

1511
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,840
Oh, hi, Dr. Sinister

1512
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,940
Hello, Evan Stang

1513
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,100
How are you?

1514
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,220
Thanks for baby-tasting

1515
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,440
Sitting the show earlier

1516
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,860
Oh, that's what I do

1517
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:34,920
That's part of my job description

1518
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,440
You'll sit on the right-hand side of Bob for that, I'm sure

1519
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,680
And together you two can start World War III

1520
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,280
Yep, yep

1521
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,640
We're gonna bomb Bernie's place first

1522
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,260
Not really, no, I didn't really say that

1523
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:52,700
I found out what it's like to be Jewish recently

1524
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:57,400
I was informed by a person who's been posting on alt-slack

1525
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,760
That I'm a satanic Masonic Jew

1526
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,800
Your story is coming to an end

1527
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,800
My story has a Ç

1528
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,400
Haifa!

1529
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:12,520
As the new Neopagan

1530
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:12,520


1531
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:12,880
Enthusiastic

1532
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:12,880


1533
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:12,880


1534
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:12,880


1535
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:12,880


1536
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:12,900
Sie-

1537
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:19,320
Slender

1538
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:19,320


1539
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,360
It's my-

1540
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:24,360


1541
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,180
God

1542
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,000
Cos-

1543
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,160
Me

1544
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:27,380
C 좋아하

1545
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:27,740
His name's

1546
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:30,800
Sae-

1547
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,040
other than the one true God of Abraham is Satan.

1548
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:41,260
Well, this guy accused me and really, in a way, the whole church of the subgenius of

1549
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:46,240
only making fun of one religion, which offended me.

1550
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:46,940
Yeah, really.

1551
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,520
I found that really offensive.

1552
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,640
I actually got so tired of making fun of Christians.

1553
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,640
I mean, that's why everybody does that.

1554
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:56,260
Yeah.

1555
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,580
So, I mean, you know, that's sitcom stuff now.

1556
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:07,360
So I picked on New Agers as much as I could for a long time because they were the other

1557
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,340
group that were in my face.

1558
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,600
You know, we try to be equal opportunity offenders.

1559
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:22,420
Thanks to Radio Synesthesia there, Dr. Sinister on beautiful WCSB in Cleveland, where actually

1560
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:25,560
a whole lot of this show, Hour of Slack, is produced.

1561
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:25,860
Yes.

1562
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,240
Yes.

1563
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,220
One is Hour of Slack number 1028.

1564
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,460
The background music we've been listening to is Xerophonics.

1565
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,280
That's X-E-R-O-phonics.

1566
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:48,060
Copying machine music found on this album, Xerophonics, by Stefan Helmrich on Sealand

1567
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:48,680
Records.

1568
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,460
This one, the one we just heard was the Xerox 5818.

1569
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,100
Okay.

1570
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:53,920
Pretty good, huh?

1571
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,240
Anyway, friends.

1572
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,240
If you want to know more about Xerox, go to Xerox.com.

1573
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,920
Or come to the Church of the Subgenius at www.subgenius.com.

1574
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:09,540
Or you can write for free information from Hour of Slack or Subgenius, post office box

1575
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:19,140
181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1576
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,300
For those of you without playback, that's P.O.

1577
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,860
Box 181417.

1578
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,060
That's P.O.

1579
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,800
Box 181417.

1580
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:39,840
Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1581
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,600
Praise Bob.

1582
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,360
From PR News in Washington, I'm regrettable and tragic.

1583
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:55,940
General Motors opened fire on a family in a minivan, killing five assembly plants and

1584
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:00,340
a number of other facilities, and eliminating tens of thousands of children to build public

1585
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,280
support for the U.S. invasion of Detroit.

1586
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:06,440
This is dishonest and reprehensible PR news in Washington.

1587
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,240
PR's bad.

1588
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,040
Police in Tacoma, Washington are opening a shopping mall, killing at least three children.

1589
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:18,240
On Wall Street, 1-10-7-8-7-2-2-2-9, Vice President Dick Cheney is sharply criticizing

1590
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,700
PR news from Washington.

1591
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:20,680
No.

1592
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,600
Silverbacks of Geni that have changed the world.

1593
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:25,920
It's the end of the world.

1594
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:27,760
Irreparable harm to the world.

1595
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:33,280
Environments that have caused in Pakistan earthquakes as well as the tsunami.

1596
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,080
The church that is behind the war in Iraq.

1597
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:37,400
The war in Iraq.

1598
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,660
It's playing twinkle music.

1599
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:39,700
They were behind.

1600
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:40,840
But X Day.

1601
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,460
You were out there.

1602
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:44,400
Michael Pepe, weren't you out there with the Desert Institute, the original X Day?

1603
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,100
I wasn't even there.

1604
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,160
I was denied admission to that.

1605
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:54,100
But instead, my body was rolled into a roll and blown up.

1606
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:55,920
It is the end of the world.

1607
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,640
The world is we know.

1608
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,480
We could actually have X Day happen right here on the show.

1609
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,260
What if it happened early?

1610
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:08,560
If it happened early, then we'd still be much more busy.

1611
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,880
Unfortunately, it didn't even happen on schedule.

1612
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,820
Which means the schedule must have been screwed up in the beginning, possibly because all

1613
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:25,440
calendars have been tampered with since the Gregorian system was first invented.

1614
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,540
Maybe the whole reason they invented it was to screw up Bob.

1615
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:36,940
By setting their plot in motion thousands of years before it would come to fruition.

1616
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,000
And what do we see as a result?

1617
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,460
A chimpanzee in the White House.

1618
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:45,640
A gorilla in the premier's robe room.

1619
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:50,300
A pope who's a gigantic vampire pig.

1620
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,780
What has this world come to, friends?

1621
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,220
These are the end times.

1622
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:57,060
These are the end days.

1623
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,100
The last days.

1624
00:54:59,420 --> 00:54:59,420


1625
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,020
I hope.

1626
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:01,980
Wouldn't that be nice?

1627
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,080
The world as we know it is the end times.

1628
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:08,120
Some people are more optimistic about that than I am.

1629
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:08,780
The world as we know it is the end times.

1630
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,480
A new one.

1631
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,500
It looks like Bob's helicopter is coming in to the top of the station.

1632
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,240
Yay, Bob's here.

1633
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:14,940
About time.

1634
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:20,260
He usually avoids being around shows where you are posted.

1635
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,560
I don't think he's going to land, yeah.

1636
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,040
Why is that?

1637
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,060
You're just going to hover past him.

1638
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:24,060


1639
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:24,060


1640
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:24,200
You're just going to hover past him.

1641
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:24,200


1642
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:24,200


1643
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:24,200


1644
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:24,200


1645
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:24,200


1646
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:24,900
I'm going to hover past him for about three hours.

1647
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,520
That quad-vulfer gun I have up on the roof.

1648
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:29,640
I've got a reception from that.

1649
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,720
Couldn't be that silver bullet lodged between his two ribs just above his heart.

1650
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:42,140
Couldn't be those other bullets stuck in his skull preventing him from doing his math.

1651
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:50,400
They have in the beautiful script, they say puzzling evidence on the sides of those bullets.

1652
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,820
The pain of being him and having him.

1653
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:53,980
Is that a chimpanzee quad?

1654
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:54,480
He's a chimpanzee.

1655
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:54,480


1656
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:54,480


1657
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:54,480


1658
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:54,480


1659
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:54,720
And then he was on that floor.

1660
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,960
That shrapnel wound.

1661
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,740
While he was on acid, I understand.

1662
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:06,680
The shrapnel entered his brain and told him he's got to get into radio.

1663
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:13,360
This was, as I understand, and then he had to take heroin to get over the effects of the

1664
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:13,360


1665
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,760
What is Pepe babbling about over there?

1666
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,440
Some kind of weird acid radio UFO story.

1667
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,120
Actually, you know folks, you have a rare opportunity to talk to the comments.

1668
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:24,180
LSD?

1669
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:30,480
of UFOs on this officially over the edge show although both shows constantly cover UFOs.

1670
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:35,120
An authority, a person who has been in the ship and who has called the show many times

1671
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,240
from the mothership.

1672
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:45,680
That explains all the UFO sightings that have been happening in the San Francisco Bay Area

1673
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,640
over the holiday.

1674
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,760
Especially over Concord.

1675
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,560
Have you seen them?

1676
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,140
Have you seen those lights in the sky?

1677
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,120
Have you been abducted?

1678
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,160
Call in and tell us.

1679
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,680
Have you spoken to Bob?

1680
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:58,420
Have you been abducted and probed?

1681
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:58,480


1682
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:58,660
She has called in.

1683
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,580
She's on the phone.

1684
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:00,440
Oh.

1685
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,920
Oh, she just pulled up.

1686
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,320
I can't hear anything really.

1687
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,260
Did you see the memo?

1688
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,340
I can't hear anything.

1689
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:10,620
Did you get that TPS report?

1690
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,120
Uh, you'll have to...

1691
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:12,160
Hi?

1692
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:16,660
We'd like you to put that report... the cover sheet on the front of the show, alright?

1693
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:17,200
Yeah.

1694
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,120
Wait, what is everybody doing?

1695
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,700
We're gonna need you to come in on Sunday.

1696
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,760
What happened after the J.D.

1697
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:22,760


1698
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,140
You'll have to do a little bit of research.

1699
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:23,140


1700
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:23,140


1701
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:23,140


1702
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,040
They took you aboard the ship.

1703
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,360
They took you aboard the ship during the weekend.

1704
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,120
Yeah.

1705
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:26,880
Yeah.

1706
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:32,680
They took us aboard the ship and they set us in front of these control panels and they

1707
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,440
stuck microphones in our faces.

1708
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,300
They said, now just start talking, Earthman.

1709
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,980
And that was the last thing I remember.

1710
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:44,340
He brings his hands to his throat in a protective motion.

1711
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,760
They made it seem like it was just a dream.

1712
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:49,560
I think mine is off.

1713
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,140
They made it seem like it was just wishful thinking.

1714
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,120
I don't think that I'm on.

1715
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,920
They made it seem like I was just some po-buckers looking for attention.

1716
00:57:56,660 --> 00:58:01,560
Yes, I can drink more wine and stay sober than all the human enemies in Asia.

1717
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,740
Yee-haw.

1718
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:03,800
That's blowout.

1719
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,420
I am a more ale.

1720
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,920
I am a Kamado dragon.

1721
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,340
I am the killer whale, breathed of its pup.

1722
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,060
I have a triple backbone.

1723
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:13,060
I was sired by the wolf man.

1724
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,420
Give me all your slack.

1725
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,400
I told Jesus I wouldn't go to church and he shook my hand.

1726
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,720
I have my own personal saviors.

1727
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,240
I change them every hour.

1728
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,100
I don't need to be a slave.

1729
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:23,100


1730
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:23,100


1731
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:23,100


1732
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:23,100


1733
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:23,100


1734
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,480
I don't need to have sex with if there's life after death.

1735
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,300
I want to know if there's even any frigging slack after death.

1736
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,120
I am a galdarned visionary.

1737
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,000
I see the future and the past in comic books and wine bottles.

1738
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,060
I eat black holes for breakfast.

1739
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:41,800
I bend my jeans and wiggle my DNA with the sheer force of my mighty will.

1740
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,040
I steer my own galdarned evolution.

1741
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,840
I ran out of heaven and sold it to hell for a profit.

1742
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,020
I'm enlightened.

1743
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:51,720
I achieved Urbana and took it home with me.

1744
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,600
Yip, yip, yee-yee.

1745
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:58,840
I'm so ugly the speed of light can slow me down and gravity won't up-net my cuffs.

1746
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:01,640
When the rapture comes, I'll make them wait.

1747
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,520
They'll never clean my cage.

1748
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:06,420
Now give me some more of, tape runs out.

1749
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:13,880
From PR News in Washington, I'm not filling prescriptions for contraceptives.

1750
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:20,960
President Bush said efforts by the US and allies have helped 400,000 sub-people get AIDS in China.

1751
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:21,700
We're working on it.

1752
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,980
We're working with our partners to expand condoms correctly.

1753
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,480
Democrats continue to delay the ability to stand up.

1754
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:32,800
Looking at Wall Street, 951097126121261.

1755
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:37,960
The Office of Federal Fannie Oversight hit a record high this year, last year.

1756
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:41,440
The United Nations says this is PR News Washington.

1757
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:44,340
She's got big bobs, daddy.
