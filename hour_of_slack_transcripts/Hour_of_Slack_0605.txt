I don't deserve to die.
I don't deserve this phone abuse.
So please just stay a while.
Work in a graveyard ship.
Work in a graveyard ship.
Work in a graveyard ship.
Work in a graveyard ship.
Gosh.
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry.
Hour of Slack.
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.
I look, I see there's three calls there.
They're all calling all the way from Bob.
All right.
Back to Bob.
Bob?
Back to the pleasure ship.
Please.
Please.
That was another one of those little toy boxes that Dobbs' voice was recorded for.
That's a little known fact about the early career of J.R. Bob Dobbs was his voiceover talent for laugh boxes and other novelty sound doohickeys.
Remember back before the days of chips?
Yes.
Little tiny, like, records inside of them.
Duma-flotchies?
Yeah, Duma-flotchies and Duma-floshies.
What are Duma-flotchies?
What are Duma-flotchies?
I'm sorry I'm so ignorant.
Well, they're just, they're an old recording technique.
They were like little plastic records, like in a Chatty Cathy doll.
Like when you're...
Had a tiny record player inside of it.
Yeah.
You insert the records.
It was an ancient computer.
Yeah.
In a way.
I heard that if you took some scotch tape and put it over your eyes and then put, like, iron oxide in it and rubbed it on the ground real hard, that it would hurt.
Well, yeah.
Of course.
But that's...
Anyway, the point is that, yes, J.R., our guru, our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs, was indeed the voice in that laugh box that goes...
And also, he created the answers in the Magic 8-Ball.
And you know those little Halloween...
Yes, you mean yes and no?
The Valentine's Day candies.
The little...
Tiny hearts that have sayings written on them.
Kiss me, sweetie.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, you kid.
Oh.
Dobbs wrote those.
So Bob was an errant copywriter as he traveled through his vagabond?
He was also a script writer for Bazooka Joe bubblegum comics.
For Bazooka Joe, those little strips down there.
He wrote those.
Oh, damn.
And a subgenius, J. Lynch, drew those for several years.
Let's see.
Other early...
Of course, everyone's familiar with Bob's modeling.
Yeah, he did a lot of radio.
He was a model, too?
Well, of course he was a model.
Like a male, like with the pipe and so forth.
Yeah.
And like a cashmere sweater.
Pick up any magazine from the 1940s, 50s, and early 60s.
Pick up any babe.
I'm sorry.
You know, Bob.
That's pretty stupid, actually.
I'm sorry.
Juvenile.
Well, you need to go that way.
You haven't been reading your prescriptions, have you, Dave?
No, I just thought, you know, that Bob was supposed to be such a sexually charged, highly charged being, you know.
You said pick up any, and I said pick up any.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's great, Dave.
That's good.
I'm glad you're coming to grips with yourself.
Now, please take your hand out of your pocket.
I'm not necessarily coming to grips with myself.
Yeah, I can see what you're hiding behind that guitar.
You can see it?
Zip up and...
You're about the only person that's ever been able to make out a difference down there.
I got new glasses.
Telescope lenses.
Anyway, x-ray.
X-ray specs, friends.
He did them, too?
Stand in an elevator.
Next time you're in an elevator, whip out your x-ray specs.
I know they don't really work.
But the pinks think they do.
And just glare at people and giggle.
Look them up and down wearing your x-ray specs and just giggle in the elevator.
Man over there.
But either way, friends were...
This is the noise.
This is the noise, the buzzing in your brain.
Yeah.
What?
But...
Oh, okay.
Thanks.
Sorry, that's not the buzzing in your brain.
Thanks, Dave.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
I am a clone, I am not alone
I live in a world where the other clones roam
It's your DNA
So just sit around and get stuck
I am a clone, why don't you leave me alone
My DNA
In my plastic world in a fadeaway zone
It's your DNA
It's the only place I call home
I wonder as I wander
Whatever happened to the time
When people could see with their eyes
I wonder as I wander
Down the line
I wonder as I wander
Down the line
I am a clone, I am not alone

I, I, I, I
I am a clone, I am not alone
My DNA
I was born in a dome, my power's a throne
It's your DNA
My power's an autochrome
My DNA


I am a clone, I am not alone
We all live in a world of siliconic growth
It's the only place I, I fall
I wonder as I watch
Whatever happened to the time
When people could see with their minds
I wonder as I wander down the line
I wonder as I wander down the line
I wonder as I wander down the line
I am a clone but I won't be for long
My DNA
From inside I planted a little bomb
Is your DNA
To turn everything off once and for all
I am a clone now I'm on the road
From the plastic world in a fadeaway zone
My DNA
If never, I'm never going home
I wonder as I watch
Whatever happened to the time
When people could see with their minds
I wonder as I wander down the line
I wonder as I wander down the line
I wonder as I wander down the line
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
Ð½esean lining me with
a chain Everyone's tied around my neck
And every day You're in my arms
A song for my soul
All my planning
I fingers never come apart
I know for now
You feel for me
You're all I have
I know my listeners

You're the talk

I'm the rap

I'm the energy
I'm the rhythm
In my dream
Even though it seems like my life won't stop
Cowboy Name with all those other people.
I was just having errant bee thoughts.
Hey, man, you guys aren't messing with the bees, are you?
Actually, I have been messing with the bees.
I have been messing with, I've got to admit, I've been messing with the bees for a long time.
You've got that smelly smile. You've got that shirt and faraway look.
Covered with honey.
Yeah.
Sticky. Tiny little red bumps all over.
A pollen.
You can tell, can't you?
I've been pollinated.
Takes one to know one.
Yeah, it does.
We're just waiting for the old queen to kick off so we can take over the place ourselves and start an anarcho-syndicalist commune.
Oh, what would you guys do without that queen and her huge...
Egg sack pulsating out your little brothers, your endless little, little maggot brothers?
We'd repopulate the insect world with Bob's face populaces of our own kind and our own makings.
You know, now, Dave, don't get Bob wrong. He does not want a planet of Bobs.
Bob Dobbs, that's what the conspiracy wants, is a planet of all male white salesmen going from place to place, just selling crap to each other.
Yeah, but she should.
That's the conspiracy's view of Bob.
It is.
Bob himself wants only himself.
And millions of babes.
Well, and customers. We, his customers. We're not his victims like the Christians are to their god or sheep.
But we are customers. It's a deal. It's a covenant. It's a contract.
I thought you said we were frozen custards.
I thought you said that...
At some point in time, some of these beings was gonna huff us all up in some kind of like...
Like our souls is gonna be their queen.
No, no, not custards. Customers. You must have been listening on the internet.
Didn't understand.
You missed... You know, it's sad. Kids miss one word. They get one word wrong in the word of Bob and spend the rest of their lives in misery because of it.
Just because they got one word wrong.
Where Bob said, you know, too much is always better than not enough, but it's almost as bad.
You know, they miss that second part of it.
Just because we never...
Never printed that second part.
And they...
They overdose on alcohol and stuff.
And it's sad.
But, you know, I believe in evolution and so does Bob and good riddance.
The good riddance factor is the most important thing in the death of any pink, poe-bucker or...
Or bad subgenius.
I know that sounds harsh.
May go down harsh on the polished ears of the modernist liberal listeners out there.
But, you know, Bob is not a just god.
But what is Bob?
I thought you said one time he was a hologram to make the words go away.
And then I thought you said another time that Bob was like the trumpet of wisdom from...
From XXX dimension.
Bob is as old as the mountains and as young as the streams, Dave.
And he's as watery as the streams.
And as...
Productive of fluids and...
Little germs.
And things.
Yes, Bob puts out a lot of fluid.
He...
You can be washed in the love of Bob and the pee of Bob, Dave.
You can...
You can be cleansed.
You can...
You can...
You...
It's like a river.
It's like...
It's like a river coursing through...
Just up and down your back.
It's like when you feel that rocket ride of Bob go up your spine and explode in your brain.
And then you look down and that grab for that old Kleenex...
To wipe up.
You know Bob didn't lie.
You know it was real.
What I...
You know that that pledge was worth it.
I've heard that some of the mystics, some of the gurus, and some of the swamis in far off land say that Bob's mucous fluids could actually rejuvenate your cells.
Much more so than any of those other progesterone treatments you get on at midnight hours watching them, uh...
Info muscles.
The font of Bob can save.
It can make a rich man poor.
It can make a...
A harlot clean.
And it can make a...
A square uptight woman into a crazed harlot.
It can...
It can...
It can make a...
A dumb-asticated pink boy turn into a smart-asticated subgenius.
I'll be damned.
I don't know if I want to sign up yet or even part with this dirty bucksy.
I was going to get me a bottle of Wild Irish Rose, but you know...
Bob ain't gonna stand between you and that bottle of Wild Irish Rose.
He ain't gonna stand between you and the hangover either.
What you're saying then...
So what you're saying is Bob is...
He's real, man.
He's real.
He's as real as you and me, perhaps.
He's as real as that drunk and he's as real as that hangover.
Yeah, but...
He's the high and the low.
He's the shotgun and the shell and the target.
And the buckshot.
That's some powerful words, buddy.
And the saltpeter.
Where does he dwell?
Where does he abode?
I mean, I'd like some tangible proof someday.
Oh, he lives down the street from me.
From me?
He lives in your postman's mailbox.
He lives in your shoe salesman's shoebox.
Bob lives in your ketchup bottle on your kitchen table.
He lives in every Christmas present you ever got.
He lives in every toy you ever broke.
He lives in the four-leaf clovers.
And the horse...
The lucky horse shoes.
And in Lady Luck's cleavage, he's kind of tucked down in there.
Whew, in the glistening spot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Before you're spinning the BS, buddy.
Oh, Bob, you love me.
It's because Bob...
It's because Bob loves you, Dave.
He loves you.
He gave...
Well, he actually didn't give anything for...
Actually, he doesn't...
Actually, I don't think Bob ever mentioned you, but, you know, his love encompasses everything generally.
And you're part of every...
Well, actually, he did come to think of it, he did ask if you could...would not call him anymore.
But...
I didn't know...
If you...as long as you stay out of his hair, he...he loves you...
Yeah, but...
...with an unquestioning love.
Oh, man, but these business ideas, man, they're sure to take off, especially with a man with an eye for the Midwestern market like good old Bob has.
So you're trying to give...you're trying to tell Bob how to sell something?
No, no, no, no.
How to do his business now?
Never would do.
That's like telling God how to do his business.
Tell God how to create his universe.
No, never, never would tell God...
Hey, God, why didn't you create this universe without that pain stuff, huh?
Hey, oh, God, why didn't you create this universe with...couldn't you have left out the death part?
Well, what's wrong with that?
How about...what...what...could you...could you have left out a little bit of that starvation stuff you invented, Lord?
I could use another...
See, you're gonna...you're gonna second-guess Bob now.
Why?
You're gonna tell God how to create the universe.
You're gonna tell Bob how to make a sale.
Don't go telling him that.
How to get those people to pledge to the station.
No, no, no.
You're gonna...you're gonna...you're gonna do Bob's job, okay?
No, no, no.
Okay, here's the pipe.
Here, take it.
No.
No.
Oh, and here's the whip.
Here's the crown over all the universe.
Wait a minute.
Now you're Bob.
How does it feel?
You still feel like an idiot, don't you?
I feel disembodied.
Now, do you understand?
I feel a bit queer.
I do feel a little picky.
Jeez.
She's looking picky.
Hey, this is pretty cool.
Heh heh.
He likes being Bob.
This is great.
You know, I...I...I feel so stupid I can't even express what I feel.
Stupid.
Oh.
Wow, man.
That's so beautiful.
Things are getting dead.
It's time to visit the graveyard.
To look for the shells, inspectors.
And to dance around for the departed.
Ready?
Set?
How many of you have ever done it in a graveyard?
Please.
Please.
Do our poem about...
I put an old gal in the graveyard.
Damn her poor soul, she was dead.
The maggots crawled out of her eyeballs and her hair slid off of her head.
After I'd finished my business, I knew I'd committed a sin.
So from my pocket I pulled out a straw and sucked out the load I'd shot in.
I'm sorry.
In these days it's easy to have a broken heart.
And to think a little poiiiiy has been like this,'ve been like this too.
It's too bad.

Well I've only just written songs about it.
And I've not finished anything else but the one from my name book.
I like it.
Well yeah.

MaiÃ´e.
Goodbye
I don't deserve to die
I don't deserve this fall of you
So please just stay a while
Working a graveyard shift

I was working the graveyard shit
late one Sunday night
keeping an eye on the trains
making sure everything was uptight
keeping a close eye
back beat on the 409
making sure the trains
didn't run on time
I looked off in the cold distance
and what did I see
It looked like a solitary headlight
coming after me
coming to take me away, yeah
I miss the dark
Secret darkness around me
I miss the dark
I miss the dark
I miss the dark
I miss the dark

He's one of the most deadly substances the Earth has ever known.
Okay, Bob.
Give me some friggin' flak.
Hey, Bob.
Oh, Bob.

What kind of is this?
Three times.

Let's cut him some slack, okay?
Thanks, Bob.
Bob.
That's right.

Man, that's all I got.
The war.
The war.
This entire planet.
Well, friends, it's because there's a war on and we've got a war to fight.
We've got to support our soldiers against the Martians.
We must defend Earth.
as best we can and if we have to resort to crappy internet connection lines then sure why not
why not it's better than being caged in some martian aquarium yeah when we have cornbread i
miss festus but when we have shoes i miss the pesto the besto i miss festus i do too the way
he used to snuggle up every night the way he would pinch princess weed the smell of the way he'd like
he'd go like this on their cheeks oh that hat smelled so good oh you'd like smelling his hat too
yeah oh that perspiration to me was like a form of liquid intoxicant it was almost as good as god
bob's mucle forms that mule he used to ride in the town yeah and when you would try and remove
everyone else beyond a horse they would make big they would make bets about it who can remove a fig
from that mule's anus with their teeth that's a difficult task but that only the doctors would
talk about that old sawbones they used to call them
he was too drunk to try it though one time i tried to do a paper on festus there just wasn't enough of
so much material but i did was able to get in touch with a group called the uh the friends of festus
i wallpapered him i i did his whole uh i did his whole bathroom and it sent me a bunch of good stuff
yeah yeah
yeah
Skiing to be a real drag looking in the mirror
there goes another eyebrow there goes more eyelashes my skin's falling off
well they said chernobyl was so long ago nothing to worry about
now i hear on the news these dumb guys are going to die
Department of Energy and Defense Department are going to start building a bunch of Chernobyls across the United States.
Then I heard Chernobyl's not really over now. All these people are dying.
All the underground aquifers are all contaminated.
All the underground aquifers are connected so we're getting two.
Yeah, we're getting two.
Then I wondered, how come my movements get so jerky like jerky?
Four, two, one, go!
The iodine, the 131, has got my thyroid on the run.
And the krypton, 885, is making it hard just to stay alive.
It's making it hard just to stay alive.
But the iodine, the 131, the iodine, the 131,
is no more running through the metal lanes.
No more paper in the woods.
Shake the pony hand of the poison man.
Shake the pony hand of the poison man.
Barium, a 248, it's made me sterile, I can't appropriate them.
And the plutonium, a 247,
has told all folks I see in heaven.
But the iodine, 131, the iodine, 131,
has no more running through the metal lanes.
No more paper in the woods.
The power of powers and the powers made.
Shake the pony hand of the poison man.
I've heard it!
The iodine, the 131, has got my thyroid on the run.
And the krypton, 885, is making it hard just to stay alive.
And the plutonium, the 131, the 131,
has told all folks I see in heaven.
I've heard it!
I've heard it!
The iodine, the 131, the 131,
has got my thyroid on the run.
Outro Music
Yeah, I remember one time he broke out in tears when they gave him the award.
Remember that? It was a little teeny bob.
No, what award was that?
It was a little teeny bob pipe. They said that he was so lax in his duty that he had relaxed.
Festus was a slack master, no doubt.
He was an impromptu slack master, and he was also quite a vegetable.
A vegetable?
Well, you know, after the coma, he never really did come around.
They put him on stilts and walked him up and down.
He was down with a computer thing in the back of his head, but you know he wasn't Festus after that.
He was, you know, P-H-F-E-S-T-U-R or something like that.
You know, I mean, I don't know necessarily if that's really what they would have called him.
But that looks kind of like science fiction way of doing it, don't it?
Like, if you had one of them bits in the back of your head and you were, you know, technically brain dead,
and they put one of them alimite bits in the back of your head and walked you around and your name was Fister,
wouldn't it be better?
I don't know if they called you P-H-F-E-S-T-U-R.
Hey, who the hell's Fister anyway?
Is that the guy on The Addams Family or is that the guy on Gunsmoke?
I think it's both of them.
I think it is, too.
At the same time?
Yes.
Oh, what a magnificent dream.
Oh, what a magnificent dream.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.












In a bowl of tomato soup.
And these Yeti women, I'm telling you where they were built.
I don't mean they were built like a brick, you know what.
Ladling the soup around my shoulders.
And a homemade cream of tomato, not from a can, by the way.
And also, they were stuffing these feathers in my feet for a pig regalia they were going to have later in the afternoon
as the ships would be leaving.

We're circumnavigating Saturn, I guess.
It was going to be a big brouhaha.
Everyone was going to be there.
A prime rib special, of course.
Goulash and pickled pig's feet, I think,
someone was going to wear as a crown.
And in some way, midway during the ceremony,
once again, we were all to be treated with this horrific face,
the geezer of Bob J.R. Bonerhead,
who never, ever had his name taken in his veins,
but did live through numerous colostomy events,
one of which my son Richard, who was also a paraclassical...
Chaz, I was talking to a young person just the other day,
a young person here in Dallas, Texas,
didn't even know that we had had an interplanetary...
interplanetary war at the turn of the century,
in the year 1900.
They thought that was a funny science fiction story
that had been made into a radio show.
Just like declaring war on the planet a couple of weeks back.
Oh, yeah, they don't take this kind of crap seriously.
And the reason they don't is they don't know any history.
You talk to a modern-day high school student or college student,
and, well, sure, they know about the Gulf War.
You know, they remember the Gulf War,
but they don't know about the war in Vietnam,
World War II.
They don't know about...
They don't even know we landed on the moon.
And, yeah, no, they don't know that we walked on the moon,
and they don't know that we had a war with the Martians
at the turn of the century.
It just, it kills me.
It's like there's these giant Martian tripod museums
in Baltimore and, I think, there's one in Akron.
They've got one of the damn Martian tripods in Akron.
And the people in Cleveland,
don't even know that we had a war with Mars.
It was, admittedly, it was 90 years ago.
90, exactly, 97 years ago, praise Bob,
that we defeated...
And there's a crashed pyramidal spaceship in Mississippi,
and nobody talks about that either.
Oh, they don't pay any damn attention to it at all.

There was a little man
Who ran a two-shot stand
And every day the man would sweep
The water from the busy stream
Seldom said a word
That anybody heard
There was something in his face
Loneliness could not erase
guitar solo
Like a
Like a
Like a broken cup
He looked up from his cup
He drank his morning coffee
And wiped the dribble
From his chin

All right, let's go.
When his eyes met mine
He made a little wine
Came with an annual joke too
And then he whispered
I hate you

What sort of nonsense was he getting on about back here while I was passed out?
Why, that wasn't Dave. That was some passerby.
Was that that little Dave program that spews like Dave?
I guess that was what it was. It was the Dave program, yes.
That was Dave, Lonesome Cowboy Dave version 3.0 beta, like third beta version.
It's buggy. It's real buggy.
It crashes a lot, and it'll scramble the other icons on your desktop.
Oh, yeah, something terrible in it.
Where all of a sudden the last five porno pictures that you looked at
will be your desktop pattern.
It's kind of embarrassing if you're trying to show your mom your website or whatnot.
For real.
I've never shown my mom my website.
That's one of the most sickest things you ever said on this here airwaves.
One of them.
So I dare you to take a breath for me, Zoom.
It's only a matter of time
before the room starts filling with liquid nitrogen
and we go back in our shells.
No, it's not so bad back in our shells.
With that...
The liquid nitrogen, of course, it freezes you,
but it feels warm.
It's like being in a cocoon.
And it's just like waking up on a Saturday morning
and rolling over and going back to sleep.
Like sleeping for another five...
Getting another five.



Another five minutes in bed.
The only difference is that you're in suspended animation
and that five minutes is really 50 years.
You wake up and all your relatives back on Earth are dead.
You know, but who cares?
Because you've got a whole new life ahead of you
on this new colony planet.
And why there are people or creatures,
or whatnot, from all over the galaxy
also helping to colonize this brave new world.
You'll be so used to seeing outlandish life forms
that you'll kind of...
You'll be surprised when you see another human.
You'll look across the rodeo stadium or whatnot
and on your new colony village and...
What?
Look!
There's a...
Is that another human over there across the...
Across...
Hey!
Hey, man, you're from Earth, aren't you?
Yeah, man, what kind of place is it?
What kind of...
Hey, hey, where are you from?
You sound like you're from the Northern Hemisphere.
I'm from the Northern Hemisphere, too.
Yeah, the Venusians run the birth and rebirth game.
The Martians torture us in our sleep.
The Saturnians are Saturnine, to say the least.
And let's just say the Jupiterians ain't so jovial, bud.
Yeah, the Uranus bug...
The Uranus bugs are the worst of all.
Yeah, well, I like them personally, but that's my own prerogative.
Well, that's why we declared war, friends.
We declared war against all the planets.
At our tent show meeting just the other night,
Halloween revival, you might say,
we, for the first time, declared war,
literally declared war against all the planets.
Because, you know, as the great...
All the heavenly hosts tell that, man.
As the great sage, Ronald Reagan,
once told the premier of Russia,
you know, if aliens from outer space were to invade our world,
all the nations would forget our differences and band together.
That's right, Reverend.
We'd all...
Well, we'd have to, but...
While old Roddy was doing that, of course,
he had already sold the planet out to the greys.
Sign here and here.
Well, paper means nothing to them.
But who cares about the greys, man?
The greys are a bunch of punks, pipsqueaks, little bug boys.
Nothing but a bunch of, like...
Shh!
Space clones, they take the meat,
they put them in a mecha-clone,
they put them in the thing and fly them around so they don't croak.
Our...
Let the Pentagon party with the greys all they want.
Our alien allies are as unto God.
Their spaceships do not crash,
for they do not need spaceships
any more than Bob Dobbs needs brains in his head.
But it's true, friend.
You know, we're gonna be on the escape...
Those of us who've, you know, signed up with Bob,
we're gonna be on the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.
We'll each have our own fleet of planets.
If that's what we want.
If all you want is a house with a creek behind it, then fine.
If all you want is a mansion and a mall, great.
I've been thinking a small planet myself.
I'm looking for one of them little God's Mansion planets.
Places where you just step in through the door
and everything changes as you wish it.
Yeah.
A whole planet, I mean.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Everything you want instantly brought to you.
Yeah.
That's what we'll have.
Wheels of gorgonzola cheese
and lovely, nubile young yeti nymphs bringing them to us.
And crackers too, right, Rev?
That's what awaits the subgenius minister.
240 days from now,
when we leave this planet,
and you know, friends, it kind of makes,
now that we're leaving,
as much as we hated Earth,
we're getting kind of sentimental now, you know?
It's like graduation's coming up.
We're already signed up for that college.
We're going to leave Ma and Pa.
And they hated us while we were at home.
But, you know, friends,
somebody's got to stay behind to protect them.
You, our little friend,
brothers and sisters that didn't spend that extra $30 on Bob,
or that didn't pledge your radio station,
you're going to have to stay behind to protect Mother Earth, friends.
And we promised that when we have,
that when we commandeer our battle planets,
when we come back to trash the planet,
we'll just trash the pigs.
We'll just kill the normals.
We'll just set fire to the,
the,
the ugly city.
But we'll leave.
We'll leave.
We'll be kind to our mother.
Mother Earth, friends.
Because when we're on the spaceships,
we won't think about the,
the pollution and all the humans and jobs and stuff.
We'll remember the oceans,
the forests,
the proud cities,
and the fast food restaurants
and comic books and monster movies.
The Moogoo Guypan.
But, friends,
Bob ain't gonna be around to protect you.
The planet's gonna be crawling with aliens.
Are you gonna be brave enough to just say no to the alien threat?
Are you gonna,
are you gonna be willing to take on the job,
become the new stewards and stewardesses over spaceship Earth?
Or Earth Farm 1, or whatever's left of it, friend?
Rev, I was wanting to ask you.
You said the Stinky Pinks is gonna be the only one that's gonna be around.
They're actually gonna be the ones under the tutelage after it's gone.
But they're gonna be roasted.
And then you said that these like, fallen subgeniuses...
The ones it wasn't in the crafts, so to speak?
Yes, the, the subgeniuses, the thousands
of subgeniuses will be left behind.
Who's chosen to stay behind?
And leave the Earth into a farm status?
A status of some-
Well the Earth is a farm.
Earth Farm 1 is what its called by its owners.
What do they grow there?
Human souls.
Anguish.
Pain.
suffering. That's what's grown here
on Earth Farm 1.
Yes, human souls. They grow as many
as possible. They grow them under
stressful conditions, and
they get high
off the anguish stored in those
souls after they buy
them from Bob.
From Bob? The Archons got
an agribiz going?
For sure, Dave. That's what this
is all about. I knew it!
We're the spuds. I knew it!
The church of the subgenius is the
tractor. I knew it!
My post office box is the sack
into which the spuds are thrown,
thence to be thrown into
the thresher, the compressor,
and extracted, and the souls
are then compressed into these church
air canisters, from which
we occasionally take
what you might call a little pinch off
the church pour box.
Have a hit, Dave.
Uh-oh.
Church air
one soul per breath.
Oh.
This guy was a little
bit fuzzy
on the inside.
Yeah, it's kind of weird
when you huff a
human soul, you
kind of pick up a trace of
their little watered-down
personality. You wouldn't want to
huff another subgenius soul. I had a
little bit of Jane-er soul once,
just a touch. It was like we...
Oh, man! We had this real, real
pink soul. It was like, hey, man,
let's throw some Jane-er souls into there
and see what happens, and we tried it.
You blended, man? Yeah, it was like, oh, well,
let's just try some... Yeah, I did
some Jane-er souls. That'd be like going down to that
gas pump. I haven't been
able to remember my own phone number
ever since, no matter how
many times I try to learn it.
That's what that... See, friends,
you gotta be careful. Just...
Just say no
to droids.
And just say no to the alien
threat.
Friends, the Earth spirit
is your mother,
Gaia, the great
personality, the living
thing that is the Earth,
which inspired
us, the human and subgenius
races, to create
the great weapons,
nuclear bombs, factories,
which we once...
We once turned against each other,
friends, but now that we're leaving,
we will turn them against the other
planets.
Symphony!
Symphony!
Against all other planets
except our own.
Until only
Mother Earth
remains.
War against the planets!
War
against the universe!
War
against God
in the name
of God!
In the name of God!
Yes, in the name of Earth,
and in the name of J.R. Bob Dobbs,
I
hereby declare all
other planets to be designated
New Earth.
And as such,
ours to
use and trample
as we see fit.
And if they resist
us in the name of
Bob and the Earth, we shall crush them.
We shall crush the Martians.
We shall crush the Venusians.
We will crush the Jovians.
We will crush the Skri-Alaq of Saturn's moons.
And the Uranus bugs.
The very sun itself we will harness and master the sun.
We will enslave the sun.
We will make you pay for light.
We will bill you for light.
You will thank Bob for the light when the sun rises every morning.
And we shall bring the 25-hour day.
And then after that we will go on to Pluto.
We will crush the Plutonians and the Dogmen of Pluto.
We will advance into the stars, to Alpha Centauri, to Tau Ceti and beyond.
And if we cannot conquer a planet, we will destroy it!
If Bob cannot have it all, then no one may have any of it.
All worlds are none!
Thank you for watching this film.





well, you've just seen Yeah.
and her, the transcribed
and for the criminally
impaired and the deafness
of the Reverend Ivan Stain's
speech on the final days of Earth
as
recollected
by Mr. Sturm
Herman, the realizer
and Jetty Post,
the producer, and
Miss Francine Stuit was the
camera person
and Jane Swath was the
gaffer.
And we'll be back with our
Meet Bob Dobbs series
and part two
for the criminally insane also and for
the hearing impaired.
A transcribed and previously
recorded message of the Reverend
Ivan Stain
and the
Paul Reiter.
And now, for the
news.
Bob spoke to me using mental
telepathy.
Hector Brea told
Colombian government investigators
he told me he was a male
of his species just as I am
a male of the human species
but Bob didn't act like
any male, that's for sure.
He acted like
a pansy from another
planet.
The father of three told
authorities the limp-wristed
pipe-smoking visitor showed up
at his home on the night of July 2nd
awakening him and his wife
with a knock at the door.
He said he thought the
subgenius was a human until he
let him in and the light revealed
the shocking truth.
A blister on his thigh.
Brea described the salesman as at least
seven feet tall with pale
green skin, huge eyes,
a large mouth and a long
protruding pipe.
He had a human-like nose
and ears and wore a thick layer of
makeup.
