1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:20,980
All right, dear friends, this is KNON 89.3 in Dallas, Texas.

2
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:28,020
This is not Criswell Christian Radio, KCBI. This is KNON.

3
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,720
That's when the wheels of action begin to move.

4
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,520
To the subgenius hour of slug.

5
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,920
Explanation of the church of the subgenius in under two minutes.

6
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,040
It's not just...

7
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,780
Hello? Is anyone home?

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,500
Are there batteries in this machine?

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,540
Well...

10
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,080
Well, close enough.

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,420
Subgenius work, like they used to say in the army.

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,220
You are no longer in control, my friend.

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,220
We shall dominate you, dear listener, as we have dominated others of your species.

14
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,120
You thought it was real funny, didn't you?

15
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,520
Thought you'd go and poke...

16
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,040
...the devil's leg, eh?

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,340
Well, go ahead, son.

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,620
Yeah, it's funny. Funny big joke.

19
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,880
Let's go...

20
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,660
Go ahead, little girl.

21
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,560
Let's go spray paint funny pictures on tombstones.

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,560
Let's go make a fake bleeding head of Arnold Palmer head and launch it.

23
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,060
Let's go set up a Bob altar and worship for aliens.

24
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:56,920
Yeah!

25
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,540
Yeah, let's lure weird forces into our immediate vicinity.

26
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,140
You just go ahead and do it, Mr. Subgenius.

27
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,600
Oh, we're in it as deep as you.

28
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,660
We took money for it.

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
We know our souls are damned.

30
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,400
Not much we can do now but try to stay so fropped up.

31
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,680
We don't think about it.

32
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:28,980
Yeah!

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,200
Oh, you still friends?

34
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,420
Uh-huh.

35
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,920
Yeah, just when you thought the hour of slack was starting to make sense...

36
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,420
...finally you got your friends to listen to it.

37
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,860
Well, tonight I'm gonna just do a completely insane show.

38
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,240
Mostly for my friends.

39
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,820
Sorry.

40
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,640
This is KNON 89.3 FM.

41
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:20,140
And you can call 823-7490 for more information about anything.

42
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,600
Oh, thank y'all.

43
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:24,920
Thank you.

44
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,600
Thank you.

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
Thank you.

46
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,300
Excuse me.

47
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,520
She might hear me.

48
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,360
I don't mind.

49
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,420
I do.

50
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:39,420


51
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,960
The link for theπαinkids has been deleted.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,760
As of downtown today, Lubaina is still not in aανgardta condition.

53
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,120
Is this thing no longer safe?

54
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,780
Later, it was revealed at the thequ 다 р olga

display what genius they have the study of the substratum the foundation garment

71
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:49,900
underlying reality is the subgenius' strength for it is from the source that he or she taps the infinite resources of a force that is completely incomprehensible to humans the force of slack

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,220
the conspiracy media unable to ignore

73
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:02,140
the church has attempted to discredit it as a mere joke a pathetic satire the

74
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,480
reason slack is simply beyond their emotional grasp

75
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,620
and there you go little piece of reverend staying zone program which runs

76
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,960
on a public station down in

77
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,200
the middle of the city of New York City

78
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,200


79
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,520
Dallas the hour of slack it's called we'll be talking to him shortly as we continue on

80
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,540
why do fellows get these these feelings before they get married and it's a good

81
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,740
question but why do I care

82
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,060
well there were some drawings in Bob's textbook I didn't mean to look at them

83
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,660
honest and then some of the older girls

84
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:55,140
well you mean they talk about things sometimes yes only they stop when they see me

85
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,460
coming

86
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,940
you do sign the application get involved with the subgenius don't listen to the

87
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:11,160
little time maybe maybe 10 to 15 years into this genius community certain

88
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,840
counties yeah I was listening to this show when I was like like hours of your

89
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,160
time to helpful and helpful subgenius activities and get involved with the

90
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,960
subgenius youth group in your team

91
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,900
the dobbs pioneers boys and girls wear the red sashes around their shapely

92
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,360
waists and the black badges of unaltered authority on their peaked and visor to

93
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,760
caps oh I'm better and you you if you don't join them they'll beat you look at

94
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,000
them bucky whenever you do nobody in the room push that button no no no wait wait

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,220
wait

96
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,860
That's a cool way to go

97
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,600
The show is ruined!

98
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,520
Ruined!

99
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,700
What happens if I push this??

100
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,120
The whole show disappeared.

101
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,240
Yes, it's time to say good morning and good night and goodbye and hello.

102
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,520
And hello.

103
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,820
Associated Press, Dallas, Texas.

104
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:18,660
It began innocuously enough with three days of mind-numbing procedural debate

105
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,300
and dreary readings of committee reports.

106
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,880
Like most conventions, all about as interesting as a mole on the Pope's behind.

107
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,620
But at the end of the third day,

108
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:35,140
the First International Congress of the Church of the Subgenius erupted into a full-fledged riot

109
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,680
over the forced resignation of church leader, Reverend Ivan Stang,

110
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,780
involved in a recent no-sex scandal.

111
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,940
The cult violence, which left over 35 dead and scores more injured or missing,

112
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,580
lasted over 36 hours.

113
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,280
Curiously enough, none of the dead or injured,

114
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,420
belonged to the Church of the Subgenius.

115
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:00,200
Before the over 2,800 delegates of this newest, fastest-growing religious denomination

116
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,960
in the United States finished their work late last night,

117
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,740
the riot had spread from the Dallas Civic Center Arena to the rest of urban Dallas.

118
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,060
Defying local police and SWAT teams,

119
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,660
the subgenius, Bobby's, quote-unquote,

120
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,120
demolished over half of downtown Dallas outright.

121
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,840
And the remaining sections were soon burnt to the ground by fires.

122
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,440
Goodbye.

123
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,300
Set by dissident factions of the controversial church

124
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,300
in sporadic street confrontations

125
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,480
with more conservative sub-congregations

126
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,220
of the apparently outlawed cult.

127
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,440
A state of emergency has been called by Texas Governor Alexander Stang,

128
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,800
who declared martial law for the Love County City

129
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,040
and then mobilized local state guard reserves to restore order.

130
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,820
After a tour of the smoldering city center by helicopter this afternoon,

131
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,840
Governor Smith said that it was the saddest day the, quote,

132
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,400
city of love, unquote, had seen since that president got shot.

133
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,320
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the power.

134
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,900
It will be...

135
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,100
I am, I am to come, I was.

136
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,780
I am, I am, I am to come, I was.

137
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,380
I am, I am, I am to come, I was.

138
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,780
I am, I am, I am to come, I was.

139
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,200
I am, I am, I am to come, I was.

140
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Both male and female races have combined to form the scrotum.

141
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,460
See that clitellium grub flying overhead?

142
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,260
So does the scrotum.

143
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,840
With a flick of his neuroglia, he has obtained his lifetime supply of organic carbon.

144
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

145
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,360
All this talk is making me hot.

146
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,260
You too?

147
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,220
Me too.

148
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,760
Your mother would give me the devil of shits.

149
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,860
She would give me the devil if she were home and saw me horsing around with you this morning.

150
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:51,980
Yeah.

151
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,120
Golly, Dad, did I hurt you?

152
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,800
You know, your mother would give me the devil if she were home and saw me horsing around with you this morning.

153
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:57,980
Of course.

154
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,220
Yeah.

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:07,400
That gay poet, explorer, sailor, whose bravery did as much to open the new world as any other human being.

156
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,620
Was he not beheaded for his noble efforts?

157
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,160
That was hardly the way for mankind to show its gratitude.

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,220
Your sense of humor is macabre.

159
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,000
Were you laughing over Sir Walter's unpleasant demise?

160
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,860
Well, I did indeed find that a bit funny.

161
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:31,220
But funnier still was an incident which occurred while he still kept his head.

162
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,780
The shocking display of the art of pipe smoking horrified English royalty.

163
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,900
Sir Walter's head took terrible punishment.

164
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,720
First they bathed it in beer and then they cut it off.

165
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,300
Oh, no! Everybody's dead! Everybody's dead!

166
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,320
Dead! Everybody's dead!

167
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,240
Everybody's dead! Everybody's dead!

168
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,880
This is the human scab.

169
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,620
What sort of an enlightened world is this of which mankind boasts?

170
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,600
And which rewards discovery with a beer bath and a beheading?

171
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:25,640
And allows one man to enslave his brother and others to steal land and kill the rightful owners?

172
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,380
And those that were not killed were cheated out of their birthright?

173
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,620
Which reminds me...

174
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,140
Music news.

175
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,240
All it took was for the Pope to announce that he likes rock music.

176
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,080
Now negotiations are underway for the Pope to put out a rap record.

177
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,980
It'll be a message appealing for peace on earth.

178
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,760
A top French songwriter, Pierre Delano, has already composed the lyrics.

179
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,620
The Pope reportedly wants them toughened up a bit though, so might be back to the drawing board.

180
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,400
Belgian record producer, Eddie Lusix, who dreamed up the project, says the Pope has committed.

181
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:09,080
And that he's gonna get 30-some percent of the takings, which tops even Madonna's royalties.

182
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,320
Now...

183
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,960
He predicts that sales could top 30 million copies.

184
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,160
Making the Pope the world's highest paid pop star.

185
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,600
Hard to believe, but it's true.

186
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,080
And this is Live Wire.

187
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,260
Direct from Dallas, the Reverend Ivan Stang.

188
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,920
Welcome to Cleveland.

189
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,120
Ah, yes, dear friends.

190
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,440
Thank you so much.

191
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,540
And y'all oughta set your radios and tape recorders on stun right now.

192
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,780
Cause we're up to our necks in radio shows.

193
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,940
I'm doing a radio show right now at the same time that you are.

194
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,340
Amazing, isn't it?

195
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,020
Yeah, yeah, only we have time control. Mine airs two hours later.

196
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,740
I see.

197
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:56,060
How about a little... We got a little taste of the subgenius theology from the...

198
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,440
I played an excerpt from our audience of your own program a few moments ago, so a little taste.

199
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,900
It usually tastes better with, um... with AM and ketchup.

200
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,560
I see, I see. Well...

201
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,340
There's little taste.

202
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,700
Now, that probably... That was a few months old, so it might perhaps be...

203
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,400
um... time to update the theology for the... the coming new year.

204
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:26,100
Oh, now... Although... Although anything a subgenius says becomes orthodox doctrine, um... instantly,

205
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,040
that... that doesn't mean we have to update anything. It means the old stuff can still apply.

206
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:37,300
The truth is a very fluid thing, you know, in the... in... in Bob's teachings.

207
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,640
Well, among... among the teachings, uh, is the... is the... the, uh... thought...

208
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:42,680
Well, among... among the teachings, uh, is the... is the... the, uh... thought...

209
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,240
that, uh, the end... end times are, in fact, near, and that they could, uh...

210
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,060
they... the end times could be your stepping stone to prosperity.

211
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,060
Well, they're... they're all the more reason to party, for one thing.

212
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,720
You know, they're... they're... they're a great excuse to... to party, and they're also a good excuse.

213
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:10,340
In fact, uh, they're... they're pretty much the reason that within the next five years, I imagine,

214
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:18,700
almost all of America will be... will be fighting and killing to buy memberships in the Church of the Subgenius...

215
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,080
to save their...

216
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,640
No, no, not another religious war.

217
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,080
Oh, uh, well, all right, I mean, that's... that's what religions are all about, is it?

218
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,920
Oh, no.

219
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:37,280
That's usually how they get started, anyway, at some point or another. And that's always how they end up at some point or another.

220
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,300
And have you, um... as... as we, uh...

221
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:40,320
And have you, um... as... as we, uh...

222
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:49,560
As we, uh... as we enter, uh, the new year, we're only a few days away, have you, um, uh, come close to, uh, predicting a date?

223
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:56,900
You know, there are, uh... there is at least one religion that's predicted the end... the end, uh, what, three times now, I think, and...

224
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,740
Radiation! Dead! And everybody's dead!

225
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,700
Cause all the radiation has came out!

226
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,000
And the Russians have come!

227
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,220
To kill us with their radiation!

228
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,040
Mining the radiation!

229
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:25,080
Mining the radiation by the human scab, dear friends. Not my kid, by the way.

230
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,960
Mining the radiation!

231
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,420
Mining the radiation!

232
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,280
We'll thank you, we'll thank you.

233
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,920
Oh, dear.

234
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,440
We have to have an actual city right now. I do need to get some...

235
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,080
No, you don't. There's a giant car engine here, the car engine is...

236
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,860
Hey, you know, we're going to...

237
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,880
We're going to need that guy coming up behind us.

238
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,280
Now, you're going to have to control the vehicle through this part, Jag.

239
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:52,960
Okay.

240
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,680
You're going to have to probably steer by hand.

241
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,040
Okay, I'm deflating the engine so it's a bit smaller now. Look behind us, look at the car behind us.

242
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,040
Ooh!

243
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,660
Oh, it's a Pook. Nice and rooney, yeah. Old Pook, the old Jag.

244
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,100
Oh, there's some more stonewashed, we'll reach out in a pinch of time.

245
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,760
Nice stonewashed.

246
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,080
Yeah!

247
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,660
Well, these microphones are not only... they're cheap microphones, but they're very small.

248
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,580
What the hell is that?

249
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,460
They look almost real, though.

250
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,340
Actually, I believe they may be.

251
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,340
This guy walked by with a flight jacket with some very incredible badges.

252
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,200
Badges.

253
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,340
They look like squadron patches, but they are so popular these days.

254
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,840
With so many...

255
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,040
fake top gun jackets that usually I don't even look anymore because they're...

256
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,900
I mean, I look artistically to see what the current design is, but I'm not looking with the eye of,

257
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,080
I wonder what squadron that was, and this guy walked by and the...

258
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:55,140
One of the nice giveaways is there is a... the Navy has always had a leather name tag on the left side,

259
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,420
and so if you see a worn away name tag or a place where it was or something like that,

260
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,400
you can obviously sometimes wind up with a good jacket.

261
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:11,400
But I watched some people buy a new jacket, and these guys have sewn old jacket labels in the inside of the...

262
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,240
the new jacket, and so you wind up with this...

263
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,020
These people booing and eyeing over the new jacket, and well...

264
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,020
I didn't get any dim sum, just dumb sales.

265
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,340
Oh, no, Jim.

266
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:29,180
Well, we listened to... Gary was thrilled to listen to Jane Earn.

267
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,740
Oh, thanks.

268
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:30,900
Um...

269
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,880
Here we go.

270
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,100
Here's our first tour in this block.

271
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,100


272
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,800
Well at this point...

273
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,780
All you get, Doug, are squirt...

274
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,500
okay, wait a minute.

275
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,960
Little mikey phone.

276
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,660
You sit up there like, Doug, turn around and look at me.

277
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,060
There.

278
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,780
And you get out from behind your pills, yes...

279
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,940
From the health food store.

280
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,320
I just came from the health food store.

281
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,540
I went to get a health chicken.

282
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,100
Mmm.

283
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,380
See, I'm drinking my spirulina smoothie, and I'm taking my little, you know, those high-energy packs of,

284
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,920
supposed to have a million vitamins in them, who knows what they really do.

285
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,180
And, don't forget, the last of the other kind of supplement.

286
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,940
Because it's like, it's what I gotta do.

287
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:31,060
I have a new screen, so it can be done with a relative degree of efficiency now.

288
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,300
And, well, I better put my keys so I can turn my car off.

289
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,300
I'm thinking of about $200 or so.

290
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,860
Now, if the church can't afford it, well, I can understand that.

291
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,920
But I thought maybe you could figure out a way that you could report it as a payroll expense.

292
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,780
So that at least it's deductible.

293
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,400
But, man, I need some cash. That's what it is.

294
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,360
I need me a little cash, and I'm brokering the son of a...

295
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,580
You know the story. I'm not gonna just make you cry over and over again because it's so sad.

296
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:20,800
It's gonna be a little bit different tonight.

297
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:27,180
We are still mining the radiation.

298
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,120
Still mining the radiation.

299
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,100
Pretty show, isn't it, tonight, eh, friends?

300
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:47,880
We turn slow, and nobody comes to save us.

301
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,400
Nobody comes.

302
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,720
Just say hi!

303
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,500
Thank you.

304
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, right, right.

305
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,040
And have missed it each time.

306
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,960
And believe it or not, the religion's going stronger.

307
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,620
Now, these are the people that deliver tracks door to door, you know?

308
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,800
Oh, yeah.

309
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,560
People still are members of this religion.

310
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,800
So you could make a prediction.

311
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,400
It'd be all right.

312
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,800
It wouldn't hurt you if you were wrong.

313
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:21,240
Oh, well, we have not changed this one since Bob first received this video.

314
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,380
We did it.

315
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,620
We've were praying to God and we want to step in to his vision in 1953 and the great...

316
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:32,860
And his divine Immaculation, we call it, where he saw that on July 5th...

317
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,780
Now, folks, this is a crucial date.

318
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,260
On July 5th, 1998 at 7 o'clock in the morning right after the 4th of July, most of America

319
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,620
will have hangovers.

320
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,580
The men from Planet X will arrive.

321
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,920
And and what happens then when they 10 되� den hostel en pazum.

322
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:57,820
entirely depends on how many subgeniuses,

323
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,920
how many dues-paying members of the Church of the Subgenius

324
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,120
there are on this planet.

325
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,140
If there aren't enough,

326
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,300
and if the planet is still in the hands of the conspiracy,

327
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,740
like it is now,

328
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,420
those creatures from space will do much like we would do

329
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,820
if we found a dog hit by a car on the side of the road.

330
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,680
Do you take it to the fence?

331
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,240
No.

332
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,380
No.

333
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,260
No.

334
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,520
There's a place for us

335
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,400
Somewhere a place for us

336
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:20,960
This entire open air place for us

337
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,900
Doesn't matter if we're free or not

338
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:21,900


339
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,300
There's a time for us

340
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,000
Somewhere a time for us

341
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,560
Time together but time to spare

342
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,480
Time to love, time to care

343
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,160
Someday, somewhere

344
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,900
We'll find a place for us

345
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,240
We'll find a new way of living

346
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,720
We'll find a way of forgiving

347
00:23:59,320 --> 00:23:59,840
Somewhere

348
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,020
Someday

349
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,460
And if the planet is still in the hands of the conspiracy,

350
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,920
like it is now,

351
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,560
those creatures from space will do much like we would do

352
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,960
if we found a dog hit by a car on the side of the road.

353
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,820
You either, you know, do you take it to the vet,

354
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,880
you just shoot it and put it out of the way,

355
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:21,880


356
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,140
or you just let it go.

357
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,240
You know, what are you gonna do?

358
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,780
And the X-ists, the men from Planet X,

359
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,860
for which X-mas is named, by the way,

360
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,580
I didn't know that.

361
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,540
Yeah, that's X-ists.

362
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,180
Anyway, if they don't like what they see,

363
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,240
if Bob can't show them numbers,

364
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,880
you know, solid figures on the number of subgeniuses

365
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,340
and enlightened individuals on this planet,

366
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,780
they will, they will snuff us like, you know,

367
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,700
like we were an ant bed.

368
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,240
Gee, that's sort of what happens in the radio business.

369
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,900
We don't show them the numbers, we get snuffed.

370
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,200
Yeah, yeah, I hear that.

371
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,000
I hear that.

372
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,880
We had to have a parade to keep our station on the air reasonably.

373
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,840
A parade?

374
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,960
Yes, a parade.

375
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,560
You would have been proud to see the Dobbs float.

376
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,180
We had the mighty 17-foot-high Bob Dobbs head.

377
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,000
This wasn't Bob himself.

378
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,420
He's not that tall.

379
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,500
Being carried on a huge wooden cross down the street

380
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,360
by various martyrs for the radio station.

381
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,600
Because we have to, we don't run ads like you do,

382
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,940
and we have to raise money in less orthodox ways.

383
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,140
I understand that Bob is a very private individual

384
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,620
and relatively few people have seen him.

385
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,240
Have you seen him?

386
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,740
He is elusive.

387
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:50,320
Bob has managed to keep himself out of the eye

388
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,700
of those who seek him, okay?

389
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,740
Many of your listeners right now,

390
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,740
if they could see a picture of Bob,

391
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,440
that just normal-looking salesman with a pipe,

392
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,420
the patron saint of sales, if they could see him,

393
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,280
they might remember that at one point

394
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,960
he had sold them a vacuum cleaner or aluminum siding

395
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,200
or a set of encyclopedias.

396
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,620
He is the traveling salesman of mythology.

397
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,400
Well, in fact, according to the...

398
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,040
According to church scripture,

399
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,880
he is the most successful salesperson of all time.

400
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,420
The man who could sell anything,

401
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,200
hence the church of the subgenius, dear friends.

402
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,260
Praise Bob.

403
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,060
Help me, somebody.

404
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,900
Wither goest thou?

405
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,620
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?

406
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,060
So I was going to Tokyo. Where are you going?

407
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,280
Going over the international date line, eh?

408
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,540
Well, put in a good word for me while you're over there.

409
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,000
How many words?

410
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,900
How many words will it take for Japan to explain the show?

411
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,540
How many words are you restricted to?

412
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,540
Well, about nine.

413
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,480
It's a caution, I tell you.

414
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,940
In our language.

415
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,420
In the language of the earth people,

416
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,480
a sublimity has been passed off as corruption of the grave.

417
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,020
And the crawling worm inhabits the marble of ancient monuments,

418
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,900
while the tomtit and the pertwee twiddle in the trees.

419
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:28,520
And if they did not floating about today...

420
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,300
They mean out of time...

421
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:29,660
I'm not oopsin'!

422
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,920
What's on your face?

423
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:31,920


424
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,700
I tell you, people call it an open tree,

425
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,160
because all they have to do is look at the sky.

426
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,840
You know exactly what's on your face.

427
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,080
It knows how big and how big.

428
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,700
This is earth-dense rechargeable equilibrium,

429
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,580
as it leans against the wall.

430
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,600
As it's dropping the vibration of the paw

431
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,120
as it bounces on the ground.

432
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,580
And the voice within me keeps repeating.

433
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,900
It does, doesn't it?

434
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,620
All right, so you didn't answer the question.

435
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,900
Have you actually seen Bob?

436
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,720
I fear the day that I might see Bob.

437
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,940
Unlike so many of the Bobbies,

438
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,760
these follower types,

439
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,800
see, this is a church that's for people

440
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,160
who are not joiners.

441
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,020
So there's sort of a contradiction.

442
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,540
Yeah, indeed, a contradiction there.

443
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,540
Yeah, yeah.

444
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,320
And, well, it draws on contradictions

445
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,760
and oxymorons,

446
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,580
much like subgeniuses.

447
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,540
You know, you get,

448
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,720
people hear that word and they think,

449
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,720
church is subgenial.

450
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,920
What is that, like Mensa?

451
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,020
And it's the opposite, dear friends.

452
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,780
It's not the intelligence.

453
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,580
It's how you use it.

454
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,300
And Bob said you had to,

455
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,380
you had to have fun with it.

456
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,260
That's where the conspiracy defines intelligence wrong

457
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,160
and defines it more on the basis of

458
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,100
your test scores and your looks and your earnings.

459
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,500
And they have been programming us this way for,

460
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,700
since Atlantis,

461
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,760
since the good Bob split from the bad Bob.

462
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,220
And every time...

463
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,380
Bob then was a salesman only before this split.

464
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,640
Bob,

465
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,240
Bob has always been a salesman.

466
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,780
I see.

467
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,720
The eternal Bob is,

468
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,260
it's all sales.

469
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,720
It's all sales.

470
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,880
You know, when you're,

471
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,000
when you're on a date, you're selling.

472
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,540
You know, when you put makeup on.

473
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,040
Hallelujah.

474
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,100
And when,

475
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,700
when some of the rival cults get on the air,

476
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,840
they are selling.

477
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,840
But they're not selling slack.

478
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,040
Bob is selling slack.

479
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,960
That's really our main commodity.

480
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,280
We will trade slack for,

481
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,640
not all of your soul,

482
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,180
but just a little bit of your soul.

483
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,160
And we'll give it back when we're through with it.

484
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,560
After X day.

485
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,540
Yeah.

486
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,920
And how would you define slack?

487
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,380
I assume while slack is a word familiar to most,

488
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,600
it might have some special meaning within the church.

489
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,080
Well, you know, as the hell's angels say,

490
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,060
those who say don't know and those who know don't say,

491
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,140
which makes me wonder why they said it.

492
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,140
But slack is...

493
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:15,740
But slack is...

494
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,440
I've heard the expression,

495
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,540
there ain't no slack in the world.

496
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,560
Oh, come on, give me some slack, so forth.

497
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,660
It's,

498
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,900
it's a state that makes,

499
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,440
it, it,

500
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,780
we were all born with original slack.

501
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,920
Original slack.

502
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,960
But the conspiracy from the moment they

503
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,300
whacked you on the behind when you were born,

504
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,220
they started taking away your slack.

505
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,220
Now, slack by definition is indefinable

506
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,160
because it's the,

507
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,780
it's different for each person.

508
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,020
Some people get slack working

509
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,640
if they're doing the kind of work they,

510
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,640
they like.

511
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,580
And, you know, others get slack in much more

512
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,200
earthy ways.

513
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,080
So you never,

514
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,120
the conspiracy would have everyone

515
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,360
getting slack the same way,

516
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,320
which is like, oh,

517
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,100
if I had that second VCR

518
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,040
so I could make,

519
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,420
so I could copy rented tapes,

520
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,900
then I'd have slack.

521
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,800
If I could just get that raised,

522
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,060
then I'd have slack.

523
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,680
But they don't think about their soul.

524
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,580
And they don't think about

525
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,720
the fact that they're not,

526
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,680
that Bob Dobbs offers them

527
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,760
eternal salvation

528
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,180
or triple their money back.

529
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,300
And I don't know of any other religion

530
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,900
that can make that claim.

531
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,660
I don't understand, though,

532
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,080
if the...

533
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,100
Please do not use this show

534
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,400
to grade our general,

535
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,580
our general expertise

536
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,260
as non-human beings.

537
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,400
However, you can use the show

538
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,240
to grate cheese.

539
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,140
Yes?

540
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,620
It's great cheese on the show.

541
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,540
a large chunk of cheddar cheese

542
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,560
up against your radio

543
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,180
right now and see what happens.

544
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,720
Just watch.

545
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,660
Watch the little show waves.

546
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,180
Cut it up and pretty soon

547
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,280
it'll look like Swiss cheese.

548
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,220
But it's strong smelling cheese,

549
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,080
isn't it, Reverend?

550
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,680
It'll turn your mind around.

551
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,740
In fact, it's head cheese.

552
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:56,700
Yup.

553
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,940
Yep, that's for sure for you.

554
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,440
Wild cheese.

555
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,340
Wild cheese.

556
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,560
Early in the morning.

557
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,900
Every week to the sweetbread show.

558
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:04,960
Now, we're not going to be honest.

559
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,360
What a disgusting idea.

560
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,560
Bleeding head cheese?

561
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,840
I'm sorry.

562
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,680
That idea is past paying for.

563
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,860
But look, there's a little collar

564
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,160
glistening on the board.

565
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,160
We might want to see

566
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,680
if this little twerp has

567
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,340
the last word on something

568
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:18,760
in the show.

569
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:18,880
Yes, yes.

570
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,180
Let's hurt him.

571
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,220
Give him 2,000 volts, doctor.

572
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,840
Let's get a collar in and hurt him.

573
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,540
Focus the interocular on the collar.

574
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,480
I think we have a guest.

575
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,640
It'll be a pleasure to

576
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,960
Yes, I think it's the other show.

577
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,680
It was fighting to get in.

578
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,400
We won.

579
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

580
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,780
Collar gone.

581
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,300
He tried to be there.

582
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,300
Not work.

583
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:37,560
...

584
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,280
Oh, okay.

585
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:39,820
Yeah, I will.

586
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,340
I will. Thanks.

587
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,520
Must reach oxygen switch.

588
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,940
Goodbye forever from all of us.

589
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,600
Almost goodbye.

590
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,040
Yeah, almost.

591
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,140
Must reach oxygen switch.

592
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,840
About seconds away.

593
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,200
Goodbye.

594
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:46,820
Oxygen switch.

595
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,560
As we watch the...

596
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,320
Can't take it.

597
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:49,940
...show.

598
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,840
We'd like to thank

599
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,560
our little greyhound bus rider,

600
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,980
Dr. Evan Tanks,

601
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,300
for coming all the way here

602
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,160
to help us help you help him

603
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,420
get royalties.

604
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,260
Thank you.

605
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:02,720
That's right.

606
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,600
All of you get royalties

607
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,560
who are listening also, right?

608
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,780
The Subdini Foundation.

609
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,500
... scheduled.

610
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,440
Subdini Foundation.

611
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,740
A giant prophet healed.

612
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,160
We want you to know that

613
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,480
your show dollars

614
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,260
follow California.

615
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,700
The son of the vengeful Tim Kare.

616
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,960
Yeah, and, you know,

617
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,460
call the other subgeniuses

618
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,220
on your show

619
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,520
and find out what's going on.

620
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,240
Isn't he dying?

621
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,820
Doug, this is Judy.

622
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,740
Could you give me a call at...

623
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,800
...not an animal...

624
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,460
...satruism

625
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,600
to be part of our religious experience show,

626
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,600
of which, without you,

627
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,720
would not be complete.

628
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,660
So feel free to call.

629
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,880
So please call, collect, ask for...

630
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,020
...and, Magnusson.

631
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,540
...and...

632
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,300
...and...

633
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:51,740
...and...

634
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:52,900
...and...

635
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,260
...and...

636
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,880
Hello, this is Ann Magnusson

637
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,700
calling from Manhattan, TS1.

638
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,320
Um...

639
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,960
God, this is an alienating experience.

640
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,600
I tried calling this number the other night.

641
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,220
Yes, dang.

642
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,000
This is Lance.

643
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,700
Do you know where my socks are?

644
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,720
Yes, I do. Call.

645
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,620
315...

646
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,300
2...

647
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:15,740
...2...

648
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:15,780
...2...

649
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,380
I don't...

650
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,740
...understand.

651
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,020
...2...

652
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,180
...2...

653
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:23,620
...2...

654
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:23,620


655
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,780
Doug, are you there?

656
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,580
This is Eileen.

657
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,480
Uh, if Shelby is there, that would be great.

658
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,140
But, anyway, uh, it's 12-15...

659
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,420
Oh, they're over at the hospital.

660
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,980
Oh, okay, you're at the hospital.

661
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,520
Have a good time.

662
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,040
And I hope everything's going okay.

663
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,800
All right?

664
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,380
Goodbye.

665
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:45,960
Bye.

666
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:53,120
All right, thank you.

667
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:56,960
You're welcome.

668
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,780
This is James.

669
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,780
Good luck.

670
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:01,320
Bye.

671
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,020
Bye.

672
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:04,780
Bye.

673
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,180
Bye.

674
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:07,760


675
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,060
Bye.

676
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:09,240
Bye.

677
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:09,260
Bye.

678
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:09,540
Bye.

679
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:09,800
Bye.

680
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,100
Bye.

681
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,160


682
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:10,320


683
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:10,320


684
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:10,320


685
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:10,320


686
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:10,320


687
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:10,480
Bye.

688
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:11,500
Bye.

689
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:11,560
Bye.

690
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:11,580


691
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:11,580


692
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,540
The South was under working, running away to have fun

693
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,680
The father was stupid, but he had two sons

694
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,640
Run, run

695
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,260
Tired of running, he was running outside

696
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,600
Shopping at his skin, a torch on his hide

697
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,740
His finger on the trigger, a man who was eating

698
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,980
Shopping at a given South was in a situation

699
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,140
Run, run

700
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,300
Run, run

701
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,100
Run, run

702
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:44,660
Hello

703
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,880
Hello

704
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,280
Mama

705
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:59,520
Mah CAMERA

706
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,680
Manure

707
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,700
Manure

708
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,280
inequitable

709
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,120
Unekkable

710
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,220
Unieso

711
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:10,440
You move.

712
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,560
Move.

713
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,320
Come in.

714
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,820
Are you there?

715
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,160
Are you there, Shelby?

716
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,840
Doug, hi.

717
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:26,740
It's Laura York at Fireside, and everybody's calling because they want to know where High Weirdness is.

718
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,420
Laura?

719
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,820
Doug, hi.

720
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,260
Yeah.

721
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,620
Happy birthday to you.

722
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,480
Happy birthday.

723
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,840
Happy birthday to Shelby.

724
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,700
See you later.

725
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,240
You are in.

726
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,200
Hi, Byron.

727
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:43,660
Hi.

728
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,820
This is Vandy.

729
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,980
Hi, Vandy.

730
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,000
Is your dad around anywhere?

731
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,620
He's asleep.

732
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:49,800
He's asleep.

733
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,460
Okay.

734
00:36:50,960 --> 00:37:00,780
Well, he has a videotape of my bachelor party.

735
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,760
He has a videotape of the bachelor party.

736
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,040
Mm-hmm.

737
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:10,200
And I just wanted to tell him that I don't want him to make any copies of it.

738
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,420
All right.

739
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,280
Okay?

740
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,380
Okay.

741
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,340
You got that?

742
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,000
Yeah.

743
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:22,720
Uh, you, you, you, your dad has been sending me some of your drawings, or Xeroxes of your drawings.

744
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,680
I think they're real cool, and I think you should continue drawing.

745
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,100
Thanks.

746
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,680
Sure.

747
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:34,960
Okay, well, tell your dad the, the message I gave you about the, the videotapes, okay?

748
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,620
Okay.

749
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,520
That, that if he wants to call me, he can.

750
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,800
3300, give me a call, please.

751
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,420
Hey, Victor?

752
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,580
Doug, this is Nancy.

753
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:50,120
I just talked to the guy running the Nolacon, and he wanted to know if you were, if you

754
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:55,520
would be willing to do some kind of a slideshow for the regular programing outside with the

755
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:55,900
Bible.

756
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,020
Uh, Becky, this is Doug.

757
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,680
ita, you on the phone.

758
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,280
Hi, Doug and Shelby.

759
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,140
Jan Johnson here, just checking in with you folks.

760
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,200
Um, things are going pretty well out at the moment.

761
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,200


762
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:17,360
up here, things progressing with our TV show. Just cracked the technical problem of taking

763
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:23,680
the Mac 2 video image, computer images and putting them onto NTS video, which is pretty

764
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,720
exciting. Zontar is coming together and I will be in touch.

765
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:34,760
Well, thank you too. This is Owen Ann calling from Knoxville and I guess I'll call back

766
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,020
soon.

767
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Hey, Doug, thanks for your call today. This is Donna Kaufman and I look forward to

768
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,140
getting that package of goodies as soon as possibly.

769
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:59,100
Hey, man. This is Flipper, man. Listen, you humans really blew it. I mean, you got the

770
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:05,000
whole thing wrong. I was just talking to Bob and he said, you know, I'm not going to be

771
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:10,540
home. Oh, man. You know, I mean, you think, I mean, you think that you can actually talk

772
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:17,740
to dolphins or even that, you know, we're going to be here. Man, there's so much more

773
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:24,060
to it that you can't even imagine. Okay. So like, just get off your high horse. Just,

774
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:30,220
you humans just blew it. Well, I'm not sure. Anyway, we're not seeing.

775
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,180
Lee, are you home yet?

776
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,180


777
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,940
Will you tell baby to call me when he gets home? Bye.

778
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:44,880
I've talked to Stan a bunch this afternoon. Give me a yo when you have time at home at

779
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,140
two to.

780
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,180
Doug, this is DJ at Kinko's.

781
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:59,800
Hi, Doug. Court. I need to talk to you. I finished the online, so for instance, reinserting

782
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,160
the artwork. So I'm going to do next week. I'm going to do the next week. I'm going to

783
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:12,480
send Dennis the tapes. But I want to talk to you about the soundtrack. So give me a

784
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:12,680
call.

785
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:26,720
If Dobbs is the is the the eternal sales person, why then would why then would the the the church

786
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:34,160
dogma suggest that purchasing these these goods would not, in fact, get you the online?

787
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,580
No, it just doesn't work.

788
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:40,440
No, if I was not then it might be thought.

789
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:54,880
Did I just say they found see-through, the

790
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,240
whole?

you working that job for a lot of you you know and and slack and money are

793
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,800
very closely intertwined particularly in this culture it's very hard to have

794
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,040
slack without any money but it is possible and as long as you can get

795
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:27,980
slack for free the conspiracy cannot win and that's why Bob can make that

796
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:36,000
guarantee and why we have faith that that Bob will save us all on next day

797
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:46,960
that's faithful day we call it when when the pinks the normals the mediocrity to

conspiracy has 50,000 nuclear weapons poised ready to fire and the Church of

805
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,960
the subgenius only has three and yet we have a conspiracy that's so insidious

806
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,040
that we dare to fight them anyway

00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,480

828
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:12,620
The ramifications of our extenuating exigence.

829
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,280
Indeed. Indeed, it only makes sense.

830
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,260
This is the potatoes.

831
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,540
Little girl went out last night.

832
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,760
Lost her head and went out of sight.

833
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,040
Milk truck zooming down the street.

834
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,400
Smushed her pennilike roadside meat.

835
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,600
Had her head went rolling on,

836
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,420
rolling on down the road.

837
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,200
Yes, her head went rolling on,

838
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,040
rolling on down the road.

839
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,940
Had a date with Bobby Sue

840
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,420
She was on her way when I heard the news

841
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,600
Had visions of a driving score

842
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,040
Instead I got blood and gore

843
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,000
Cause her head went rolling on, rolling on down the road

844
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,600
Her head went rolling on down the road

845
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,620
Yes, her head went rolling on, rolling on down the road

846
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,220
Her head went rolling on down the road

847
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,820
In the twisted metal

848
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,460
And the jagged steel

849
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:06,840
Her head played croquet on the steering wheel

850
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,220
Her head was ripped and torn and pulled from her neck

851
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,420
The bloody torso did twitch and the rack

852
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,540
And her head was rollin' on, rollin' on down the road

853
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:20,180
Her head was rollin' on down the road

854
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:24,180
Yes, her head was rollin' on, rollin' on down the road

855
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,720
Her head was rollin' on down the road

856
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,000
Her head was rolling on down the road

857
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,220
Her head was rolling on down the road

858
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,560
In the sickly sweet moment of agony

859
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,100
My little day was an ecstasy

860
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,580
I'll never forget that tragic night

861
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,460
Her severed wig blew us

862
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:26,700
Ah!

863
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,200
And her head went rolling on

864
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,000
Rolling on down the road

865
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,620
Her head went rolling on down the road

866
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:33,980
Yes!

867
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,800
Her head went rolling on

868
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,580
Rolling on down the road

869
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:40,260
Her head went rolling on down the road

870
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,700
Her head went rolling on down the road

871
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,720
Her head went rolling on down the road

872
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,700
Her head went rolling on down the road

873
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:55,500
Oh, oh, oh

874
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:55,920
Oh

875
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:55,920


876
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:55,920

00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,940
The Potatoes from right here in Dallas.

879
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,640
Thank you, Potatoes.

880
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,340
In fact, for all we know, the conspiracy is so insidious

881
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,620
that for all you and I know,

882
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,420
Bob Dobbs could already be Big Brother.

883
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,200
Could be.

884
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:24,320
Could be?

885
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,260
You know, if he's who he said he was.

886
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,180
Could be.

887
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,860
Once again, a very rare opportunity for you here.

888
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:36,540
We have the co-founder and the current leader

889
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:38,220
of the Church of the Subgenius.

890
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,900
No, no, no, Bob is the leader.

891
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:40,720
Oh, Bob, Bob.

892
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,260
Bob is our leader.

893
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,900
I am merely but the sacred scribe.

894
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:44,240
Nice.

895
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,380
Dr. Philo Drummond and I were, I will admit,

896
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:52,980
the first two of Bob's 10 billion fishers of wallets as apostles.

897
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,180
Pardon me.

898
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:54,420
The error.

899
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,700
Yeah, yeah.

900
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,240
I'm in the ocean.

901
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:03,460
Golden fields where everything has nothing but chasing butterflies.

902
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:04,660
Cats.

903
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:11,420
See, cats go to cat heaven, but bad cats go to cat hell,

904
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,700
which is the same as dog heaven.

905
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,500
And the bad cats that were bad on Earth

906
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,420
have to spend eternity being chased by dogs on,

907
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,820
in dog heaven.

908
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,340
That's a fit punishment.

909
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,940
I hate those bastards anyway.

910
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,160
Yeah, Dougie boy.

911
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,320
Doug.

912
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,300
Hey, Doug.

913
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,420
I know you're there, Doug.

914
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,680
It's 635-04-05-06.

915
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,980
This is Reverend Huey.

916
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,480
I sent you a tape, but you didn't send me a card or a phone call.

917
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:45,760
Caller.

918
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,880
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up.

919
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,120
I'm calling because I saw the number on the back of a pamphlet

920
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,940
about the Pope's secrets.

921
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,040
Uh-huh.

922
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:08,160
And I was reading about it, and I was curious about more information

923
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,260
and how can we verify this very frightening information

924
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,840
about the Pope's secrets?

925
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:20,100
Well, there's a list on the back of the Pope's secrets.

926
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:20,960
Mm-hmm.

927
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,900
There are several books that we have available.

928
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,900
If you're interested in looking at more information on it.

929
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:30,140
And then, of course, there's different information that are in the footnotes.

930
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:33,340
This is John Truby calling Tony Alamo.

931
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,140
Right.

932
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:40,000
Now, how is this information dug up regarding the secrets of the Pope?

933
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,660
Well, it's all based on the Bible,

934
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,860
and specifically chapters 17 and 18 of Revelation.

935
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,500
And what do those chapters say?

936
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,500
Well, have you read them?

937
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:53,500
Uh-huh.

938
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:58,280
I've referred to them, but I haven't read them in a while.

939
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:02,080
Well, it gives a description of the whore of Revelation.

940
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,040
Uh-huh.

941
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,260
It talks about where her headquarters are located at

942
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,640
and all the different things about the whore of Revelation

943
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:16,780
and in detail so that you would be sure that you would know who she is.

944
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:22,440
But how do we know this was specifically reforged to the Pope?

945
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:28,060
Well, you know, because, you know, the Pope was a religious leader.

946
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:33,940
And a lot of it makes sense in that he would be corrupted.

947
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:43,260
But in Revelation, there's such a general outline that it could reforge just about anything.

948
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,540
Well, no, it's very specific.

949
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:46,780
Uh-huh.

950
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:50,720
It says that her headquarters are in the city of the Seven Hills and the Seven Mountains.

951
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,240
It's important.

952
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,880
If you went to any travel...

953
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,440
If you went to any travel agency in the world and asked to send you there,

954
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,120
that city of the Seven Hills, they'd send you to Rome, Italy.

955
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,260
Couldn't it also be San Francisco?

956
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,760
Because that's a lot of hills there.

957
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:02,740
Well, no.

958
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,000
If you went to a travel agency, they'd tell you Rome, Italy.

959
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:05,580
Oh.

960
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,580
It's a pretty well-known historical fact.

961
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,420
It has been for many hundreds of years.

962
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,260
Uh-huh.

963
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:18,720
But, also, how can me, as a normal person, citizen,

964
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,020
defend myself against the Pope?

965
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,320
And what he's doing and all that stuff?

966
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,840
Well, would you like me to send you some information?

967
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:33,340
Um, I really can't because I don't have an address because I do live out in the street.

968
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,000
I am what they call a transient, unfortunately.

969
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:40,260
Um, but I can vote.

970
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,840
That's one thing that I can do.

971
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:48,000
Now, should I vote against the Pope in the next election or what do you think?

972
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,880
Or is there some way that I, as an average citizen, could...

973
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,220
could battle against the forces of evil?

974
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,980
Well, first of all, you have to be born again in the spirit of God.

975
00:51:59,060 --> 00:51:59,920
Have you ever been saved?

976
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:05,140
I was baptized many, many years ago in...

977
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:12,820
in the Buddhist temple, but I don't know how I can become born again.

978
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,840
How can I become born again?

979
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,480
Because I'd like to be if I can, if I will be saved.

980
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:21,000
Well, Jesus said that you must be born again.

981
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,620
And the way you do that is you...

982
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,240
you have to repent of your sins.

983
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,180
You have to ask the Lord to have mercy upon your soul,

984
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,480
to come into your heart and wash all your sins away.

985
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,760
And you have to believe that He died on the cross for your sins

986
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,360
and He rose from the grave on the third day

987
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:41,100
and He is right now standing at the right hand of God.

988
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:43,460
He sees and knows everything you do.

989
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:47,120
And that one of these days when the breath leaves our body,

990
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,780
we're going to stand before God and He's going to judge.

991
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:51,260
Um, and...

992
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,060
He... He...

993
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,680
He... You said that He knows everything we do?

994
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,480
Does He know...

995
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,980
Oh, you see, uh, friends, these, uh, calls by...

996
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:03,340

...music train.

998
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,680
But, I want to ask the one question.

999
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:14,440
In the last election did you vote for rectal...

1000
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:15,400
..beasy?

1001
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,960
I don't understand that.

1002
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,900
Well, rectal beasy...

1003
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:21,460
Had... had...

1004
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:26,140
But no, you're not sorry you want to destroy

00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,100
