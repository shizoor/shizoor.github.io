1
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:28,740
Okay, I'm going now to shift from being the big boss of this area on stage over to there

2
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,840
where the fake hour of slack will begin.

3
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,000
This area is equally important as that area.

4
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,500
Yes, and welcome, Ivan Stang, to this particular area.

5
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:52,940
I'm Dr. Howland Owl, and I'm ready to assist as long as it is within my poor power to do so

6
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:58,480
to carry these important ceremonial and symbolic functions forward.

7
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:04,660
In the way which we have sanctified by frequent unremitting use.

8
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:14,820
That's right, friends. It's not like this is the first time that we have sat waiting for the saucers.

9
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,740
We've had a lot of practice with this.

10
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,220
They're coming from a long way away, it must be remembered, by any standard of measurement.

11
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,360
They have a long, long parabola to travel.

12
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,520
Yes.

13
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,540
It could be that we've been doing something wrong.

14
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,920
It could be that there hasn't been enough of something to make it worth their trip.

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,180
Now, obviously, we have enough subgeniuses.

16
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,320
There's at least 50 of them signed up already for this festival.

17
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,780
There's compression and compaction.

18
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,100
It's possible to accommodate many more.

19
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,000
Remember, one subgenius is worth 100 pings.

20
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,060
So it's as if we had 500 people here right now.

21
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,360
If they were people, yeah, people, sure.

22
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:11,740
And I trust everyone who is gathered at this assembly point is ready, physically and spiritually,

23
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,540
to board the escape vessels.

24
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,800
And financially ready.

25
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,340
We assume that you all have your membership card in your pocket.

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,960
Now, I talked to one young lady who said she didn't have her membership card, had no proof.

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,620
But I asked her, where is your?

28
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,200
You've got to have a scar.

29
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,200


30
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,700
And sure enough, on her ankle, and I remembered seeing it before when she was ritually initiated,

31
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,680
a little penguin drawn originally by either Paul Mavridis or Dr. Howell here next to me,

32
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,400
I can't remember, etched onto her leg.

33
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,540
So I know she's ready for the saucers.

34
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,920
I've spent my 30 bucks.

35
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:57,020
In 1997, in fact, I bought my membership from the Subgenius Foundation.

36
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,720
And I didn't even have to invest.

37
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,720
I endorsed the check myself.

38
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,100
Those were the days.

39
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,340
I've got that card in my pocket, friends.

40
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:12,800
Because I don't, but we don't want to be rising up, possibly tearing through the wood of this pavilion

41
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,880
if we're not wise and move outdoors.

42
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:22,500
I don't want to watch, I don't want to have to look down and see a subgenius or two down here with tears rolling down their face going,

43
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,440
but why?

44
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,560
Why?

45
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,340
I spent my $30.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,720
Oh, yeah.

47
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:28,720


48
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,720
Well, it was Canadian, $4 if it was Canadian money.

49
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,580
Uh-uh.

50
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,760
That won't do it, friends.

51
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,200
You're left behind.

52
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,000
Just like in those Christian, those abysmally terrible Christian movies.

53
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:47,560
How curious that they should want U.S. dollars when even the Canadian loonie has eclipsed

54
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,340
the U.S. dollar in value.

55
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,800
It doesn't matter.

56
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,340
It says dollars in the scriptures.

57
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:55,860
Exactly.

58
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,940
That means dollars.

59
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,800
That means...

60
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,380
They want dollars.

61
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:03,620
American dollars, not Australian dollars, not more, I think, more pork dollars.

62
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,100
They want that molecular structure, that greasy paper handled by the sweat of desperation

63
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:18,440
of countless hands of pinks permeated with all sorts of unfulfilled desires and percolating

64
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,980
with strangeness and yearning.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,540
They don't want some suave foreign country's more valuable money.

66
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,840
Although they will accept credit cards.

67
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:29,260
Yeah.

68
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,620
Well, there is that because the yearning and desperation are far greater in the emanation

69
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,840
and the aura there.

70
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,360
But the dollar is a primordial thing.

71
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:46,680
They claim that they'll never change the dollar, even as they're going to refit and refigure

72
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,920
all U.S. money for the blind, or pardon me, the differently sighted, the dollar will be

73
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,920
left alone.

74
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,980
So that...

75
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,520
Yeah.

76
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,160
Whatever they feel, it'll still be a dollar.

77
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,620
Everything else, well, you won't recognize it at all.

78
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,600
From PR News in Washington.

79
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,600
From PR News in Washington.

80
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm still down slightly.

81
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,440
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice predicts the downward trend will continue.

82
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,280
I anticipate continuous decline well into middle of 2009.

83
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,960
President Bush is the focus of PR's hearings today.

84
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,740
Today's hearing is on President Bush.

85
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,820
But John Conyers reeks of PR news in a formal setting.

86
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,500
It's no secret that this is sexy and this is sex.

87
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,140
Externs can be botched.

88
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,300
The Boeing 747 had 20,000 feet.

89
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,600
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama left a gaping hole in the fuselage.

90
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,800
Near one of the wings.

91
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,120
Some of the 346 passengers dropped down.

92
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,960
On Wall Street 7-11-3-6-8-2-8-2.

93
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,940
The president's office is now closed.

94
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:55,940


95
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:55,940


96
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,000
This is PR News.

97
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,000
A computer science professor is in Colorado today.

98
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,620
PR News in Melbourne.

99
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,060
PR News in Pittsburgh.

100
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,540
And in Washington.

101
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,140
This is PR News.

102
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,180
PR comes from PR.

103
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,520
PR News.

104
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,180
Now another thing that the exes require is the spirit.

105
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:21,340
Maybe, maybe we had enough people, we had enough money, but we didn't have enough spirit.

106
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,880
They flew by and they looked down and they said, well, they're just standing around.

107
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,340
I don't see a single, I don't see a single group orgy in the field all copulating.

108
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,380
They must be too shy or ugly or something.

109
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,720
And friends, we understand.

110
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,800
Yes, it's true.

111
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,460
Most of us are too shy.

112
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,640
I myself have never copulated in that field in a big orgy, although I will, I have many

113
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,800
times had to step over humping bodies in this very campground.

114
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,500
Grass stained.

115
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:54,820
Grass stained.

116
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,180
That's another thing that the aliens want to see.

117
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,400
We call them aliens, but really they were around before us.

118
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,040
We're the aliens.

119
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,560
They need good breeding stock.

120
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,660
To them, maybe we're the monsters.

121
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,560
The children of the gods came down among the people.

122
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,220
The Nephilim.

123
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,520
Yes.

124
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,560
And they found some of the human women.

125
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,480
They saw the daughters of the gods.

126
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,920
They saw the daughters of man and took them onto them as wives.

127
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,100
And lo, the earth was filled with these.

128
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:40,560
And Jehovah One was most displeased because of the adulteration of the gene pool.

129
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:48,100
And also because of the population problems, which automatically accrue when one lives

130
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,120
600, 700, 900 years.

131
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,460
Which was a result of the...

132
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,140
The Nephilim human breeding problem.

133
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,340
There were giants in the earth in those days, friends.

134
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,700
The sons of Anak, in whose sight we were as grasshoppers.

135
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,060
And not very big grasshoppers either.

136
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,120
But today, today these giants, these gods are called by the name of an animal.

137
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:23,140
They're called silly names like Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Abominable Snowflake.

138
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,440
Snowflake.

139
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:24,560
The king of the snowman.

140
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,600
Just belittling them.

141
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,020
But it's never the superior who belittles the inferior.

142
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:37,180
It's never the superior who says to the inferior, I'm just as good as you.

143
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,000
No, that always goes upward.

144
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:48,560
And we aspire to fill those enormous shoes of those gigantic prehistoric progenitors.

145
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,480
But aspire in vain.

146
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,420
Our foot size, like the size of our spirit, will not keep them.

147
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:54,420


148
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:54,420


149
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:03,860
Never expand enough to fill those castoffs until we are truly filled with the spirit of Bob.

150
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,200
You have to be Bigfoot in your spirit.

151
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,160
You have to be Bigfoot in your heart.

152
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,900
You have to be Bigfoot in your groin.

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,800
Or in some cases, we do have some big heads here.

154
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,460
That's true. Not swelled heads, but naturally large heads.

155
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:31,400
Large, almost inhumanly large craniums, making one a bit top-heavy.

156
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,120
I wouldn't want to brag myself. I only have a mere size 8 3⁄4 hat size.

157
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,300
That's pretty good, actually.

158
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:46,700
There are greater ones here, bigger bosses of the cranial area, perhaps.

159
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,780
I don't know. I think we maybe should have...

160
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,960
We could have a measurement contest.

161
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:51,740
That's right.

162
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,780
When two boys are fighting, the girls say, well, maybe we ought to get a ruler.

163
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,240
We could make helmets for everyone.

164
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,920
But we need a tape measure.

165
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,520
Slack helms.

166
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:09,180
Now, see, DJ Shaver is pointing to Reverend Skull, who has quite a large skull.

167
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,860
They don't call him that for nothing.

168
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,580
But the size of the skull is not necessarily correlating to the intelligence of the brain.

169
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,560
Yes, that's what I would say.

170
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,640
And besides that, whoever gave a...

171
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,200
I'm not a hoot about intelligence in the Church of the Subgenius.

172
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:30,880
The fact is, Reverend Richard Skull does have a large head, but he has, like the Pachycephalosaurus,

173
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,520
it's actually hollow and is used for mating purposes.

174
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,000
He slams his head against the other big heads.

175
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,560
Not hollow, but solid bone is what I think you meant to say.

176
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,180
Well, no, in his case it resonates.

177
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,780
It's for the gray matter within.

178
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,400
The precious jelly.

179
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:57,300
So it could be that what the exes want to see when they hover over brushwood is a bunch

180
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,980
of large men butting each other in the head like mountain goats.

181
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,500
This is suppositional, theoretical.

182
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,420
We might try that this year.

183
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,460
We don't know.

184
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:15,360
And you can't force us old-timey subgeniuses to come up with these new ideas and experiments to try.

185
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,800
It's up to you folks.

186
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,760
We're hundreds of years old.

187
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:23,220
I would try it, but these nosebleeds I have keep me on my back.

188
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,760
Otherwise, I'd be out there smashing my head with the rest of you loyalists.

189
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,020
That's right, but they need us here.

190
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,240
This program is presented by the Centers for Disease People.

191
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,160
The good news is, old age still has its downside.

192
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,840
Reflexes slow, eyesight fades, and we lose that spring in our step.

193
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,760
According to a recent study,

194
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,840
if necessary, eliminate people over the age of 65.

195
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,000
So let's gird our loins for the struggle which lies ahead.

196
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:07,220
For we must be not simple passengers, sheep-like, bleating would-be travelers,

197
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,080
inching and bumbling our way up the landing ramps,

198
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,620
but striding up like mighty men of old.

199
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,100
You better get that.

200
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,040
And...

201
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,260
In doing so, all our new found friends, the exists,

202
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,040
with the strength and might of our purpose and resolve.

203
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,140
And if so, we'll be rewarded as seen on these screens.

204
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,600
Look, even Hitler has been resurrected and made good.

205
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,320
Things are supposed to be in 3D.

206
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,420
Hitler's Hitler.

207
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,060
And all your pornography will be in 3D.

208
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,240
If you but have faith in not only 3D,

209
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,900
but it'll be...

210
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,960
It'll be real.

211
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,860
You'll be in feel-o-vision.

212
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,820
Because you'll be really feeling that squamous alien sex monster

213
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,160
and thinking she's a beautiful sex goddess.

214
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,380
Ah, yes.

215
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,220
I wake up that way every morning because I'm married to one of them.

216
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,340
As long as I keep my eyes closed when lightning strikes.

217
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,100
There's a psychological aspect to it.

218
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,840
What you think is so essentially is so.

219
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,860
Beyond this, we're not going to go.

220
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,980
So, any objective...

221
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,320
Any objective eyes, if there were any left at that time,

222
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,200
might think these pleasure saucer sex goddesses

223
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,200
were some unthinkably horrible organism.

224
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,340
But fortunately, they send powerful chemical signals,

225
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:39,820
which will make your union with them as ecstatic as it is possible to be,

226
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,840
given the limitations of protoplasm and this physical universe.

227
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,680
The married subgeniuses here are going to have to have,

228
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,000
open minds when that day comes.

229
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,920
But see, that's the point of it.

230
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,860
Your mind will be laid bare.

231
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,620
Everything, everything ever hidden will be revealed.

232
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,760
And so, you better be ready for some embarrassments, friends.

233
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,520
Jack T. Chick isn't entirely wrong.

234
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:05,700
That's right.

235
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,080
The prophet Jack T. Chick, although he got a few details wrong,

236
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,220
such as the name of the aliens,

237
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,560
was right.

238
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,960
There are recording angels.

239
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,860
But that part where everything you ever did,

240
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,340
or thought, will be shown on a giant wide screen,

241
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,940
in full detail, in color, and sense around,

242
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,960
and dynorama, the new miracle of the screen.

243
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,300
All will be shown, and nothing will be hidden.

244
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,100
And there will be plenty of time for each and every sapient being

245
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,320
to muse on your every momentary decision.

246
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,600
Because these are indicators of what is left

247
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,880
after the fleshly,

248
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,200
envelope is boiled down,

249
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,880
vaporized, and whisked away into the void.

250
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,780
What is left is either worthy of taking on as super cargo,

251
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,280
or taken on, but as fuel.

252
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:08,440
Friends, do you want to be a co-pilot on that alien vessel?

253
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,860
Or do you want to be the equivalent of the peanut butter

254
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:17,620
that's spread on the little crackers they give to the passengers in the port,

255
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:27,240
screaming in the Corona love zone?

256
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,980
At such moments are there plenty of BC the

257
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,080
Safe Portugal Pertinen who fly within our JC wind.

258
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,960
Getậ�Ld attended on their journey to the star bird.

259
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,180
You took'll flight for allının errado acontecendo wioned the

260
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,440
previous message rainbow moon so many times.

261
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,100
As see,

262
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:53,780
spirits having been lightened and made hardly a burden on the infrastructure of the beyond.

263
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,200
You sure do talk purdy, Dr. Howe.

264
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,980
Well, it all comes out of the ancient records, the ancient subgenius records,

265
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,320
consulted by Dr. Philo Drummond in bygone days,

266
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,720
and elaborated on by saints and sages, Nenslow, other names,

267
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,440
too many names to mention and throw into the catalog,

268
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:24,600
but all these straining, mighty intellects are there to make sense of the living vortex of slack,

269
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:31,600
which has its one point of generation in the glowing pipe of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

270
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,360
And you know, the nice thing about subgenius is we really have to strain that intellect.

271
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,560
We have to work hard to...

272
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,260
to stop thinking.

273
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,300
Not just elbow grease.

274
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,380
Bob doesn't cogitate and wisely decide what he's going to do next.

275
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,920
He just up and does it.

276
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,440
Whatever he wants to happen happens by chance to be what was going to happen anyway.

277
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,980
But that's not true for you and me.

278
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,820
There's an element of skill that comes into it.

279
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,280
Surfing the luck plane, it's like any kind of surfing.

280
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,400
You just don't stand on the surfboard and be expected...

281
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:19,020
to be carried safe to shore, past the teeth of the sharks and whatnot.

282
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:26,300
You have to do some instinctive manipulation of this surfboard with your feet.

283
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,980
And on a far less crude level, as a subgenius,

284
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,100
you have to develop the instincts to make it possible for you to surf the luck plane as would Bob.

285
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,140
And Bob's got wood.

286
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,220
Plenty of it.

287
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,400
For you, my friend.

288
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,520
Varnished, lacquered, inlaid, and outlaid.

289
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,000
Presenting Superman!

290
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,660
Look! It's Superman!

291
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,380
And now, the dark sinister figure we have come to know as Superman.

292
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,840
Operator?

293
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900
Hello, Operator.

294
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,260
Is there a garage in town where I can rent a car?

295
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,120
No, I've got a little surprise for you.

296
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,680
Surprise?

297
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,700
That's right.

298
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,560
Ah, gee, thanks.

299
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:16,960
Bye.

300
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,380
Wait! Wait!

301
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,960
Meanwhile, Superman walks the Earth.

302
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,180
So have you, don't you remember?

303
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,660
Say, that's right.

304
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,280
Don't you remember?

305
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,180
Remember what?

306
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,220
Meanwhile, less than an hour to go.

307
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:29,940
When?

308
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,760
Right now, buddy.

309
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,320
Good!

310
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,760
And meanwhile, Superman barricaded in the dining hall, the hiding place of Superman.

311
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:37,880
Lois!

312
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:38,420
Here.

313
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,460
Lois, where are you?

314
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,900
Lois is safe and unharmed.

315
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,980
Is she in the clutches of Superman?

316
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:45,540
No.

317
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,880
If we look at our schedule, which is etched in stone...

318
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,780
I was just doing so.

319
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,020
It was originally etched in stone.

320
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,980
Like the laws of the Medes and the Persians.

321
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,020
And then was later...

322
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,500
And there goes Motormac on his appointed rounds.

323
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,160
Something has happened in the motorcade route.

324
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,040
Love and cheer throughout the camp.

325
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:12,800
The...

326
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,220
Yes.

327
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:14,640
Oh, yeah.

328
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,420
Well, we're right.

329
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,800
It said 1 o'clock, registration opens at stage.

330
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,040
2 o'clock, live hours of slack.

331
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,260
That was...

332
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,400
That we were on schedule.

333
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,720
We didn't actually start talking until 2.30.

334
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,080
But it was a slack-filled hour just the same.

335
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,460
Right.

336
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,220
That was our slack.

337
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,220
Our hour of slack.

338
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,180
Yes.

339
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,520
Why?

340
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,580
Do we have to specify whose hour of slack it is?

341
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:39,660
So people understand.

342
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,480
They think that hour of slack means slack for everybody else.

343
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:41,680
No, it's our slack.

344
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,880
They have to nail down every niggling detail.

345
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,740
They should be able to understand.

346
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:51,140
Anyway, since no one is paying attention, let's continue with our broadcast.

347
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,040
Right.

348
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,320
Time control.

349
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,800
Time control is...

350
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:54,920
Always important.

351
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,580
...is always an issue.

352
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,100
It's something we strive for.

353
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:05,860
If you'll notice, just in the last two minutes, the schedule went ahead in time an hour and

354
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,820
then went back in time an hour.

355
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,340
It dropped back through a time evacuation.

356
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,340
I'm sorry, I didn't know there was a time preparation.

357
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,900
predict maybe if you can if you do believe there is ...

358
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,600
Think that I am likely to be the leader in the 50th year.

359
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,400
What a cut!

360
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,020
No.

361
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,020


362
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,460
Be wannaei.

363
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,220
Know cli flipped about showing us to see more footage on YouTube here.

364
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:27,620
You see it's the phenomenon of momentum.

365
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,940
A beautiful可能 michzego-

366
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,880
... spending a lot of energy trying to put the population in poem on the sign.

367
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:32,880


368
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,000
No, look atounce.

369
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,380
Can't even see what I'm...

370
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,660
Just really, that's a good start a straight forward-ellschaft direction in it.

371
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:36,660


372
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:36,660


373
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:36,660


374
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:36,660


375
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,320
Let's take a look at the book.

376
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:41,320


377
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,340
No.

378
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,020
impediments to time control, but the engines which drive them.

379
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,820
It is your very will

380
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,380
which will remind you to turn on

381
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,260
your background music. Yes, the triumph of the will

382
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,740
of Dobbs.

383
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,460
Always put one in the brain.

384
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,840
The subgenius power of

385
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:11,920
work.

386
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,200
So, many things are on the docket

387
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,220
today, and of course we're going to spend some time

388
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,200
talking about ancient mummification and burial

389
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,160
practices, but the schedule is flexible.

390
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,200
We can lift that body of text, move it over

391
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,140
somewhere else, cut and paste, and start discussing flower

392
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,280
arranging or whatever else seems to be appropriate

393
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,380
to the moment. I was really looking forward to the

394
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,040
mummification instruction. That's personal to me.

395
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,820
The younger folks may not be that interested, but

396
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,320
time sneaks up on you. You're young and full of life,

397
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,400
the sap of life is still growing, but when you are old

398
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,820
and starting to approach the threshold of mummification,

399
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,360
the subject may be more of interest.

400
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:21,440
So, the first prerequisite for creating a mummy,

401
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,020
which will be, as they say, a lasting parcel of your

402
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,320
composition, is to dry out the flesh.

403
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,680
No more must it be filled with these youthful lipids

404
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,180
and soft fats.

405
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,400
And squashy flesh. No, you have to become tanned,

406
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,700
hard, and as dry as desert leather. Inside and out.

407
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,220
And contrary to what the conspiracy pink scientist

408
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,380
will tell you, you don't have to be dead to be mummified

409
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,280
in Bob. That's right.

410
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,860
You don't have to have all of your organs removed either,

411
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,960
just certain sloppy ones.

412
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,160
Pinks are actually mummifying themselves without even

413
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,520
understanding it. For example, long, prolonged, frequent

414
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,520
indulgence in tobacco actually mummifies the tissues.

415
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,140
Takes the water out, turns the skin to leather,

416
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,080
and calcifies the internal arrangements.

417
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,840
This has been shown. And it dries up those fluids,

418
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,940
which would otherwise be wet and moist.

419
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,660
The Native Americans, who used tobacco first,

420
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,340
knew this well and actually used the tobacco leaf

421
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,800
in the tanning and curing process.

422
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,760
But if you've ever seen the face of an old smoker,

423
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:52,040
and seen those cavernous etched lines, and observed

424
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,040
the leathery appearance of the skin, you will see

425
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,280
that its advance in mummification is unparalleled.

426
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,880
Iguanas, we call them, in the tanning industry.

427
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,320
There are other agents of mummification, however.

428
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,900
Moisture is to be avoided, dryness and heat embraced.

429
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,460
And of course, an appropriate resting spot, a sepulture,

430
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,140
a sarcophagus, or what have you, needs to be arranged

431
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:26,280
before you even think of getting your slaves to start

432
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,400
constructing your pyramid, the subject of a later lecture.

433
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,860
Now, friends, when you do this, you're going to have to do it in a different way.

434
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,200
If you do go for your mummification and your pyramid building,

435
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,160
please don't forget the tanna leaves.

436
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,760
They're expensive, but you can't, that's the one place you mustn't skimp.

437
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:51,360
Only one during the moon of the jackal will keep the heart beating.

438
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,080
But nine will turn you into an engine of vengeance

439
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,320
for those who will defile the tomb of Queen Connie.

440
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,460
Yeah, but, you know, since we're throwing this open,

441
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,100
there are two ways of becoming a living, shambling mummy.

442
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,580
And the tanna leaves are important for keeping the mummy active

443
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:19,440
once set in motion, but a far more powerful and superior one

444
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,820
is simply the scroll of Thoth.

445
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,420
Remember, with that, you don't need tanna leaves at all.

446
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,300
And it's most undignified if you happen to drive it,

447
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:30,300


448
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,240
and you drop the vessel with the derived fluid of the tanna leaves

449
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,840
to see your terrifying, reanimated mummy suddenly drop down

450
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,240
on its withered hands and knees and start trying to slurp it up

451
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,480
with its tongueless mouth in desperation.

452
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,700
This is an embarrassment that you want to avoid, if possible.

453
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,840
Now, friends, if you can't afford the tanna leaves and the sarcophagi and all that,

454
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:58,780
you just go down to Doc Fropp's camp and mooch some fropp off of him,

455
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,280
and pretty soon you will be dead.

456
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,860
You will be as if mummified.

457
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:08,400
You will sit down in one place, staring and stiffening, slowly stiffening.

458
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,020
You will zone out for eternity.

459
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,320
You will look down the long corridor of time,

460
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,480
and perhaps in your fancy you will even see something at the end.

461
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,300
But this can't be done in the hurly-burly and hugger-mugger of everyday life.

462
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,000
It takes a moment of contemplation and actively seeking slack.

463
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,340
This ain't just common street marijuana we're talking about.

464
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:40,900
Fropp is sometimes used as a euphemism for marijuana by kids and rappers and the like.

465
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,220
Yes, it's in the movie Grass, if you've seen the movie Grass.

466
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,260
We're talking about the original plant called the scientific name Havafropzipulops marifasa lupina,

467
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,220
which is not at all related to cannabis in the slightest.

468
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,960
For one thing, it doesn't wear off. The inebriation doesn't go away.

469
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:05,820
It looks more like a branch than the lanceolate serrate leaves which characterize cannabis.

470
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:13,600
But if you've ever seen the movie Werewolf of London, you get a pretty good glimpse at this plant.

471
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,820
The conspiracy pretty much spelled out the truth about Fropp in that movie.

472
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,340
In all monster movies, there's a living fountain of wisdom,

473
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:28,180
because this is exactly where stodgy bozos will never look for it.

474
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:28,840
That's right.

475
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,760
It is where the exceptional will look for their inspiration and find it.

476
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:42,100
You can hide the secret right out in the open if you use a monster movie to put your secret in.

477
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,040
Now let's just talk for a moment, since we've introduced the subject,

478
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:52,460
about that movie Werewolf of London starring Henry Hull and I'm afraid Spring Byington.

479
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,360
Every time she comes into the movie, it grinds to a stop.

480
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,940
They have to have that fluttery social dowager come in for a second.

481
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,520
For some reason.

482
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:06,720
But avoiding her, Henry Hull does a good job as being the tormented titular werewolf.

483
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,740
But he got his Fropp from Dr. Yogami.

484
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:15,780
Dr. Yogami picked his Fropp in Tibet, right?

485
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,240
This is what we're told.

486
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:23,760
So why in the background of that scene do we see the Vasquez rocks?

487
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,920
Because, Dr. Hull, the Vasquez rocks served as the...

488
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,780
The actual setting.

489
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,260
Exactly.

490
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:35,780
And that's where the Fropp was growing right there in California, right outside of Los Angeles.

491
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,700
It's close enough to X-Day.

492
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,660
We can tell you this.

493
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,660
You don't have to go to Tibet at all.

494
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,760
It's Tibet, in quotes, Tibet as in this monster movie.

495
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,620
But actually this is in the USA, in the great state of California,

496
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,780
in those rocks that have been in the background of Star Trek episodes,

497
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,280
of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,

498
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,240
of Westerns,

499
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,560
of...

500
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,020
Marco Polo starring Tyrone Power,

501
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,520
and Werewolf of London.

502
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,640
The monsters and the Fropp aren't necessarily in Tibet.

503
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,040
The Yetis don't have to be in the Himalayas.

504
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,660
The Yetis are right here at this campground, Brushwood Campground.

505
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,080
The Fropp is right here.

506
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,620
It's growing right in front of you.

507
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,100
You are floating in a sea of pills.

508
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,020
But you're just...

509
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,920
Your tongue is too numb to taste them.

510
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,900
And your eyes too filmed by frequent miracles.

511
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,120
I see that.

512
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,680
You're just having an addiction to marijuana and alcohol use.

513
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,300
People come to us and they go,

514
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,240
I paid my $30!

515
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,880
Where's the slack?

516
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,760
My God, man!

517
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,440
You had the slack all along!

518
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,280
You paid the $30 for us to go...

519
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:42,900
You idiot!

520
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,500
You're standing in it!

521
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,080
It's filling you up.

522
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,120
It's filling your head.

523
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,200
No...

524
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,140
You just have to shut off the...

525
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,060
the...

526
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,140
the distractions,

527
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,680
Distractions, the silly distractions from the conspiracy.

528
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,720
Poor Ivan is so agitated.

529
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,660
Your own interest, or as Dr. Howell might put it, your own genius.

530
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:12,700
We cannot pull all the fellow travelers into the spacecraft behind us and then screw the portal closed.

531
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,960
They must follow of their own volition.

532
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,980
And it saddens me personally as one who has known Ivan Stang for many years.

533
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:33,440
We hear the anguish in his voice as he tries to impart these simple precepts to those who believe themselves so well informed that they will not listen.

534
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:45,940
There will be a time for snarkiness, for guffawing at the pathetic action of the left behinders as they writhe in a hell of their own making.

535
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,980
But not now. Now we need to pull together as one.

536
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:55,260
To make sure that sitting well in order, we smite the sounding furrows.

537
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:01,560
For our purpose holds to fly beyond the sunset and the baths of all the western stars.

538
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,740
Slack is the simplest thing in the world.

539
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,160
You don't have to memorize endless tracks of subgenius books.

540
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,900
You only have to buy them.

541
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,180
The slack is the same yet.

542
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,340
Here we find ourselves having to beat the slack into the bobbies.

543
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,260
We come upon the bobbies going,

544
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,560
Oh, I'm doing everything you said, Reverend Stang.

545
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,180
I've chanted Bob Slack, Bob Slack 500 times before I went to bed.

546
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,640
I masturbated every hour on the hour.

547
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,940
I took a picture of Connie.

548
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,740
And then I turned and looked at Bob just when I reached the moment of climax.

549
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,500
Just like you said, I did everything just like you doctors did.

550
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:46,260
And that's when we have to kick them down and beat them and thrash them.

551
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,960
And literally tie them up and slowly torture them.

552
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,760
And torture them for hours.

553
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,820
Because only when we stop do they finally understand how much slack they already have.

554
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,460
It feels so good when we stop.

555
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,060
I hate having to work so hard at it.

556
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,920
That's where the slack initially starts to come from.

557
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,420
We haven't even spotted a wetback trail.

558
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,040
Yeah.

559
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,380
I've been hunting wetbacks for two months.

560
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,380
Who are you, senor?

561
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,120
Narcotic smuggling.

562
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:17,980
Might be.

563
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:18,680
Senor?

564
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,600
What do you want?

565
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,560
What do you got?

566
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,340
Bud.

567
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,440
Fine, that'll do.

568
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:22,860
Bob?

569
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,760
I'll buy that.

570
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,680
How about you?

571
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,900
We need one badly.

572
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,600
Yeah?

573
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:26,960
Good.

574
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,080
You got the package?

575
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,540
See, right here.

576
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,660
20 ounces.

577
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,760
Here's your money.

578
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,420
200 an ounce.

579
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,540
It's not cheap.

580
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,220
$4,000.

581
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:35,840
Oh, gracias.

582
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,960
It's expensive.

583
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,260
Look.

584
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,380
Mmm, brown.

585
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
Oh, no.

586
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,400
Take it easy, man.

587
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,080
Take it easy.

588
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,520
You'd think he'd take better care of it.

589
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,360
It's all right.

590
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,360
Marijuana?

591
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,580
Man who smokes that stuff could turn cold.

592
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,160
We'll fill her in a minute.

593
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,420
We'll see if we can get you some later on.

594
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,620
Not for me, but I beg for my kid.

595
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,720
What are we waiting for?

596
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,140
Come on.

597
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,600
You hit him, senor?

598
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,140
Yeah.

599
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,020
Looks like I didn't hit him good enough.

600
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,940
You mean we gotta sit here and let a hophead get away with murder?

601
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,540
Yeah.

602
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,040
Well, yeah.

603
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,380
How about them?

604
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,680
They're both dead.

605
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,280
Looks like that.

606
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,440
Oh, they're all dead.

607
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:26,440


608
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:26,540
Mayor Scott Powell hands back the power.

609
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:26,600
Mayor Scott Powell turns it Gorsiclesworth Thank you, Mayor Scott.

610
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,800
You know, back in the day I had a biology teacher who used to tell all the

611
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,480
students sitting there, you know, you gotta read those biology textbooks, men.

612
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,960
That knowledge isn't just going to os nouveaux into you.

613
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,980
You gotta do your homework.

614
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:47,760
Well, for biology for Americans, that might be true, but with the book of the subgenius

615
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,840
and all its offsprings, that knowledge will osmos from those books into your head.

616
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,100
You don't have to read them, although it helps.

617
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,880
All you have to do is buy them.

618
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,660
That's right. And sleep on it.

619
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,740
Put it under your pillow and go to sleep.

620
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,480
You don't even have to sleep.

621
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,080
You'll have the most amazing technicolor dream.

622
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,380
You can just keep it in your bathroom.

623
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,040
And you don't even have to read it.

624
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,420
You can use it for toilet paper.

625
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,880
Bob doesn't care. He's not a proud god.

626
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,820
He's not a vain god.

627
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,760
He's not like so many of these gods who demand that you gaze upon no other image of any other god.

628
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,000
He's a short-duration personal savior.

629
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,840
He knows that you're going to get tired of him after a while.

630
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:39,080
He knows that you care more about that naked porno star in that movie than you care about him sometimes.

631
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,820
Those other gods just want to make sure you're paying attention.

632
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:45,480
But...

633
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,040
But, uh, J.R. Bob Doves doesn't even care whether you're paying attention or not.

634
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,280
He doesn't care if you live or die.

635
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:59,100
You can't imagine how little that man cares about you.

636
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,940
Caring? That's not what Bob is about.

637
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,560
He's not breathing down your neck.

638
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,400
He don't care if you're a good subgenius or a bad subgenius.

639
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,700
He only cares if you're a paying subgenius.

640
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,340
And this makes him the fairest god.

641
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:14,620
Uh...

642
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:14,880
Uh...

643
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,000
Uh...

644
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,320
Uh...

645
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:15,360
Uh...

646
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:15,360


647
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:15,440
Uh...

648
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:15,440


649
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:15,440


650
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:15,460
Uh...

651
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:15,460


652
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:15,680
Uh...

653
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,980
The justice in this world is when you can measure what's good and what's bad.

654
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,620
But you have to draw the line somewhere.

655
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,780
There has to be a place to zero your meter.

656
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,520
Well, that meter happens to be best zeroed in that zero between those two Bs.

657
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,520
Between the twin poles of pleasure and pain.

658
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,180
Right in the center of that O in Bob.

659
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,300
That is where you could...

660
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,500
To the left, it's good.

661
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,180
Towards the one B.

662
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,560
To the right, it's evil.

663
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,100
or whatever, mirror, depending on stage right or stage left.

664
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,980
But here's the important thing.

665
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,760
On the good side, it's still a B.

666
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,980
On the evil side, it's another B.

667
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,820
What does this tell you?

668
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,560
I don't know. I can't interpret it.

669
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,500
I'm not Bob.

670
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,380
But yet he laid it out.

671
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,880
He put it right there in front of us.

672
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,160
What are we to do but to take his word literally?

673
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,900
You don't have to interpret it.

674
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,280
You don't have to go to a priest.

675
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,860
And say, what does Bob mean by this chapter here where it says, repent, quit your job, and slack off?

676
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,940
Surely he doesn't mean I'm literally supposed to quit my job.

677
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,700
Yes, he does mean that, my friend.

678
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,160
He wants you to repent.

679
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:33,200
That means repent of your silliness and anti-slack.

680
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:41,900
And being concerned about foolish things like your health or your family or your love life, your sex life, anything like that.

681
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,380
And slack off.

682
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,440
Just quit worrying.

683
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,720
And you have to quit your job because that implies two things.

684
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,380
First, that you had a job to begin with, which you must have in order to give Bob money.

685
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:00,700
If you happen to be born rich, give him all your money because you didn't earn it.

686
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,900
And then get a job.

687
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,740
Get a job so that you can quit it.

688
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:11,680
So many of my dearly beloved subgeniuses live in their parents' basement.

689
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,080
And that's fine.

690
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:13,920
They're fine.

691
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,400
They're gobbling.

692
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:14,860
They're going to live a long life.

693
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,040
It said they could do that in the first pamphlet.

694
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,200
But what do they give to Bob?

695
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:27,920
This basement will provide a good shelter of four walls for the forthcoming blasts of the apocalypse also.

696
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,000
So them moving into their parents' basement is actually a progressive thing.

697
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:42,160
But I should add as a codicil, perhaps a warning, quit your job does not mean act so that you will be fired from your job.

698
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,260
No.

699
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:48,280
You must voluntarily disdain your job and leave.

700
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,740
Being fired by the boss does not count, unfortunately.

701
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,680
And, you know, here's the sad thing about it, friends.

702
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,880
The very worst thing that happens when you quit that job is you get a better job.

703
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,520
That's the worst thing that can happen.

704
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,600
A better job, which means you get a little extra.

705
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,580
A little extra to tithe, maybe.

706
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,900
We don't ask tithing.

707
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,040
We just ask buying.

708
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,020
We don't expect you to give us something for nothing.

709
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:25,700
We just intend for you to give us a lot of money for a very overpriced, cheap object.

710
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,320
That's very different.

711
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,760
It's not faith-based.

712
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,960
You don't earn slack through faith, but through works.

713
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,280
Now, of course, many people keep their works hidden away in a safe place for the police.

714
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,180
They can't get to them.

715
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:49,420
It's easy to be confused by the Christian iconography that everything is actually built on.

716
00:38:49,540 --> 00:39:00,480
According to Christian theory, the sacrifice that Christ made on Golgotha, the Hill of Skulls, on the Mount of Cavalry,

717
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:09,260
that is the sacrifice which is all that is needed to take the elect into heaven, and works are irrelevant.

718
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,840
You can be an absolute.

719
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,380
You can be an absolute evil malfeasor and still be whisked into heaven

720
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:19,480
while a kindly old couple that built hospitals for lepers in Africa

721
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,060
is immediately thrown into the fiery hellhole right next to Hitler.

722
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,800
We have Jack Chick's works to show us that.

723
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:34,140
But with us, us meaning subgeniuses, there is no Calvary.

724
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,760
There is no Hill of Skulls.

725
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,600
There is no sacrifice by anyone, least of all,

726
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:44,460
by Bob, which will admit us into glory.

727
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:50,060
We must seek after it, find it, mount it, and assume it on our own.

728
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,700
And then the word subgenius will start to mean something.

729
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,620
Hey!

730
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,960
The subgenius.

731
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,260
Our boss.

732
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,540
What?

733
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,520
Oh no!

734
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,160
Good?

735
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,180
Oh, the poor Donny.

736
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,860
You make me sick.

737
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,140
All of you.

738
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,480
What are you trying to do?

739
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,880
I like the rock skulls.

740
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,180
Oh no.

741
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,180
Anyone else want his head bashed in dirt?

742
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,100
No!

743
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,440
Oh no.

744
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,820
How often have you been in the middle of something?

745
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:40,820


746
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:49,060
Like a petty transaction when suddenly you find you have to start talking about subgenius to some clueless clerk.

747
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,920
Well, you might not want to do it.

748
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:59,040
You might want to snap at the guy, bite his head off, just go on and buy your fifth of Lord Calvert or whatever,

749
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,440
without having to start explaining about Bob and the conspiracy.

750
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,400
Resist that impulse.

751
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,540
Start talking about Bob and the conspiracy.

752
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,820
He will be ever more anxious to sell you.

753
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,160
That fifth.

754
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:18,700
He will be ever more anxious to get rid of you and go on to the next customer in line.

755
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,520
By fleeing, you increase the entanglement.

756
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,920
By going forward, you eliminate it.

757
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:33,060
And the best way out of a bad situation is usually just to plow right through it.

758
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,980
Bob would do that and his critics would say it was because he was insensitive.

759
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,480
But that's not true.

760
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,100
Well, it is true that he's insensitive, but that's not the reason.

761
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,240
The reason is that he is supremely motivated.

762
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,680
And you must all be likewise.

763
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,160
I love thinking about the way Bob plows and mounts.

764
00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:02,540
Yes, in the seed time, the time of growing things when the sap rises, Bob fecundates.

765
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:08,540
The entire earth becomes one enormous egg and then one huge zygote.

766
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:18,160
But unfortunately, the children engendered are somewhat like the monsters of that ancient period before the Olympian gods.

767
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:30,960
When Typhon, the lord of the many angled polygon, huge in snaky twine, and hundred armed Briareus, these enormous monsters contended with each other.

768
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:34,960
Just because they were born didn't mean they were good little kids.

769
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,780
Or think of the shark.

770
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,560
That interesting creature of the ocean.

771
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:45,880
You know, the mother shark gestates a number of little sharks in her womb.

772
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,240
But only one is born because they eat each other in the womb.

773
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:58,160
And only one fat shark is decanted from the birth process.

774
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,940
This program is presented by the Centers for Disease People.

775
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:08,940
This is an important message from the U.S. Department of Human Fire.

776
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,360
Look for signs that your appliances have gotten wet and throw them away.

777
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,720
To learn more, replace all gas breakers during a flood or fire.

778
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,000
From PR News in Washington, I'm in Afghanistan.

779
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,380
Congressional budget analysts say $25 billion.

780
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:30,800
A new study suggests that Viagra may help problems with some women.

781
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,920
72% of them reported better sexual function.

782
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:33,920


783
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,420
Placebo.

784
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:39,520
An accused war criminal from Bosnia may help some women who are suffering from sexual functioning.

785
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,820
On Wall Street 663.

786
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,320
Israeli officials say Barack Obama drove a construction vehicle into traffic today.

787
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,520
He hit vehicles and passers-by and injured at least 11 people before he was shot and killed by John McCain.

788
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:57,080
He's reiterating his view that U.S. troops need PR news.

789
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,700
PR comes from Saturn.

790
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,200
I look out upon this field.

791
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,340
A field of faces.

792
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,080
This huge crowd.

793
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:19,100
And I think how many, how many here, when they saw that monster movie, was there a single one here who was rooting for the humans to kill the monster?

794
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,880
I think not.

795
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:25,180
I think almost everyone here did the opposite of what they were meant to do.

796
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,520
And they went, oh great, the monster's destroying the town.

797
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,280
I hope he makes it to the next town to destroy that.

798
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,180
And at the end, of course, they're going to be like, oh, I'm going to kill the monster.

799
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,280
And of course, invariably, at the end of a Hollywood pink movie, the monster gets killed.

800
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:48,560
At the end of Independence Day, which Hollywood released on X-Day 1996, at the beginning of our first X-Days, who won?

801
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,320
The humans.

802
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:55,060
With some foolish computer code that any alien could see right through in a nanosecond.

803
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,220
They, they, they.

804
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,560
How likely is that?

805
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,180
An America online virus saved the humans from extinction.

806
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:03,180


807
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,600
Oh, yeah, according to Hollywood.

808
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:12,320
The one monster movie I've seen that shows hope is the Cloverfield monster.

809
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:17,660
Which at the end of which, you know that thing's not dead.

810
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:23,600
All that's left of New York is the code name Cloverfield.

811
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:29,360
Because there's no way else to truly describe the horror of what happened.

812
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,160
Yeah, they had to.

813
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,960
That was a movie that ended with hope.

814
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,780
The hope that every human died and that monsters inherited the earth.

815
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,260
Because are we not those monsters that they fear?

816
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,360
Well, we are.

817
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,580
Where are the monsters walking among them?

818
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:47,840
The movie's even more subtle than that, Stan.

819
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,580
Some of us, it's obvious, like Reverend Skull over there.

820
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,600
You can tell just by looking at him, he's one of the monsters.

821
00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:02,940
Then there are others who are a little bit more subtle in their monstrosity, such as the big boss of this area, Reverend Back It On Up.

822
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:09,200
You'd never think that she was, aside from the gigantic cranium, you'd think she was a human being.

823
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,040
You'd hardly look twice at her.

824
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,300
Well, actually most people probably, a lot of guys do.

825
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:16,900
Yeah, speak for yourself.

826
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,860
Sneak a second look.

827
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:23,180
But let's not get bogged down in the doctrine here.

828
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:28,400
We were trying to address the hearts and minds and glands, really.

829
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,320
Forget the minds, they're pointless in this church.

830
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,140
But the glands.

831
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,640
The feeling of slack.

832
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,940
Because isn't that what it is?

833
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,580
It's a feeling.

834
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,920
A feeling that everything's right.

835
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,540
If you're a cigarette smoker, you can only get that feeling with another cigarette.

836
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:52,520
But if you're a cigarette smoker who's a subgenius, you got your cigarette and your Dobbs head.

837
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,640
Now what is that signal supposed to mean, Priestess Pisces?

838
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,900
Oh, time.

839
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:58,580
Time.

840
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,400
Control of four minds.

841
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,380
Four minutes to the auction.

842
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:07,700
Four minutes to the Bulldada auction.

843
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,320
Friends, the auction, the Bulldada auction.

844
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,280
Things have happened at that Bulldada auction that were beyond imagining.

845
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,300
One time a dollar bill was auctioned for how much was it, Motormax?

846
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,320
Two dollars!

847
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,840
This is the essence of the subgenius.

848
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:29,340
As has been said, a subgenius first waits for the miracle.

849
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,580
And then, if that doesn't happen, gets off his ass.

850
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:40,960
At the Bulldada auction, we've auctioned such things as the immortal souls of individuals.

851
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,120
Something you can't hold or feel or touch.

852
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,260
We've auctioned off people's honor.

853
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:52,520
We've auctioned off bits of memory, just as the exes sometimes snatch away little pieces of us.

854
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,480
Ex Day happens all the time, friends.

855
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,560
Every time you lose a hair.

856
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,320
It's gone up to the...

857
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,680
If you can't find it on your living room carpet, it's gone up to the sausage.

858
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,780
It's waiting for you.

859
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,860
It may take a long way to get to the saucers.

860
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:13,940
The hair has to follow you everywhere that you have gone before it finally reaches its ultimate destination.

861
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:20,680
If it were only possible to have the vision, then one could see...

862
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:26,800
If you were just sitting in the room of any house, you would see with this accelerated vision

863
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,360
that there were plants growing there that you knew not about.

864
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:36,340
Tiny jeweled lizards crawling among the plants where all you thought was wallpaper.

865
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:44,200
And every now and then flecks of skin or hair or even something like a severed leg might float in and bump about

866
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:51,520
and then gradually leave because those particles would be following the absent host.

867
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,500
But where the destination of those things all is,

868
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,840
is the Grand Saucer.

869
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:00,740
The mother ship.

870
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:02,840
All those...

871
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:08,960
The police in Canada keep wondering why those left feet keep washing up.

872
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,800
Or is it right feet?

873
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,880
Feet keep washing up on the Canadian shores.

874
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:14,220
Those feet are just trying...

875
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:17,860
They're subgenius feet trying to make it to the saucers a bit early.

876
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,280
Some of them are.

877
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:24,600
Yeah, those feet could be feet bitten off by sharks which sometimes bite off feet

878
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,260
and then spit them out.

879
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:33,140
But even so, they still are making their way one foot at a time, as it were, to the saucer portal.

880
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,940
You know, Dr. Howell, I don't know if you knew this, but we had...

881
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,600
I think it's right feet that have been washing up.

882
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:45,940
We've been getting people buying memberships using left feet in lieu of the $30.

883
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:49,380
And we're full up, friends. We don't need any more...

884
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:51,260
Feet.

885
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,360
We do need a left hand.

886
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,320
A hand to complete the experiment.

887
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,940
Left foot, right foot, any foot at all.

888
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:04,980
I see many of you volunteering, but we'd rather use a hand that's not being used.

889
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,880
Well, I think this now brings us to the end of our ranting section

890
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,880
and time for the beginning of the Bull Dada auction.

891
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,440
And this, of course, is one of many high points of X Day.

892
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,480
So we will start...

893
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,840
Good Lord, look at the modem...

894
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,640
...with a giant bin of swag,

895
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,220
bought by Modemac,

896
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,400
and just look at these incredible treasures in here.

897
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:34,760
I have a box. I'm going to get my box of Bull Dada for the auctioning.

898
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:39,220
I hope that we should get lots of folks coming up here.

899
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,200
Now, you know, when we say Bull Dada, that doesn't...

900
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,480
That can mean almost anything that's meaningless to the pinks.

901
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:54,340
But in subgenius vision, as Bob said, subgenius can see the future and the past in comics.

902
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:54,340


903
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,020
Comic books and wine bottles.

904
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:02,340
Last year, we auctioned off many, many things.

905
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:08,560
But you know something we could not sell and which ended up being left here Sunday as I drove away?

906
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:14,800
We left here on this stage a box of the complete works of L. Ron Hubbard.

907
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,300
Couldn't get rid of it. Couldn't give it away.

908
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:23,020
And yet, we have folk remedies of arthritis.

909
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:27,880
Arthritis sold for hundreds in cheesy paperback form.

910
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,260
Let that be a lesson to you, friends.

911
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:35,500
If you want to donate something to the church, no matter how seemingly pathetic and worthless it is,

912
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:41,960
it may be worth more than you can imagine to some fixated subgenius pervert

913
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:47,140
whose fetish happens to be that bazooka Joe bubblegum comic or whatnot.

914
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,660
My friend.

915
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:53,000
I wouldn't mind a couple of bazooka Joe bubbles.

916
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,060
Those things used to contain pearls of cosmic wisdom.

917
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,500
Or beforehand, though I don't expect anyone can go this far back in time,

918
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:09,860
does anyone remember the comics wrapped around bubblegum from the Frank H. Fleer Corporation featuring Pud?

919
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,020
Pud, a primeval subgenius?

920
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,340
As I thought. No one remembers Pud.

921
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,560
But the spirit of Pud...

922
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,900
No, you're thinking of Mort.

923
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,920
That guy with the shirt over his face was Mort.

924
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,220
He was Bazooka Joe's sidekick.

925
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:36,100
But Pud was a fat kid with a bow tie, a baseball cap, and a red striped jersey.

926
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:40,320
But let's stop bringing up the classics.

927
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:46,060
Maybe in the fullness of time, they will come to light like everything else.

928
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:52,680
I will now stand behind the podium and initiate the first phase.

929
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,580
The Bull Dada auction.

930
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,480
What's our bar?

931
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,680
What? Meanwhile, friends, the amino acids have arrived.

932
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,980
Their helicopter landed on the Northfield a little while ago.

933
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,580
I have seen them.

934
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,600
They are preparing to play.

935
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,940
However, we have an important movie we want to show you.

936
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,960
An educational film.

937
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,940
We can't let the amino acids play until everyone who has actually seen this film has...

938
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,240
You know, it's just a legal thing.

939
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,820
The health department insists on it.

940
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,240
Because here's the thing.

941
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,140
We know about the amino acids.

942
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,380
We know about the building blocks of life.

943
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,840
We know that they come from out of space.

944
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:45,140
But what we don't know is, are they all male?

945
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,000
Do they reproduce asexually?

946
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,700
Do they just bud?

947
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:52,200
Or are there perhaps amino acids?

948
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:53,880
Amino acids.

949
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,280
Female amino acids.

950
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,500
We have seen the amino acids.

951
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:07,880
They seem to be of what we would call, with our Earth bias, some sort of a male-looking creature.

952
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,640
Of course, that may, you know, from other worlds.

953
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,240
Who knows?

954
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,880
But we must speculate.

955
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,620
The amino acids.

956
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,880
Could they be the opposite?

957
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:22,600
Could they be all white with black faces in hand?

958
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,020
Yes.

959
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:24,580
Wow.

960
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,200
We...

961
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,780
I hope I never find out.

962
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,920
I hope I don't...

963
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:36,600
You know, it's a blessing that people die when they get to be about 80 or 100 years old, or 50 or so.

964
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:38,020
It really is.

965
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:43,020
Because, you know, there's some things that old folks aren't meant to see.

966
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,140
And everybody gets old.

967
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:50,040
And it's best not to have to watch the dumbassery of the next several generations.

968
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,980
And the horrors of species extinction.

969
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,520
That we'll all watch.

970
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,540
By the way, I'm not tripping, even though I'm addressing that issue.

971
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:03,040
In the meanwhile, I'm going to set up this amazing film.

972
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,020
Which you may...

973
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:10,260
Some of you may recognize people you know in this educational film.

974
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:14,060
Some of you may recognize, yes, even yourselves.

975
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:36,780
I know, but some may not.

976
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,920
I'm athletes who are still transferring

977
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:52,960
And people pain...

978
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,040
Thank you.

979
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:27,860
Thank you.

980
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,160
Thank you.

981
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:52,020
Thank you.

982
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:57,840
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

983
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:52,340
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

984
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:19,540
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

985
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:27,660
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!
