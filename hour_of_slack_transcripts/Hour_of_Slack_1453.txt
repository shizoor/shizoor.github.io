Baby, baby, please, baby
What I'm talking about
No, not without
I'm lost in the desert and I'm dying of thirst
I'm grasping at straws, chasing a mirage
I'm sure to expire unless you get here first
I got my GPS working, hope it's still working
Please give me some, whatever's something greater
Walk like a perp and be my perpetrator
Please give me some, shoot again later
Walk like a perp and be my perpetrator
Please, baby, please, baby, baby, baby, please, baby
Please, baby, please, baby, baby, baby, please, baby
Baby, please
Baby, please
Baby, please
Baby, please
I'm lost in space, floating up in space
I'm upside down
It's cold and dark, dark as no bar
I'm surely drift away unless you bring me down
Throw me a tether, please, throw me a tether
Please give me some, whatever's something greater
Walk like a perp and be my perpetrator
Please give me some, shoot again later
Walk like a perp and be my perpetrator
Please, baby, please, baby, baby, baby, please, baby
Give me some of that
And I'll heal me with that
Baby, please, baby, baby, baby, baby, please, baby
I want to talk about

This is Mark Mothersbaugh showing off his Fairlight synthesizer, early sampler that he had just got in 1984. To me, I was helping with their music video of Are You Experienced? And, well, this kind of thing happened.
Fairlight, Fairlight, Fairlight.
Fairlight, Fairlight.
Fairlight, Fairlight.
Fairlight, Fairlight.
There. Speak to him, boogie.
Hi there, Long Beach.
You know, we used to do devil music like that band Devo.
But then, Jerry over here, he sat down on a Bobby Dylan record, and the Lord came into him.
And now we do music you love.
I got something here I wrote for you people.
I just want everybody to read this, okay?
Make sure you all read it.
Yeah, let's do it.
Here we go.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Let's do this.

You'll have us bury in your dick lies.
Oh boy.








How you doin'?
Hey, purple historia?

achter gracious!
Well, she looked great.
You gotta know she's on to it.
With a long string of pearls
But you gotta serve somebody
Yes, you've got to serve somebody
Well, it may be the devil
Or it may be the Lord
But you gotta serve somebody
Well, you might be up on Grokker
Dancing on the stage
Money, drugs at your command
Women in a cage
You might be a businessman
A high-colonic freak
They might call you doctor
And they might call you chief
But you gotta serve somebody
Yes, you've got to serve somebody
Well, it might be the devil
Or it may be the Lord
But you gotta serve somebody
Serve somebody
Yes, you've got to serve somebody
Well, you might be a state trooper
Or another kind of jerk
You might be the president
Of some big TV network
You might be rich or poor
You might be blind or lame
You might be living in another country
And there needs another name
But you gotta serve somebody
Serve somebody
Yes, you've got to serve somebody

Serve somebody
Well, it might be the devil
Or it might be the Lord
But you gotta serve somebody
Serve somebody

Say somebody, Boogie.

Well, it might be the devil, and it might be the Lord, but you gotta serve somebody.
Serve somebody.
You gotta serve somebody.
Praise God, brothers and sisters.
Oh.
Popeye's Big Punch.
Dr. Pluto Cole.
Cartoon.
People.
Don't go, oh.
Yosemite sound.
Clothes off his head.
Why, you and me.
Wind up dead.
Dreamed I laid a toaster.
And he caught me in the air.
Still on base for Cali standards.

But it was all a talking ludship.

You had enough.

Showing cataracts is the incidence of cataract syndrome.
사랑 Darlin.

That everything you did for me is a cult.
Thank you.
Love you dearly.
Love you dearly.
Love you dearly.
Itchy goo, itchy goo, itchy goo goo goo.
It's all I wanna do.
Whammo!
Itchy, itchy goo.
There's a pile next to you.
Itchy goo, itchy goo.
And it's turning blue.
Itchy goo, itchy goo, itchy goo goo goo.
It's all I wanna do.
Whammo!
You got me running in circles like a big, big baby.
I'm so happy I just wanna die.
Cause it's baby love that comes from up above.
Move on over.
I wanna get closer.
Move on over.
Wanna twaddle with you.
Move on over.
Satisfy my urges.
Please, please, hope I got the goo goo.
Itch, itchy, itchy goo.

Oh baby, I love you
Itchy goo, itchy goo
Itchy goo-goo-goo
It's all I wanna do
When I'm home
Amazing.
I'm not sure where that one's from.
And I'm not sure if we're gonna be able to get to Dave on.
He's trying to call in, but we seem to be having some sort of a strange, nasty...
If I go like this, hello?
Hello?
Oh, there is Dave.
Yay!
Oh, it worked.
Are you on the air?
Yeah.
We're...
We...
We seem to be.
Why you be draggled, young old Philistine?
Yeah, there's something funny about me.
You've been there a long while.
That's right, my man.
Well, celebrating the passing of Bob.
Yeah.
Still, Casale, as we would normally say.
Another Bob.
Down the Bob trail, or down the old Bob tube, or out the old Bob window, or...
Well, we like to think that Bob Casale has joined the...
The men from Planet X ahead of us.
The end of the world has already come.
He's on his escape vessel for X-Day.
Bob's promise came true for Bob 2.
Well, it would not be in any way, I don't think, superstitious to talk about flatulence then.
Well...
Not that that, you know, is pertinent at this time.
Because I know it's not.
But...
Well, you know, it is sad when somebody croaks at the young, young age of 61.
Only 61 years young.
Actually, 61 is pretty old, if you're young.
And since I think young, I think that's pretty old.
And I'm 60, and I know it's old.
And you're even older.
Oh, I'm 25, 6, 7, 5, 30 years older now.
I was looking up the ages of the Devo's just before the show.
Because I...
Suddenly got a little curious.
Like, which is the older brother?
And Jerry, it seems, was born in 1948.
Oh.
And Mark was born in 50.
So, um...
And the Casale boys hail from Kent, Ohio.
Which brings us...
Water Street Bums.
Which brings us to a little announcement, which is not so sad.
Even though Bob Casale won't be playing bass.
Actually, who can replace Bob Casale?
I know.
Chaz.
Chaz Smith.
That's not funny.
I know.
It made Legume laugh.
Anyway, there's an art show at the art gallery run by the sister of Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo.
I bet it's on Water Street, too.
Um...
No, it's on Front Street.
Well, that's just a saying.
No, you're right.
It's at 2091 Front Street because it's called Studio 2091.
And it's an art gallery run by Amy Mothersbaugh Roos, the sister of Bob 1 and Mark 0.
That squid-loving woman.
Yeah, but the important thing is, on March 8th, there's a show...
an art show opening of paintings and gigas by Apostasy Fenord, who some of us know as Reverend A.P. O'Stacey, and others know as Miss Torrey.
But she's been working on some crazy, I would say somewhat devolved paintings.
Oh, yes.
Greatly devolved.
Some samples of her art.
In fact, we've got a...
They're animals.
We're sick.
We're upset by her hanging over our business table.
I mean, our dinner table.
Yes, we do.
Where we do our business.
Bob is watching us.
Thanks to Apostasy.
Her business is all over the house, from what I've heard.
Well, yeah.
Yeah, but it's a pretty...
Because of the increasing decrepitude.
But that is an excuse from a lot of the other, you know, weird activities out of your attic window.
So, anyway, there's going to be a little subgenius gathering on March 8th at Mark Mothersbaugh's sister's art place to show off.
Reverend Apostasy Fennord's art.
And we'll be there.
And Dr. Legume and Reverend Pockets will be there.
And Susie the Flusie may even show up.
Might.
I hope so.
She might.
It's in the Akron area in Cuyahoga Falls.
Is that Bob's real name?
Oh, that's right.
It's not in Kent.
It's in Cuyahoga Falls.
2091 Gallery.
Studio 2091 in Cuyahoga Falls, where you can fall all over yourself to look at the cool pictures.
Well, that sounds absolutely lovely.
And giggles.
Except for the fact that you said it was in Kent.
And now you've...
Now it's in Cuyahoga Falls.
Well, you're right.
Now that's what...
Yes.
Well, it's all kind of near Akron, right?
Mm-hmm.
And it's all kind of near Kent.
And everything's kind of interconnected.
But it's not all the same.
Because you can go to the wrong town.
Right.
Jeez dang, I wish you'd stop doing that.
You sent me the wrong town last night.
I did?
Yeah.
I was in there in a dream.
I was almost asleep.
And I got the clans.
Got in the car and drove over there.
And nothing happened.
I'm kind of losing faith in a lot of this Bob stuff.
Not Bob.
That's good.
That's good.
That's stage two of your brainwashing.
First, we roll out the red carpet for you.
And then we pull the carpet out from under you.
So you fall flat on your face and hate Bob.
And then we kill everybody named Bob.
Except for J.R. Bob Dobbs, who you can't kill.
Because it's been done.
And that's...
Not enough times, if you ask me.
But do you have any treasured memories of the Devo's?
I mean, the Devo's are still around and everything.
But they were working on some projects.
The Casali brothers were.
And now there's only one.
And...
Actually, there's another Casali brother still in Akron that we've met.
We had dinner with him.
Remember?
Yes.
That one time.
After a devotional.
Yes.
He was the smart one who didn't get into the rock and roll business.
He seems to have more slack for that.
I don't know.
Yes.
It's a very difficult road to hoe.
It's tough.
It's rough.
Full of fluff.
Earlier, we played some material from...
From when Devo was briefly born again.
And they changed their name from Devo to Dove.
Which has the same number of letters.
They saved money on that.
It's an anagram.
It's the same business.
Anagram from, you know, Devoid and so forth.
Right.
And so that's why you heard Boogie Boy singing that Bob Dylan born again song,
You Gotta Serve Somebody.
But Boogie Boy is like a very weird looking person.
Or whatever it is.
He is.
Yeah, he is a weird looking person.
He's kind of rubbery looking.
He hasn't aged at all.
No.
In what's been like 40 years.
Right.
And he's still a baby.
He's still a great big fat baby in diapers.
With his finger in a toaster.
That's the colloidal masses in his ears.
All fat babies are the cutest.
There's too many in Boogie Boy's ears.
There's too many of that same kind of sound receptor stuff.
The same anachronistic noises.
Push in every night.
He goes right into your cerebral cortex.
Sometimes it does.
Well, we're all Devo.
Dr. Sinister is here.
He walked in.
Princess.
Princess has always been Devo.
We were all devoted.
Oh, and there's going to be another devotional this year.
Yes.
They skipped one or two.
In August.
Right.
In August at the Beachland Ballroom.
Yes.
As they have been before.
I don't know if any of the band will be there.
Unfortunately, we're pretty sure we won't be there.
Because we have a prior commitment.
But we thought that last time.
Remember that one year we thought we were going to Jamaica for the drug conference?
Oh, that's right.
And it fell through.
An hour before we left for the airport, I called the guy around and it turned out the whole thing was a complete lie.
Well, it sounds like everything is a complete lie.
So we did get to go to the devotional that year.
Yes.
That was a hoax.
Look, there's no hip straddling in this business, Stangy, Wangy, Mangy.
No hip straddling?
There's no hip straddling.
There's no false microphone work with the tissue papers and the other accruedments.
Right.
The accruedments.
To create this mind control flavor over vast numbers of human beings that don't deserve it.
Some of them certainly do, of course.
But I forgot what I was talking about, so I'll shut up.
No.
I'm going to do this as well because I promised the listeners that I would play some Devo tunes that they probably haven't heard.
And the ones I've played, they might have heard.
But there's some stuff from a collection called DNA Recombo or Recombo DNA, something like that.
It's like songs that didn't make the album cut or early versions of songs that have changed.
I'm going to play one of those right now, okay?
Woohoo!
Okay.
You can listen.
Listen, even if I pot you down.
Okay.
Oh my God.
Please let me listen!
Are you listening?

Good that's no good.
Listen.




What's this?




Now that the world had badly gone to hell, I could hear more and more of this跳ing-standing

So we can see more so.


And two of myuellementpanel gelears get either produced as것 urgentLY??
They're coming in hiawat.
You say, what?

Listen, this is my incarnation of something.


Because if they could be, they probably would be
It's best not to wait until then
Life must be healed or at least bitten into
To get past the surface, a moment of truth
You know when it's right, it's sweet deep inside
It's real and it's better that some things don't change
For centuries, some could not be seen
And sat in the mind before MTV
It's the way of the world
It's the world, it's the way we live
Live, live
So things could be different or could be different
It seems pretty hard to believe
Because if they could be, they probably would be
It's best not to wait until then
Life must be healed or at least bitten into
To get past the surface, a moment of truth
You know when it's right, it's sweet deep inside
It's real and it's better that some things don't change
It's the way of the world
It's the world, it's the way we live
It's the way of the world
It's the world, it's the way we live
Live
Live
That's what this cast, this thing on this?
Yes, this thing is on.
This thing is on?
Yeah, that was some kind of strange Devo song that I never heard before today.
It's the way of the world.
Well, tough.
I don't know which world they're talking about, though.
I hope it's not the same world you're talking about.
These corruptigated worlds full of fish and spineless creatures.
I don't know.
Let's see.
Here I got it right now.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
An obsidian.
Oh, no.
I guess another word.
And a bunch of dirty mule crap.
Jeez.
I keep losing my place here.
Oh, this one is directed right to you.
Dearest Reverend Ivan Stang,
I've noticed that during the past few weeks of your many broadcasts,
which seem to please no one but yourself,
which seem to please,
no one but yourself,
that you have omitted to remind your listening audience
that there are...
Oh, jeez.
Now I can't read the rest of this.
For no one's pleasure but your own.
At least you can say that your show pleases you.
I think it's just regular old drool that blurted out.
But sign Susie, not Susie.
Beckett, Slarton, then.
Beckett.
The suitcase or something.
David, are you feeling okay?
You sound kind of slowed down.

You sound like maybe you had a stroke or something.
No.
Dave can't have a stroke.
I've had three of them just today.
No.
But you had three strokes today.
Strokes are no laughing matter.
When you're marking your territory,
sometimes you'll have a little flash in the back of your head
and you'll start humping the wall.
Is that what you're talking about?
Well, no.
If you can stroke, you don't have to hump.
But let's not go any deeper into that.
Okay.
So to speak.
I don't want to be associated.
I don't want to be associated with people like that
or ideas like that.
In the background, we're playing a record or a CD
called Devo, Easy Listening Disc.
A classic.
Yeah.
Well, the easiest thing you could do with it
in a situation like that is create a vast slurry,
you know, in a huge vat of like six different chemicals.
And you put them all in there.
You put like a plug underneath them
and where it's the same place where you're lighting the fire.
And that's the way the Babylonians did those tricks
with the rocks and everything.
Well, if anybody wants to hear what that sounds like,
that's the net.
You just described the next show, Radio Synesthesia.
Oh, yes, certainly.
It's an odd combination of many different sources and resources.
And it seems the populist leader, what's his name?
Antonin Karnatsky.
What the hell?
One of those guys.
He's about ready to resume power.
What are you talking about?
You don't get it?
The earthquake crisis in Armenia, I think it is.
Or maybe Venezuela and Ukraine.
It's in all of those places.
I haven't heard anything about Armenia lately.
I hear a lot about Ukraine lately.
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's the perfect answer if you can't really hear it.
The Ukraine is at war with Venezuela
and they're both revolting against their...
They're promoting a mass...
They're promoting something.
The monkey kings, they used to call them.
They're at least like seven foot tall giant monkeys.
They look like Yeti, but they're...
It was a little different.
And they used to rule the world so that everybody would...
Like thousands of people have to line up and bring them pies
and like orchids and different kinds of sandwiches and stuff.
And they put it down at their feet and everything like that.
And they, you know, eat some and leave.
And, man, we've certainly come a long way.
I'm not so sure.
I'm not so sure about that.
Has been launched by a sandwich.
Well, take out the neck bolts, you know, and what do you got going, you know?
A boltless Frankenstein, that's what you got.
Well, yeah, sure.
We're all crafted in a certain way and we all need juice of some kind.
Could just be coconut oil.
But that's not pertinent.
That's not pertinent.
I don't think.
Pertinent.
And, yes, we need something pertinent.
Pertinent to what?
Oh, that's right.
We were mourning the passing of our friend who we don't really,
didn't really know all that well, actually.
Although, you know, last, the last devotional, was it?
Bob Casale came to the devotional and he not only talked
and kind of jammed with the band, the Spud Boys,
but he cooked for everybody.
It was at the Beachland Ballroom.
Yeah, that's cool.
Which has a big kitchen.
And it turns out Reverend Bob, too,
is a gourmet cook and he cooked chicken cacciatore, I think,
for everyone there, which was about 80 people,
about as big as an X-Day, and about half of the same people.
I never really understood the chicken cacciatore thing.
That's one, too, for a keyboard guy.
Right.
And he put in, I did notice he put a lot of echo
because he's an engineer, you know, an audio engineer.
He put an extra bit of reverb into his,
you know, careful annoying eventually deny at a big function scale.

It ended completely in my head,
like I said, at the Isney
Poor man.
That's�in is single man.
skinny in the picture.
And then it sunk in.
Oh yeah, we were all that skinny then.
Because
in more recent years,
Bob Casale got more prosperous
looking, not unlike myself.
So what is it about the Cacciatore that puzzles
you, Dr. Sinister?
Oh.
What catches in your brain, should I say?
The word
catch and the word Cacciatore have something in common.
They have the same root.
I see.
I can't hear them talking about Cacciatore at all.
You don't hunt chickens.
I mean, I can hear them.
Cacciatore is like hunter's chicken, but who hunts
for chickens?
Chicken hawks.
Chicken hawks.
I say a chicken hawk
hunts a chicken.
That is an insult to my honor.
Foghorn leghorn.
You're not a chicken.
My daddy
told me about chickens.
You're not a chicken.
I say I am a chicken.
We saw a cartoon just a couple of days ago.
Yes, we did.
And now you can also do the entire
college-traveling project in the background
while we're doing the words or vice versa
and stuff like that.
Going back between Daffy and the goofy gambling buddies
of Daffy when they're on the skating pond.
That's a lovely, lovely world
you've escaped into.
Bob?
The other day I was eating some pork.
Roast.
And when I was done eating it, I actually said,
that's all folks.
It just came right out.
I saw a porky pig cartoon in which Sylvester or Daffy
or somebody was trying to insult him and said,
I your sister wears army boots and porky goes.
My sister didn't wear army boots.
My sister works in a butcher shop and smokes ham.
That's easier than smoking cold turkey.
Pull that off.
Taggy waggy.
But that got the old funny bone going.
That was...
Another thing we noticed is that
although Porky wears a jacket,
he has no pants on.
And nobody ever notices that.
They never say anything.
That reminds me of the time I walked out this week
and I wasn't wearing any underwear
and I had a rip in the back of my pants
and didn't know it.
And I think I might have scared some people.
You may have, Daffy.
You may have.
I'll have.
Okay.
I'm going to play another Devo's tune here
called Love is Stronger Than Dirt.
Whoa.
Well, that's an ever-present sentiment.
Okay.
Is it true?
I have seen Dirt get between lovers.
Well, this is just a way to listen for Devo
from a tent area.
The Devo's.
The Devo's.
The Devo's.
The Devo's.
Oh, my goodness.
Start to take off and start to fly,
in a Holder,
far, far away.
Be coming to top any fortress,

Oh, I can reach the screw that can make a lot of noise.
Open the Opportunity.
Try to let goவ
isn't well,
right now.
All of a sudden,
There's another plane.
Love is proper today
Love is proper today
Love is proper today
And that was that
And that was great
Well that was well spoken
I liked it
Love is stronger than dirt
You know the lyrics made a lot of sense
To me as a teenage dancer
In an exotic nightclub
When I was only 14
And I was
Stronger than dirt
Pardon?
Stronger than dirt
Love is stronger than dirt
It said
But bacteria is stronger than anything
No vinegar is stronger than dirt
Especially in my case
As I
Visit the places they hide every day
I'm trying to think what I should play
For the last song
There's one on here called
Time Bomb
Which I think is about
Sex
I think a lot of the songs we've been
In fact pretty much all rock and roll
If sex is
If Time Bomb is an allusion to sex
Then I am thankful
That my sexuality
Is not a time bomb
Because you want a time bomb
To be predictable
You want to be able to predict
When the bomb is going to go off
And does anyone really operate
On a timer that precise
You know
Would you trust your life?
I guess there are professionals
Who can do that
In the pornography industry
Oh sure I could
If I wanted to
It's still $100 an hour
But it's the same kind of
Release mechanism
Afterwards
No I mean
Can somebody
Can somebody
You know
Present the money shot on cue
That's like you know
When the director says
Okay
Three
Two
One
Spooge
Yeah
Can that be done?
Yes I mean
If they can buy your thought
A yogi
Bob could do that
He could do that on command
But he would refuse to
You know yogis are all
Well Bob's not that kind of
Commando anymore
He's more like a
Sedentary bean
Connie could make him do it
It'd be like talking to a dog
Bob come
There you go
Yep
We're here to go
Connie is kind of
The deus ex machina though
Of
See
That
I can't hear Dr. Sinister
Deus
Sex
Machina
Deus sex machina
Back in the ancient amphitheaters
When the
When the
All else fails
Just to vote Connie
And everyone gets a happy
Blistening silver tube
And then this guy
Would be riding on top
He'd be Zeus
And it'd be like his babes
And stuff like that
That's where
We got to go back
To the days of mythology
And promise everything
Under a thin veneer of lies
Under a thick fat
Thin veneer of lies
Isn't that what we've been doing
All this time
Anyway
A veneer of lies
So your lies are only skin deep
What kind of liar are you
A tissue of lies
It's pathetic
It's only desperation
That makes you
A snotty tissue
Or a snotty used tissue of lies
Necrotized tissue

A disgusting
Grotty old
Handkerchief of lies
You've got to be alive
A beastly rag
A smut of
Indiscriminate size
Worn by everyone on Tuesday
Especially with
The bands in town
Do you remember the band
The stangy
Old stangy boy
And that
We were in
Public school together
Band of Brothers
Sure
B.O.B.
That was a code name
For the
Assassins for Bob
Yep
And what a beautiful time
That was
You just said it on the radio
The sun was glistening outside
I'm not supposed to say
Assassins on the radio
You just said ass twice
You just said it on the phone
Four times
You could say it
Such asses for saying that
No you have to say asses
No
It's okay as long as you're referring
To a jackass or a butt
Well the one per radio
Personality who's now national
Who's show you were on and stuff
Likes to call everyone
He doesn't like ass clowns now
I was not really familiar
With that phrase
For a long period of time
I know that
Must have heard it somewhere
But is that common usage
You ass clown
Ass hat
It has been for quite a while
It came after ass hat
It sounds archaic yes
Maybe anti
Or pre-Diluvian
Well I mean the kids
Were probably saying it
A long time ago
Back in the
Back in the 80s
The Beastie Boys
Had a song called Ass Monkey
With anything that reminds you
Of the id
You know like
A forbidden planet or something
Getting ready to blow up the world
Cause you're so P.O'd
I know I can't say the real world
No you're right
Don't say real world
Oh I did it
Don't say anything real
On a subgenius show
Don't kick me off the air
You decide what's real
And what's not
Real real real real real real real
Leave it
Please
For mercy
That cry in the wilderness
Will affect anything
Will change the world
The way it is
Not like my friends
Now things are gonna continue
To tumble for a while
Before they start to
Shake out just fine
What he said
Yeah what he said
If he said it
Then you better pick up on it
Yeah man
Man
Can't be unsaid
How many among us
Could claim that title though
The title of man
No the title of
Um
Princely dupe
Don't shoot
I'm a man
That was one of the new
You know Devo put out a new album
Like last year
Or the year before
Yes they did
And we played some of them
In fact I played that
Please Baby Please
Was on that new
That was like two or three years ago now
Yeah well you know
When you're my age
Time flies
A year is like a week
Yes
I'm actually
I just recently moved into that
Yeah you're on
Dinosaur time actually
I am
I am
Well you know why that happens
Not enough milestones
A chronic mystery
And a sad conclusion
Not enough what
Not enough milestones
In your life
Oh I'm sorry
If you have more
Milestone events in your life
In old age
Then a year
Will seem longer
Do kidney stones count
Yeah
Well your first one counts
What only up to five
What are you talking about
My kidney stone
Can sing
The Star Spangled Banner
Wow
Yeah well
My algorithm
Is
You sound like
I'm having a stroke again
I'm sorry
When I passed my first stone
I was singing
The Star Spangled Banner
To take my mind off the pain
Actually I've never
Passed a stone
Well I dreamed
Bob Casale
Was actually singing
The Canadian National Anthem
At the
I guess
It was the
You know why
You know why
The Canadians won
The Golden Hockey
It's a big hockey game
And there's guys
Talking with people
All day
You know the
The whole action stuff
And everything
And it was all like
Oh it was great
Well I'm gonna play
Say what
I was gonna say
The real reason
The Canadians
Won so much gold
In hockey this year
Or any year
For that matter
The Olympic Fan Fair
And O Canada
Open with the same notes
Da da da da
And then what comes next
Well it's either
The Olympic Fan Fair
Or it's O Canada
I don't know
Well I know
That I've had
Enough of this
Bad singing by us
And I'm gonna put
This last unheard
Devo song
Time Bomb
Which I think
Is about sex
This is the
Hour of Slack
From Church of the Subgenius
We were talking about
A different Bob
Than usual tonight
But
What the hey
As they say
Still unusual
And now
That sexy song
Time Bomb
Boom
