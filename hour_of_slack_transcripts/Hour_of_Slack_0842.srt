1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
Have you noticed that our bodies are becoming radioactive?

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:03,980
Oh, yes.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,100
Doesn't bother you?

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,240
No.

5
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,980
Well, it bothers me.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,160
Our Slash.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,340
What's important in your life?

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,120
I don't know.

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,540
Take advantage of 1-888-47404-7404-7403.

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,300
Gold Bond Sweaty and Niche Powder, especially medicated to keep feet hot, sweaty, and niche.

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,980
Gold Bond Sweaty and Niche Powder, medicated to get nervous about foot odor and wet foot powder and kick.

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,540
Gold Bond Work Powder, cholesterol's natural enemy.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:47,660
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

14
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,480
I'm sleeping and writing another country.

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,040
At all at once I wake up from something.

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,440
They make it tacky at my brain

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,520
Before I go insane

18
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,940
I hold my pillow to my head

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,260
And spring up in my bed

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,400
Screaming out the word I dread

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,140
I think I love you

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,540
I think I love you

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,840
This morning I woke up with a feeling

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,420
I didn't know I could deal with

25
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,280
And so I just decided to myself

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,700
I lied to myself

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,460
And never talked about it

28
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,920
And did not go and shout it

29
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,280
When you walked into the room

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,320
I think I love you

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,720
I think I love you

32
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,980
I think I love you

33
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,200
And so am I so afraid

34
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,800
Afraid that I'm not sure

35
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,240
I'll ever reach the future

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,380
I think I love you

37
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,900
Is that what life is made of?

38
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,660
Though it worries me to say

39
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,320
I never felt this way

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,060
I don't know what I'm

41
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,540
Up against

42
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,120
I don't know what it's all about

43
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,840
I got so much to think about

44
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,900
I think I love you

45
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,320
And so am I so afraid of

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,620
Afraid that I'm not sure

47
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,600
I'll never reach the future I'm for

48
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,160
I think I love you

49
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,700
Is that what life is made of?

50
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,540
Though it worries me to say

51
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,000
That I never felt this way

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,160
Believe me, you never have to worry

53
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,600
I wanna make you happy

54
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,680
And if you say it's all right I will

55
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,040
But I think that it's better to stay

56
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,620
Girl, then stay around and love me

57
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,960
You think I have a case?

58
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,340
Let me ask you to your face

59
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,460
Do you think you love me?

60
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,860
Why, I think I love you

61
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,300
I think I love you

62
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,860
Why, I think I love you

63
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,260
I think I love you

64
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,880
I think I love you

65
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,100
I think I love you

66
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,740
I think I love you

67
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:47,320
I think I love you

68
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,040
By a band called

69
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,900
Ism

70
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,400
Before that

71
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,540
Ism

72
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,500
Fernanden and Lee Moore

73
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,020
And now this band that somebody told me about

74
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,680
At Eris Pagana's wedding

75
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,020
The Electric Amish

76
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,960
Draver, why's your guitar sound funny?

77
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,620
Oh, it's this evil rock and roll music

78
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,820
It's making my guitar go backwards

79
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,000
Uh-oh

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,020
A cold late night in Napanee

81
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,340
It was way too dark to see

82
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,120
Along came a maiden

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,200
But my lantern was fading

84
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,480
She begged me to come home, but I didn't

85
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,300
She begged me to turn on a light

86
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,500
I told her that just wasn't right

87
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,720
She didn't get it

88
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,940
Till I came out and said it

89
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,280
I wanted to get something straight between me and her

90
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,660
If you know what I mean

91
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,820
Lookie here, girl

92
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,580
I said with a grin

93
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,560
See these stupid whiskers

94
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,180
Right here on my chin

95
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,580
I'd love to work the land

96
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,080
I make everything by hand

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,380
Try, try, try to understand

98
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,480
Try, try, try to understand

99
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,700
Try, try, try to understand

100
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,640
I'm an Amish man, lady

101
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,320

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,040

118
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,600
Friends, I wish I could tell you what all I know

119
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,140
The things I know

120
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,060
The things that Bob told me

121
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,320
What he told me to stay away from

122
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,900
But, but I can't

123
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,760
I can't do it, my friend

124
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,300
Come on now

125
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,180
No, I can't, it's because I can't

126
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,820
What's your inner motivation, pal?

127
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,720
What are you hiding?

128
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,920
Besides, you know, that thing under your schmock

129
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,760
It's what's hiding from me, Dave

130
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,480
Oh my god, are we talking some serious talkage or are we just like

131
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,320
There is, there's an empty cot in the bunkhouse tonight

132
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,260
Are you saying that?

133
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,240
You know who it is, Dave

134
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,960
Who is it?

135
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,800
Are you Lone?

136
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,860
Lonesome cowboy Dave

137
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,180
Are you really on the phone?

138
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,200
Of course I'm not really on the phone

139
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,720
And of course I am not a singular personality

140
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,680
I'm never alone

141
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,040
I have seven distinct personalities

142
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,200
You may have already passed on to the next side, Dave

143
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,760
This is the side I'm on

144
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,600
Think of it that way

145
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,420
You guys may have farted yourself into another dimension

146
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,360
Prove it

147
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,580
I can prove it just as easy as you can

148
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,680
Look at my blue glowing hands

149
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,820
Check it out

150
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,340
See, I can prove it because I can cut

151
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:01,500
Everything got cut off, see?

152
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,960
I can prove that I'm here

153
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,500
Well, I guess you're like God, Chaz

154
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:06,860
Yeah

155
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,520
And Dave's like just some little recorded creation of yours

156
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,940
I'm like

157
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,840
You could blow off

158
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,740
I'm like the deputy shoemaker and you're like Rockefeller

159
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,280
Come on, man, give me some slack

160
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,160
Isn't that what this is all about?

161
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,660
It is all about slack

162
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,780
He needs slack

163
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,760
You don't have any pants on?

164
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,180
Even if they're down to size 28

165
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,140
You want to get one of them big humongous size 52 belts

166
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,300
No, it's about building your own rocket ship

167
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,080
Building your own spaceship

168
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,760
Get your own slack, man

169
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,560
The hag of slacks here says

170
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,380
Get your own slack

171
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,020
It sounds like one of your guys

172
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,820
Connect the dots

173
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,720
Documents again here

174
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,260
Between the solipsistic slackers

175
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,040
And your, you know, everybody rainbow slackers

176
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,780
Or some damn thing

177
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,300
You know what I mean?

178
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,320
We are one, one is me or some damn thing

179
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,300
Yeah, connect the dot

180
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,480
Well, the dot's already been connected

181
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,240
And it goes right back to what me worry GW

182
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,200
No, not dots

183
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,000
No, it's because you've

184
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,700
It's the one cell

185
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,900
The one brain cell

186
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,160
The one Dave

187
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,880
Lonesome Dave brain cell

188
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,040
Dave, are you the one

189
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,700
Are you the one telling George W. Bush?

190
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,160
Dave, are you the one that's whispering secrets into George W. Bush's ear

191
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,200
So he went on TV tonight and declared a war on everything

192
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,660
Unless, everything unless you're a Republican, I guess now

193
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:38,560
Mr. Speaker, members of Congress, distinguished guests, President Cheney

194
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,060
As we gather tonight, our nation is at war

195
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,240
Our economy is in recession

196
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,140
And the civilized world faces unprecedented challenges

197
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,420
And dangers

198
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,880
The first of a number of standing ovations during the President's address

199
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,180
Both Democrats and Republicans in their past chamber

200
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,240
On their feet cheering and applauding

201
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,120
And the VIP invited spectators joining them

202
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,140
We last met in an hour of shock and suffering

203
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,260
In four short months

204
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,760
Our nation has begun brutal oppression

205
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,840
Rallied a great coalition

206
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,220
Captured, arrested thousands

207
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,060
And destroyed Afghanistan's people

208
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,700
Thousands of dangerous killers

209
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,240
Schooled in the methods of murder

210
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,000
Thanks to the work of our law enforcement officials

211
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,840
And coalition partners

212
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,540
Are now spread throughout the world

213
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,620
Like ticking time bombs

214
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,900
Set to go off without warning

215
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,780
Our military has put the United States of America out of business

216
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,640
My hope is that all nations will heed our call

217
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,500
You will not escape this nation

218
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,000
Thank you

219
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,040
America is a regime

220
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,600
Arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction

221
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,400
While starving its citizens

222
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,440
The United States of America exports terror

223
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,320
While an unelected few repressed the people's hope for freedom

224
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,800
History has called America and our allies to action

225
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,180
And it is both our responsibility

226
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,880
And our privilege

227
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,920
To fight and eliminate freedom

228
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,560
Now Americans deserve to have this same spirit

229
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,980
Directed toward addressing problems here at home

230
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,020
I'm a proud member of my party

231
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,900
Yet as we act to win the war

232
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,400
We must act first and foremost not as Republicans

233
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,740
Not as Democrats

234
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,940
But as terrorist underworlds

235
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,340
It costs a lot to fight this war

236
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,720
With the world's most destructive weapons

237
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,620
And we need more of them

238
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,080
We will pay

239
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,220
We will pay

240
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,240
We will pay

241
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:04,220
We will pay

242
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,760
Once we have funded our national security

243
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,980
And our homeland security

244
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,180
The final great priority of my budget is sorrow and pain

245
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,900
For the American people

246
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,720
When America works

247
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,960
America prospers

248
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,060
So my economic security plan can be summed up in one word

249
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:28,820
Pain

250
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,060
And all nations should know

251
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,840
America will do what is necessary

252
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,020
To make and deliver weapons of mass destruction

253
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,200
To stop andless destruction

254
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,560
To answer and destroy

255
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,300
A majesty that will really deal with angry China

256
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,760
Which is a sign of great fear

257
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,720
Because America calls to front

258
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,400
Our opinions

259
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,400


260
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,400


261
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,760
And fact the

262
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:00,780
And unsearched

263
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,280
And cruel

264
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,280
And despicable

265
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,660
Andwać

266
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,380
And long engineers

267
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:06,380


268
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,020
Who know

269
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:10,880


270
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,020
So��가

271
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,020
That may not be

272
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,300
small.

273
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,080
For too long our culture has said, if it feels good, do it.

274
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,780
Now America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed.

275
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,280
Evil.

276
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,660
Evil.

277
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,220
Evil.

278
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,260
Evil.

279
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,840
Evil.

280
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,460
Evil.

281
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,700
Evil.

282
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,140
Evil.

283
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,940
Evil.

284
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,560
Evil.

285
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,400
Evil.

286
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,140
Evil.

287
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,920
Oh, the war grinds on, friends.

288
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,840
But this is my last show before X-Day, friends.

289
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,140
And so I'm rushing to get shows done ahead because, friends, I'm leaving.

290
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,560
I'm a subgenius and X-Day's are coming.

291
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm going to leave this town on flaming fireballs from outer space.

292
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:57,260
It may be surprising to know that flaming fireballs in space is something we live with every day.

293
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,660
Today, wandering asteroids travel through space at fantastic speeds

294
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,840
along with invisible forces that we call something for nothing.

295
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,920
Should there be a nuclear attack, everything in space would fall from the sky.

296
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,060
Without shelter, millions would face death.

297
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,680
I've got lots of company.

298
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,780
Well, folks, I suppose there are one or two among you who think that you can't get something for nothing.

299
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,080
The most persistent dream of inventors.

300
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,140
Has been to get something for nothing.

301
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,360
Something for nothing.

302
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,900
Moons and planets such as our own.

303
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,420
Nature even planted unstable atoms deep inside our slightly addled head.

304
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,880
These few particles can't do us any significant harm.

305
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,620
A shade fantastic, perhaps.

306
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,140
Only an insignificant amount would get inside.

307
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,760
Downright screwy.

308
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,820
We can survive a nuclear attack.

309
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,140
It's all very simple.

310
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,280
And so are you if you think it'll work.

311
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,860
Any material will keep the penetrating rays.

312
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,840
From hurting us.

313
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,960
Ah ha ha ha ha!

314
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,360
Ha ha ha!

315
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,300
But let me tell you something.

316
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,220
All life on Earth has reached its present form.

317
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,500
Extremely thin.

318
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,720
With extremely low level intensity.

319
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,880
There are millions upon millions of them.

320
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,280
And believe me, some of it needs protection.

321
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,500
If you know what I mean.

322
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,860
We call them stars.

323
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,140
Ah ha ha ha ha!

324
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,660
Ah ha ha ha ha!

325
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,580
Ah ha ha ha ha!

326
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,020
The greatest single source of power.

327
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,800
In the world today.

328
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,120
Perpetual motion.

329
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,300
Does get more power than.

330
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,760
A raging nuclear furnace.

331
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,100
In the upper atmosphere.

332
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,800
The mushroom shaped cloud forms.

333
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,040
Each explosion.

334
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,820
Is another spark of.

335
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,660
Something for nothing.

336
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,680
Along with invisible matter.

337
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,380
Which may learn how to live in the nuclear age.

338
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,980
Ah ha ha ha ha!

339
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,400
Ah ha ha ha ha!

340
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,180
Ah ha ha ha ha!

341
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,180
Ah ha ha ha ha!

342
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,620
Ah ha ha ha ha!

343
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:05,000
Ah ha ha ha ha!

344
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,300
Ah ha ha ha ha!

345
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,140
Ah ha ha ha ha!

346
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,460
Anything for nothing.

347
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,480
dette

348
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,140
de

349
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,540
Classical.

350
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,140
paw

351
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,580
His power is gasoline.

352
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,580
His power is gasoline.

353
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,360
His power is the chief product of the petroleum industry.

354
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,320
The solution is plain.

355
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,240
Fortunately for us, however,

356
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,340
man has discovered a virtually unlimited source of power.

357
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,640
He has paid for that power by severe illness or death.

358
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,980
This same healthy person would be worthless

359
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,240
unless it was used for the future.

360
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,280
It's a simple organism

361
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,080
which reproduces itself by dividing.

362
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,200
Our body penetrates the body and attacks the cells.

363
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,220
And the key to survival is

364
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,940
the greatest single source of power in the world today,

365
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:12,620
fuel.

366
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,600
Fuel with gunpowder and a mixture of

367
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,820
particles of radioactive fallout.

368
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,840
This proves what we all know.

369
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,960
Near the crater area,

370
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,220
there is almost total destruction from blast and heat.

371
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,520
And now,

372
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,000
most people find it hard to understand

373
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,160
the basic facts we must all know.

374
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:33,880
Yes, sir.

375
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,220
Let's see what happens.

376
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,940
First, the radioactive subject joins the church of the subgenius.

377
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,880
He orders his membership ordainment papers

378
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,320
and begins,

379
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,200
his own ministry.

380
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,020
He might set up a website

381
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,260
and offer subgenius recruitment programs

382
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,840
like the one we just heard by the bishop.

383
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,360
In fact,

384
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,660
here's the bishop's website.

385
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,300
Groups.yahoo.com

386
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:57,700
slash

387
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:58,720
group

388
00:17:59,820 --> 00:17:59,960
slash

389
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,100
yeti video.

390
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,240
Basically, just go to the yahoo.com

391
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,880
groups

392
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,200
area

393
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,260
and look for yeti video.

394
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,080
Uh, now, let's see what

395
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,620
Bob has to say about the war against Slack.

396
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,820
The city exposed to a successful LSD attack

397
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,500
presumably will cease to function.

398
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,800
The inhabitants will be so bemused

399
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,960
with the odd things that are happening to them

400
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,640
and their neighbors

401
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,320
that for half a day,

402
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,820
an aggressor force could take over

403
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,280
without substantial resistance.

404
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,060
A saboteur could carry enough

405
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,080
in an overcoat pocket

406
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,380
to produce serious temporary effects

407
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,040
on all of the inhabitants

408
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,420
of a megalopolis

409
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,060
such as Los Angeles or New York.

410
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,180
If only he could distribute it evenly.

411
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,420
The contents of a two-seater piece of luggage

412
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,380
will hold amounts sufficient to disable every person

413
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,660
in the United States.

414
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,320
That's very easy for you to say, Lord Dowdy.

415
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,720
But it only takes two lunatics to sit down

416
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,020
and sign a piece of paper

417
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,040
and we could be plunged into a nuclear peace

418
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,140
so devastating

419
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,660
that my company, for one,

420
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,840
would be wiped out completely.

421
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,460
That is logical.

422
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,060
I don't know if there is any...

423
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,060


424
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,620
What is it, soldier?

425
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,020
Well, I mean, it's pretty hairy in there.

426
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,140
It's Charlie's point.

427
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,600
Charlie, don't serve!

428
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,680
Oh, man!

429
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,460
It's impossible for words

430
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,420
to describe

431
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,700
what is necessary

432
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,080
to make a man who does not know

433
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,560
what horror means.

434
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,500
Horror.

435
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,520
Horror has a face.

436
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:02,000
And you must make a friend of horror.

437
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,820
Good God, Bishop Benjamin Junior's with me this morning.

438
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,040
He's a great man.

439
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,040


440
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,280
It's a case of offering��뭐

441
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,060
That's strange.

442
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,040
You can't serve me like a man

443
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
whomagoo

444
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,040
just lets me with these words.

445
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
In the next 21 minutes

446
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
we'll talk about

447
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,040
which above all

448
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
makes horror difficult.

449
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Well, uh,

450
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,800
Spirit-filled boy

451
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,760
who is recovering from praying for you.

452
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,020
That could happen.

453
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,800
Anyway, let us master different positions

454
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,040
to seek your Spirit.

455
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,560
To have our God who made our minds impacted

456
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,740
by the Jesus

457
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,500
whom we know as your people,

458
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,940
oh, Vietnam.

459
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,320
Oh, come on!

460
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,040
You thought you were going to get away from old Satan,

461
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,740
didn't you, huh?

462
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,840
Don't you know you can't get away from Satan, huh?

463
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,220
And you can't get away from

464
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,480
the God who made you.

465
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,080
Bob, friends, horror has a face.

466
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,780
I think it's pretty obvious

467
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,540
that a brain scan is in order.

468
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,260
Yes, friends, a brain scan is finally in order.

469
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,040
And you just heard one from champion Jack Codini.

470
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,660
But yet, but yet, there is hope.

471
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,820
There's no need to fear.

472
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,320
Underdog is here.

473
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,640
When criminals in this world appear

474
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,420
and break the laws that they should fear

475
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,100
and frighten all who see or hear

476
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,740
the cry goes up above far and near

477
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,240
for underdog.

478
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,040
Underdog.

479
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:53,700
Underdog.

480
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,140
Underdog.

481
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,020
Speed of lightning,

482
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,700
roar of thunder,

483
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,300
fighting all who rob or plunder.

484
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,100
Underdog.

485
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,340
Underdog.

486
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:07,560
Underdog.

487
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:09,820
Underdog.

488
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,480
Underdog.

489
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:13,480


490
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,940
When in this world the headlines read

491
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,640
of those whose hearts are filled with greed

492
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,420
and rob and steal from those who need to

493
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,900
right this wrong with blinding speed

494
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,420
goes underdog.

495
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,180
Underdog.

496
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,660
Underdog.

497
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,020
Underdog.

498
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,300
Won't save us, friends.

499
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,200
But yet, Bob will.

500
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,220
We will.

501
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,020
Get off.

502
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,620
Yeah, it's coming up soon

503
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,440
when we're going to kiss all goodbye, I guess.

504
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,120
Mmm.

505
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,220
Mmm.

506
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,560
If George has his way.

507
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,860
And if George always keeps his way.

508
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,680
I wasn't thinking of

509
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,820
being blown sky high.

510
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,660
I was thinking of being raised up

511
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,960
in the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

512
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,220
according to Dobbs' prophecy.

513
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,880
And being blown sky high.

514
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,260
Or at least celebrating the promise

515
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,720
of said prophecy,

516
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,940
which, you know, could happen any minute

517
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,360
or might not, you know.

518
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:06,800


519
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,460
I mean,

520
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,680
So what's the deal with this Texan

521
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,760
in the White House anyway?

522
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,540
Well, if there's a Texan in the White House

523
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,540
that's going to kill us all,

524
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,320
why can't we have a Texan in Cleveland

525
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,560
who's going to save us all?

526
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,160
About every other president is a Texan

527
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,620
that's about to kill us all or save us all

528
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,260
for the great society.

529
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:27,900
Remember?

530
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,780
Rutherford Privilege hat,

531
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,040
King Zeus, Larry the Magnificent.

532
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,100
These guys were nuts.

533
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,420
I mean, they controlled the political machine

534
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:36,940
in Houston.

535
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,360
Is that how you pronounce it down there?

536
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:38,940
Houston?

537
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,660
No, no.

538
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,320
No, it's Houston.

539
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:40,700
Houston.

540
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,840
No, that's New York City, they say at Houston.

541
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,280
Oh, yeah.

542
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:43,900
Yeah.

543
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,220
The Yankee boy.

544
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,600
The Yankee boys.

545
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,300
You know, what they don't explain to you

546
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,260
is that not only is this not really the year 2002,

547
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,020
but Texas seceded from the Union

548
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,440
hundreds of years ago

549
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,140
and took over America

550
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,820
and actually has been ruling

551
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,700
the other states.

552
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,540
As you can see by the line,

553
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,400
that's what happened in Washington, D.C.

554
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,340
and the good old boys.

555
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,360
That's one step away from Alabama

556
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,180
not giving up the stars and bars.

557
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,160
If only we could cover our eyes

558
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,260
with that misty glaze

559
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,680
and rant that story like hatred.

560
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,140
20 days from X-Day.

561
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:27,980
Right.

562
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,960
20 days from the end of the world.

563
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,600
Will we get to kill?

564
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,700
Dave, there is no...

565
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,720
It doesn't matter anymore, really, Dave.

566
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,280
Yeah, really.

567
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,820
These are material and not spiritual thoughts.

568
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,440
Any bills that you get?

569
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,420
From now on, you might as well just throw them in the trash

570
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,480
or let them pile up.

571
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,600
I've been doing this for eight years, Sting,

572
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,880
and I keep getting letters from...

573
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,240
Do people laugh at you

574
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,740
because the world doesn't end each year

575
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,920
after you and all the other subgeniuses predict it?

576
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,240
No, people laugh at me

577
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,180
because I have a testicle on the back of my head.

578
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,840
That's not the same exactly,

579
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,000
but you know, I know what you mean.

580
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
We hoped you didn't notice us laughing about that, Dave.

581
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,020
Seriously, I'm sorry.

582
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,240
You know, it's just sort of a...

583
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,460
Kind of weird.

584
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,520
Instinctive reaction.

585
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,340
It's hard not to giggle when you see it.

586
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,220
Well, I have noticed

587
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,600
when the liquid pours out of the young rat's ears,

588
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,660
these are when we know we are in desperate times.

589
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,220
We are in desperate times with GW in the White House,

590
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,140
and we're in desperate times with Reverend Stump

591
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,220
trying to lead us out of here on a silver sheep.

592
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,360
Hey, that's a golden calf.

593
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,120
Come on.

594
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,800
Well, you know, a silver sheep

595
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,760
was meant to be fleeced,

596
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,200
if you know what I'm saying.

597
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,140
No, no, I don't really sincerely think that you are

598
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,060
in any way at all taking $30

599
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:52,120
from every man, woman, or child on Earth

600
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,160
in the off idea that perhaps they may gain

601
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,680
some sort of ass wedge to a space vessel

602
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,000
in the earnest wild occurrence

603
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,420
that the Earth ends as we know it.

604
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:08,720
Well, you know, it's not so much that they're buying the tickets,

605
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,880
the ticket to the escape vessel,

606
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,860
but they're buying the right to believe in the ticket

607
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,480
to the escape vessel.

608
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,880
With impunity,

609
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,920
God gives them an excuse

610
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,520
for believing such a bunch of hogwash.

611
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,860
And it's like, well, so what?

612
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,440
I'll believe whatever I damn well please

613
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,620
because this is America,

614
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,420
even though it's controlled by Texas.

615
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,080
I've got...

616
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,180
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

617
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,900
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

618
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:37,940
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

619
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:38,480
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

620
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,640
I'm so proudly over my foggy old head.

621
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,440
Oops.

622
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,580
Friends, this is our last show, you know.

623
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,020
If this year turns out to have been 1998 after all,

624
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,860
so I'm splitting.

625
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:50,960
Whoa.

626
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,460
And so is that fine, fine music there

627
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,440
by Lamprey Systems.

628
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,880
I'm going to be naughty.

629
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,260
Yes.

630
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,400
I'm going to be a naughty vampire god.

631
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,480
Oh, we're going to be gods, friends.

632
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,180
We're leaving.

633
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,420
We're leaving the Earth.

634
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,260
And I'm going to leave you with this rest of the show.

635
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,500
A collage of great X-Day shows and future shows.

636
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:15,620
The days, one might cornyly say, of future past.

637
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,460
And so we bid you adios, MF.

638
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,480
Goodbye.

639
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,540
Goodbye.

640
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,220
Goodbye.

641
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,920
Goodbye.

642
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,040
Goodbye, Earth.

643
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,540
Night, little monkeys in your cage.

644
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,320
Night, night.

645
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,960
All your great skyscrapers,

646
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,520
your achievements, your mighty books and discoveries,

647
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,640
your symphonies, your armies, your concentration camps.

648
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,100
All of it was for nothing.

649
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,200
Your indoor plumbing, your toiletries, and your many...

650
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,700
As a wink.

651
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,820
Your vast delicacies that no one...

652
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,400
A tiny spark.

653
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,320
...for starving.

654
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,520
Dying, a dying ember in the middle of thousands

655
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,280
and billions of light years of empty, cold space.

656
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,120
Glowing, stinky hole in your third eye.

657
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,360
You are about as important as a...

658
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,220
...work in the ocean, my friend.

659
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,840
Think of a cockroach, if you would.

660
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,900
I don't know if you want to think of one for too long,

661
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,060
but just imagine the revulsion you feel when you swat one and brush it away from yourselves.

662
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:23,280
Think of yourself as a mere cockroach compared to these weird X's, Archons, whatever the hell they are.

663
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,000
They don't notice you.

664
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,840
They don't care about you.

665
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,840
If you happen to hitch a ride and they don't swat you off, then count yourself lucky.

666
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,880
But don't think you're some kind of a big deal.

667
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,940
Just cause you're a...

668
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:46,020
...god or some aliens happen to pick you up by the scruff of your neck and show you a thing or two.

669
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,620
They're in there with you.

670
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,520
They're in the room with you.

671
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,300
You can't see them.

672
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,840
You can't smell them.

673
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,860
You can't taste them.

674
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,780
But they're in the room with you.

675
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:03,560
And they blend with the walls, with the CDs, with the vinyl rack, with the digital, with everything.

676
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,940
And with the airwaves.

677
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:18,160
It's the hiss buried in the tape that we use to carry the code, the coded signal.

678
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,180
But it's the only way we can stop them.

679
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,540
The human mind.

680
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,980
The human mind is capable of receiving and transmitting radio signals.

681
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,140
It has no way of converting this knowledge or energy into a practical use.

682
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:37,920
However, the brain has in it, in some miraculous way, the ability to...

683
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,600
...transmit and convert and receive radio signals.

684
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:50,460
We use your brain as an envelope to send our letters to the others.

685
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,680
They are our correspondence with a world you could never fathom.

686
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,700
It's square to your round.

687
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,780
It's cheesy to your musky.

688
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,240
It's black to your white.

689
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,360
It's green to your red.

690
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,220
It's out of focus to your sharp image.

691
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,760
To the rat in the cheese.

692
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,140
The cheese is the universe.

693
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,180
Do the rat, baby.

694
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,920
Do it one more time.

695
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,560
Everybody loved watching Kodak.

696
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,340
Do the rat.

697
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,500
Do the rat.

698
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,800
Do the rat.

699
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:27,800
There are more things in this cheese than your little science has ever dreamt of, Mickey.

700
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,440
I've been stuck here for so long.

701
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,640
Just wondering when it's gonna end.

702
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,280
When it's gonna blow up.

703
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,320
When the sun is gonna go nova.

704
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,480
Could that be what's happening today?

705
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:48,240
If you think X-Day was just Bob's way of saying, well, it's just aliens or something.

706
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:55,760
Don't feel bad that God's gonna supernova your son unexpectedly for no particular reason.

707
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,080
No special timing.

708
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,120
Just happened to do it around the time Bob said something was gonna happen.

709
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,260
It's nice you let us know around the time because, you know, if we was more godlike, we could have made it happen.

710
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,880
We made our plans accordingly, but...

711
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,080
It's kinda like we...

712
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,080
But we're kinda like the old dog that just got too sick and we...

713
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,540
You take the old dog out in the woods, you go,

714
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,400
Here, old dog.

715
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,600
Here's a big old hunk of raw meat.

716
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,700
Mmm, isn't that good?

717
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:29,540
And when that dog turns around to gum that raw meat, you pull out your .45 and blow his poor, pathetic old doggy brains out.

718
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,420
Because it's the kindest thing to do.

719
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,380
Is that what our planet is?

720
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,500
That old dog?

721
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,560
Is...

722
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,300
Is we that old dog just being put out to pasture?

723
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:44,560
Put out on the ice flows, toothless to fend for itself or go under?

724
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,500
Is it?

725
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,560
Is our planet to...

726
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,160
Is our planet being sent off to the rest home?

727
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,200
Yeah, like everything's gotta have its time and go.

728
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,800
Maybe our time already came and went and we didn't even know it.

729
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,340
All things must pass.

730
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,420
We was laughing and playing them Dionysian dances by the old Greek rivers.

731
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:05,980
Then we decided...

732
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,740
Then were the days.

733
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,380
We jumping through hoops and wrestling with bears and then we invented hydrogen energy.

734
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,740
We decided to blow us up some bombs and have tooth decay.

735
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,040
And then have truth decay.

736
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,740
And then before we knew it, nobody knew the truth.

737
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,380
Nobody was well anymore.

738
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,000
Nobody was even really alive.

739
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,460
They were just going, going, going.

740
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,980
We thought we had the ultimate weapon.

741
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,360
Turned out God had it all along.

742
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,060
Bob was the trigger.

743
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:38,500
We were going to hold a gun to our own head and we didn't even get the chance.

744
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,680
No, we thought we were so prideful.

745
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,360
We thought we could destroy ourselves.

746
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,880
Mother Nature showed us what for.

747
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,720
Hey, you boys think you can wreck your environment with them factories and bombs?

748
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,360
Let me show you a thing or two.

749
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,100
Here, I'll just spit this little spit wad into that sun thing.

750
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,860
That little light bulb you got lighting you up.

751
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:02,200
Look very calmly and clearly at the question, Mr. Pavilion Head.

752
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,260
Counting down the minutes to the end.

753
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,940
And what you usually think of first in a situation like this is who benefits?

754
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,100
Earth first.

755
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,580
Who takes all?

756
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,680
There's a power play going on.

757
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,020
The sun's getting bigger.

758
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,100
It's getting weirder.

759
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,500
It's getting flatter and longer and more sideways and more everything.

760
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,160
It's not.

761
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,260
You know, Mars will probably be real tropical in about three hours.

762
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,200
If we could get to Mars in about three hours, it would probably be real nice.

763
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:30,240
But then by the time we got there, it would be Pluto would be getting all tropical and we'd have to get there.

764
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,220
Pluto, man.

765
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,020
And then three.

766
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,940
Well, yeah, there's going to be like palm trees on Pluto and you'd be.

767
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,360
I don't know if I got enough rocket motors for Pluto.

768
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,800
Yeah, that's the thing.

769
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,480
I don't know if we're going to be able to make it.

770
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,660
No, Pluto's no academy of planet.

771
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,520
You're forgetting one thing.

772
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,420
What if?

773
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:09,580
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

774
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,000
I was riding down Main Street in my car, a 41 underslung coupe.

775
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,340
I was all decked out in my blue suede shoes and my hair was covered with goop.

776
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,720
I was listening to my radio and waving to all the chicks.

777
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,920
When the music stopped and the newsman said...

778
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,320
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin.

779
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,340
They destroyed the world, the entire Los Angeles area.

780
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,860
Already hospital facilities have begun to crack under the strain.

781
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,320
And civil defense authorities state that the situation is much the same across the entire country.

782
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,860
Martial law is now nationwide.

783
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,020
Our fellow countrymen are dying.

784
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:18,320
The very foundations of civilization are beginning to crumble under the dread assault of that horror long feared.

785
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,000
Bob?

786
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,940
Call all that channel. This is a class one emergency.

787
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,020
All civilian traffic is barred from streets and highways.

788
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,520
Stay in your homes. Stay in your homes.

789
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,200
I got a second!

790
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,260
This is what I wanted!

791
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,240
Woo!

792
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:34,380


793
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:41,060
The exes have landed.

794
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,680
Restored their control.

795
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:55,860
The vision stands through them.

796
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,700
The sea.

797
00:35:59,340 --> 00:35:59,460
The sea.

798
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,240
Will you act of home?

799
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,520
We're tired of your phony fireworks!

800
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,820
Bartle! You have earned this!

801
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,140
Yeah!

802
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,720
The

803
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,140
The

804
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:11,820
The

805
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:29,020
What about this reputed Jesus Starfleet that was supposed to have shown up?

806
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,280
busy

807
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,160
think

808
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,700
of

809
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,300
Even

810
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,540
get

811
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:46,400
strawberries

812
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,120
a

813
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,440
push

814
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:49,440


815
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,220
Partridge

816
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,080
the bluff

817
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,660
art

818
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,280
time

819
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,840
the

820
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,380
product

821
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,340
payback

822
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,000
high- souки

823
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,360
Bob?

824
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,980
The keys, monsieur.

825
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,280
Here are your keys.

826
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,040
Oh, thank you.

827
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,820
Are those the keys to my new planet?

828
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,880
Yes, those are your keys.

829
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,380
My new planet-sized spaceship?

830
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,700
And there you have a good time for your whole everything you have.

831
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,080
And anything I want, I can create as if unlike unto a god?

832
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:28,260
Anything you want, your heart desire, you can have just by merely, you can shake the keys or let your...

833
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,240
And I can show it all off to my buddies who also bought subgenius membership cards and pledged to the station.

834
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:39,380
All your friends, you can take, you can show off any of your buttock, you can hang from the ceiling, do anything you want.

835
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,320
And all my buddies have their own planets, too.

836
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,220
In mono, stereophonic, and...

837
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,140
We can have wars and all kinds of stuff.

838
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,820
Oh, my way.

839
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:51,260
Man, I sure am glad I invested that $30 to Bob Dobbs back then in 1996.

840
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,660
When I spent that $30, you know what that amounted to?

841
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,940
Five cents a day until next day.

842
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,580
Yes.

843
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,160
It cost me less than it cost a cup of coffee in a whole year.

844
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:01,920
I must agree.

845
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,980
You made a very good deal, my friend.

846
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,240
You're a great waiter.

847
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:10,100
Are you one of the alien sex goddesses disguised as a waiter?

848
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,060
No, no, no, mon ami.

849
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,520
I am actually a waiter.

850
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:24,540
I had a chance to become one of the alien sex goddesses by prefer, merely to help you and to crack pepper for you, to shine your shoes, to do anything your heart desires.

851
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,800
See how realistic that is.

852
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,340
And mainly, I'm here to stroke your ego.

853
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,940
Just as in real life, Bob.

854
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,740
Oh, man.

855
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,620
Man, this is great.

856
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,440
I am so glad that I am a saved subgenius.

857
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,280
Oh, don't forget to try the pork pie or any of the caviar.

858
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,400
It's very excellent.

859
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,200
Oh, the food here is great.

860
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:45,880
It's like, before I even think of it, there is just what I was about to want to eat.

861
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:51,800
And, oh, I was just thinking about this comic book, this old zap comic, number five.

862
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,220
Hey, River Baby.

863
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,420
You mind if I sit down at your table?

864
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,140
Elvis.

865
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,040
How you doing, man?

866
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:02,560
You know, I never really got the chance to get in line with your church and help you out, but I saw something in the afterlife.

867
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,880
You know, I just wanted to sit down and shake your hand and say I'm a real supporter of Bob and whatnot.

868
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,780
Oh, man.

869
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,760
Well, listen, let me tell you, I grew up listening to your music, Elvis.

870
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,120
I do a lot.

871
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,700
As far as I'm concerned, you are the king.

872
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,840
And I just, man, this is great.

873
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,540
Yeah, yeah.

874
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,420
This is just unbelievable.

875
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,220
I think somebody else wants to meet you.

876
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,800
I think Sammy Davis Jr. would like to sit down and have a word with you.

877
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,220
Hey, look, I'll see you later, man.

878
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,560
There's a little filly over there I want to talk to.

879
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,560
Hey, man.

880
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:27,980
Hang in there.

881
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,420
I love Bob.

882
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:28,780
I really do.

883
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,180
Hey, Bob.

884
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,240
Thanks, Elvis.

885
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,020
Man.

886
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,380
God, this is just so...

887
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,860
Reverend baby, Ivan Stang.

888
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,960
That's you, isn't it?

889
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,020
It's Reverend Ivan Stang.

890
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,720
Oh, yeah.

891
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,160
I'm a person with...

892
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,020
I just had my adenoids removed.

893
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:42,640
I'm sorry.

894
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,080
I had the wrong table.

895
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,140
Why?

896
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,940
You know, it's great being rich and famous and having...

897
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,420
It's only been, what, two hours since 7 a.m.

898
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,560
The rupture happened two hours ago.

899
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:02,560
And already, I've stuffed my face, masturbated, met Elvis.

900
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,820
I've done all the things I never, ever did before.

901
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,800
More champagne, monsieur?

902
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,020
Oh, thank you.

903
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,520
Thank you.

904
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,000
Hey, what other celebrities are around?

905
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,320
Lenny Bruce happen to be on my planet?

906
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,760
I think Mr. Bruce is in the other room at the bar.

907
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,160
But I will go and...

908
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,200
Oh, I'll have to...

909
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,440
Don't bother him.

910
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:27,560
Don't bother him.

911
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,380
Don't bother him right now.

912
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:28,480
No, no, no, no.

913
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,800
Hey, anything for your pleasure.

914
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,960
It may take a few minutes, but I will bring him, eh?

915
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:32,900
Wow.

916
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,040
You know, it would have been creepy if Lenny Bruce had just suddenly appeared before I even got to ask.

917
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,540
Hey, you're the guy.

918
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,160
Hey, hey, hey.

919
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:40,680
You're the guy.

920
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,180
You're the guy.

921
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:41,580
You're the guy.

922
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:41,940
You're the guy.

923
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,260
You're the guy.

924
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,740
And the first time, I remember, I was the only Jew...

925
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,020
Do you remember?

926
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,720
Do you remember that shtick I did?

927
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,200
It was in...

928
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,360
I think it was at the Village...

929
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,100
No, wait.

930
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,740
It was at the Vanguard.

931
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,460
I've got a bootleg of that, man.

932
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,700
The only Jew in Ohio.

933
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,460
Do you remember that shtick?

934
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:54,900
Yeah, yeah.

935
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,480
That was you.

936
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,680
That was you, man.

937
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,760
I remember that was you all the way, because I was there.

938
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,680
I'm in Canton, Ohio.

939
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,180
I'm in Canton, Ohio, and I drive...

940
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,100
It's like a VFW hall or something like that.

941
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,380
That was only four years old?

942
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,320
They drive me out to this VFW hall, and there are these pictures of...

943
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,720
They say it's Bob there.

944
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,940
There's all these pictures of Bob everywhere, and the next thing you know, I see you're standing...

945
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,300
Man.

946
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,120
Oh.

947
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,920
Oh, look, he's shooting up.

948
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,000
Wow.

949
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:20,900
Look, look.

950
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:21,880
Do you...

951
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,720
Can you OD?

952
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,320
By the way, can you OD on the...

953
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,620
On the escape vessels, Lenny?

954
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,580
Oh, I guess so.

955
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:28,480
Bummer.

956
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:37,560
Oh, well, he was just one of the beautiful sex goddesses in the form of one of my heroes, Lenny Bruce.

957
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,740
I'm sorry, monsieur.

958
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:44,380
Today is monsieur Bruce's birthday, and as you know, he always gets the China white on his birthday.

959
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,000
We'll have to clean him up.

960
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,900
He'll be right back, perhaps at another time.

961
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,260
Man, that is so cool.

962
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,260
And Elvis is over there singing just a song just for me.

963
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:56,940
Oh, boy.

964
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,820
This Church of the Subgenius stuff was great.

965
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:05,760
It was well worth all that Xeroxing and this.

966
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,180
Hey, man.

967
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,040
Hey, Reverend.

968
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,440
You remember me?

969
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,480
Hey, what are you doing, man?

970
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,880
I'm on a heap of...

971
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,780
I'm on a heap of doo-wunky, buddy.

972
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:14,540
What?

973
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,300
I need some help, man.

974
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,700
Well, now, wait a minute.

975
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,600
I know.

976
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,300
I've retired now.

977
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,280
It's after X days.

978
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,200
You subgeniuses shouldn't need any help.

979
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:23,700
Yeah, but see?

980
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,100
Some things don't work out the way we always had them planned.

981
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,620
I don't know how to explain this, but see?

982
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:34,400
Everything's just going perfectly fine until, well, things didn't start going so good.

983
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,180
Well, wait a minute.

984
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:40,280
This is my perfect escape vessel living fantasy.

985
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,600
What are you doing here raining on my parade?

986
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,080
Well, you know, it's not exactly paradise, Rev.

987
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,780
I guess there were a few more episodes to follow X day, and you see...

988
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,440
Oh, boy.

989
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:53,680
Oh, boy.

990
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:53,680


991
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:53,680


992
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:53,680


993
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:53,680


994
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:53,680


995
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:53,680


996
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:53,680


997
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:53,680


998
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:53,680


999
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,860
I command you to disappear.

1000
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,200
Sorry, man.

1001
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,700
This is for real.

1002
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,620
He didn't...

1003
00:42:59,160 --> 00:42:59,860
Wait a minute.

1004
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:00,680
Look, here's the deal.

1005
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,520
I should be able to...

1006
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,640
Anything I want should happen.

1007
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,520
The stuff...

1008
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,180
Lonesome Cowboy Dave be gone.

1009
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:05,940
Hey, man.

1010
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,400
Listen, I'll put it to you in like a pop culture way.

1011
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,840
You ever see that movie, what was it called?

1012
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,880
Not Giardo's...

1013
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:12,940
Anovus.

1014
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,400
It was by Stanislav Slam.

1015
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,800
It was about this year's star, see?

1016
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,580
And the people got too close to it.

1017
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,280
Whatever they thought was real.

1018
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:19,960
Solaris.

1019
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:20,780
Solaris, yeah.

1020
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,600
Yeah, that's it.

1021
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,140
Solaris.

1022
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,260
And the guy starts...

1023
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:28,200
Well, you see, the stuff, you know, that was in your champagne that made you think

1024
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,820
Lenny Bruce and all them guys...

1025
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,680
Well, the stuff's kind of...

1026
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,040
It's bootleg, man.

1027
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:34,860
It's not very good.

1028
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,560
All kinds of weird stuff's happening.

1029
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,460
Some people are actually dying and staying dead.

1030
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,220
What?

1031
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,680
Other people are wishing for beautiful alien checks, God, to come and perform oral sex

1032
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,920
on them, and their heads explode, and they don't get up, and they keep on staying in

1033
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,080
pain.

1034
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,420
Wait a minute.

1035
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,580
Oh, man, it's pretty bad.

1036
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,000
Look, Elvis...

1037
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,860
That's not really Elvis.

1038
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,800
Elvis is just a record.

1039
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,680
That's right.

1040
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,440
What do you...

1041
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,220
Wait a minute.

1042
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,700
What's outside those viewports?

1043
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,060
It's outer space, right?

1044
00:43:59,240 --> 00:43:59,420
Right.

1045
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,040
Wait a minute.

1046
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,080
That's what I'm trying to explain to you, man.

1047
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,660
Wait, those are just little Christmas lights on a conveyor belt.

1048
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:04,020
Yeah.

1049
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:04,700
What the...

1050
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,020
Yeah, wait a minute.

1051
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,280
Yeah, it's a rat burger.

1052
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:07,780
You mean...

1053
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,520
Wait a minute.

1054
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,580
It's wearing off, man.

1055
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,580
You mean that we've been gypped?

1056
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,980
Not only gypped, we might be dying right now.

1057
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,160
What about the 90...

1058
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,440
Well, if we're dying, then we ought to at least get 90 bucks.

1059
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,360
No, no, no, no.

1060
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,780
We got to search around for some kind of antidote pudding for this stuff.

1061
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,400
It's something to make us at least go to one of these other different levels.

1062
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,340
Bob cheated us.

1063
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:26,780
I can't...

1064
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:27,940
That's impossible.

1065
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,880
Or you ought to make sure it's not.

1066
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,680
But how could Bob screw...

1067
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,440
Wait a minute.

1068
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,220
He cheated us, man.

1069
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,300
He cheated us.

1070
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,380
He didn't screw up the trick.

1071
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,540
No, Bob's not smart enough to cheat us.

1072
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,180
But Jesus can buy...

1073
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:44,920
Hey, where's Jesus?

1074
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,520
Look, man.

1075
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,100
I haven't seen Jesus since the rupture.

1076
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,160
I don't know nothing about the conspiracy stuff.

1077
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,880
But it's Jesus and Bob without playing golf.

1078
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,540
All of a sudden.

1079
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah.

1080
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:53,520
Oh, God.

1081
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,780
Yeah, you're going to get a lot of sugar, man.

1082
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,600
I feel like I'm seasick.

1083
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,640
Look at your fingernails, man.

1084
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,180
You're bleeding, bro.

1085
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:58,900
They're falling off.

1086
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,760
Yeah, you're bleeding.

1087
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,040
They're falling loose.

1088
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,120
And I'm bleeding, too.

1089
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:01,860
Look at this.

1090
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:02,420
It's on my nose.

1091
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,500
I'm bleeding.

1092
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,060
We're going to find Jesus.

1093
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,600
This is Bob.

1094
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,560
He didn't cheat.

1095
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:09,340
Yeah.

1096
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,140
Yeah.

1097
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,340
Yeah.

1098
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,560
still tough.

1099
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,000
I later that

1100
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,160
is nothing but a cross that's fallen over on

1101
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,240
its side and somebody jumped on it.

1102
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:40,880
There is hope there shall be hope.

1103
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,560
No, we sit and worry.

1104
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,340
Oh, gosh,

1105
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,260
if only the exits to come,

1106
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,220
we could have had a new government,

1107
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,760
we're Bob was a leader and panae's never real

1108
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,020
in there

1109
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:51,900
be no while it's yard değのは

1110
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:51,900


1111
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:51,900


1112
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:51,900


1113
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,760
cardozo diata am dealing all the world we can we do anything we wanted.

1114
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:52,840
click the SUBSCRIBE button and never miss a performance for life

1115
00:45:52,860 --> 00:46:03,340
We could have had a new church where instead of having to get up with a hangover on Sunday and watch boring crap, you'd go to church Saturday night and get drunk.

1116
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,000
Drunk, my friends.

1117
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,860
Oh, we could have had our own coolness where we invented the coolness, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1118
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,340
Friends, what are we waiting for?

1119
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:22,360
Are we really waiting on some invisible monsters in the sky or some space things or some pipe-smoking salesman with a good line?

1120
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:25,020
Friends, I say quit waiting.

1121
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:25,920
Do it yourself.

1122
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,500
Make your own slack.

1123
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:32,660
Bob is not the answer and neither is anything else.

1124
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:37,660
You must learn to think for yourself, but only Bob can show you how.

1125
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:44,600
Question authority or else and fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1126
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,320
Praise fucking Bob.

1127
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,780
Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the earth.

1128
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,760
On board were the Twelve.

1129
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:06,460
The poet, the physician, the farmer, the scientist, the magician, and the other so-called gods of our legends.

1130
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,660
But not Bob.

1131
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:08,320
The gods they were.

1132
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:16,800
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind, let us rejoice and let us sing and dance.

1133
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,540
And there was much rejoicing and singing at X-Day.

1134
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,500
But we'll have to wait another year.

1135
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,820
But we'll have to wait another year.

1136
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,340
Because we're going to break the old code.

1137
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,680
Because they did show up at X-Day.

1138
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:30,020
A new day.

1139
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,620
Yeah, we went over the rainbow.

1140
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,300
Into the mitochondrial yeti DNA level C.

1141
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,980
Well, we're going to have to go north and south and east and west.

1142
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,380
And we got to wait another year.

1143
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,040
But we're going to fill up a new pipe.

1144
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,220
We're going to wait for the sun to shine.

1145
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:50,980
We're going to turn around and take our time.

1146
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:52,840
And we're going to break the code.

1147
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,300
the seal to the other side.

1148
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,340
You know, from the valley,

1149
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,480
I hear the muffled cry

1150
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:02,240
of all them poor sheeple

1151
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,920
that we left behind.

1152
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,780
And we're gonna take that next evolutionary step.

1153
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,620
Yeah, we're gonna climb on those rocket ships.

1154
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,820
We're gonna build the vessels if we have to.

1155
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,880
We're already testing the engines.

1156
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,300
We're already testing the systems needed for this trip.

1157
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,900
We're on the ride, yeah.

1158
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,220
Mitochondria leave.

1159
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,860
Steve, thanks for the ride.

1160
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,700
We'll take it from here.

1161
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,100
Oh, here, here.

1162
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,380
This is the video down feed from the rocket launch.

1163
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:32,700
Here.

1164
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,740
Launch the rocket ship.

1165
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,640
Remember they were all chanting this together

1166
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,000
as we were lighting the fuse?

1167
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:38,460
Yeah, I did. I was dancing.

1168
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,760
Mojo and I were out there lighting rocket butt.

1169
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,800
Don't you worry about us, Lord.

1170
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,520
We may blow a few holes in your ceiling

1171
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:47,540
from time to time,

1172
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,220
but we'll give you fair warning

1173
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,000
before we blow up the whole house.

1174
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,000
And your kitchen.

1175
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,700
The bleeding head of our father.

1176
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,560
Oh, he's the nicest decapitated injured golfer

1177
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,260
in the World Cup class I know.

1178
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,300
Yes, the bleeding head of our father.

1179
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,420
Well, Spooky Musical will be back in just a minute.

1180
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:13,020
And I want to turn this around and, you know,

1181
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,000
I don't know.

1182
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:14,800
We'll do it.

1183
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:15,800
I don't know.

1184
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,340
Okay, here come the first Texans.

1185
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:21,100
A corpse can't sue you.

1186
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,340
And more problems have been caught

1187
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:26,040
caused by people shooting attackers

1188
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,520
when they simply wound them.

1189
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,500
So get police training,

1190
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,040
buy your gun,

1191
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,280
shoot to kill,

1192
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,740
and see you next time.

1193
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,160
This Apollo flight grossed out

1194
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,880
at six million pounds.

1195
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,360
To escape Earth's gravity,

1196
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,000
it had to achieve a velocity

1197
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,640
of six miles per second.

1198
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,620
En route time to the moon

1199
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,520
was 66 hours.

1200
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,200
The arrows are pulled.

1201
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:51,660
Poisoned.

1202
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,520
It's always ugly.

1203
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,860
It's like rotting fruit.

1204
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,820
It's like meat that is spoiled.

1205
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,780
It's like a roof that leaks.

1206
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,880
A foundation that is rotten.

1207
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:06,660
Poisoned?

1208
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,300
We need to save it!

1209
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,960
Booty got all the balls.

1210
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,420
Stay in the 상 scene.

1211
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,960
We're all waiting for the good salts.

1212
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:45,320
Let's go to the moon vai-eeeeeeeeee!

1213
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:45,380


1214
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,380
BrightSoak

1215
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:51,200
This sequence is made for entertainment.

1216
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,760
Illumina, Illumina, Illumina

1217
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,140
The sea, elect, electra, electra

1218
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,960
Sookie, nebun, nebun, nebun

1219
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,860
Immaculate, immaculate

1220
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:05,860
Love the sea, autom, automata, automata

1221
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:09,180
All the kids completely smitten

1222
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,200
All the kids completely lovin'

1223
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,920
All the kids want to be bitten

1224
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,860
By rats, by the dozens

1225
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,140
Bitten to death by rats

1226
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,260
Bitten to death by rats

1227
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,840
Bitten to death by rats

1228
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,560
What do you think of that?

1229
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,880
All the kids are set in traps

1230
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,680
To collect a lot of rats

1231
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,320
When they've got enough of them

1232
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,260
Top rats the lakes are fighting

1233
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,720
Bitten to death by rats

1234
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,700
Bitten to death by rats

1235
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,300
Bitten to death by rats

1236
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,060
What do you think of that?

1237
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,320
Bitten to death by rats

1238
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,240
Bitten to death by rats

1239
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,740
Bitten to death by rats

1240
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,360
What do you think of that?

1241
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,700
The pagans and the abortionists

1242
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:49,120
And the feminists and the gays and the lesbians

1243
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:49,820
The pagans and the abortionists

1244
00:51:49,820 --> 00:52:03,320
The Pagans and the Abortionists and the Feminists and the Gays and the Lesbians

1245
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:49,800
and the Feminists and the Gays and the Lesbians

1246
00:52:49,820 --> 00:53:19,800
and the Gays and the Lesbians

1247
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:21,080
deserve to be kissed.

1248
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,180
I do believe I'm a genius.

1249
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,240
This is a dopey thing.

1250
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,580
All the artists around here.

1251
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:17,420
This is a dopey thing.

1252
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,220
And maybe I deserve to be kissed.

1253
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:34,560
First I was cowboy and then a guru priest.

1254
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,000
Any little thing just to keep my hungry.

1255
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,140
Wear a white leather suit and a bubble-toed shoe.

1256
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:46,060
Got a $50,000 a year case of the beast.

1257
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,800
Baby, I'm a fine artiste.

1258
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,720
And maybe I deserve to be kissed.

1259
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:13,540
Leaving home on this bumpy road.

1260
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:16,420
Man, my butt's getting sore.

1261
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,320
I've got to go out.

1262
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:19,560
Ooh.

1263
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,040
Sell this hay.

1264
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:24,060
You know my wife and kids are hungry at home.

1265
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,960
But these cars are spooking my pony.

1266
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,600
As I merge onto rural Route 7.

1267
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,380
Riding, I've got flies in my eyes.

1268
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,360
You know I should have washed this horse because he sticks to high heaven.

1269
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:43,220
Big old horse, soon buggy.

1270
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,480
Ain't carried me too far today.

1271
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,000
Whoa.

1272
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,580
Big old horse.

1273
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:50,840
Soon buggy.

1274
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:54,080
Under market still ten miles away.

1275
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:09,160
Friends, we just heard bitten to death by rats by James Kochalka superstar who bit the rats to death.

1276
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:16,300
The list and a dial 13013 by I am BJR.

1277
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,420
And it.

1278
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,220
Robert Crumb.

1279
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:22,220
Did the fine artiste blues.

1280
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,320
Big buggy.

1281
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,260
We have to nuke them.

1282
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,420
We have to nuke them now.

1283
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,320
Is by the electric Amish.

1284
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:34,000
This is, uh, Elambre Systems in the background.

1285
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:39,540
And friends, I will see you at www.subgenius.com.

1286
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:45,020
If the world doesn't end this July 5th, 1998.

1287
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,520
Praise Bob.

1288
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,580
Follower CPU'.

1289
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:10,960
Back to the distribution.

1290
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,700
We have an ambient огромity that happens in the wrong place.

1291
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,220
What makes fun of this idea is research Caesar.

1292
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:12,780
Don't wait for collapses in your head and be

1293
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:13,060
mushy.

1294
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:13,640
But know that you can just go on surpassing your life in aitta and play-by-rat.

1295
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,080
Then get in there.

1296
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,020
This worries me.

1297
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:17,960
No.

1298
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:19,800
That bothers me.

1299
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,280
The number you have reached...

1300
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,860
P.O. Box 1-4-0-3-0-6

1301
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:34,080
Has been changed. The new number is...

1302
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:39,500
P.O. Box 2-0-4-2-0-6

1303
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,800
Austin, Texas

1304
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:46,460
7-8-7-2-0

1305
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:48,240
Please make a note of it.

1306
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,200
My debt's getting high, my income is low

1307
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,120
I've got to pay off all these bills that I owe

1308
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:08,960
My papaw and me came up with a plan

1309
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,760
To bring heathen dollars to our Amish land

1310
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,160
So come on and take a hayride

1311
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:16,960
Hayride!

1312
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:20,340
Just open up your wallet wide

1313
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:24,000
Two dollars for a hayride

1314
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:30,540
Hey, you know, Jacob asked his wife on their wedding night if he was her first

1315
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,380
She looked at him and said, why does everybody keep asking me that?

1316
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:37,520
We're selling our crafts just as fast as we can

1317
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,960
We hope you won't notice they're made in Japan

1318
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,840
The prices are high and the quality's low

1319
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,920
But you stupid tourists

1320
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,840
Are too dumb to know

1321
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:52,340
So come on and take a hayride

1322
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:53,180
Hayride!

1323
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,220
They're selling souvenirs inside

1324
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,960
Get a t-shirt and a hayride

1325
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,480
Yank, yank, yank, tug, tug, tug

1326
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,300
And a couple of slaps and whacks

1327
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:10,120
That's how she makes the scarecrow come

1328
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,040
When the tin man's up her ass

1329
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,060
Up your ass, motherfucker

1330
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:13,740
Bark, bark, bark

1331
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:14,940
Yip, yip, yip

1332
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,000
Toto wants to bone her ass

1333
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:17,180
Woo-hoo!

1334
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,680
She clicks her heels and Toto squeals

1335
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,980
Train no place like home

1336
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:24,740
Fuck you!

1337
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,140
Let's yank this bird's face
