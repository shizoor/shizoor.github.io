1
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,880
And you sit there and you talk with your neighbors.

2
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,260
Each one is named Mr. Smith.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,900
Let's sing to the hour of black.

4
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,780
I'm J.N. O'Byrne.

5
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,820
Praise God!

6
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:38,600
My hair!

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:48,920
Your mind is completely released and becomes still and tranquil

8
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:56,200
as it gives itself in complete surrender to a positive new pattern

9
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,980
of perfect happiness and grace.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,460
Restoration.

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,720
From the so-called powers of voodoo, hoodoo, hexes, jinxes, and witchcraft,

12
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,940
get rid of that spell of sickness.

13
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,180
Get rid of those funny sicknesses that you're wondering about

14
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,000
and the doctors can't seem to do any good for.

15
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,560
I've got to get a grip on myself here.

16
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,160
Heaven will be my home

17
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,920
Oh!

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,920
And I'll come

19
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,740
to get this all

20
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,700
This is it.

21
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,780
This is it.

22
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,240
What?

23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,520
They're going to make a contact.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, Johnny, you are drunk.

25
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,840
No, no, no, no.

26
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,520
Listen, Rosie.

27
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,260
They've contacted me on the car radio.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,300
This is the night.

29
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,760
Now let's watch the sky.

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,040
I don't see anything.

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,380
Anything moving?

32
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,500
Over there.

33
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,200
That one.

34
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,540
What?

35
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,980
No, it's...

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,580
It's not moving.

37
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,940
I don't see anything moving.

38
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,860
Uh-oh, I think he's caught it.

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,780
Doctor, give him something for his cough.

40
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,100
All right, all right.

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,280
Here's a quarter.

42
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,020
Oh, that's not much.

43
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,160
Not much of a cough.

44
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,180
Well, thanks, Douglas.

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,920
I'll take over.

46
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,420
Big man.

47
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:21,740
Pop.

48
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,960
P-O.

49
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,760
Oh, yes, dear friends.

50
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,520
I'll take over.

51
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,580
Ooh, thanks, Doug.

52
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,660
Well, you've got me all worked up again.

53
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,620
That ought to have been nice.

54
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,700
Get rid of that spell of sickness.

55
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,940
Get rid of those funny sicknesses that you're wondering about

56
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,780
and the doctors can't seem to do any good for.

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,020
After about 20 minutes, we went into the house.

58
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,760
Our master bedroom was furnished with lounge furniture.

59
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,320
And also, there was a radio and a TV receiver.

60
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,380
And I sat in there in the darkness.

61
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,760
I was looking out the window.

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,120
Just how did this message come to you on the radio?

63
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,940
Well, maybe I can show you, honey.

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,100
Look, we've got this radio over here.

65
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,880
See this little radio?

66
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,440
Yeah.

67
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,580
Now, I talked like this.

68
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,060
Okay.

69
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,080
All right, you folks.

70
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,940
Look, proof to my wife that you've spoken to me.

71
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,280
Do like you did when I was in the car.

72
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,100
Sure, like you showed me.

73
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,320
What was that?

74
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,160
It was the television.

75
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,080
The television.

76
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,660
Oh, Johnny, there's something wrong here.

77
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,680
Are you the same ones who contacted me in the car?

78
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,640
Look at the screen, John.

79
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,400
Look at the screen.

80
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,520
Like Bob.

81
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,820
Bob, you're the people.

82
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,300
With your neighbors.

83
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,720
Each one is named Mr. Smith.

84
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,780
And he says, I'm average.

85
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,440
You say, I am too.

86
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,700
And it's lovely to look at love when you're average.

87
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:24,940
I'm average.

88
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,640
But then you've got to get back.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,200
You've got to get back.

90
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,400
And that's the hard thing.

91
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,940
To make the film go backward.

92
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,580
Until finally, you're crawling back through the sewer.

93
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,480
Up through the pipes.

94
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,180
Somehow you make it back through the drain.

95
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,800
And then the reality of where you are.

96
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,460
Brings you back.

97
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,080
And then you're back.

98
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,440
And then you're back.

99
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:56,440


100
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:56,440


101
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,480
What's going on here?

102
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,920
The Cell Genius.

103
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,760
Our own cell.

104
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,320
Watch.

105
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,780
You're going down.

106
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,120
Chainsaw.

107
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,520
Chainsaw.

108
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:15,560
Chainsaw.

109
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,240
I have sinned against you, my lord.

110
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,800
I have sinned against thearynx.

111
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:28,800


112
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:28,800


113
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:28,800


114
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:28,800


115
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,220
Can I ask you to forgive me?

116
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:36,720
How can I ask you to forgive me?

117
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:44,600
How can I ask you to forgive me?

118
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,180
I have sinned against every one of you.

119
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,180


120
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,180


121
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,300
I only owe it to one last reign.

122
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:51,700
Elliott Nash.

123
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:51,700


124
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:51,700


125
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:51,700


126
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:51,700


127
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:51,700


128
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,140
And this is why.

129
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,780
Though our marriageی

130
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:02,620
I call it a mendacity. I call it sin.

131
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,300
I call it sin.

132
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:13,600
I call it sin.

133
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:35,660
I want to address myself as best as I know how to those that I have wronged, that I have sinned against.

134
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,880
First of all, my wife, Frances.

135
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:54,560
God never gave a man a better helpmate and companion to stand beside him.

136
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,980
I have sinned against you.

137
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,340
And I beg your forgiveness.

138
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,040
I have sinned against you.

139
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,060
And I beg your forgiveness.

140
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:38,260
God could never give a man a father, a minister of the gospel, a finer son than he has given me and his mother.

141
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,760
I have sinned.

142
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,260
Donnie and Debbie.

143
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,680
I have sinned against you.

144
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,120
And I beg you, forgive me.

145
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,040
I have sinned against you.

146
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,380
Donnie and Debbie.

147
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,280
I have sinned against you.

148
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,900
I know that so many would ask, why?

149
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,960
Why?

150
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,740
Why?

151
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,280
I have asked myself that 10,000 times.

152
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:42,980
Through 10,000 years.

153
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,560
Why?

154
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,600
Why?

155
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,460
Why?

156
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,500
I call it sin.

157
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,660
I have sinned against you, my Lord.

158
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:21,160
And I would ask that your precious blood

159
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:30,520
would wash and cleanse everything

160
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:38,260
until it is in the seas of God.

161
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,560
God's forgetfulness.

162
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,120
Never to be remembered against me anymore.

163
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,420
Being acquainted with customs and habits different from our own

164
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,620
is an important part of the learning process.

165
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,940
That's right, it really is, dear friends.

166
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,560
You're listening to The Hour of Slack

167
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,880
on KNON 90.9 FM.

168
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,020
The Hour of Slack voice.

169
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,500
Of the Church of the Subgenius.

170
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,300
And this is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

171
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:23,100
You can call 823-7490 for information.

172
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:29,780
You'll be speaking to the Will O'Dobbs itself.

173
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,480
Oh, fuck.

174
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,000
But are you still smoking the same old brand, friend?

175
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,060
The communist brand?

176
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,600
The smoke?

177
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,260
The smokers smoke?

178
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,500
On the side of the package it says,

179
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,580
warning, smoke or else.

180
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,600
Or are you smoking the capitalist brand cigarettes?

181
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,920
The smoke that sets you free.

182
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,760
Cigarettes, they call them.

183
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,380
That's the one that's got the warning on it.

184
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,540
About smoke at your own risk.

185
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,960
Communism, capitalism.

186
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,260
They both deliver on that great taste.

187
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,860
Repression, authority, dogma, mayhem.

188
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,420
And what's one without the other, dear friend?

189
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,840
After all, they've been battling for close to a century.

190
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:30,220
The same stilted bulldada from either side.

191
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,540
You know, without the decadent West, the Reds,

192
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,260
oh, they'd be in the pink, pinker than red.

193
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,260


194
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,360
And without the, quote, evil empire, unquote,

195
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,080
the West would truly be the best.

196
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,620
And in between, they've brought us such great tastes

197
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,040
as Cold War, World War, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan,

198
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,780
Bay of Pigs, and soon, soon to come, friends,

199
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,540
Central America.

200
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,960
Not to mention a neat $3 trillion military bill

201
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,260
for keeping both sides in power.

202
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,100
Well, don't get branded.

203
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,000
Leave the rope to the rest, dear friends,

204
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:20,600
and break away from the pack with subgenius.

205
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,640
Mmm, subgenius.

206
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,100
What a great taste.

207
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,120
Mm-mm.

208
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,520
Neither, neither God nor master, dear friend.

209
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,260
And no state, neither.

210
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,340
Ain't that refreshing?

211
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,620
It's our own way.

212
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,640
No leaders?

213
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,100
No followers.

214
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,320
Try it today.

215
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,120
Subgenius.

216
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,620
And call 823-7490 for further information

217
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,520
on where to write for your further information.

218
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,540
Whoa.

219
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,260
On the other hand, we should try not to pass judgment.

220
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,420
You're kidding me.

221
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,180
Nope.

222
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,520
Nope.

223
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,220
This is drugs.

224
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,580
This is your brain on drugs.

225
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,180
Any questions?

226
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,480
Huh.

227
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,820
Oh, you did.

228
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,920
Oh, I know.

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,560
I did.

230
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,780
It was so nice.

231
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,100
It was so nice of him.

232
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,980
Just, why ca...

233
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,780
You know that Bob, that way we were guy.

234
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,780
Why can't Woodman be more like Bob?

235
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,740
Why do you want him to be like Bob?

236
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,600
Because I don't know Bob.

237
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,980
I, I don't.

238
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,240
Why would you?

239
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,240


240
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,240


241
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,240


242
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,400
I don't know, Bob, but I've been touched.

243
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,060
I've been touched by Bob.

244
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,460
And, well, you've been touched by Bob, too.

245
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,980
And I know you have.

246
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,200
And I know you know.

247
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,940
And then the horrible, perverse God is laughing at his truth

248
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,480
as it stays the same.

249
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,400
From what I've told you about Bob,

250
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,920
you think he sounds okay to you?

251
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,660
Yeah, I guess.

252
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,300
You're not sure?

253
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,420
There's only one thing I'm sure of.

254
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,440
What's that?

255
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,380
He's lucky.

256
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,320
He's not just a doctor.

257
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,080
He's a person like anyone else.

258
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,400
Isn't he?

259
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,020
I mean, he's just a person who makes his living staring at...

260
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,100
He's a doctor.

261
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,920
He's a doctor.

262
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,900
That's the important thing.

263
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,080
He's a doctor, a man of science.

264
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,240
This has nothing to do with sex.

265
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,580
Hi, I'm Dr. Barber.

266
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,740
Ellen.

267
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,540
Bob.

268
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,280
Ellen?

269
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,540
Oh, my God.

270
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,840
I mean, Bob.

271
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:43,980
Right.

272
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,620
Uh, so, uh, so.

273
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,760
So.

274
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,140
Hi.

275
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:51,900
Hi, Ellen.

276
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,160
How are you?

277
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,000
Hi, Bob.

278
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,680
I'm fine.

279
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,500
And you?

280
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,300
Fine, fine.

281
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,700
Um, Bob, I'm a little surprised to see you here.

282
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,400
I was expecting a doctor.

283
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:01,860
Doctor.

284
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:02,940
Doctor.

285
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,320
Doctor.

286
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,100
Doctor.

287
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,340
Doctor.

288
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:05,560
Doctor.

289
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,020
Doctor.

290
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,100
I was expecting a doctor, not Bob.

291
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,880
I was expecting...

292
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,480
I'm gonna...

293
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,060
I'm gonna...

294
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:11,940
Is this your Bob?

295
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,200
Bob.

296
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,560
Bob is there.

297
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,680
He's here.

298
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,320
He's a little homeless.

299
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,320
I don't know where I'm going to put him.

300
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,720
But that's what you get for the service.

301
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,300
Epic.

302
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:21,720
Is that it?

303
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,120
And, um, well, that's it.

304
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,780
Is that all right?

305
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,440
Every time I sit down

306
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,540
I'm a doctor.

307
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:35,540


308
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:35,540


309
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:35,540


310
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,580
A complete cyborg.

311
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,440
And that suits this orders.

312
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:54,240
From a handsome man

313
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,380
to a shopper.

314
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,700
I'm in Surrey

315
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:58,700


316
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:58,740
Nobody has heard of

317
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,720
stuffed with

318
00:15:59,720 --> 00:15:59,740
it.

319
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,500
It's down to

320
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,800
no cleaning.

321
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,260
Too much will

322
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:03,440
only

323
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:03,440


324
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,180
wickedness

325
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,660
away.

326
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,520
I didn't see

327
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,840
Call 823-7490

328
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,720
for more information.

329
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,140
Thank you.

330
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,160
Thank you.

331
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,120
Thank you.

332
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,880
Thank you.

333
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,300
Thank you.

334
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,580
Thank you.

335
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:21,620
Each day you will experience a new delightful sense of quiet peace and perfect contentment.

336
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,780
Oh no, he burned down the transmitter again.

337
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,040
Oh man.

338
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,900
Kind of sort of bummed me out.

339
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,380
Isn't it?

340
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,340
In a sort of multi-logical way.

341
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,600
I don't know what you're going to see.

342
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,620
I don't know if the auto focus is on the commercial.

343
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,820
I'm sure the cars will stand by here for just a few more minutes

344
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,020
in the nonsensical beginning of your famous tape.

345
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,500
Right, somebody take the gun away from St. DeRule.

346
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:58,180
By the eleventh day, it became eminently apparent

347
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,380
that both Hargraves and Jennings were weakening severely.

348
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,640
I was still forging ahead with my trusty Sherpas,

349
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:17,700
but the two young army officers began falling farther and farther behind.

350
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:24,560
Often they would not straggle in until it was almost dark and camp had been set,

351
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,420
and would collapse in front of the fire and having eaten,

352
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,460
go directly to sleep.

353
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,900
And I think the poor lads slept with difficulty.

354
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,860
Their bodies aching and groaning, every muscle shrieking,

355
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,340
every singing twanging in protest of this arduous trek

356
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,780
above the high Pamiers in...

357
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,600
to the unknown valley of the Crusader,

358
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,940
high amid the radioactive rubble of what was once the splendor of Tibet.

359
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,940
I made notes in my journal,

360
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,880
used extra meditation chips,

361
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,140
and then finished off the eleventh day

362
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,680
by chanting myself into a state of insensibility,

363
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,880
doing my Harry Curly Moe, Bob Hill's,

364
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,420
Sex, Food, Love, Nukes mantra,

365
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:29,240
until at last the whole forbidding landscape

366
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,100
shrouded in snow,

367
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,260
encrusted with glittering iron-like ice,

368
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,160
became a rosy glow around me,

369
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,200
and I knew that before me somewhere,

370
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,920
somewhere in the valley of the Crusader,

371
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,940
amid the radioactive rubble of what was once the splendor of Tibet,

372
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,100
somewhere in there I knew lay the answer.

373
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,300
So...

374
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,620
Tell me about Smith.

375
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,100
Well, Smith ain't no trouble.

376
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,180
He's just this little guy with glasses.

377
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,340
Well, I said, sound's eunuchs.

378
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,720
Yeah.

379
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,920
He can barely drive a car,

380
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,740
and he's right above us at the same time.

381
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,020
Don't come drunk, friend,

382
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,520
on the Skull Farmers.

383
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,960
We can go on the lawn

384
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,600
where the Skull Farmers are.

385
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,980
Skull Farmers. Not again.

386
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,800
Oh, God, I don't want to hear him go into that, my friends.

387
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,100
No, I do not.

388
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,280
I daze not, let me say.

389
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,500
Let me put it that way.

390
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,240
Some nice natural sounds for some background.

391
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,360
Got a little bit of a rant coming up here.

392
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,040
Actually, this is not one of my rants.

393
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,720
This is just merely information

394
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,960
presented in a fairly straightforward manner

395
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,120
by Dr. Waves Forrest,

396
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,420
who actually was one of the co-authors

397
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,960
on High Weirdness by Mail,

398
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,980
the new subgenius book.

399
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,340
Not yet available.

400
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,320
I'm not sure if you've read it.

401
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,420
And I'll give you Waves' number

402
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,280
at the end of the rant

403
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,600
if you remind me correctly,

404
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,920
and if these darn tapers in the background

405
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,180
will quit snorting around.

406
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,660
It's easy. It's easy for me.

407
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,220
You know, I get to live

408
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,020
pretty much anywhere in the world I want,

409
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,960
make love to pretty much any animal I want.

410
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,320
Bob promised us that.

411
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,280
He said we could do that.

412
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,180
But as it says here in Waves' latest,

413
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,800
have you thought about

414
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,780
where the oxygen you breathe comes from

415
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,140
or where it's going and how fast?

416
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,800
Now, anybody listening to this show probably has.

417
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,520
But have you noticed the decline in water quality

418
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,920
and the increasing disruption

419
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,780
of once-dependable rain patterns?

420
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,880
Notice the funny weather we've been having lately,

421
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,960
as it says in the pamphlet?

422
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,040
Or the deterioration of public health

423
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,700
and vitality in general

424
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,340
and reduced life expectancy for adults?

425
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,800
It's started to go down lately.

426
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,140
The primary cause of the continuing slaughter

427
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,820
of Earth's trees and other photosynthesizing

428
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,600
or oxygen-producing surfaces,

429
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,700
such as green plankton in the ocean,

430
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,300
coupled with the massive oxygen consumption

431
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,280
of modern industrial transportation methods.

432
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,940
So...

433
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,260
killing trees and bugs

434
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,520
and making more stuff.

435
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,880
Well, we all knew that.

436
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,060
We've all been...

437
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,380
most, I think, most regular listeners

438
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,960
and probably most of you

439
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,620
who've been listening to the Church's subgenius

440
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,380
radio ministry for the first time

441
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,100
knew that our oxygen is being depleted,

442
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,920
slowly but surely,

443
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,260
by the deforestation of the major rainforest.

444
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,880
No big deal.

445
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,560
Nothing worse than a nuclear war.

446
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,940
It's not even worse than nuclear war.

447
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,240
It's not even worse than nuclear winter.

448
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,900
It might last a little longer.

449
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,940
That's about the only thing.

450
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,240
You know,

451
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,460
all it really means is that,

452
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,140
you know how we exhale that carbon dioxide stuff

453
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,320
that those trees breathe.

454
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,100
Well, they breathe out that oxygen stuff

455
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,900
that we breathe.

456
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,300
And three quarters of it comes from South America

457
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,280
for the whole planet.

458
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,140
Actually, I don't know if it's three quarters of it.

459
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,300
The rainforests in general provide

460
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,820
most of the land-contributed oxygen,

461
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,320
since the trees and other plants there

462
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,620
have much faster respiration and growth rates.

463
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,160
They spread like subgeniuses,

464
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,280
have a lot of babies, friends.

465
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,900
And they have a lot more surface area per acre

466
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,200
than your subarctic forests or temperate forests

467
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,960
like around here.

468
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,560
By the same token, cattle grazing land,

469
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,860
which is what a lot of the rainforests are getting torn down,

470
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,520
and they're trying to make way for,

471
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,020
produces a whole lot less oxygen than that.

472
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,880
Makes lots of hamburgers.

473
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,100
The big beef, big-time beef business

474
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,520
requires thousands of acres, friends,

475
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,520
and undeveloped lands and ranch hands

476
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,300
and just about everything else that you need

477
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,460
to raise cattle can be had a lot cheaper

478
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,880
in less developed countries,

479
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,580
particularly South America or Africa.

480
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,700
But the land there wears out after only a few years,

481
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,880
since the soil that had sustained the rainforest

482
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,180
isn't really rich enough to last as pasture.

483
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,460
It works out, in the end,

484
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,940
to about nine square yards of rainforest

485
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,140
that get wasted for each hamburger.

486
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,160
I know that sounds ridiculous.

487
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,920
I mean, I'd hate to think how many square yards

488
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,640
of rainforest got wasted for one subgenius pamphlet.

489
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,400
Ethiopia being a classic example.

490
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,900
That country was nearly half forest in the year 1900,

491
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,180
and it's now about 2% forest.

492
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,660
Rain seldom falls where there are no trees.

493
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,920
And nobody eats.

494
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,260
And despite such innovations

495
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,440
that the government generally tends to,

496
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,220
not the government really so much as

497
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,380
those who own the government, I should say,

498
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,900
tend to just keep the lid on.

499
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,720
Innovations like electroaccretion,

500
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,320
where you grow walls for houses in the ocean

501
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,920
for almost nothing,

502
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,500
or urethane foam structures,

503
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,860
growing houses from interwoven tree branches.

504
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,700
Despite all that,

505
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,180
lumber will continue to be in demand for most construction,

506
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,700
since it's what we're used to and it's versatile.

507
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,240
So a total moratorium on cutting trees is obviously out.

508
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,020
Nobody's going to quit eating hamburgers,

509
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,880
except vegetarianists,

510
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,460
and I mean wimps.

511
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,960
So that means if we don't want to have to buy

512
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,780
all of our oxygen in bottles in about 20 years,

513
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,800
which would mean the poor people,

514
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,020
like most of you,

515
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,000
would have to just plain stop breathing,

516
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,160
then we need to get moving

517
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,940
on some pretty heavy reforestation programs.

518
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,840
I'm sorry you have to hear the Church of the Subgenius

519
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,760
preach about serious stuff like that,

520
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,280
but it's sort of like that nuclear war stuff.

521
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:28,940
That's fun.

522
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,020
That's fun pornography for us subgenius ministers.

523
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,760
We love to talk about your hair falling out

524
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,040
and the breeze and the buildings crumbling around you

525
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,460
and all that,

526
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,460
but the slow suffocation, dear friends.

527
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,400
Think of the suspense.

528
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,780
Don't worry.

529
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,980
You'll find out if we can do the subgenius movie

530
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,380
before that actually happens.

531
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,420
Friends,

532
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,800
now,

533
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,880
this morning,

534
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,180
that was merely the prelude.

535
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,440
That was from Waves Forest's Now What?

536
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,700
Issue number one,

537
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:09,120
which has information besides the electro-accretion techniques

538
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,340
and plant growth acceleration methods.

539
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,240
I haven't tested them.

540
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:14,660
I don't know.

541
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,460
But I trust the guy.

542
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,460
He's a buddy.

543
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,500
He's a subgenius.

544
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,380
Right for information from Waves at...

545
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,780
Oh, and here's the other thing.

546
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,660
He's got...

547
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,180
is the AIDS cure theory.

548
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,340
Okay.

549
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,580
P.O. Box 768,

550
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,940
Monterey, California,

551
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,640
93942.

552
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,260
We'll give that one again in a minute.

553
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:39,560
Now,

554
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,180
what I was really getting to here

555
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,740
is that, uh,

556
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,000
this morning, I opened up my morning paper.

557
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,340
I love to read the paper in the morning

558
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:49,980
because it...

559
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,780
it fills me with such hate.

560
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,860
The child rapes and the kidnappings.

561
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,780
Oh, there was one down the street from me.

562
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,020
Four houses down,

563
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,240
a little 14-year-old boy

564
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,960
with three of his buddies went and, uh,

565
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,140
they stole a car and a gun,

566
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,440
and they played with gun,

567
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,780
and one of them shot himself in the head.

568
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,080
I remember coming out about 10 o'clock at night

569
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,840
seeing the ambulance and all that,

570
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,920
and it's just sort of normal nowadays.

571
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,200
And so, you know,

572
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,400
when you read the newspapers,

573
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,420
then you get into this fit of subgeniusness,

574
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,540
basically, is what it amounts to.

575
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,000
Uh...

576
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,320
Now, this particular, uh, morning,

577
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,280
around...way down around page five,

578
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,360
in the little section,

579
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,240
the little special section of minor news items

580
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,880
around the U.S., they called it,

581
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,000
as if it didn't have anything to do

582
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,960
with the rest of the world,

583
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,060
quote,

584
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,800
greenhouse effect,

585
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,580
linked to forests.

586
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,000
Washington.

587
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,820
Hey, this is big news, friends.

588
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,060
Not that they bothered to put it on the front page

589
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,160
or anything like that, no.

590
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,020
It's the kind of thing that should have been

591
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,980
on the front page 20 years ago

592
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,680
and could have been.

593
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,900
Major efforts to restore tropical forests

594
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,740
could bring an important slowdown

595
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,540
in the expected greenhouse effect

596
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,000
or warming of the Earth,

597
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,660
according to a study of forest needs.

598
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,820
Uh, growing trees, uh, absorb carbon dioxide,

599
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,080
the principal gas responsible for the warming,

600
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,200
and break down gas to incorporate carbon

601
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,520
in their woody tissues.

602
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,800
Uh, a growing forest also adds carbon to the soil.

603
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,940
It does provide an important lag time,

604
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,320
while we do important things in other areas,

605
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,800
like reorient national energy policies.

606
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,560
One paragraph on page five, dear friends.

607
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,020
With about 40 other paragraphs around it.

608
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,780
And it's more, it's a more likely end

609
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,280
to you and me and all the cute little bunnies

610
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,440
and rabbits that you animal lovers

611
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,780
don't want to eat.

612
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,480
A sure and certain end, dear friends.

613
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,280
And it makes a paragraph every month,

614
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,960
well, actually, they mention it every month

615
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,660
or two, three, you know, it's a minor thing.

616
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,200
They don't want to get you excited.

617
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,180
They don't want to panic you about what could happen

618
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:29,720
if there, if about a million Johnny Apple seeds

619
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,080
don't get to work.

620
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,780
It's essentially what it boils down to.

621
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,740
And the, here's the most horrible thing

622
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,160
about this little paragraph.

623
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,740
Not that it was so little, and not that it was at the back,

624
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,640
but the irony on top of it was that the statistics came

625
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,040
from the World Watch Institute.

626
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,820
Probably ourこう

627
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:26,120
friends and it makes a paragraph every month well actually they mention it

628
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,080
every month or two three you know it's a it's a minor thing they don't want to

629
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:37,000
get you excited they don't want to panic you about what could happen if there if

630
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,040
about a million Johnny Apples seeds don't get to work it's essentially what

631
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:49,840
it boils down to and the here's the most horrible thing about this little

632
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,720
paragraph not that it was so little and not that it was at the back but the

633
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,540
irony on top of it was that the statistics came from the World Watch

634
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:05,460
Institute the Institute is a Washington based environmental research

635
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:12,400
organization now not to slander anybody but word has it in certain circles of

636
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:19,060
kooks crazies subversives weirdos computer hackers and others

637
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,680
you know people who study the news constantly the especially suppressed

638
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,840
news who of course therefore wouldn't know what was really going on according

639
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:35,060
to mainstream ordinary news doctrine World Watch Institute is basically

640
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:43,440
government supported the news about the environment the scariest news you get is

641
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,620
associated oftentimes with them and yet and yet and yet you know there are

642
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,820
organizations that are doing this and they're doing it for the sake of the

643
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,080
Klim podcast remember we are

644
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,600
together forget we are connected we're planning try

645
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:02,640
again but hey the thing is this the picture result says that neoliberalised

646
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:02,660
light is your message to me then should you be okay with that

647
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,880
part as in ition numbers you want to eu i for

648
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:03,880


649
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,820
Carol stated when she input 15 protracting

650
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,300
nomination from herdsman

651
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,820
can it represented the

652
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,340
pres Ig i w

653
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,380
on a

654
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,540
which was a

655
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:17,840
those are 24

656
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,680
I am

657
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,460
bid

658
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,960
that they've helped in some manner.

659
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,740
Now, the funny thing is,

660
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,640
I get mailings from the World Watch Institute once a week,

661
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,080
and I've never given them money.

662
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,580
If I've been getting one every week for three years,

663
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,140
and lots of other people have,

664
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,480
think how many millions,

665
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,760
how many acres of rainforest had to go down

666
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,980
to support those mailings,

667
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,360
those pro-environmental mailings,

668
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,660
of the biggest of the environmental groups.

669
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,380
They're not all like that.

670
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,540
I don't think you could say that.

671
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,440
I mean, I haven't heard rumors.

672
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,020
These are rumors, of course,

673
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,880
that no station like this would ever support such rumors.

674
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,060
You know, in public.

675
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,460
But this is not to be confused with efforts like Greenpeace.

676
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,860
Greenpeace, I don't think, they don't have a thing on them.

677
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,000
Bombs on their ships, yes,

678
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,040
placed by governments, foreign governments,

679
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:19,660
even cool.

680
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,640
People like the French.

681
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,840
Artsy people like the French.

682
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,380
Even the French government might bomb a Greenpeace ship or two

683
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:30,020
so as to get the attention away

684
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,420
from the little problems out there with the plankton.

685
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,900
Nobody worries about the plankton anymore.

686
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,280
You don't.

687
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,740
I certainly don't.

688
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,960
And the fish themselves who live on the plankton,

689
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,220
and the plants who live on the fish skeletons,

690
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,400
and who make the air,

691
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,660
and the water which comes up into the rain,

692
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,060
they don't care either.

693
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,560
Nobody cares but us four-legged creatures

694
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,920
and only a tiny, tiny percentage of us, dear friends.

695
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,140
Only a small percentage of us.

696
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,260
And that's not the only thing the Church of the Subgenius is here for.

697
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,840
All we're here for, really, the main thing we're here for,

698
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,680
is to make it possible for you to not kill yourself

699
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,800
while thinking about these things.

700
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,700
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

701
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:22,880


702
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,200
Here I go falling down, down, down

703
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,220
My mind is a plank

704
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,960
My head is spinning around and around

705
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,040
As I go deep into the funnel of love

706
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,820
It's such a crazy, crazy feeling

707
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,820
I get weak in the knees

708
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,980
My poor old head is reeling

709
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,460
As I go deep into the funnel of love

710
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:11,300
I tried and I tried to run and hide

711
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,040
I even tried to run away

712
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,000
You just can't run from the funnel of love

713
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,780
It's bound to get you someday

714
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,340
It's gonna get you someday, dear friends

715
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,780
Jeez, what was that tape I just started?

716
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,860
Yeah, you got me.

717
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,760
Good people on bad days

718
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,980
will often hurt those they love most,

719
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:09,860
their children.

720
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,920
When stress builds and you're about to lash out,

721
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,540
stop.

722
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,040
Take time out.

723
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,780
Don't take it out on your kid.

724
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,680
Well, there was a big argument

725
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,920
with the Sherpas this morning.

726
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,360
We wanted to bury him,

727
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,340
but they wanted to eat him.

728
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,540
Said they were tired of eating dried dog.

729
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:38,200
And said that it was not by our religions

730
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,580
for the people to eat the flesh of young men,

731
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,800
only young women.

732
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,040
Young maidens, in fact.

733
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,540
They were surly.

734
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,040
They were about it.

735
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,760
But after I branded my brand new

736
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,840
Boxer III short barrel pistol,

737
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:03,120
they quickly threw up a rustic camp.

738
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,660
And we compromised.

739
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:05,540
We served.

740
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,140
We served for old Hargrave's fingers and toes

741
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,440
as hors d'oeuvres at the wedding service.

742
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,900
This seemed to be a compromise with the Sherpas.

743
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,760
It was.

744
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,660
It was.

745
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:19,660


746
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:19,660


747
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:19,660


748
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:19,660


749
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:19,660


750
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:19,660


751
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,460
And soon we were up here

752
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,960
at the end of the Valley of the Crusader.

753
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,860
Where the Roentgen level is lower,

754
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,940
we found a small, commodious,

755
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,060
and quite comfortable country inn.

756
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,000
Three-floor level,

757
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,520
guests on the third floor,

758
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,560
food storage, family,

759
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,820
and livestock on the first floor.

760
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,600
And, of course,

761
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,880
the dung gaso-gene on the first floor.

762
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,480
Yes.

763
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,340
It was there we found Watson,

764
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:49,620
and we waited.

765
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,660
We waited for a smoking,

766
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,140
a serviceable-looking pipe,

767
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,460
and serviceable-looking gas-lap.

768
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,460
Oh, thanks.

769
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,820
No, that's right, dear friends.

770
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,060
We'll continue with G. Gordon Gordon's report

771
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,020
on his Himalayan expedition

772
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,920
200 years from now,

773
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,520
when possible.

774
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,780
Here's another one from Waves Forest.

775
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,920
Now what?

776
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,820
Once again, I'll give the address at the end

777
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,280
because you're going to want it this time.

778
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,940
This is Dr. Chris Gross in the background

779
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,700
doing the music.

780
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,900
Designer diseases.

781
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:29,060
AIDS as a biological and psychological warfare.

782
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,920
First, before I get any further,

783
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,820
let me state for sure and certain

784
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,600
that this is not the official policy

785
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,400
of this station,

786
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,440
nor its management,

787
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,860
nor subscribers,

788
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,680
but only of this particular editorial

789
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,120
that I'm reading

790
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,400
and something that I myself often wonder about.

791
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:53,400
At a House appropriations hearing in 1969,

792
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,640
the Defense Department's Biological Warfare Division

793
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,500
requested funds to develop, through gene splicing,

794
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,660
a new disease that would both resist

795
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,540
and break down a victim's immune system.

796
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,040
Within the next five to 10 years, they said,

797
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,660
it would probably be possible

798
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,440
to make a new infective microorganism,

799
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,740
which could differ in certain important respects,

800
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,600
from any known scientific study,

801
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,300
to any known disease-causing organisms,

802
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,540
most important of those being

803
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,100
that it might be refractory

804
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,320
to the immunological and therapeutic processes

805
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,140
upon which our bodies depend

806
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,000
to maintain our relative freedom

807
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,380
from infectious diseases.

808
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,860
The funds were approved,

809
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,960
and AIDS appeared,

810
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,380
happened to appear within the requested timeframe,

811
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,740
and as happens to have the exact characteristics specified,

812
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,580
the incidence of AIDS infection in Africa

813
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,060
coincides exactly with the locations

814
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:57,440
of the massive smallpox vaccination program

815
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,340
in the mid-1970s, according to the London Times.

816
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,900
Some 14,000 Haitians then,

817
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:08,620
on UN secondment to Central Africa,

818
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,380
were also vaccinated in this campaign.

819
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,540
Personnel actually conducting the vaccinations

820
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,920
may have been completely unaware

821
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,040
that the vaccine was anything other than what they were told,

822
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,420
and it may well have been.

823
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,240
A striking feature, though, of AIDS

824
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,400
is that it is ethno-selective.

825
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:33,780
That is, the rate of infection is twice as high

826
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:37,120
among blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans

827
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,940
as it is among whites,

828
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,620
with death coming two to three times as swiftly.

829
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,640
Funny how that worked, see?

830
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,900
And over 80% of the children

831
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,200
with AIDS and 90% of infants born with it

832
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,880
are among these minorities.

833
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,720
So-called ethnic weapons that would strike

834
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,940
certain racial groups more heavily than others

835
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,100
have been a long-standing U.S. Army

836
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,280
biological warfare objective.

837
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,000
It just so happens.

838
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,980
Under the current United States administration,

839
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:14,140
biological warfare research spending has increased 500%.

840
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,740
I suppose that means since the last administration.

841
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:18,880
Primarily, the United States has been the largest

842
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,700
in the area of genetic engineering

843
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,460
of new disease organisms.

844
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,800
Ah, yes.

845
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,960
So despite the loyalty of the vast,

846
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,540
I'm sure the vast majority of U.S. military personnel

847
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,620
towards their country,

848
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,040
there may be some military officials

849
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,780
who have very different intentions,

850
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,440
and they occupy high enough positions

851
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,060
to impose their priorities on military programs,

852
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,580
and get away with it.

853
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,200
So far.

854
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,660
So far.

855
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:55,520
The first charges that AIDS may have been

856
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,280
a biological weapon were published

857
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,480
in New Delhi, India in 1984,

858
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,320
and then the Soviets picked it up,

859
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:03,520
but dropped it pretty quick after,

860
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,920
mmm, you know, where China became

861
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,140
more and more friendly with us,

862
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,380
and so they had to be a little bit more careful then.

863
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,420
Anyway, there are many key references to this,

864
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,860
and also to the hyperoxygenation therapy,

865
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,240
which is a highly contested, very controversial,

866
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,440
and certainly not to be definitely called anything on,

867
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,360
over the air,

868
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:31,900
but as a supposedly possible cure

869
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,740
for the cureless disease.

870
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,040
And once again, for information,

871
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,820
that what I've been reading from basically,

872
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,840
Waves Forest at Box 768,

873
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:47,840
Waves Forest at Box 768,

874
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:47,840


875
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,700
Monterey, California,

876
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:57,940
93942,

877
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,500
USA, dear friends.

878
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,720
What a deal.

879
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,900
What a deal.

880
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,960
Call 823-7490 here at the station,

881
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,680
KNON, if you have any serious questions.

882
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,820
I certainly would if I were you.

883
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:17,820


884
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:17,820


885
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:17,820


886
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:23,940
In the meantime, just stick, just hang in there.

887
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:45,760
It is a common thing among our youth today,

888
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,300
to become,

889
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,940
one with Wotan.

890
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,260
But through Bob,

891
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,200
it is not necessary to become one.

892
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,740
That's right.

893
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,600
You can be half with Bob,

894
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:05,820
and still be one with Wotan,

895
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,160
or vice versa.

896
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,820
Half a hole is still a hole.

897
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,440
Dig a hole.

898
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,760
Fill it halfway with dirt.

899
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:21,520
It's still a hole.

900
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,760
That's true.

901
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,700
Maybe it's a little more shallow.

902
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,300
Sort of like a suburban housewife.

903
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,340
Hey, not quite as deep.

904
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,120
Wait a minute.

905
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,440
But it's still a hole in a state of wholeness.

906
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,220
So as you can see,

907
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,420
it's possible to be whole with dirt.

908
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:45,700
Half with Bob,

909
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,300
or half with Bob.

910
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,500
Or half whole with Bob.

911
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,020
You can achieve oneness,

912
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,880
and you can achieve wholeness.

913
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,060
Or,

914
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:04,580
you can achieve hole in oneness,

915
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,800
which is considered par for the course.

916
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:08,780
Bob.

917
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,480
Bob.

918
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:11,380
Bob.

919
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,260
Bob.

920
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:12,740
Bob.

921
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:13,340
Bob.

922
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:13,560
Bob.

923
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,240
velen

924
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:15,840
Ven.

925
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,800
A neighbor lived across the hall

926
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,320
He used to do strange things

927
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:35,600
One time, a cozy dinner at his house

928
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,520
Before he slept, three cups of coffee

929
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,880
Sat and bowed, all three

930
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,160
He thought to himself

931
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,760
Say nothing more then

932
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:56,220
Please ask your service

933
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,940
Another time, we were traveling

934
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,760
We had no sooner set our bags down

935
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,420
In the motel room

936
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,360
When

937
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,680
He

938
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,180
He moved every piece of furniture

939
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,940
In the motel room

940
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,200
Four inches to the left

941
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,280
Saying a little well again

942
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,460
Do you feel draft in here?

943
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,000
The third time

944
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,800
Took the police

945
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,980
I saw him turn around three times

946
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,780
For a positive male

947
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,340
In the little blue U.S. mailbox

948
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,300
On the corner

949
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,060
Three times he turned around

950
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:48,720
I said, why?

951
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,640
I cornered him in the hallway

952
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,840
I said, why did you do this?

953
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,540
I said

954
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,080
If I turn around

955
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:04,940
If I turn around three times now

956
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,280
Why?

957
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,420
There's less of me for life to turn around

958
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,640
Three times later

959
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,740
My strange neighbor

960
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,380
By the quarks, dear friends

961
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,380
The quarks

962
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,220
And before that we had Nick Smith

963
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,140
And before that I don't know what all

964
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,500
Public service announcement here

965
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:40,180
Teen Contact wants teenagers and their families to know that there is an alternative to being isolated and alone with a problem

966
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:42,660
In other words

967
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,420
If you're feeling all alone and overwhelmed

968
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,640
And need somebody to talk to for any reason

969
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,540
Say you can't tell your parents

970
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,880
You can't tell the teachers

971
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,540
You can't tell me

972
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,740
Because I'm not going to give you my phone number

973
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:58,420
Call Contact Teen

974
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,160
At 233-TEEN

975
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,100
So literally 233-T-E-E-N

976
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,640
Seems like they only give the numbers on there

977
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,080
Some people have, like me, have trouble figuring that out

978
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,160
233-TEN

979
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:15,280
Remember it's healthy to call for help before reaching the boiling point

980
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:18,820
Call 233-TEEN

981
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,280
And that's pretty, uh

982
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,540
That's pretty much for real, uh

983
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:30,680
I remember a time when I would have killed myself a day later had not I gone to my friend and said

984
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,920
Hey man, like

985
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,940
Like, what's wrong?

986
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,640
I've got this problem

987
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,520
Yeah, I bet some of you out there are wishing that friend hadn't been there

988
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,300
But it could be worse

989
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,820
There was a congregation

990
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,160
This was also in the papers

991
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,160
Before we get back to the tapes here

992
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,900
There was a congregation in, uh, Denver

993
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:00,920
This Denver minister seeks commitment to international disarmament

994
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,020
He told his, he told his folks basically they had to turn in their guns

995
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:09,160
They had to turn, bring in their handguns, their shotguns

996
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,520
Their, uh, just about any kind of guns

997
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:16,300
And, uh, give them, give them over to the church

998
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,000
For, for international disarmament

999
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,820
Guns are demons, he said

1000
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:24,520
We pretend they'll save us, but they won't

1001
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,020
Said the pastor of Our Lady of Guadalupe Roman Catholic Church

1002
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,220
Everyone in, in Denver has guns these days

1003
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,260
Why do people need a gun on their hips?

1004
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,020
He asked parishioners to sign cards pledging they would not carry guns

1005
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:42,280
Uh, unless it was for hunting, uh, wild animals and not their neighbors

1006
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,740
So far, 400 cards, but only 10 guns have been turned in

1007
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:51,080
Uh, the guns will be destroyed by the Denver Police Department

1008
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,920
Hopefully not given over to Hare Krishnas or white supremacists

1009
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,000
Or any of the other people in your neighborhood who stash guns away

1010
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,100
And many of your subgenius buddies, so you never know

1011
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:07,000
Father Gurley said that, uh, he could have preached 10 sermons on New Year's Eve

1012
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,040
And a nuclear disaster, but they wouldn't have hit the people

1013
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,980
The way this request has

1014
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:17,720
And believe you me, they won't hit anything as hard as a nuclear blast would

1015
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,560
But, uh, well, hehehe

1016
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:24,780
Like I say, that kind of thinking, that's almost like pornography to some of us

1017
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,980
Oh, what have we got here, what have we got here

1018
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:31,080
Oh, Dick Gregory, he can say words that I never could

1019
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,640
Now, for you black folks that was devastated

1020
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,760
By Ronald Reagan getting in the White House

1021
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,040
It's awful when fear enters your consciousness

1022
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,140
You can hang it up

1023
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,360
But I would say to those of you that's really upset over Reagan

1024
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,560
What you should do is just go sit by yourself

1025
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,700
And take your pencil and piece of paper and just write the word Reagan

1026
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,160
And look at it

1027
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,520
Then spell his name backwards, write Reagan backwards

1028
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,540
Just sit there and look at it

1029
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,980
That's right, Reagan spelled backwards is nigger

1030
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:22,620
So at least we can boast we got us a backward nigger in the White House

1031
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,620
Praise Dick Gregory, dear friends

1032
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:30,300
And for all you Jimmy Carter fans, well look at it this way

1033
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,140
Anywhere, anything that gets Amy off television, you know what I'm saying?

1034
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,420
Anywhere, anything that gets Amy off television for the next four years

1035
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,980
Cannot be all bad

1036
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,900
Yeah, we're the good old days

1037
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:45,240
Hello, we'd like to know is Bob a member of the Republican Party?

1038
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,120
Bob is a member of

1039
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,540
Good question, great question

1040
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:49,580
That is a good question

1041
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,320
Bob at different times has been a member of every

1042
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,220
He was a member of the Illuminati for a long time

1043
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:00,580
And he was one of the highest ranking members of the conspiracy

1044
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:02,580
He could have been president at one time

1045
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,400
He was the richest man in the world and he threw it all away

1046
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,340
For you my friend

1047
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,640
Well, I thank him for that

1048
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:16,460
And speaking of president, Bob is a friend of Ronald Reagan, a close personal friend

1049
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,840
That is true

1050
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,560
I remember he used to go out to the Bohemian Groves and drop acid together

1051
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,340
Reagan is not, he's not what people think he is

1052
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,160
He's an actor, he's doing an excellent job

1053
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,600
Well he's obviously dropped a lot of acid

1054
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:30,580
Reagan?

1055
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:38,760
Yeah, but he was with Bob and it wasn't, you know, they, it's not, I wouldn't recommend that kind of thing to the average young

1056
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,660
He knows Bob in every sense of the word

1057
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:50,200
Yeah, Reagan and Bob, you know, I could get into some stuff that you wouldn't believe about Reagan and Bob

1058
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,440
They're good friends

1059
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,080
They're the kind that's illegal in Texas

1060
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,600
In Georgia

1061
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,060
He's a broad minded guy

1062
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:05,700
Yeah, did Bob and Reagan and the Supreme Court Justice there get together a lot?

1063
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:11,300
Well see, now Bob is, Bob, Reagan, like I said, he's an actor

1064
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:15,100
And Bob is not for all the censorship they're doing, you know

1065
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:25,480
But the thing you gotta remember is even though, even though they've tortured the 7-Eleven executives into not selling Playboy and Penthouse

1066
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:30,560
At the same time when they do that pictorial on the girls of 7-Eleven

1067
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:30,560


1068
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:38,780
It's, they're gonna censor, they're gonna censor the subgenius mutant women that should be in that pictorial

1069
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:39,920
You know what I mean?

1070
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:43,500
So censorship and the conspiracy works both ways

1071
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,200
They'll have nothing but those plastic, you know, airbrushed, hard-gallon girls

1072
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:54,320
As fragile, tender, enduring, tough, talkative, gossipy, nasty, humorous, sweet, intelligent, passionate creatures

1073
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:59,420
Who are, unlike other animals, capable of symbolic thought

1074
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:04,440
And therefore also unlike other animals capable of deluding ourselves

1075
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:09,120
If we could accept ourselves as we are

1076
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:15,800
We could start to build a morality built on actual human need and desires

1077
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,460
Oh yeah

1078
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,880
What's for lunch?

1079
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,300
A game show steeped in the American tradition!

1080
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:29,400
What's for lunch? A game show steeped in the American tradition!

1081
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,040
Scrambling for roaches!

1082
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:37,660
The new high-speed competition that fits natural American skills against the awesome, icky corporate clock of greed!

1083
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:39,380
Just look at what you can win!

1084
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:42,520
A car two blocks long outfitted with a mint-covered toilet

1085
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,260
A dishwasher the size of the Great Cheops Pyramid

1086
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:46,240
A trip to Venus

1087
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,300
Four shots at Spiro Agnew's limo with a grenade launcher

1088
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,580
A six-legged dog

1089
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:54,840
Forty strap-on dildos in a rainbow of colors from Mr. Huey's of Nookers Street

1090
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,080
A change in the weather

1091
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,220
A break in the action

1092
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,040
Twenty hand-painted Arkrum t-shirts of antiquity

1093
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,880
A stainless steel bar autographed by Groucho himself

1094
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,400
A kiss on both cheeks

1095
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,760
One on the face even

1096
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,940
A genuine hand-rubbed atomic poodle harness with snout retainer and automatic scooper

1097
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,740
A piece of table linen stained by Keith Moon himself

1098
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:16,320
All the comic books that your mother threw away that are now worth millions

1099
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:20,400
A life-size fiberglass figure of Vincent Price in full mask of the Red Death drag

1100
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,120
And a matching set of plaid wool socks, panties, brassieres and mittens

1101
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,100
The premise of our game is really simple

1102
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:32,600
We line up two rows of identical alternating 52 Chevy Coupes and old Firebirds whose looks are more body-cutty than metal

1103
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,640
42 in all

1104
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:38,460
We then load up all the ashtrays with premium heavy-duty roaches and pipe-dumping rimners

1105
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:41,560
Just the kind found most commonly on Texas beaches in July

1106
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:46,640
At the sound of the police siren, our two contestants will scramble like mad through said ashtrays

1107
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:52,840
And try to amass the largest amount of usable dough possible in the three-minute period prior to the firing of the air raid siren

1108
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,400
And to weigh the dough after the mad scramble,

1109
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:59,260
We use a nuclear-powered triple beam donated by Mr. Natural himself

1110
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:03,040
This little beauty is accurate within one-eighth-billionth of a gram

1111
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,180
And we don't weigh the paper either

1112
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:08,360
All the remaining money and prizes revert to the US Foundation

1113
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,600
Because we have bills to pay

1114
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,460
Not to mention a vicious Jones

1115
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,860
In everything vision

1116
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,460
Scrambling for Roaches!

1117
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:18,660
Yuuuughhh

1118
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,000
Bwahahahaha

1119
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:25,380
Oh, so good ol' Hell Pope you in there, huh?

1120
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:25,380


1121
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,400
And he is a Hell Pope, dear friends

1122
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,800
He's an ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly man

1123
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,920
If you knew him personally

1124
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,860
Oh, oh, he's a bad, bad guy

1125
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,660
I think you can tell

1126
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,880
With the swinging love corpses in the background

1127
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:40,460
Huh

1128
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:44,480
Stay tuned, dear friends, for Robert Wisdom's American Music Party

1129
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,760
Regular type

1130
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,640
Oh, well, good ol'

1131
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,380
It's not regular, it's better than regular

1132
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,540
It's a good ol' day, good ol' time

1133
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:54,640
Back from them good ol' days

1134
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,020
Remember that one time

1135
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,940
You and Wanda in the back seat

1136
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,120
Remember that time, what, that song you were listening to?

1137
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,880
Well, Robert Wisdom's gonna be playing every one of those songs

1138
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,340
In the next hour and a half

1139
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:10,960
I got about, uh, four minutes to go here

1140
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:15,280
And I think what I'm gonna do is let, uh, Berklee take over

1141
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,760
This is the Berklee Subgenius Show

1142
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,740
Because you can fade out anywhere on their show

1143
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:20,660
Doesn't really matter

1144
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,900
Dr. Howell, Puzzling Evidence

1145
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:27,080
Lies, I think on this one, maybe in the background

1146
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,060
And Gary Gbrogfran and Bob Nelson

1147
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:32,880
And yours truly for that one time

1148
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:33,620
That one time

1149
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:34,580
Remember that one time

1150
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:36,280
Well, I want you to, before I go, though

1151
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,580
I want you to write for information

1152
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,320
If you haven't already

1153
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,420
Free information from the Church of the Subgenius

1154
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:45,200
Get that pencil ready, dear friend

1155
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:53,880
Cause it's Bob at P.O. Box 140306

1156
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,460
In Dallas, Texas

1157
00:59:58,620 --> 00:59:59,260
75214

1158
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:05,240
Once again, P.O. Box 140306

1159
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,300
In Dallas, Texas

1160
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:10,720
75214

1161
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,560
For stuff you wouldn't believe

1162
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,420
Stuff you really wouldn't, wouldn't

1163
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,900
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed

1164
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:20,520
This is it

1165
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:21,380
Maybe

1166
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:22,440
Maybe

1167
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:22,780
Maybe

1168
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:23,700
Speaker 1 says maybe

1169
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:24,120
Voice over

1170
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:24,120


1171
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:24,440
Since she said maybe

1172
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:24,440


1173
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,740
hurt your eyes

1174
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:26,980
Mr. B steel

1175
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:27,060
Oh...

1176
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,300
Yeah.

1177
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:28,900
Go on

1178
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:29,160
What are you talking about?

1179
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,000
Talk on Yoga

1180
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,140
All right

1181
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:32,820
If you don't want the details

1182
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:33,460
What are you mad about?

1183
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:33,780
Do you wanna talk on Yoga?

1184
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:33,780


1185
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,960
Skin voor Segen

1186
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:42,180
Well, you miss that

1187
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:48,480
Con Jedi

1188
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,240
Well...

1189
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,920
What do you have to say for yourself, son?

1190
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:53,580
I'm sorry.

1191
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:54,680
I'm sorry.

1192
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,000
I'm sorry, little caller officer.

1193
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,620
It came from the caller zone.

1194
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,920
Okay, let me just start my show and get out of here, okay?

1195
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,380
Just let me give you a piece of my mind.

1196
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,500
Oh, here, go ahead.

1197
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,540
I'll put it in here.

1198
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,280
Oh, thank you.

1199
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:06,620
Ah, squeeze!

1200
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,180
Oh, there we go.

1201
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:08,380
Okay.

1202
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:13,620
See, this little piece of Hal Robin's mind, let's examine it.

1203
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:18,240
In time, sir, in time, we have plenty of time to be on the air.

1204
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,980
It's been freed from the encasing skull.

1205
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:23,120
Well, I hope it'll be soon because you're driving me crazy.

1206
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:26,460
Well, if you don't like it, turn off the radio.

1207
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,700
Turn off the radio.

1208
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:32,320
Turn off the radio.

1209
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:37,260
How do you guys do that?

1210
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:40,200
We hold our mouth like this and you just kind of, yes.

1211
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:42,580
It's the hypnotic beam from the interocitor.

1212
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,120
Would you like to change your mantra?

1213
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:45,260
Okay.

1214
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:46,260
M-I-N-O-T-I-O-N.

1215
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,680
M-I-N-O-T-I-O-N.

1216
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:51,180
M-I-N-O-T-I-O-N.

1217
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:52,560
M-I-N-O-T-I-O-N.

1218
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,460
M-I-N-O-T-I-O-N.

1219
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:58,120
M-I-N-O-T-I-O-N.

1220
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,000
M-I-N-O-T-I-O-N.

1221
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,460
M-I-N-O-T-I-O-N.

1222
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:01,200
M-I-N-O-T-I-O-N.

1223
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:01,340
M-I-N-O-T-I-O-N.

1224
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:01,340


1225
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:01,420
M-I-N-O-T-I-O-N.

1226
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:02,040
M-I-N-O-T-I-O-N.

1227
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:07,940
Oh, Darnini, you're so pretty when you wear that flaming headdress of burning souls.

1228
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,880
He exploded all by himself.

1229
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,940
You see, Bob, who being in very nature dogs,

1230
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:36,240
did not consider equality with an antipode something to be grasped,

1231
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:39,600
clutched, or palpated, but rather smoked in his pipe,

1232
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:42,240
like a fine burly or rubbed-in shell.

1233
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,180
He himself, nothing keeping the very...

1234
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,080
848-4425.

1235
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,580
Dave, show us.

1236
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,040
All caught.

1237
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:52,240
Somebody's smoking some anti-Bob right here.

1238
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,580
And being an apparent of a man, he fumbled himself

1239
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:58,480
and became obedient to entropy.

1240
01:02:58,580 --> 01:02:59,460
Well, here, have a hit.

1241
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:04,120
Therefore, God exalted him and taught him to himself,

1242
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:07,220
but we gave Bob the name that is above his name,

1243
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:09,100
a movement of the year,

1244
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:13,260
that at the name of Bob every year should wind on each human

1245
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:16,820
and have water up his head and soil the tops of his shoes.

1246
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:20,500
And every tongue confess that Dob's his squash.

1247
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,680
So be nice, little callers.

1248
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,720
It's almost time to go seepy again.

1249
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:24,580
That's right.

1250
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,220
The show really begins to get pretty here.

1251
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,900
The wind-down part of the show.
