1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,400
Concentrate.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:18,280
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

4
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,040
Flight, now I'm losing all three of them.

5
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,800
It's just a little medical mutiny, Doc.

6
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,460
I'm sure the guys are still with us.

7
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,620
Let's cut them some slack, okay?

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,460
We interrupt this program tonight.

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,680
What would you cut us some slack?

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,580
She's lucky she had it.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,820
Hello, toxic Bob.

12
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,740
How you doing?

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,340
Huh, what's that?

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,380
This behind me is Bob.

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,240
Automated dialing.

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:00:59,980
Automated dialing.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,560
Automated dialing.

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,900
Automated dialing.

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,240
Allow to be able to...

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,380
Call Bob.

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,520
Command.

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,160
Call Bob.

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,100
Dialing.

24
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:12,780
Mom.

25
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,960
No, not Mom.

26
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,280
Bob.

27
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:16,860
Cancel.

28
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,500
Cancel.

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:19,520
Stop!

30
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,460
Hello?

31
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,740
Hey, Mom.

32
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,920
The self-genius.

33
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,360
Power of swag.

34
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,220
Forget a blockage.

35
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:28,880
It's a job.

36
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:29,820
For Grime.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,280
For Grime.

38
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,280


39
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,280


40
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:30,320
For Grime Fighter Bob.

41
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,460
For Grime Finn?

42
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,760
Yeah, sir.

43
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,820
For Grime Fighter Bob.

44
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,300
We interrupt this program

45
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:40,860
to bring you Bob.

46
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,780
Ah, Bob, I think that I got a little problem.

47
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,500
Contact the federal marshals.

48
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,040
Get them out here!

49
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,540
I want something large enough to hold it.

50
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,420
To hold something large.

51
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,260
What?

52
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,220
Isn't this Mayor Rogers?

53
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:55,220


54
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,600
Wasn't this mayor lorsque we有 він complimentaryедин會 на tendencies?

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:01:59,600


56
00:01:59,600 --> 00:01:59,600


57
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,700
30 seconds.

58
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,620
25 seconds.

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,400
20 seconds.

60
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:27,540
19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

61
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,640
Dad, power surge.

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,880
Quick, the abort switch is on.

63
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,460
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

64
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,880
Unable to abort.

65
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,340
Happy holidays, Bob.

66
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,300
But let's imagine for the sake of argument that you don't care for what Bob has to say.

67
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,760
Say you've convinced yourself that slack is nothing more than an unattainable pipe dream.

68
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,520
Maybe you feel that this whole thing really is just some sort.

69
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,580
Or a stupid joke.

70
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,040
Perhaps you are thinking to yourself, fuck Bob.

71
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,780
Well, fear not, my friends.

72
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,260
Fucking Bob is kind of the point.

73
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,060
Fuck Bob.

74
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,040
Are these thoughts blasphemous?

75
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,940
Are these beliefs hearsay?

76
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,020
Are we out of our minds?

77
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,180
Are we desperate for money?

78
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,440
You're damn right on all counts.

79
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,180
And I know Bob is happy for us.

80
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,540
See?

81
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,840
He's smiling.

82
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,660
How can you argue with that?

83
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,440
What?

84
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:29,500
What?

85
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:29,580


86
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:29,580


87
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:29,580


88
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:29,580


89
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:29,580


90
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:29,580


91
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:36,660
Turning a profit off the backs of false prophets is just one of a multitude of ways the Church of the Subgenius finds its slack.

92
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,340
And that's exactly what Bob wants.

93
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,920
Well, besides your money.

94
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,400
He wants us to have slack.

95
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,860
And by Bob, we aim to have it.

96
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:52,080
So reaffirm your faith in the Sultan of Saiyans, the instigator of yucks for the alien warbearers.

97
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,960
Money will flow like the explosion of wet sex over the face of the highest uberfans.

98
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,580
And I never will.

99
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,980
Trusted convenience.

100
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,140
Smith's

101
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,140


102
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,140


103
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,600
your

104
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:12,680
his

105
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:12,880
ele

106
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,320
i

107
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,480
your

108
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,660
vehicle. May the fire of our hatred keep us nourished through even the darkest times.

109
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,780
May it warm us in our coldest nights. May you find shelter amongst the ripples of Bob

110
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:36,300
Scrooge. May his shadow of occurrence pave your path at least resistance. May subdued

111
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,320
efforts and proverbial pie-chucking and backhanded slapstick appease the lunatic gods and their

112
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:47,140
insatiable funny-hole. Lest we once again find ourselves hung out to dry on next day,

113
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,520
being mercilessly mocked and heckled from beyond the stars. Praise God damn Bob.

114
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,460
I shall leave you with a poem. Even a man who is pink at heart and only knows false

115
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:08,140
slack may be seen as green in the pipe-light's gleam and excess cannon-flack. E-quapity-socky,

116
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,660
a-boppity-boopy.

117
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,160
Side effects include high blood pressure, profuse sweating, speaking in tongues, shortness

118
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,340
of breath, swelling of the genital region, exposing discharge of smell, feelings of mild

119
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,320
to intense ecstasy, dependency, heart attack, and lethal shouting. Please consult your doctor

120
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,200
to find out if the Church of the Subgenius is right for you.

121
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:33,380
That was Sermons with Suds by Reverend Frodus Suds Pasha, and you can see the video on YouTube.

122
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,480
The Larch did the opening. Later we'll hear recent clips from Radio Synesthesia,

123
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,860
from WCSB Cleveland, Puzzling Evidence from KPFA Berkeley, the Ask Dr. Howell Show podcast,

124
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:52,300
the All Zappa Show of Krell and Pope, Sternodocs and Little Rock, Rare Firesign Theater,

125
00:05:52,540 --> 00:06:00,660
the Psychoskeletons, and me singing Neil Young's Southern Man. All parts of our recent cross-country

126
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:08,040
travels, on which Princess Wee and I did daily reports, such as the following, recorded at the

127
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,480
home of Reverend Pocket.

128
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:22,740
Well, we made it to North Carolina, and we're now putting our disease in Dr. Legume and Reverend

129
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:32,480
Pockets, and Pockets' little boy, Jack, and, oh, did Jack quit playing his doctor music?

130
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,500
He might come back.

131
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,380
Yeah, I ran to get the recorder because he was doing some...

132
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,200
He's playing some more music.

133
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,660
Here we go.

134
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,680
Did I say we use it?

135
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,500
Show him your tattoo, Jack.

136
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,660
Show him your tattoo, Jack.

137
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,500
Oh, my God, there's a Dobbs head on that tiny, that three-year-old child's arm.

138
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,500
Let me see it. Let me see it.

139
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,800
That's nightmarish. How could you do that?

140
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,120
Sing us a song, Jack.

141
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,920
Okay.

142
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,660
Okay.

143
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,400
Oh, we're dark.

144
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,320
Doctors.

145
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,620
Doctors.

146
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,120
For Bob.

147
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,220
And it's just not sound.

148
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,200
It's not sound.

149
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,000
Sounds just like the Rudy Schwartz project.

150
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,720
Sounds great.

151
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,620
It's a regular John Cage.

152
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,640
That was good, Jack.

153
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:39,640


154
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:39,640


155
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:39,640


156
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:39,640


157
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,440
That was great.

158
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,060
Yeah.

159
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,540
Yay.

160
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,580
Thank you. Thank you.

161
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,480
Nice concert.

162
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,660
Thank you. Thank you.

163
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,100
My scissors.

164
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,260
Oh, great. Scissors.

165
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,680
None of those things in there actually belong to you, Jack.

166
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,340
Those are...

167
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,760
That's a grown-up's office.

168
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,600
Look who's in there.

169
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,740
Yeah, that's for grown-ups to run with.

170
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,240
That's my best.

171
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,560
Those scissors.

172
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,000
Here, have a beer.

173
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:09,680
Yeah.

174
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,780
I'm gonna calm you down.

175
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,220
All righty.

176
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,100
I think we got another caller here on the line.

177
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:16,880
Hello.

178
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,420
You're on the air.

179
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,120
Hello?

180
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,340
Hello.

181
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:20,660
Hello.

182
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,160
It's Dave.

183
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,280
You could tell from the hortensious buzz, which we'll...

184
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,240
We'll should go away with it after a...

185
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,220
Actually, I could tell by the piercing knife-like sound that happens whenever Dr. Sinister picks

186
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,160
up a new caller.

187
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,220
Which is what?

188
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,600
That's funny.

189
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,500
I don't find it to be that...

190
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,640
You were gonna call in and your way of saying, you know, I'm not gonna call in.

191
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:39,640


192
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:39,640


193
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,200
I mean, the way of saying hello is very Dave-like, Dave.

194
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,520
I don't know if you knew that.

195
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,820
You mean it's very particular or onerous or unique or ridiculous?

196
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,720
It's sort of apologetic.

197
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,760
Oh.

198
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,960
Your way of saying hello is much like your way of compulsively saying, I'm sorry.

199
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,820
And you're forgiven, Dave.

200
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,140
By whom or by what?

201
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,280
Dave, you need to stop apologizing.

202
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,160
You're forgiven by my own feet.

203
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,580
Yeah.

204
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,060
Well, that's good.

205
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,620
Stop apologizing.

206
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:09,620


207
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:09,620


208
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:09,620


209
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:09,620


210
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,360
apologizing.

211
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,560
You should never apologize for your greatness,

212
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,440
Dave. Don't apologize.

213
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,460
It's a sign of weakness,

214
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,820
mister. Apologies is a sign

215
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,540
of weakness. I will try to remember that.

216
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,640
I'm sorry. I forgot it.

217
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,600
But anyway,

218
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,360
Ray,

219
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,100
Ray,

220
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,020
I noticed that you were awfully cold.

221
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,580
You said you were coughing chunks of dynamite?

222
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,660
No, my coughing is...

223
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,340
Coughing like a dinosaur.

224
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,320
You're coughing like a dinosaur.

225
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,960
Dinosaur. How does a dinosaur cough?

226
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,160
I've never heard of one of these things.

227
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,160
Really, really loud and forcefully.

228
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,780
In fact, there were...

229
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,020
I don't know quite how to put this

230
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,560
delicately on the radio, so maybe I won't.

231
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,220
Yeah, just say it. I'll beat it up if I have to.

232
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,640
These coughs were so

233
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,860
unexpected. They were sudden

234
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,180
and really violent and painful.

235
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
It kind of hurt your throat.

236
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,880
And then every time you swallow, it hurts.

237
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,920
But occasionally,

238
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,960
the violence of the

239
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,760
cough would cause a violent

240
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,140
crepitation

241
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,860
or flatulent

242
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:11,980
event.

243
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,480
It was so violent

244
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,500
that it kind of hurt down there.

245
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,380
And a couple of times I thought, you know,

246
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,820
I'm going to wake up some morning

247
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,660
and find out it wasn't just a

248
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,760
gaseous, but was what a friend of

249
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,860
ours, Mr. Sister, termed

250
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,940
a lubriff fart.

251
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,680
The kind that comes just

252
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,740
before other

253
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,400
messier sorts of

254
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,220
expulsions.

255
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,340
Sure enough,

256
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,240
one morning,

257
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,620
I got up and

258
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,800
it was like everything was kind of stuck

259
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,540
down there, glued

260
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,600
in place. I had to

261
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,400
peel my drawers back

262
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,300
in order to,

263
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,960
I mean, I had to really, like,

264
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,500
yank at my drawers to get them unstuck

265
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,800
because everything had kind of dropped.

266
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,620
The sickness

267
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,900
has its benefits

268
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,600
in that it makes other people

269
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,300
laugh when they don't have it.

270
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,400
Huh?

271
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,300
I just think you described the actual sickness.

272
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,640
I think you just induced a whole

273
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,880
different kind of sickness in many listeners.

274
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,340
Well,

275
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,460
you know, with this particular

276
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,700
subgenius cold,

277
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,400
you can give it to other people

278
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,120
just by looking at them.

279
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,520
You don't have to

280
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,380
even be in the same room. So, like,

281
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,580
cars going by us, I'd kind of give

282
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,800
them the evil eye and

283
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,580
they've got it now.

284
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,080
We, so, honest to God,

285
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,340
we stood on a bridge in Little Rock

286
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,280
with barges

287
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,240
going underneath. Little Rock is a

288
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,580
big port. And these barges

289
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,260
were going off to other

290
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,980
states and countries

291
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,080
and we stood there spitting down

292
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,080
onto the barges far below.

293
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,880
That way your spit gets around.

294
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,160
And you thought about leaping on

295
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,200
one of those barges or?

296
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,120
If you ever read

297
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,260
that Stephen King story, The Stand,

298
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,180
we are implementing

299
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,120
that now.

300
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,000
X day,

301
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,240
is coming for the pinks

302
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,720
whether it comes for us or not.

303
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,940
Wow. Whether we get our

304
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,040
vessels or not, we'll soon have the

305
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,100
earth just to ourselves.

306
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,860
But anyone who

307
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,680
has survived it.

308
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,120
I think this guy

309
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,200
should hit the Cleveland comedy scene, man.

310
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,000
I think

311
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,240
he already hit it.

312
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,100
Or maybe he's

313
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,080
even better. Maybe he should go out and start his own church.

314
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,580
Hey,

315
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,780
wow, I've got the name for it.

316
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,640
I do it all.

317
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,740
I do it all.

318
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,580
It's like

319
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,100
idiotology, but idiots can't spell

320
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,740
idiot. They spell it wrong.

321
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,560
So it comes out. I do it.

322
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,960
I do it all.

323
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,080
I bet we do as well as

324
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,880
Scientology. Could we but

325
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,300
keep a straight face?

326
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,020
That's always been the one hang

327
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,920
up. I mean, you talk about

328
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,620
your anonymous mask.

329
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,720
Nothing is so frozen and

330
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,760
ridiculous as a subgenius

331
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,800
smile. It's plastered there.

332
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,720
There is if by some rude

333
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,760
painter without the with, you know,

334
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,640
too much mix in his glaze.

335
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:13,380
It

336
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,880
even when

337
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,720
they're miserable, they have that grin.

338
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,040
You know, it's like an instinctive

339
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,880
imitation of Bob

340
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,600
our guru

341
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,900
who always grins

342
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,760
no matter what.

343
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,040
Well,

344
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,840
having left

345
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,680
North Carolina and

346
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,560
Reverend Pockets and like

347
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:36,780
you,

348
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,280
James Place five

349
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,700
hours ago, we're

350
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,300
approaching Atlanta where

351
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,340
Reverend Susie the floozy lives.

352
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,720
And we just passed

353
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,960
be for

354
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,000
ruin road.

355
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,480
Yes, a

356
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,340
road called be for

357
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,860
ruin, which

358
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,700
Susie in her direction

359
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,580
said would be

360
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,720
funny except that a woman was raped

361
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,480
there about 10 years ago.

362
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,700
She

363
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,060
still had to mention it, though.

364
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,580
Notice

365
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,600
her directions there on the computer

366
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,680
and I didn't print them out and I don't want to try

367
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,700
to look at a laptop while we're navigating

368
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,860
the

369
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,720
circuitous

370
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,800
Atlanta

371
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,400
highway system, which is

372
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,360
about as driver

373
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,480
friendly as Dallas or

374
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,380
Los Angeles.

375
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,440
Luckily, it's almost 10 o'clock

376
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,660
at night, so it's

377
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,480
relatively quiet. Otherwise,

378
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,580
I'd be driving

379
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,440
because Princess Wee is nice

380
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,100
and she's not adjusted to

381
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,140
aggressive highway driving

382
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,480
that people specialize in

383
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,060
in southern giant

384
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,780
cities.

385
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Like I am. I was trained

386
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,040
in Dallas

387
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,760
where the drivers are

388
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,320
by habit so aggressive

389
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,080
that I've had

390
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,280
two separate New York cab drivers

391
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,020
tell me that they were terrified

392
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,840
driving in Dallas

393
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,360
highway.

394
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,000
I would never do it again.

395
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,560
While they were telling me this, I was clutching

396
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,380
the sides of my seats in terror

397
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,380
at the way they were driving

398
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,260
in New York City streets.

399
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,100
So I guess they have some

400
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,260
unspoken rule there that lanes

401
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,040
are for amateurs.

402
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,180
On the highways, lanes

403
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:28,700
are

404
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,520
in southern cities, the lanes

405
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,160
are taken seriously, but they're

406
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,340
considered territory.

407
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,820
It's a very territorial kind of lane.

408
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,280
It's like, no, buddy, this is my lane

409
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,400
I'm in. Oh, you want to get in?

410
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,500
I'm going to speed up.

411
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,100
Oh, you're trying to get in now? I'm going to slow down.

412
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,360
Well, you actually do get

413
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,260
a certain amount of that from some of them.

414
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,100
So what you have to do is

415
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,880
force your way in because

416
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,760
they will not

417
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,120
damage their cars just to be

418
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,080
mean to you. However,

419
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,180
Pisces,

420
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,200
for me, that in New York City, they

421
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,480
will damage your car, their own

422
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,420
car, just to be mean to

423
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:12,700
you.

424
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,920
It's almost like the opposite

425
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,460
types of

426
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,440
aggressive driving. Yeah, she said they'll

427
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,980
give you a tap or a nudge

428
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,540
if you're not... Yeah, I've never seen

429
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,600
that happen in Dallas or Los Angeles

430
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,960
or Houston or

431
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,400
Atlanta, but

432
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,540
they will prevent you

433
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,100
from getting in unless you

434
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,280
threaten to damage their

435
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:36,460
vehicle.

436
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,600
And they still won't honk.

437
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,480
You don't get the honking

438
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,900
like you do in New York City.

439
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,620
No. But then in New York City,

440
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,460
the normal greeting

441
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,740
to a stranger is,

442
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,120
Go fuck yourself, you

443
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,480
goddamn moron!

444
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,420
I'm walking here!

445
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,240
In Dallas,

446
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,320
it's kind of like, Howdy, neighbor,

447
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,500
let me stab you in the back with this here buck knife.

448
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,740
Yeah, so I'm surprised Susie didn't mention

449
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,320
the two roads,

450
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,520
Atlanta, Cumming, and

451
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,720
Dunwoody.

452
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,020
After Cumming,

453
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,660
then you're done with your Woody.

454
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:20,740
Ah-hoo.

455
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,580
Ah-hoo.

456
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,400
I caught you a delicious

457
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,540
bath. This is

458
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,300
pretty much the worst video ever made.

459
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,620
This is pretty much the

460
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,240
worst show ever made.

461
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,720
That was

462
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,380
Napoleon...

463
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,480
Dynamite there.

464
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,720
The desk model.

465
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,260
This is pretty much the craziest house

466
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,220
I've ever seen.

467
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,800
Yes, friends, we've made it to Susie the Flusie's

468
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,520
house. In fact, we've been here for...

469
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,540
This is our second

470
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,560
night. We're gonna leave

471
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,280
tomorrow. She's

472
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,620
taking us on... You finally got here!

473
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,020
Whoa!

474
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,480
How long have you been here? You just noticed?

475
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,440
Duh! There's so much

476
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,520
crap in this house. I thought you were the decor.

477
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,020
Who

478
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,400
do you think you were?

479
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,340
We're escorting around

480
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,680
John Bonnet Ramsey's grave

481
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,800
and... John Bonnet?

482
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,540
Who else?

483
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:14,700
Well...

484
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,940
I'm handing cookies to people

485
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,520
who have cookies already.

486
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,000
So we've put

487
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,840
our disease in Susie

488
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,060
now.

489
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,300
And took 500

490
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,420
photographs of her

491
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,760
slack altar.

492
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,620
Which, in the case of Susie the Flusie,

493
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,920
is the entire

494
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,820
house.

495
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,860
Wall-to-wall

496
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,200
bulldada objects.

497
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,660
Indeed. Word isn't a reptile

498
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,120
farm. Right.

499
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,400
Well, those are bulldada objects, too,

500
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,480
to many people. They're not all

501
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,580
sex objects to everybody,

502
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,080
Susie.

503
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,120
And it's

504
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,600
been one... Tomorrow we have to leave.

505
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,720
I just thought I'd better

506
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,400
make one last...

507
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,860
while we still could talk. Before the sheriff's

508
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,500
deputies show up again on the front step?

509
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,460
Yeah, that's right. They're orbiting

510
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,180
the neighborhood.

511
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,740
Yeah, I think they heard through the grapevine

512
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,520
you were on the way.

513
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,420
Well, and

514
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,540
Reverend Valer Chucks and his wife

515
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,700
Emily were here, too.

516
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,460
Valer last heard on

517
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,840
Hour of Slack as Bonobo's

518
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:22,980
Convergence

519
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,460
guitar player.

520
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,600
This is the most people I have had

521
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
in my house since I moved here

522
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,220
a year and a half.

523
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,980
This was an insane crowd

524
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,040
for my house, for my lifestyle.

525
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,360
Too bad we didn't

526
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,060
pick up the recorder while

527
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,400
Valer was here noodling

528
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,240
away on his guitar. That sounded

529
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,200
so good. You know, I didn't know that he

530
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,260
was related to the Allman Brothers.

531
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,380
You thought he was related to the Keep On

532
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,520
Truckin' trucks.

533
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,320
Yeah, I thought he was related

534
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,060
to Mr. Garbage Truck

535
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,200
and his brother Fire

536
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,740
and Toe.

537
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,740
And Dump.

538
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,420
Yeah.

539
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,060
Yeah, this will be the most frustrating

540
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,100
Hour of Slack ever since no one

541
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,240
can see any of what we're talking

542
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,160
about. It's like one of those

543
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,080
endless shows where people talk about what they're

544
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,120
looking at on the internet.

545
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,980
Like some

546
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,160
subgenius show hosts

547
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,700
I know.

548
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,700
The little celebrity girl that was

549
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,920
murdered and everybody thought it was her mom.

550
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,040
Oh, hello Dahlia.

551
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,100
Susie always takes us to her grave whenever we

552
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,840
visit Atlanta. We always go to the

553
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,540
grave.

554
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,820
The little fashion girl.

555
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,200
Joan, Joan, Joan, Joan,

556
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,660
Benet, Robin. Yeah, that's right.

557
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,080
Yeah, yeah. John Benet.

558
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,180
I visited her

559
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,280
grave twice. It's funny, right

560
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,380
next to the John Benet

561
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,340
grave is a Smith grave and

562
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,420
a Dobbs grave.

563
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,300
Really? Yeah.

564
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,140
Jane Dobbs and

565
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,240
Satua M. Dobbs are

566
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,100
buried right next to

567
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,320
John Benet. Honest, I'm

568
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,440
not kidding. I've got photographic

569
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,180
evidence. Coincidence or conspiracy?

570
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,140
I wouldn't have to Photoshop

571
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,300
Satua M into any

572
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,460
other Dobbs name. Old man

573
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,940
bald head, they call him.

574
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,360
Jane Dobbs, the mother of Bob, is

575
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,380
actually buried in Atlanta. I've got a

576
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,700
photo of her tombstone.

577
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,420
Also called the Jerusalem

578
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:22,960
cricket.

579
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,320
Jerusalem syndrome,

580
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,240
I think, is what we all have.

581
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,540
A Jerusalem artichoke. Giant

582
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,660
cricket can emit a shrill

583
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,260
squeak and handle

584
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,780
and can also bite.

585
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:36,980
Remember before?

586
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,020
No, that was before my

587
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,220
Well, Susie would

588
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,820
probably love to take you there.

589
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,200
He is known by the humble, simple

590
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,760
dwellers of the desert as

591
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,880
the old man of the desert

592
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,940
or old man

593
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,280
bald head. Full of Civil War guys.

594
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,240
Old man bald head is the god of

595
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,520
the desert? Is the

596
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,740
another name for the Jerusalem

597
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,360
cricket. Oh. This giant

598
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,580
bald headed cricket.

599
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,900
Huge, armored, massive.

600
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,320
The Jerusalem cricket a

601
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,280
phallus daughters showed

602
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,320
found along with

603
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,580
the two notes that she captured

604
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,900
in the endangered new part.

605
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,860
She found an

606
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,180
insect that was dead.

607
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,160
It looked like it was not missing

608
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,140
it's abdomen

609
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,240
covering and the

610
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,500
whole insect was there, but not the

611
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,080
covering of his abdomen just

612
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,400
because

613
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,260
I'm

614
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,100
I'm still wondering, I'm still puzzling over that.

615
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,080
What happened to that bug?

616
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,440
What creature would do that to a bug, leave the rest of the bug,

617
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,040
but eat only the outer integument of the abdomen?

618
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,720
Well, that is the opposite of what usually happens,

619
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:58,620
where the soft and toothsome tissues of the inside are siphoned away.

620
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,760
I'm trying to find my camera so I can show you a photograph of it.

621
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,740
I might even suggest that no individual creature did this,

622
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:15,060
but some sort of fungus infestation or carapace-destroying bacteria.

623
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,240
We're now at the part of the show where we pull cameras out and take pictures of each other.

624
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,260
I thought you were going to flash me a picture of some horrendous bug atrocity.

625
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,860
Oh, yeah, that's right. Let's see. I have to...

626
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,860
Oh, this new camera is so...

627
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,520
Lumix is cool. Which one did you get?

628
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,140
No blames is true.

629
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,040
So where's Jones?

630
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,000
I'll just have to figure out...

631
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,140
He's in the box out back.

632
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,000
Pine box?

633
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:38,900
Bug and...

634
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,620
There it is.

635
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,280
Pine box, boys. Here.

636
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,220
B-O-Y-Z.

637
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,100
There's the bug.

638
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:50,000
Dr. Howell is now looking at the tiny picture of the strange bug corpse.

639
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,740
Well, it's a Jerusalem cricket.

640
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,380
Is it?

641
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,040
That's old ball head?

642
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,240
I think so. It's certainly a cricket.

643
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,860
Lily told me it was a... she said it's some sort of cricket.

644
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,340
Nothing near for...

645
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,860
For a scale.

646
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,300
It's as big as a locust.

647
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,060
It's a Jerusalem cricket. They're heavy, massive, armored crickets.

648
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:16,820
And the bald, round head can just be seen at the proximate end.

649
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,720
If Lily hadn't corrected me, I would have assumed it was a hopper grass.

650
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,540
Look at the armor on the legs. The first two pair of legs.

651
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,960
You see, mostly your cricket has a little thin leg.

652
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,620
This is... these are hefty.

653
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,740
Mycroft was just swallowed up and turned by history.

654
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:41,280
I can show you some fine pictures of Jerusalem crickets that come.

655
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,960
You got some bug porn, Dr. Howell?

656
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:49,700
Although they are supposed to be more native to the Sonoran region than here, the California desert,

657
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,260
I've run into them right in the San Francisco area.

658
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,320
Well, this was... that photo was taken up the hill from Dr. John.

659
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,440
Oh, I was just having insomnia. It's really fun.

660
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,520
Insomnia.

661
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:02,920
Yeah.

662
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,060
And I woke up thinking, my worst fears...

663
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,960
Yeah, these are good cameras. Those are excellent cameras.

664
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,080
Line up, sign up, and real this day.

665
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,240
I have the next one up and the one after this just came out.

666
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,820
Let's take another caller here.

667
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,620
Is this Governor Rockner?

668
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,540
Yes, good to hear from you, man. How's everybody?

669
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,640
Yeah, it's good to hear from you.

670
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,600
How is everybody? Everybody's sick, if I've got anything to say about it.

671
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,520
I'm surprised you're not sick, Rockner.

672
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,540
I am. I actually am.

673
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,420
We drove near...

674
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,680
I don't have age yet. I don't have age yet.

675
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,880
No, I got the upper respiratory infection in my hearing.

676
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,800
My hearing's now going as bad as Stang's is.

677
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,420
Wow. So I'm not the only person who had this happen to them.

678
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,500
I had significant hearing loss for about a week.

679
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,520
It took like a week and a half for things to get back to normal.

680
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,060
Well, it started off with really intense pressure.

681
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,480
I got my hearing back and everybody else lost theirs.

682
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,700
So, ha, ha, ha, look who's yelling now.

683
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,920
We've been spreading the subgenius virus.

684
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,620
We make reference to it right up front.

685
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,680
First page on subgenius.com mentions it.

686
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:19,840
And people think it's a joke, but they won't live to be thinking of it as a joke much longer.

687
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,280
We're coming to your house and we are infected.

688
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,800
In fact, everyone who can hear my voice now is now infected.

689
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,280
For this virus is spread not only by the air,

690
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,880
and computer networks, but by, as I said earlier, line of sight,

691
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,920
and the sound of voice.

692
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,460
So if you're lost in the frequency, you're sick.

693
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:47,660
You better go out and buy you some Guafanisan or something

694
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,900
and get ready to call off work and curl up in bed

695
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,720
and be really, really miserable and not be able to hear anything.

696
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,960
And if you aren't a douche, thanks subgenius, you'll soon be dead.

697
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,640
And if you are a douche, thanks subgenius.

698
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,200
Would you like that?

699
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:01,800
Yes, subgenius.

700
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,940
You'll be fine and your hearing will be better in about a week and a half.

701
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,920
Oh, it's already been two weeks.

702
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,140
Right.

703
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,780
Yeah, I actually, it's only been two weeks for me.

704
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:12,900
Yeah.

705
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,040
I dealt with it for two weeks and everybody I saw,

706
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,900
well, they all still have it.

707
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,580
We've been on the road for just two weeks.

708
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,560
What does it mean to really have it?

709
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,460
Does it mean that the subgenius virus is actually going to...

710
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,460
kill everybody that you come in contact with,

711
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,740
but not you because you are subgenius?

712
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,200
I don't look at it as a disease.

713
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,680
I look at it as an improvement.

714
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,240
I once had a disease, or should I say it once had me?

715
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,760
We're thinning the herd.

716
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,020
That's all.

717
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,300
I thought you were wearing gold earrings again.

718
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,540
Man, none of this makes any sense to me.

719
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,080
I don't think the thinning of the herd is...

720
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,980
Dave, what did make sense to you?

721
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,460
You were dead on the road.

722
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:01,460


723
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:01,460


724
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,580
You're an ugly fuck on your own free fucking whale, Doc!

725
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,300
Yes, yes I am.

726
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,140
I'd rather be lucky than smart.

727
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,700
I don't know.

728
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,900
I don't know.

729
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,220
I'm not gonna believe my hobbies.

730
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,540
I don't think I can run and take into my own fox-like

731
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,540
and own mày

732
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:51,540


733
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:51,540


734
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:51,540


735
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:51,540


736
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:51,920
What are you whale doing?

737
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,880
The earth.

738
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,700
Oh!

739
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,460
Hey, find a cool way to hang out over there while you're profiting.

740
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:01,460


741
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:01,460


742
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:01,460


743
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:01,460


744
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,900
I want to sniff your panty.

745
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,600
I want to feed you some yogurt.

746
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,140
Oh, Wendy, Wendy.

747
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,140
Let me put my hand down your shirt.

748
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,220
Sweet mama of the Canadian News Hour.

749
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,520
Oh, Wendy, Wendy.

750
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,960
I want to put my head up your skirt.

751
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,940
I want to sniff your panty.

752
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,700
I want to feed you some yogurt.

753
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,100
Oh, Wendy, Wendy.

754
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,180
Please let me put my hand down your shirt.

755
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:31,440
I want to feed you some yogurt.

756
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,520
Everybody, come up again.

757
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,480
All right.

758
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,060
No money, Michael.

759
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,620
I had an interesting encounter with another weirdo station.

760
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,980
My friend Pope Sternodox in Little Rock has a Zappa show every Sunday night at 9.

761
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,140
Only 9 Central Time.

762
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,880
And we went down to the station with him.

763
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:57,660
By the way, I should preface this by saying the first thing I asked him was,

764
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,680
can I say Zappa sucks?

765
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,880
And he just...

766
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,520
And I said, well, I don't think Zappa sucks.

767
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,660
I just wanted to know whether I was allowed to say that.

768
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,540
He said, no.

769
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,180
And his co-host said, yeah, you can walk home.

770
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,140
I said, okay, I just wanted to see if you guys were in a cult.

771
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,580
And Sternodox said, I'm in two cults.

772
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,840
And anyway, this station, it's the opposite of WCSB in every way.

773
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,540
It has very little equipment, much less than I have in my home studio.

774
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,920
And that ain't saying much.

775
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,980
And Sternodox's partner owns all of it.

776
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:37,080
But their transmitter is so powerful that they reach five states.

777
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,220
And get this.

778
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:44,680
Their show, when they end their show, they're the last people in the station until the next morning.

779
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,240
They put on a Zappa CD on repeat.

780
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,040
It's a different one every week.

781
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,860
Selected material.

782
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,420
Usually rare.

783
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,800
And so for seven hours from Sunday night to Monday morning,

784
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,660
for five states around Little Rock,

785
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:06,900
lone weirdos and ignorant young musicians get to hear, for the first time,

786
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,140
hours of Frank Zappa.

787
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:19,160
And I thought, what a great gift to those weirdos in Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi.

788
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,380
Yeah, but you're in Tipper Gore country, remember?

789
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:24,160
Tennessee.

790
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:29,660
So, yeah, I mean, really, these guys are like more than 50,000,

791
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,880
150,000.

792
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,160
I mean, it's a lot of people.

793
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,720
And I think it's a great gift.

794
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:33,720


795
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:33,720


796
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:33,720


797
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:33,720


798
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,560
Coming out of a station that only has one CD.

799
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,100
They have two CD players and a cassette deck that doesn't work.

800
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,780
Not a single turntable.

801
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,840
And no way to record off the air what they're doing.

802
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:53,220
And I'm sure that that Zappa, those 10 hours of Zappa every late,

803
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,180
in the middle of the night, have saved some lives.

804
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,220
You know?

805
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,120
Because, I mean, think.

806
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:00,740
If you're the only.

807
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,820
If you're the only punk in McCrory, Arkansas.

808
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,780
Oh, yeah.

809
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,060
Look, if you're worried about, you know, red and green lights here,

810
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,420
just stop it.

811
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:21,900
Just stop it.

812
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,260
Just back my cart right off your green.

813
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,300
Is that what you're saying?

814
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:25,620
Yeah, we've been saying.

815
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,300
We've been saying to everyone involved in this whole endeavor this evening,

816
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:30,720
you know,

817
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,080
two-thirds to three-quarters of all the knobs and buttons and lights in this whole place

818
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,400
are completely superfluous.

819
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:36,980
They mean nothing.

820
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,380
They have no bearing on the overall sound that we hear or whatever.

821
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:41,920
Right.

822
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,760
And ignore the red wire that goes from there to the Pentagon.

823
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,920
Oh, forget about that.

824
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,700
It's buried deep enough they're not going to run into it anyway.

825
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,660
Take the yellow light and you'll stay where you are.

826
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,060
Take the red light and you'll see how deep the rabbit hole goes.

827
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,180
There you go.

828
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,600
There's how it's going.

829
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,760
They don't have to dig very deep.

830
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,120
They don't have to dig very deep at all.

831
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,920
Get a sledgehammer down there, a pneumatic sledgehammer,

832
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,940
and pierce through that force field somehow.

833
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,940
Cut that wire, and then what Krell just said would be true.

834
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,240
None of the buttons would work.

835
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,260
None of them, well, really none of them do.

836
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,200
So did that already happen?

837
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,240
That's what we're saying, yeah.

838
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,820
It already happened.

839
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,160
It's the past again.

840
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,680
We're living in the past, man.

841
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,620
It's the past all over again.

842
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:27,300
The station on the planet where I'm from has a million buttons,

843
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,560
and none of them do.

844
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,720
And they all work.

845
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,720
You can only hear it for about 12 feet around the station.

846
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:37,060
That's because it's in the other past.

847
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,500
Because of a boy named Vicky.

848
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,460
We ain't dealing with that.

849
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,740
We're dealing with the other thing.

850
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,240
Yeah, that's what happened.

851
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,520
Right behind, left behind.

852
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,660
I was about to say that, and then I thought,

853
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:59,540
am I violating a copyright by saying pull the lever, down you go?

854
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,260
No.

855
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,420
No, I don't think so.

856
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,600
I think the legal representation that we've endured

857
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,020
will make sure that saying things like pull the lever, down you go

858
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,280
will not result in any permanent incarceration

859
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,900
of the part of the person who said it.

860
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,340
Even though they were once a doctor, or are now.

861
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,880
Now, is this about Frank Zappa or the duck farms of Arkansas?

862
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,400
Which I saw today.

863
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,400
We drove all the way here from Cleveland High.

864
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:30,740
It's a duck farm.

865
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:30,740


866
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,200
It's astonishing how they entered Link.

867
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,500
How they entered Link.

868
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,440
But, yeah, they were catfish farms, though, with just ducks on them.

869
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,080
The ducks were trespassers.

870
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,760
The ducks were just on them.

871
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,560
On the catfish.

872
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,340
Yeah, the ducks were just on the catfish farms.

873
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,820
That's what they were.

874
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,600
Freak Out was the fourth album I ever paid money for.

875
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,220
When I was a kid.

876
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,980
My first album I ever bought was the Monkees album

877
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,720
with Last Train Clarksville.

878
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,100
I don't know why I'm saying that.

879
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:02,260


880
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:06,960
The second album I ever bought was Magical Mystery Tour.

881
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,280
You're on a roll.

882
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,180
The second album I ever bought was Jimi Hendrix's Are You Experienced?

883
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:12,660
Let's go.

884
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,540
The fourth album was Frank Zappa's Freak Out.

885
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,660
Let's give Stang a hand for the...

886
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,880
That's a hell of a four first albums.

887
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,540
Mine aren't quite that good.

888
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:23,940
You can see the progression.

889
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,540
Mine aren't quite that good.

890
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,480
And then Trout Mask Replica, I think, has been number five.

891
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,040
Number five?

892
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:29,580
Yeah.

893
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:29,740
Yeah.

894
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:36,500
Yeah, Monkees album was among my first four albums, but also among those were the 1910

895
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,320
Fruit Gump albums.

896
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,700
Right.

897
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,400
Greatest hit.

898
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,600
I've been reading about it.

899
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,380
It all links in.

900
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:41,700
Yeah.

901
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,480
Lillian Roxon has been telling me about those.

902
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,200
You don't have to read those off a glittering screen.

903
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,640
They're on magazines that are in your daddy's bottom drawer.

904
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,340
They're right there.

905
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,400
Oh.

906
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,060
All right.

907
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:59,560
I found a place where I could download all the photos from the magazines.

908
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:04,680
I want that website.

909
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,200
I downloaded them all.

910
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,200
Alt.binaries.newdisc.com.

911
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,720
I'm serious.

912
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,500
Every year I download about 10,000.

913
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:17,920
Okay.

914
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,400
Why didn't I know that?

915
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,920
I sent my dad.

916
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,320
Why hadn't I had that bookmarked for years?

917
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,020
I sent my dad a CD of about 10,000 scans of those magazines.

918
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:28,780
You're right.

919
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,560
I'm not a big fan of that.

920
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:29,560


921
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:29,560


922
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:29,560


923
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:29,560


924
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:29,560


925
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:29,560


926
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:29,560


927
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:29,560


928
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:29,560


929
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:29,560


930
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:29,560


931
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:29,560


932
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,800
I'll give you a copy of that.

933
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,080
Crel has that kind of relationship with his dad.

934
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,240
Only it's Led Zeppelin.

935
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,620
Not Newt Volleyball.

936
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,980
Although Led Zeppelin and Newt Volleyball, that'll ...

937
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,640
Six of one, seven of another.

938
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,380
Yeah.

939
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,120
It's half of one.

940
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,900
It's half of one, seven of another.

941
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,220
Half of one and nine and a half of the other.

942
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,680
This is what we're saying, ma'am, sir.

943
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,940
Sir, ma'am.

944
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,540
Nobody calls here at KBF 88.3 FM Community Radio in Little Rock, California.

945
00:37:59,540 --> 00:37:59,540


946
00:37:59,540 --> 00:37:59,540


947
00:37:59,540 --> 00:37:59,540


948
00:37:59,540 --> 00:37:59,540


949
00:37:59,540 --> 00:37:59,540


950
00:37:59,540 --> 00:37:59,540


951
00:37:59,540 --> 00:37:59,540


952
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,160
Arkansas playing music is the best

953
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,300
with Reverend Ivan Stang, Princess

954
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,540
We Are Doe,

955
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,140
and me, Reverend Sternow, here

956
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,200
in Little Rock.

957
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,520
The only problem is

958
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,120
that as free

959
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,160
as that station is, and as

960
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,000
great as the work Reverend Sternow

961
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
is doing, I have it on good authority

962
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
that as free as they are, you're not

963
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,140
allowed to say Zappa sucks

964
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,780
on the air. That's right.

965
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,160
I specifically asked if I

966
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,080
was able to say that, whether

967
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,120
I meant it or not, which I don't particularly.

968
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,560
Sometimes I do.

969
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,420
That dental floss song sucked.

970
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,600
I said, Sternow,

971
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,180
you're in a cult.

972
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,780
It's a Zappa thing. It's a cult for you.

973
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,760
He goes, no.

974
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,040
I'm in two cults.

975
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,580
Did I say

976
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,900
this whole thing last night?

977
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,580
Yes, you did, and I was hoping you would

978
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,600
say it again. Were you having boujadé?

979
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,020
Our audiences

980
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,560
overlap, but are not

981
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,720
the same audience.

982
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,740
So this parable

983
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,680
needs to be told more than

984
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,780
once, and that's our opinion.

985
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,700
Well, our background sound effects aren't the same.

986
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,600
It's true. We usually

987
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,920
eschew all that grinding, bumping

988
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,240
and microphone stand

989
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,800
banging sound effect, but we just had the tape

990
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,480
and we just had to use it because it was so fun.

991
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,700
You know, boujadé is right.

992
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,940
You know, it's amusing to professional broadcasters.

993
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,100
As opposed to déjà vu.

994
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,680
I know, jamais vu, the sense that you've never

995
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,960
seen what is familiar.

996
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,020
No, boujadé is where

997
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,680
when you got chewed out

998
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,620
by an asshole

999
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,300
and you walk away and you think of the

1000
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,800
perfect response, but it's too late.

1001
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,320
No, actually,

1002
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,320
I hate to correct you,

1003
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,660
but that is called esprit d'escalier.

1004
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,440
Or the spirit

1005
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,600
of the staircase, where as you're leaving

1006
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,320
you're thinking of the perfect thing you

1007
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,580
should have said, but you just

1008
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,480
didn't say. You just want to roll back

1009
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,320
time and be able to say it, and you

1010
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,000
can't. In hindsight.

1011
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,800
Hindsight has perfect.

1012
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,940
Indulging in the luxury of hindsight.

1013
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,180
Wow.

1014
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,880
If only I'd have said this.

1015
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:08,520
The nice thing about confrontations on the internet is you can

1016
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:14,020
get furiously mad at somebody who's trolling you and write a whole bitter essay,

1017
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:19,760
and then just hit save and hide it away, sleep on it, and the next morning you wake up with

1018
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:27,000
a one-liner that is so much better response than all of that hate-filled ranting because it, you know,

1019
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,460
gives the impression that you were merely amused by this pathetic thing.

1020
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,080
It actually did manage to get your gut.

1021
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:40,620
Those concise, but really robust, but concise insults are the best, you know.

1022
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,580
Well, I've been consciously working on that.

1023
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,120
Like, Madam, Madam, you're ugly.

1024
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,280
In the morning, I shall be sober.

1025
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,820
What did he... Madam, I'm Adam.

1026
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,300
No, no.

1027
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,380
That's a palindrome.

1028
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,620
That's not it.

1029
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:57,760
No.

1030
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,380
Bob, I'm slob.

1031
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,600
You know, it's like one of those.

1032
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:01,860
Yeah.

1033
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,120
Bob, I'm slob.

1034
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,040
Bob, I'm me slob.

1035
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,740
I'm me slob.

1036
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,120
That's not the one I was thinking of.

1037
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,260
I was thinking more of it.

1038
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,440
We're not very good at accurate palindromes.

1039
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,520
Let me think about what I was thinking about and see if I can think of it again.

1040
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,880
If you stop, if you don't think about it anymore, it'll come to you.

1041
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,080
I'm going to put my finger next to my nose because that will help draw it out.

1042
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,580
And does that make you go up the chimney?

1043
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,400
It helps draw out...

1044
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,900
Put a rubber band around your wrist.

1045
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,020
I've got a rubber band around my head.

1046
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,660
Don't cut off the circulation.

1047
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,320
Don't bind that headband too tight.

1048
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,640
Bind the evil spirits in my head.

1049
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,080
Okay.

1050
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,660
Now, if I push that button...

1051
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,940
Turn the damn radio down.

1052
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:52,100
Yes, listener caller, please turn your radio or computer device down.

1053
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,400
I know you're listening all the way out there in the west coast of San Francisco.

1054
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,100
Unless it's an art project you're doing and you need that sound effect, you know, that's okay.

1055
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:05,380
I thought it was just my head cold that was making that slight feedback.

1056
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,880
I was hoping it was the church air making that slight feedback.

1057
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,920
I thought it was the raw onion in my ear that was there for the earwax.

1058
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,500
Is that onion still in your ear?

1059
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,660
Yeah, it's still in there, yeah.

1060
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,420
That's that weird smell.

1061
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,820
Everybody's smelling around me.

1062
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,720
You guys are remarkable.

1063
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:21,900
Hmm.

1064
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,300
We get some really rude remarks.

1065
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,780
We don't get paid enough to do that though.

1066
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,860
There you go.

1067
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,060
We get some pretty rude remarks, yeah.

1068
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:37,200
I would say that in our money we thought we'd be perfectly cold.

1069
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:44,100
Well, it wouldn't make any difference to us because that just goes right out the window.

1070
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,880
We just burn it up.

1071
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,440
The fumes go right up where they're supposed to go.

1072
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,220
The only way out is through the chimney.

1073
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,880
It's just, it's just a little bit of a pain.

1074
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:51,880


1075
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:51,880


1076
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:51,880


1077
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:51,880


1078
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:51,880


1079
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,720
Physics and chemistry is all it is.

1080
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,740
Up in smoke.

1081
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,780
Did you go to the big game?

1082
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,300
Hey, life is a big game, dude.

1083
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,320
Um, no.

1084
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,840
Okay, I didn't think so. I don't know.

1085
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:12,860
We weren't even game for him asking you about the game at first, but then we...

1086
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,860
Well, now it's become almost embarrassing.

1087
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,640
We agreed on it that he'd be alright, probably.

1088
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,440
If you even mention the game, you've lost the game.

1089
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,700
That's not supposed to be funny.

1090
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:35,540
I mean, are you trying to tell me that you guys all thought I wasn't me?

1091
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,220
Well, all I'm trying to tell you is we don't know what happened.

1092
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,100
Something must have happened.

1093
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,600
Yeah, we're not really sure.

1094
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,680
We're going to figure it out.

1095
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,580
We're taking notes now.

1096
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,420
We're taking notes.

1097
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:51,420


1098
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,120
We're taking notes right now.

1099
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:55,400
Bob came and he did something to all of us.

1100
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,320
Right.

1101
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:00,720
That's all we can piece together.

1102
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:09,160
That's all the memories that have been erased and that we've been allowed to read once real quick in disappearing ink.

1103
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,380
But everything else we were forced to forget.

1104
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,840
This is the show where people are missing no how, no Philo, no Sterno.

1105
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,180
And of course, in honor of Phineas Darko, no Jano.

1106
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,980
And you can't, and you, can you say Zappa sucks on this show?

1107
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:27,500
Yes.

1108
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,820
I just proved it.

1109
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,120
You can.

1110
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,060
We're free.

1111
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,260
We're not a cult.

1112
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,080
We're not a cult.

1113
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,020
It's really Sterno's show that we have to be afraid of.

1114
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:36,420
Right.

1115
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,300
You are not allowed to say those words, whether you mean them or not.

1116
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,380
Zappa sucks.

1117
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,580
You know, most of the time I don't mean it, but you are not allowed.

1118
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,780
And I've been tattling on them for weeks now.

1119
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,220
But that's just in private conversation.

1120
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,500
Can you say it on like?

1121
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,860
No, on the radio.

1122
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,480
No.

1123
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,660
They almost beat me up for saying it in private conversation.

1124
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,160
Just the very concept.

1125
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,460
Zappa sucks.

1126
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,020
Upset these Zappa cultists so much.

1127
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:10,520
I was going, look, I'm just advancing the, if I say these words, what will happen?

1128
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,160
And they said, you'll walk home.

1129
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,360
And they were not kidding either.

1130
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,040
I said, you're in a cult.

1131
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,820
And Sterno said, no, I'm in two cults.

1132
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,240
That's there.

1133
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,540
Now I've told it 500 times.

1134
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,040
Here's Ivan Stang dancing home from the show.

1135
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,420
I'm like my dad now.

1136
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,300
I just, I can't remember who I've told what joke to.

1137
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,880
And I just keep saying the same things over and over again.

1138
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,060
What about these people over here, Mr. Smith?

1139
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,200
They all say the same thing.

1140
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,520
That's what Facebook is for.

1141
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,700
You get on there and you have to make up new stuff every 10 seconds.

1142
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,340
That's why I've been voicing.

1143
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,440
I can't.

1144
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,500
I'm tired of that.

1145
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,740
I'm just tired, tired, tired, tired.

1146
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,580
Do you like it?

1147
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,520
I know what you mean.

1148
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,620
I'm tired of it.

1149
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,620
I haven't done that much of it.

1150
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,280
Well, we did it before it was around.

1151
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,940
We did it by tape and U.S. Mail.

1152
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,520
And I'm glad that the Internet wasn't around then because there was some pretty embarrassing

1153
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,240
things said.

1154
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,080
Goodbye.

1155
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,340
I'm sorry.

1156
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,160
It's true.

1157
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:12,860
It's really funny.

1158
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,320
We had the Internet, but it was, it was really, really bad.

1159
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,320


1160
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,320


1161
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,320


1162
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,320


1163
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,320


1164
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,320


1165
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,320


1166
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,320


1167
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,320


1168
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,320


1169
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,320


1170
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,760
It was really slow.

1171
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,200
It took days and there were only 15 of us.

1172
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,540
Yeah, it was.

1173
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:23,600
It was a lot funnier until the flaming and trolling.

1174
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,500
And of course, you know, it's always funny until somebody gets hurt and somebody's little

1175
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,780
brother gets her eyes shot out.

1176
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,400
Hell of a way to operate.

1177
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,420
Then all the ins and outs of getting killed.

1178
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,320
Every fucking beaten.

1179
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:42,020
I'm grateful for every fucking one of them.

1180
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,660
Get all the trust.

1181
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,820
Beat out of you.

1182
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,080
And you know what the fucking world is.

1183
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,540
26 years when in the studio, they used to listen to me.

1184
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,940
Never would Irving Thalberg make a picture I was opposed to.

1185
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,780
I had to worship for that boy.

1186
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:02,840
He worked.

1187
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,720
Now they want cocktail parties and their names in the papers.

1188
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,320
Irving listened to me.

1189
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,120
Never satisfied with his own work.

1190
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:09,800
That was Irving.

1191
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,440
Years later, after Irving passed away, they still listened.

1192
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,180
They make an Andy Hardy picture.

1193
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:19,220
Andy's mother is dying and they make the picture showing Andy standing outside the

1194
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:19,480
door.

1195
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,140
Standing, I told them.

1196
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,720
Don't you know that an American boy like that will get down on his hands and knees and pray?

1197
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:26,300
They listened.

1198
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,420
They brought Mickey Rooney down on his hands and knees.

1199
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,140
It was the biggest thing in the picture.

1200
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,100
But it wasn't good enough.

1201
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:37,320
They don't show the good, wholesome American mother in the home.

1202
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,060
Kind.

1203
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:39,420
Sweet.

1204
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,520
Sacrifices.

1205
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,560
Love.

1206
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,160
I'm sorry.

1207
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:44,160


1208
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,740
I'm sorry.

1209
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:45,940
I'm sorry.

1210
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,700
Knock the old mother on the jaw.

1211
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:48,780
That's what they do.

1212
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,280
Throw the little old lady down the stairs.

1213
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:55,840
Throw the mother's good homemade chicken soup in the mother's face.

1214
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,560
Tip on the mother.

1215
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,200
Kick her.

1216
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,700
That's art, they say.

1217
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,320
Art.

1218
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,000
Art.

1262
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,840
This here is anutlichly a hesitant发다 this piece came so I'll leave it in construction

1263
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,680
The two assumed the press that they were with the wedding.

1264
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:43,180
and little, at least, rotting trailer courts and kudzu-covered barns

1265
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:48,680
and funny-named businesses like Mammy's Bammy Shack.

1266
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,140
Mammy's Bammy BBQ Shack would suit me.

1267
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,840
But we've been bitterly disappointed.

1268
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:01,560
It's just as pink as Richardson, Texas, with the suburb I grew up in.

1269
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,260
It's blank.

1270
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,220
Yeah.

1271
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,020
It's totally blank.

1272
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,160
Well, I mean, there's Burger Kings and shell stations.

1273
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,460
And cemeteries and hairdo places.

1274
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,860
Yeah, but the hairdo places don't have quaint names.

1275
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,040
They have funny names.

1276
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,800
It was called Hills Hair Service.

1277
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,040
Yeah.

1278
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,340
That's pathetic.

1279
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:25,560
I mean, it's destroying.

1280
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,600
I've never been in Alabama before that I can remember,

1281
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:34,260
and it's destroying all my stereotypes, and I'm really let down.

1282
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,900
I was hoping to get a huge feeling of superiority.

1283
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:43,100
We're passing trailers right now, but they're perfectly, nicely kept.

1284
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,420
I'm disgusted.

1285
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,180
That shell station is just modern.

1286
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:58,860
Alabama is supposed to be, you know, the kind of man, backwards.

1287
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,520
It's supposed to be hillbillion.

1288
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,420
It might as well be anywhere.

1289
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,640
It's supposed to be somewhere else in the goddamn country.

1290
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,220
What the?

1291
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,760
Those are chicken.

1292
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,140
That's a chicken farm.

1293
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,340
Really?

1294
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:13,860
Yeah.

1295
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,980
What are each one of those little beans?

1296
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,660
Each one of those pyramids has a chicken in it.

1297
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:21,540
Really?

1298
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,480
Yeah, that's probably what they call free-range chicken.

1299
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,840
When you buy those eggs thinking,

1300
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:32,140
Oh, those chicken, the chickens that lay these dollar extra free-range eggs

1301
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,500
are skipping happily across the pasture.

1302
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,720
You know, pecking at worms.

1303
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:42,500
What that means is instead of being crammed together in six-inch boxes in a factory,

1304
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,100
they're outdoors under those triangles.

1305
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:53,020
Those triangles looked like they were maybe two inches bigger than a hen inside of it.

1306
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,060
Well, but they're outdoors.

1307
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:56,060
Uh-huh.

1308
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,720
The hens don't know any better.

1309
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,720
So much more humane not...

1310
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,540
Well, no, it is.

1311
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,440
It's actually, if you, you know,

1312
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,740
compared to those giant indoor factories,

1313
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:11,320
it's still a chicken concentration camp,

1314
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,400
but it's a benevolent chicken concentration camp.

1315
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,820
And don't worry about it.

1316
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:22,440
Those chickens' ancestors chewed on our ancestors for millions of years.

1317
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,860
Jesus is Christmas.

1318
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:32,800
It's so sad that everywhere in America looks like everywhere else in America.

1319
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,660
I mean, it really is.

1320
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,860
There are places that are different.

1321
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:43,480
New Orleans has or had a sort of a somewhat different spirit.

1322
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,280
There's little tiny sections of San Francisco

1323
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:55,420
that are still not completely obliterated by creeping metroplexness of everything.

1324
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:01,480
There's one street in Fort Worth that's kind of Texas-y.

1325
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:04,440
But it's like Rocky and Bull.

1326
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,640
I think that's the way it is.

1327
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:06,660
All right, let's go.

1328
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:06,660


1329
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:06,660


1330
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:06,660


1331
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:06,660


1332
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:06,660


1333
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:06,660


1334
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:11,280
Look, Rocky, we're in that same town again.

1335
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,420
There's that same hamburger place.

1336
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:19,000
In Frostbite Falls, they didn't have McDonald's or Burger King.

1337
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,800
They didn't have any franchises at all.

1338
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,100
It's a conspiracy.

1339
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,200
And they didn't deliberately do it.

1340
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:32,440
They did it because people like convenience.

1341
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,640
And they like things to be.

1342
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:42,320
be the same. Well, they'd like to know what to expect. They don't like surprises. On our

1343
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:49,180
previous trip, I remember walking into kind of a redneck biker diner that was a bit too

1344
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:56,820
much of a surprise. And if I didn't have my hair, well, actually, I should have had my

1345
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:02,840
hair out. Then they wouldn't have looked at us so suspiciously. That was one place where

1346
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:09,580
being disguised as Mr. Smith was a drawback. If I'd walked in looking like Reverend Stang,

1347
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:17,080
they'd go, oh, hi, buddy. You want a beer or some meth? But when we travel, we try to

1348
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:24,860
look as innocuous as possible. And there are still a few places. Now, see, if I was black,

1349
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:28,620
I'd probably be pretty uncomfortable walking into there, especially once I'd read what

1350
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,080
was written on the stall. There was like a...

1351
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:42,360
Too hot even for the publishers of the Turner Diaries. And it gave a web address for a PDF.

1352
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:48,160
This was written in the bathroom stall. And I wrote it down. And when we got back home,

1353
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:54,460
I downloaded the PDF. And sure enough, it was too hot for the Turner Diaries, which,

1354
00:53:54,540 --> 00:54:02,680
by the way, are a famous racist hoax document, somewhat like the Protocols of the Elders of

1355
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:11,740
Zion, only written by some peckerwood in America about what the black people really think.

1356
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:17,440
And I'm sure somewhere there's black people that really do think that way. I probably

1357
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:25,700
wouldn't blame them. But I'm sorry. I just... It's become too difficult for me to generalize

1358
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:32,000
anymore. Everything's all mixed up as far as people's heads go.

1359
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:32,420
So...

1360
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:38,240
What's not mixed up is the damn landscape of America. That's uniform. Of course, we

1361
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:45,200
are on the interstate now, and I expect it to be uniform there. But, I mean, we pulled

1362
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:52,740
off just to see some class division, and there weren't none. There was an actual middle class.

1363
00:54:53,620 --> 00:55:00,140
I guess we should be relieved that there's still some place where they have that. If

1364
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,400
the city didn't get after us...

1365
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,640
I mean, I guess our house would probably be the kind that we ourselves would make fun

1366
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:05,960
of.

1367
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:06,800
Probably.

1368
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:09,540
The inside already is.

1369
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:15,020
Okay, six to an even, over and out.

1370
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:22,340
Oh, well, enough preaching. Soon we'll be in the beautiful, historic city of Birmingham,

1371
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,120
Alabama.

1372
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:32,380
Southern man better eat your head. Don't forget what the Book of the Superficial

1373
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:32,380


1374
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:32,380


1375
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:43,980
Subgenius said. Southern change gonna come at last. Fifty-seven cents crammed up my

1376
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,960
ass. Southern man.

1377
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:58,360
Oh, we finally saw the Alabama we were looking for. For one thing, we just crossed the Buttehatchee

1378
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:02,280
River. And it's spelled like it sounds.

1379
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:13,240
Buttehatchee. Buttehatchee River. Shortly before that, we saw a sign that said,

1380
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:22,440
I heart my credit union in pretty bad lettering. And I'm saying that literally. It didn't have

1381
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:30,840
a symbol of a heart. It wasn't I, picture of a heart, my credit union. It was in bad,

1382
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:42,240
giant lettering on a billboard. I heart, H-E-A-R-T, my credit union. That's the Alabama we were

1383
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,000
looking for.

1384
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:51,140
And you also, we also passed a store that you missed when you were talking just a moment

1385
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:58,260
ago called Devoe Paint. It wasn't spelled right. It was D-E-V-O-E, but it was Devoe

1386
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:58,520
Paint.

1387
00:56:59,140 --> 00:56:59,200
Devoe.

1388
00:56:59,200 --> 00:56:59,920
Devoe.

1389
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:00,280
Devoe.

1390
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:11,220
There's Family Worship Center, ATM inside. It's a church. And I was just curious to see

1391
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:15,800
what the name of the church was. And the name of the church is Family Worship Center. And

1392
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:21,480
right underneath that, it said ATM inside. They usually have something like Jesus is

1393
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,740
your friend. Or what was the one you saw earlier?

1394
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,480
Happy Birthday, Jesus.

1395
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:37,220
Yeah. Yeah, ATM inside. Whoa. Does that mean they don't take credit cards?

1396
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,180
Don't let that plate pass you dry.

1397
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:47,940
No kidding. We'll have to remember that if we ever have a church in the subgenius building.

1398
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,860
You know, Bob loves you, ATM inside.

1399
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,320
Heart your credit union?

1400
00:57:55,320 --> 00:58:06,180
Yeah, I heart Bob. We heart Bob with heart spelled out. You know, to be really complete,

1401
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,180
it should have quotes around heart.

1402
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:08,660
Yes.

1403
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:12,680
But then, that would be almost too self-aware.

1404
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,020
Yeah.

1405
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:25,020
It would be better to put the quotes around the ATM. Quote ATM, unquote inside.

1406
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:25,300
Yeah.

1407
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:25,300


1408
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:25,300


1409
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:25,300


1410
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:25,300


1411
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:25,300


1412
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:33,420
Or around inside. Anything inappropriate. That's how quotes are used out there. True,

1413
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:39,820
the true boonies. For sale. Numeral four in quotes.

1414
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,400
Oh, shut up, Jack.

1415
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:54,680
It's the hour of slack from the church of the subgenius. www.subgenius.com.

1416
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,280
Subgenius.com.

1417
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:55,280


1418
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:55,280


1419
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:55,280


1420
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,080
Um...

1421
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,320
Throw away Z'n'Aliens.

1422
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,220
Throw away z'n'aliens.

1423
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,140
Estoshachin's this planet.

1424
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,460
Throw away z'n'aliens.

1425
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,500
Throw away z'n'aliens.

1426
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,020
Subgenius.com.

1427
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,900
planet. Job is

1428
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:22,520
an alien.

1429
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,700
Job is an alien.

1430
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:28,000
Job is

1431
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,220
an alien. And so threatens

1432
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,840
this planet.

1433
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,020
Oh, sire, there is

1434
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:36,100
no more money. We gotta

1435
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,260
get some money.

1436
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,480
That dirty, perky, shark-a-back, flat-a-wattin',

1437
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,760
Philip-buck-a-burton, perkaluma-burton,

1438
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,060
dirt-a-bustin'-a-law!

1439
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,740
Beep. Beep.

1440
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,340
Friends, we're glad you listened

1441
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:50,280
to this show, and we're even more

1442
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,060
glad that some listeners have donated

1443
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:54,300
enough to help us keep on going for another

1444
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,220
couple of months. And not

1445
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:58,820
just this show, but subgenius.com

1446
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,380
and all the other archive sites.

1447
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,300
But if

1448
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,860
you truly love Bob,

1449
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,420
and want some of that slack back to rebound

1450
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,320
to you, you should

1451
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,220
go to subgenius.com

1452
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:12,480
front page, or especially the radio

1453
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,380
page, or the catalog store

1454
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,320
pages, and help

1455
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,240
out financially as best you can.

1456
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,040
Now, we know

1457
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,060
what it's like to be on the brink of total

1458
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,600
poverty, and we don't want any subgeniuses

1459
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,260
to make their own situations worse.

1460
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:27,880
But some of you

1461
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,300
still have jobs.

1462
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,100
Even five bucks makes a big

1463
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,060
difference, even if it's only once

1464
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:36,100
a month from enough of you.

1465
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:38,080
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger

1466
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:38,520
difference.

1467
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,820
All we're saying is that

1468
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,140
blowjobs could go the

1469
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,080
way of Stevejobs if you

1470
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,020
don't pay dogs.

1471
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,940
We also take checks and

1472
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:50,880
money orders to

1473
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,780
Subgenius Foundation.

1474
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,900
P.O. Box

1475
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:58,120

1476
01:00:58,720 --> 01:00:59,700
Cleveland

1477
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,540
Heights, Ohio

1478
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:05,200

1479
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,040
Thanks for anything you can do

1480
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,820
to help let there be

1481
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:10,460
slack.

1482
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:16,960
We're not just a small corporation.

1483
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,620
