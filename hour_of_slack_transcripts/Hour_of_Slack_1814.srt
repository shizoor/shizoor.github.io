1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,900
Dim dawn, the wretch has fled, the rich old fuck is out of luck.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,280
Dim dawn, the rich old wretch has fled.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,060
Wake up, you MAGA heads, drop QAnon, try Dobbs instead.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,800
Frop on up, the rich old wretch has fled.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:26,680
He's gone where the swamp things go below, below Mar-a-la-go.

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:32,160
Let's tear things up and sing, and kick the bums out.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,560
Dim dawn, the rich old wretch has fled.

8
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,700
Thank you all.

9
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,500
Radio has correctly been called the theater of imagination.

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,460
Listeners were essential partners in the creative process on programs like

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,880
Suspense, Lights Out, Inner Sanctum, and

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,240
The Self Genius.

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,360
Power.

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,700
Oh, yeah.

15
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,220
What?

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,680
Well, I'll tell my daddy not to steal anymore, and I'll make him get a real job.

17
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,720
Yeah, pretty soon.

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,780
First arrangement.

19
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,620
The first arrangement.

20
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,420
Made.

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:17,060
To sit down slowly, making sure the head muscles don't move too much, causing the brain to

22
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,960
move around in the brain case.

23
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,560
Making sure all the dendrites are connected so that no one knows.

24
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,160
No one knows.

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,220
No one knows.

26
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:37,260
No one knows.

27
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,260


28
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,260


29
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,260


30
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,260


31
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,260


32
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,260


33
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,260


34
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,260


35
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:44,960
Genetic engineers working in secret laboratories in medieval castles are now able to create

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,860
an onion that will not make Mr. and Mrs. Hustler cry.

37
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,600
He doesn't even have a body, he's still a head.

38
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,380
Yea, verily, for Bob should be praised.

39
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,660
He is being praised.

40
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:56,660


41
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,140
This is how we praise Bob.

42
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,060
This is how we polish Bob's mom.

43
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,760
This is the way we worship our Bob.

44
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,300
We take care of Bob like no one else.

45
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,740
Repeat after me.

46
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,980
No, you repeat after me.

47
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,800
Bob is ice.

48
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,120
Bob appears and Bob is light.

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,980
Bob is nice.

50
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:14,980


51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,360
Bob is nice.

52
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,620
You know, just saying it doesn't make it so.

53
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,700
Bob is not nice.

54
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,880
Yea, verily.

55
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,560
Yea, verily.

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,020
I know, if Bob's looking in the window, are you the servant that opens it so he can piss

57
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,220
in?

58
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:24,900
Weep no more.

59
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,060
I know about that one.

60
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,660
Onions will let the wind blow.

61
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:26,660


62
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:26,660


63
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:26,660


64
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:26,660


65
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,160
I only know about it because I had to seek out the magic towel that night.

66
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,860
Well, you shouldn't have.

67
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,160
You should have been able to contain yourself.

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,980
Again and again and again and again.

69
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,780
It makes me want to go to Grandview Camping Center and watch kill them sitting there by...

70
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:41,960
Bob never goes down.

71
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:41,960


72
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,220
Bob is always up.

73
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,100
He's always up.

74
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,420
Always up, dude.

75
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,120
He never has to seek out the adult catalogs that other subgeniuses do.

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,260
And you must receive slack in Bob.

77
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,140
Those subgeniuses.

78
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,780
It's always too cheap to get on their own computer and just seek out...

79
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,040
Now, you be nice to their little phone people.

80
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,240
Tiny little catalogs.

81
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,140
At 848-4425.

82
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,860
420, 520.

83
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
You have suggested...

84
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,640
520 man is mounted and moving.

85
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,580
Massive collections.

86
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,400
Now, let's not get dirty here.

87
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,600
Massively large, huge, erect collections.

88
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,060
Moving toward bridge.

89
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,520
Oh, he's away from the bridge.

90
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,080
Don't worry about it.

91
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,240
Oh, don't worry about it.

92
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,120
It's just puzzling evidence.

93
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,120


94
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,120


95
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,120


96
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,120


97
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,120


98
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,120


99
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,120


100
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,320
I'll be damned.

101
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,740
Nice, he's gone.

102
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:37,840
So, talks abouthl a mushroom at

103
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,020
7.10 today when I was out at the mini bath during theата yard.

104
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,660
Eh, I'm out on my feet.

105
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,880
That's it, folks.

106
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,640
weeks of physical therapy in the form of controlled torture.

107
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,200
And by gobs, it actually worked.

108
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,180
Slow and steady.

109
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,740
No pain, no gain.

110
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:05,080
Regular application of the poop dog hat and hourly exposures to the photo of that.

111
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,220
Plus endless repetitious stretches.

112
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,020
If you feel, you heal.

113
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,600
And I had lots of feels.

114
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:24,380
In fact, friends, I guess I've been denying the severity of my little arthritic aches and pains for a longer time than I wanted to even remember.

115
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:39,120
I keep seeing ancient evidence that all that hauling of stage props, cases of subgenius swag products and PA gear was stressing my skinny little backbones.

116
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,180
That's been going on for so long it just became background noise.

117
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,580
For two years.

118
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,640
20 years.

119
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,320
For instance, I found this recording from the year of 2001.

120
00:04:51,660 --> 00:05:00,760
It's me preaching like a sailor at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland during a devival with Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

121
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:09,880
This exactly dates the first time I started bitching about my aching back in public.

122
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,040
No wonder I cussed so much then.

123
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:22,180
I know that some of the young people here are not going to like to hear this, but I really did have to quit smoking and drinking to excess.

124
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,260
But I would not recommend that to everybody.

125
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:25,840
No.

126
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,400
Because sometimes you have to smoke and drink to excess just to stay alive.

127
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,300
I'm afraid I know how that is too.

128
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,780
But my friend, there is an ultimate narcotic.

129
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,540
And it's one that I wish I had more of right this very day.

130
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:43,940
I'm going to tell you about it in just a second.

131
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,240
That ultimate narcotic is sleep.

132
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,460
Sleep.

133
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,760
Oh my God.

134
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,840
And food, my friend.

135
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,280
Food is the only kind of speed that you never crash from.

136
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,940
Now I know I sound sort of like mom saying all that.

137
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,160
But some plain old common sense things are true for subgeniuses and humans alike.

138
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,180
And even hold true for most mammals.

139
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,460
But living here in the 20th century universe,

140
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:13,520


141
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,200
like we do, and like being a bunch of fucking weirdos,

142
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,540
it's easy to forget those things.

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,320
But you just wait until you haven't been able to shit for three days.

144
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,600
Then you'll know what's important in life.

145
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,080
Luckily I haven't had to cross that particular bridge.

146
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,380
But that reminds me, I need the lovely volunteer from the audience.

147
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,680
Yes, oh that would be perfect.

148
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,240
If you could come up.

149
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,180
I have a little multimedia display here.

150
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,420
And stand over here.

151
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,120
Stand up front so the folks can see you.

152
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,240
I made this little chart myself at about two in the morning.

153
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,300
Friends, my list of priorities shifted.

154
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,180
Now most of us probably don't write down the ten most important things in our lives.

155
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,880
But I started doing that.

156
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,500
And my priorities shifted again when I suddenly remembered what had been left on me.

157
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:13,500


158
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:13,500


159
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,580
Now these are ranked by immediacy of need.

160
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,160
Number one of course, air breathing.

161
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,020
That's something you often forget.

162
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,320
Most people say, oh the ten most important things in life,

163
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,280
well that must be food, sex, and sex.

164
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,560
Well yeah sure, when you're 20 years old that sounds great.

165
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,020
But really, let's get real.

166
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,020
The first thing you need is decent air.

167
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,600
Number two would be, not sex, but water drinking.

168
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,500
Because you can't live for another three hours

169
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,800
or another half a day without water.

170
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,580
In fact, I could use a glass of water right now myself.

171
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,060
Now some people would think that number three would be sex.

172
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,360
But no, number three is peeing.

173
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,640
To pee.

174
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,540
You can't even live, once you drink the water you gotta pee, right?

175
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,860
Well number four, that must be sex.

176
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,380
No, number four is food.

177
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,380
So that sounds boring.

178
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,680
But remember, hot pastrami sandwich.

179
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,120
Number five was a toss up.

180
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,180
Was it shitting or sleeping?

181
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,440
Well I needed sleep a lot more than I needed to take a shit.

182
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,120
So I put sleep on top.

183
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,540
But if you go down one more, it's number six is shitting.

184
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,660
Now you're starting to wonder.

185
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,420
This is pretty sad Reverend Stang.

186
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,260
Where's the slack?

187
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,540
Number seven is of course the slack.

188
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,980
Friends, cause let's face it.

189
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,900
Slack does come almost first.

190
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,500
But you've gotta have some food, water, and sex.

191
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:43,500


192
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,100
And you gotta sleep.

193
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,340
You know when we were younger,

194
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,480
we thought the peeing and the shitting

195
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,100
automatically went along with the intake.

196
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,640
But friends, I'm afraid it doesn't.

197
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,600
However, we know that for instance,

198
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,580
shitting does not necessarily follow eating.

199
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,540
But it had better soon.

200
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,540
Alright, now some of you have noticed something missing from the list.

201
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,680
And that would be number eight.

202
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,680
Money!

203
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,720
Notice that money does follow slack.

204
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,320
But let's face it.

205
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,220
It's not interchangeable,

206
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,280
but it's damn close.

207
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,100
Number nine.

208
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,220
The one you've all been waiting for.

209
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,240
FROP!

210
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,340
Now some of you

211
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,000
may not know, may not be familiar

212
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,420
with subgenius jargon.

213
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,580
But frop is a Tibetan herb

214
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,540
that Bob smokes.

215
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,300
For some of you,

216
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,980
you frop might be booze, or beer,

217
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,000
or pot, or pills,

218
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,620
or rock and roll,

219
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,760
or TV,

220
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:43,920
or government.

221
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,800
I don't know.

222
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,160
But everybody needs their goddamn frop.

223
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,780
Now at this point the kids are going,

224
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,200
okay, when is sex coming along?

225
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,220
Well, it must be number ten.

226
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,760
Oh my god!

227
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,680
Ten!

228
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,340
Your back not hurting!

229
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,580
Jesus fucking Christ!

230
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,320
You could go on down.

231
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,060
Eleven and twelve

232
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,240
are sex and Bob.

233
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,960
No longer even,

234
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,220
oh and tax, holy shit!

235
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,440
March 15th.

236
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,980
I haven't done my corporate taxes yet.

237
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,940
Um, yes friends,

238
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,700
sex and Bob

239
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,980
are no longer even in the

240
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,240
top ten.

241
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,560
My god! What is this world coming to?

242
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Well friends,

243
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,460
I'm afraid that this list has been developed

244
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,200
by pure, untainted,

245
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,420
cold, mathematical logic

246
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,040
over a number of years.

247
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,900
And some might argue that

248
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,260
frop is too far down on the list,

249
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,260
or that it's a sad statement

250
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,120
about our morals,

251
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,500
that it's on there at all.

252
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,820
But get real!

253
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,100
The only reason that money is on the list at all

254
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,660
is that you need the money

255
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,340
to get the fucking frop!

256
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,040
Anyway,

257
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,980
plenty of you young fools

258
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,100
are probably laughing

259
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,240
that your back not hurting

260
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,580
ranks above sex

261
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,000
on my list.

262
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,180
But you'll see,

263
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,060
oh yes, you will see

264
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:13,760
that I'm not a frop.

265
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,040
Well look,

266
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,540
these games,

267
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,220
these games will turn

268
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,420
the who-really-likes-it drill

269
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,960
of learning English into

270
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,280
Zinglish!

271
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
No promises.

272
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,720
Or maybe Zwinglish.

273
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,620
Maybe it's a way of bringing in Scandinavian,

274
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,000
you know, occult religious forms.

275
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,240
Very possibly.

276
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:36,860
With blocks?

277
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,740
Well, it's done, yeah, actually,

278
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,140
it does deal with that.

279
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,260
It does deal with other things like that.

280
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,700
It says here,

281
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,520
how to improve your child's English

282
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,920
now at your bookstore.

283
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,860
Or mail the coupon for your free examination copy,

284
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,580
which you may try out for a whole month.

285
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,880
My child is three

286
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,920
and still not reading.

287
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,980
Still not reading?

288
00:11:59,140 --> 00:11:59,760
What can I do?

289
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,840
Beat it.

290
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,480
Beat out the rhythm with a drum.

291
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,320
Salt Peter?

292
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,920
Is that your name?

293
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,680
Ephraim. Have you tried salt, Ephraim?

294
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:13,920
Salt Marshall?

295
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,940
Yes. What we've done is when we beat the child,

296
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,340
we take salt and show the child

297
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,360
the word on the book.

298
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,900
If the child gets the word wrong,

299
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,000
we put the salt in the wound.

300
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,880
Oh, that's terrible.

301
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,240
Zinglish!

302
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,700
Zinglish!

303
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,120
Cat, right?

304
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,840
What's that, C-A-T is cat?

305
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,740
Ten minutes later, you show the word

306
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,980
and he just sits there, doesn't know.

307
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,580
He shakes a little.

308
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,860
So we have to hit him again, then take the salt

309
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,180
and he's done.

310
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,460
Sometimes he's just trying to hide it from us.

311
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,280
You're lucky. Your city's been saved

312
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,080
from three days of nameless terror

313
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,380
because you paid your salt tax.

314
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,940
That's right. This city yet unblemished

315
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,460
because the blemish have yet to arrive.

316
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,920
Have you seen the tax collector?

317
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,960
The salt tax collector?

318
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,420
This is a man dressed in a blue leather costume

319
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,940
who comes knocking on the door

320
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,700
and I say, what is it?

321
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,040
He says, Richard. No, Richard is locked away

322
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,380
and John wants his salt tax.

323
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,980
John wants the salt tax.

324
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,220
I said, but I...

325
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,860
And he says, give me half of what you have

326
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,460
in your shop.

327
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,560
And I am but a small joiner, so I have but little

328
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,380
for them to take.

329
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,100
Then they commence to take from my kitchen,

330
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,500
from my larder, from my pantry.

331
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,600
Yet but I have two pigs in the pen.

332
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,540
Were I to give one to John, unto him,

333
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,780
what must I say for Richard, who doth language

334
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,000
in yon jail, back behind the Hun's line?

335
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,840
Oh, one day we will rise up,

336
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,920
Robin of Hoffman.

337
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,580
He will come.

338
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,600
He will come to us right now, yet not.

339
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,780
It's Robin of Hoffman in the hills of the East Village

340
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,160
collecting his men.

341
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,240
Yes, mistress.

342
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,800
It's Tompkins Square Warriors.

343
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,440
Yeah, the electric park.

344
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,280
I love that place.

345
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,100
Do you know the building where I finally got a room

346
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,080
for myself in this town?

347
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,880
I finally got a room in a very nice apartment.

348
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,240
You've been over to the place.

349
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,020
It's right at the corner of...

350
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,540
Oh, and...

351
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,900
It's a great place, man.

352
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,100
I'm living right next door.

353
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:11,960
I'm living right next door to the...

354
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,180
Why did you get one of those?

355
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,720
You watch out, Peter.

356
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,080
One day you'll get a place in Manhattan

357
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,980
that'll even be worse.

358
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,640
That's right.

359
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,280
Because those New Jersey places are not so hot.

360
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,540
They are though during the summer.

361
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,600
They're incredibly hot.

362
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,100
Very hot.

363
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,780
Yeah, I lived in Garbage Heights, right at the corner of Hell and...

364
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:29,640
Oh...

365
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,160
Near...

366
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,300
During Reconstruction.

367
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:33,820
That's right.

368
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,640
Joined the gun club out there.

369
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,380
Oh, you did?

370
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,560
Get your head down, you fool!

371
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,880
Look, there's the postman over there with the grenade launcher.

372
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,260
Where? Over the keep town!

373
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,660
Where's registration?

374
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,420
Over there by that copse.

375
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,860
That corpse? Copse!

376
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,140
Right there where that column of smoke is rising.

377
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,400
Keep your head down!

378
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,460
Just crawl on over there.

379
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,060
Oh!

380
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,720
But it really gets noisy on election day.

381
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,720
I'll tell you for sure.

382
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,200
Then they bring out the white soldiers.

383
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,760
All the time we see nothing but the red men come out.

384
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,480
The red soldiers.

385
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,340
I say, bring on the white soldiers.

386
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,680
No, not ready for them to move.

387
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,480
You're just a pawn.

388
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,860
Well, don't talk to a rook that way.

389
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,900
It's a rook. Society's rook.

390
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,560
Right, right. King Scam.

391
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,960
Right to Queen Shock Four.

392
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,300
Right to Queen Shock Four.

393
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,300
Queen Sleaze.

394
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,960
But the knight...

395
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,640
Dodo 12.

396
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,920
The knight is a Bonwit window dresser.

397
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,140
Tries to create sex heaven in those windows, night after night.

398
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,880
Oh, yeah.

399
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,760
That being him.

400
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,340
It's a great show, though.

401
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,000
It's a great city. It's a great place to live.

402
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,300
The Firesign Theatre from the collection

403
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,880
Dope Humor of the Seventies.

404
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,760
And now from the Dobstown Mirror.

405
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,440
We're back.

406
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,880
With lovely background music by Cybercharm.

407
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,900
Truth outweighs fact.

408
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,620
Look hard at the face of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

409
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,340
Keep staring until one of you blinks.

410
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,540
Whispering voices inside.

411
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,980
What musicians do you like who are also in your religion?

412
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,320
And what musicians do you like who are not?

413
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,440
Why aren't they playing?

414
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,440


415
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,440


416
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,440


417
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,440


418
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,440


419
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,440


420
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:29,440


421
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,180
All in or all out?

422
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,480
Aren't beliefs and preferences supposed to be the same thing?

423
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:42,580
Maybe to some believers, beliefs and preferences are supposed to be the same thing.

424
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,420
In the Church of the Subgenius, we say,

425
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,860
Believe me out of it.

426
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,160
Once you've paid your money to Bob,

427
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,660
we actively don't care what you do or believe.

428
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,160
Many are never ready for that freedom of choice.

429
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,420
But I'm an atheist.

430
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,080
Okay, we get it. You too.

431
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,240
Are you ready to be the kind of free thinker who thinks freely?

432
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,100
Or are only the approved heresies going to cross your teeth?

433
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,160
When you join the Church of the Subgenius,

434
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,360
two things happen.

435
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,560
First, everything you like becomes part of your clench.

436
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,640
As a moral good,

437
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,000
an aesthetic treasure,

438
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,740
and a self-consistent spiritual truth system.

439
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,140
Second, everything you do is a part of your clench.

440
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,140


441
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,140


442
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,140


443
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:27,140


444
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,040
And what you don't like becomes bad and evil,

445
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,680
and is a false prophet to be cast out.

446
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,580
Who wouldn't want that kind of slack?

447
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,360
And, oh yes,

448
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,840
you do get to ride on a flying saucer

449
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,560
to leave Earth forever

450
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,140
on July 5th, 1998.

451
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,680
Praise Bob and thanks to the Dobbs Docktown Mirrort.

452
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,320
And now this, from the Subgenius movie,

453
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,520
J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius.

454
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,100
By Sandy Boone.

455
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,300
Here's Paul Mavridis.

456
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,360
We actually are a religion.

457
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,900
You know,

458
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,900
that seems like an art piece,

459
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,420
that seems like a religion,

460
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,320
that seems like performance art,

461
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,680
that seems like a joke,

462
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,180
that seems like a religion.

463
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,180
Simply because we're involved in something

464
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,200
that is funny,

465
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,740
we don't believe that for that reason

466
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,060
we should be taken any less seriously.

467
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,060
We started getting invited

468
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,760
to things like art museums.

469
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,320
They thought it was performance art.

470
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,260
Ivan Stang was approached

471
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,220
by a fellow in San Francisco

472
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,700
who wanted to put on a subgenius party

473
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,800
in San Francisco.

474
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,220
And so we pictured some storefront

475
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,740
or a loft or something

476
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,360
with a hundred people.

477
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,060
And we went, yeah, we'll do that.

478
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,260
And we came back to the second meeting

479
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,580
and Tom was all excited.

480
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,060
He had gone out and rented

481
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,400
a theater for two nights.

482
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,880
San Francisco tonight is the location

483
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,160
of the first international

484
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,320
subgenius world survival crusade.

485
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,520
TV stations picked up on the show.

486
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,460
It all began with the book

487
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,440
of the subgenius

488
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,980
and the church's deity, Bob Dobbs.

489
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,580
I was preparing tacos

490
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,860
one day for my children.

491
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:15,360
And...

492
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,020
Now Bob.

493
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,580
The face appeared and it's Bob.

494
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,200
The night of Slack Show in San Francisco

495
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,140
in 1984 was

496
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,160
the first time anybody

497
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,720
had put any money into a subgenius show.

498
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,000
And flew several people

499
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,040
from Dallas and other cities

500
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,680
into San Francisco.

501
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,240
And there was even

502
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,300
a paid stage manager.

503
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,660
There were people building sets

504
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,340
just for that show.

505
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,980
About half the people here

506
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,880
will have a great time.

507
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,120
The rest of them will probably run for the exits.

508
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,260
The one thing none of us were at that point

509
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,940
and still aren't are professionals.

510
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,000
And I knew that

511
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,860
nobody had ever been in front of an audience

512
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,360
as big as the one

513
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,000
we were hopefully going to draw.

514
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,960
I remember Friday night going out

515
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,840
around the corner of the Victoria Theatre

516
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,500
and the line went out up to Mission

517
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,800
and around the corner I almost threw up

518
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,660
because I thought, we're not showmen.

519
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,860
These people are paying $7.50.

520
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,220
It looked like it was going to be a disaster.

521
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,600
As people were coming in

522
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,720
we had a galvanized

523
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,740
tub of evil looking

524
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:23,800
Kool-Aid.

525
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,400
Some people would come over

526
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,600
and they would take it eagerly

527
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,860
the Dixie cups just like they did in Jonestown

528
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,080
and they would drink it and they would come over

529
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,960
and say, how long till I get off?

530
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,940
And they thought it was like Kool-Aid.

531
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,540
Acid Kool-Aid.

532
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,240
And it was like, oh about 20 minutes.

533
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,220
Of course some people were very nervous.

534
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,200
The real question was

535
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,100
is this cyanide

536
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,900
or LSD?

537
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,060
We made sure it was

538
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,040
non-sweetened

539
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,080
so we wouldn't kill any diabetics.

540
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,400
It was great.

541
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,660
It was really the first event

542
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,980
where a lot of people

543
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,420
got together and said, hey we're all subgeniuses

544
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,920
and rubbing elbows.

545
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,660
The Night of Slack

546
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,240
ran for two nights and was

547
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,260
surprisingly successful.

548
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,560
It was the first

549
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,740
show that Bob Dobbs

550
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,040
himself ever showed up at.

551
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,880
We were not expecting that at all.

552
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,140
He walked out on stage

553
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,760
and puzzling evidence

554
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,540
Doug Wellman runs out and

555
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,640
shoots him with a handgun.

556
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,900
Right in front of everybody.

557
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,980
Oh my god, Bob was killed

558
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,120
that night. It was so sad.

559
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,120
We were coming from the airport

560
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,540
and I got to thinking

561
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,740
if you want to sell a religion, you have to kill the deity.

562
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,620
That's how you do it.

563
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,940
So I shot Bob thinking the thing would just take off.

564
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,780
The audience

565
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,560
went berserk.

566
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,640
But the funny thing was, the cops didn't

567
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,180
care. Nobody cared.

568
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,040
Afterwards, people were having drinks.

569
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,360
The band was dancing on the

570
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,880
corpse of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

571
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,540
It was this chance to just

572
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,260
sing and dance

573
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,220
and be crazy.

574
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,640
It was really, really, really, really fun.

575
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,320
Science

576
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,400
does not remove the terror of the gods.

577
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,620
We can't do much

578
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,320
about those evil gods

579
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,300
from the other side

580
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,440
of the cosmos. But enough of this.

581
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,240
You don't want to hear about this.

582
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,460
Who is the right hand man of Bob?

583
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,340
Who sits on the right hand side

584
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,220
of Bob? None other

585
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,260
than the Reverend

586
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,400
Ivan Stang!

587
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,480
I'm not here to talk

588
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,960
about the bleeding head

589
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,060
of Arne Palmer.

590
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,240
One of the things

591
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,200
that we

592
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,820
like to talk about was how the

593
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,140
Church of the Subgenius would allow you to control

594
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,420
your own time.

595
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,500
Now, do we have the house lights up a little bit?

596
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,460
We decided to have our producer

597
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,240
be our plant

598
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,280
in the audience. There's a main doctrine

599
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,000
of the church called time control.

600
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,320
Many people don't know it. Would you take a watch?

601
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,820
We can't control it.

602
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,300
It's a nice watch.

603
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,020
There it is.

604
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:51,760
All right.

605
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:52,920
Bring it!

606
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,580
And then before

607
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
he presumably could be

608
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,240
stopped, Ivan put the watch

609
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,180
down on the concrete block and

610
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,320
not just smashed the watch

611
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,020
but broke the concrete block

612
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,820
into pieces.

613
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,720
You've got me really to kill everything in your previous life.

614
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,720
And then

615
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,260
what happened was the unexpected.

616
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,820
We were going to move on to the next thing.

617
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,800
But people in the audience

618
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,360
suddenly ran up

619
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,200
to us and started taking their

620
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,620
watches off and throwing them on stage.

621
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,460
Some of them were really nice watches.

622
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,380
But the audience demanded

623
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,940
that we smash them.

624
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,380
Doug had us sit up

625
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,380
there smashing one after another.

626
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,220
So,

627
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,020
there it was.

628
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,100
The audience was ready to take it

629
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,660
way beyond what we were doing.

630
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,000
I thought,

631
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,380
this thing goes farther

632
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,540
than I ever imagined.

633
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,640
We had to run

634
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,480
for the exits, but only in order

635
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,340
to get you this report on time tonight.

636
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,140
However, if you're the kind of person

637
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,280
who likes to pull the wool over your own eyes,

638
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,100
church is in session again tomorrow

639
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,020
at 8 p.m.

640
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,220
That was great. Cheaper. Better.

641
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,300
When I was

642
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:38,160
thinking about what happened,

643
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,060
I thought,

644
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,060


645
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,060


646
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,300
But I was wrong.

647
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,300


648
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,300


649
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,300


650
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,300


651
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,300


652
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,300


653
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,300


654
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,300


655
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,300


656
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:59,540
In the end,

657
00:25:59,540 --> 00:25:59,560
mitt прям

658
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,460
during the

659
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,060
拉 divorce's

660
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,120
ride across the

661
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,300
Genau.

662
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,760
Or $5.

663
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,120
All wishes cost you the same amount.

664
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,680
Wish away those tightly clutched bad memories.

665
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,100
There is not a reason to be stingy or modest with your wishes.

666
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,500
Don't be wishy-washy.

667
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,480
Thank you, Dobbs.town Mirror.

668
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,000
And now this.

669
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,980
Time Intersection.

670
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,220
As prophesied in the precepts,

671
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,760
could be tomorrow?

672
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,820
Are you ready?

673
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,040
Could it be Saturday night?

674
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,260
Are you ready?

675
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,240
All right.

676
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:16,280
Emperor Stingy took out his wallet and decided to end it or begin it all.

677
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,760
It could just be another stupid subgenius revival.

678
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,700
Or it could be the Time Intersection.

679
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,340
Or it could be a bunch of puteras with a hair all full of, like, these weird little jelly beans and things like that.

680
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,040
The Data Men and the Thumb People will come together.

681
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,780
As some of them are just.

682
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,580
Under Charlotte and Bob.

683
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,400
For Bob.

684
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:58,200
Well, my friends, for years now, Reverend One Encantabyte has been kind of a co-writer of a lot of my rants.

685
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:04,000
And he's co-written his own rants with himself many times.

686
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,520
But here's a new guy who's thrown out one-liners at an incredible pitch.

687
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,080
He's done this before.

688
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:24,000
He just sent me another big list of one-liners that I guess, if one took the time, could turn all of these into one big rant.

689
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
If you used connective tissue.

690
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,160
Uh...

691
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,280
Hmm.

692
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,740
For instance.

693
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:39,580
Even the book of the subgenius describes Bob as a short-duration personal savior.

694
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,340
You might say he's the wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am of gods.

695
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,260
But what is a subgenius?

696
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,180
A subgenius is someone who says yes to a job now and learns how to do it later.

697
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,260
You may be dumb, but at least you're subgenius.

698
00:28:59,260 --> 00:28:59,260


699
00:28:59,260 --> 00:28:59,260


700
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,100
You're smart about it.

701
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,580
There are no fools among you.

702
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,740
You are among the fools.

703
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,280
If I had a dollar for every time I heard someone say...

704
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,880
If I had a dollar for every time I heard someone say...

705
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,080
I'd have just made myself another dollar.

706
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,220
But money is dirty.

707
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,380
So let Bob use his dust-buster on your wallet.

708
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,760
Now remember, when invoking the name of Bob in the written word,

709
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,460
you must never forget the quotes around his name,

710
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,020
which differentiate him from all of the ordinary Bobs of the world.

711
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,160
And when invoking the name of Bob in the spoken word,

712
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,700
you must at least mentally infer them.

713
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,000
Also never use smart quotes, for Bob only speaks in dumb quotes.

714
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,180
Perception of the truth is more important than the truth.

715
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,740
True or false.

716
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,900
Now I only believe in two things.

717
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,360
Bob and the fact that he doesn't exist.

718
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:09,140
But don't you know that all things weird are part of the conspiracy?

719
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,460
It's them trying to out-weird us.

720
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,300
It's them trying to out-weird us.

721
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,160
We're getting out-weirded when we should be getting weirded out!

722
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:16,700
We're getting out-weirded when we should be getting weirded out!

723
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,460
And you know if you say the word weird enough times,

724
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:20,800
And you know if you say the word weird enough times,

725
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,740
over and over again,

726
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,100
it starts to sound weeeird.

727
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:25,600


728
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:35,540
thank you reverend Elvis Martini and cyber chump for the music in the background

729
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:45,680
and now this this being Dr. Hal Robbins guesting on the old tv show conspiracy zone

730
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,760
with host Kevin Nealon

731
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,340
more zone we're talking about secret societies and I'd like to introduce a material witness

732
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:04,060
he's the master keeper of church secrets for the church of subgenius say hey to Hal Robbins

733
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:16,400
yes you can see the church of the subgenius isn't all that secret because

734
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,380
many of them are clearly in the audience

735
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:18,740
you can see the church of the subgenius isn't all that secret because many of them are clearly in the audience

736
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,480
well how does your church view these other secret societies how

737
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:29,640
it's all really the same conspiracy according to us we call it the conspiracy or the con for short

738
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,940
oh I see I see what are your reactions to our panel here

739
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,560
well I found it interesting any discussion of masonry is interesting

740
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:45,180
it's not generally known that Buzz Aldrin of Apollo 11 actually brought a masonic flag to the moon

741
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,160
yeah he did a ritual yeah

742
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,740
well I don't know if he did a ritual

743
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,640
he did he did a ritual

744
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:56,860
but that happened so why didn't we see the flag well they decided it might scare people or confuse them somewhat like this show

745
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:16,540
well you know you you are subgenius yes I'm one of them how many people in your church well it's not generally known because they tend not to be joiners and they don't usually get together except on special occasions

746
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,620
and how often do you get together on special occasions

747
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,180
well every now and then we have devivals as we call them

748
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,720
devivals

749
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,200
we perform healings and sickenings and other things like that

750
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,620
pretty successful with that

751
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,340
oh yes we sicken a great number of people

752
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,340
you sicken me

753
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,480
well it may be contagious I hope

754
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,780
do you guys wear hats at all

755
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,480
oh we have all kinds of headgear that we wear

756
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,100
okay

757
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,660
you mean when you say headgear you're talking about like

758
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,620
well the first one is headgear

759
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:48,620


760
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:55,500
A fez which the Masons and the Shriners like and pointy hats that we have we have hats of all geometrical shapes

761
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,360
you're the master keeper of the church

762
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,040
the master of church secrets they call me

763
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,200
yeah

764
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:07,820
people tend to lose them they get misplaced and so I gather them up

765
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,580
it sounds very disorganized your whole organization

766
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,340
well it is disorganized

767
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:17,700
you see since subgenius is each sub genius is under his own genius

768
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,620
under his own genius

769
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:18,620


770
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,420
spirit and not under the control of somebody else. The idea is that the con, the conspiracy,

771
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:32,160
wants to take away your slack. The subgenius must have slack. And it wants to sell you false slack.

772
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:38,020
It wants to make you work for a living. It wants to make you do what they want. And slack is the

773
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:42,700
opposite of tension. It's leisure, the basis of culture. It's the time, the slack time, in which

774
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,860
everything important in your life is done. And that's what the con wants to take from you.

775
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:55,020
And now more from Reverend Elvis Martini's little collection of rant bits.

776
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:03,700
They say you should live life like you're going to die tomorrow. But I prefer to live life like

777
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:09,880
I'm never going to die. I personally, friends, say why not both? And then he comes along and

778
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:16,140
basically says that too. Live life like you're never going to die, but also as if you could

779
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,620
easily be killed.

780
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:27,780
A nihilist, an existentialist, and an absurdist are having a conversation. The nihilist says,

781
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:37,260
life has no meaning. The existentialist says, life has no apparent meaning. The absurdist says,

782
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,860
apparent meaning has no life.

783
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,620
We firmly believe that procrastination is the only way to get things done.

784
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:56,740
That and radical centrism, where you believe only the most extreme nonsense from both sides.

785
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,960
Bob, frop, give me, for I have had a lack of sin.

786
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,320
One of the reasons I got the boot the first time around was that I was taking it all way too

787
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,620
seriously. For I was without slack. After all, the subgenius doesn't do anything. He's just a

788
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:18,900
fool.

789
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,940
The subgenius doesn't join in order to be lectured. The subgenius reluctantly hangs around in order to

790
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:29,740
be told that which she or he has already long suspected. That they are right!

791
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,380
Folks, I have a Bob bumper sticker on the back end of my car for two reasons.

792
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:47,060
Firstly, to serve as a reminder that sometimes people follow Bob a little too closely. The other

793
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,620
is so that for every person who follows Bob, he or she will be able to follow Bob. And that's why I'm

794
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:55,560
better than you. Because it doesn't matter whether or not that's actually true. The important thing

795
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:03,580
is that it's being said. There's a good reason that Bob is supposed to be a short-duration

796
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:08,100
personal savior. Anything longer than that, and it might all go straight to his head.

797
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:15,820
Because the moment you get Bob, you've got him wrong. It's like sin mixed with bullshit,

798
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,440
which is exactly what Zen is.

799
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:24,020
Funny thing is, there's wisdom in bullshit. There are smart ways to be dumb.

800
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:32,260
Thank you, Reverend Elvis Martini, for those bits and pieces of rants. Perhaps into one big rant.

801
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:40,560
And thanks to Cyberduck, uh, Cyberchump, for the music. I use Cyberduck for something else.

802
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:48,360
You see, the first subgenius, the first truly slack-filled man was J.R. Bob Dobbs. This is his

803
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,600
image.

804
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,600
I have a little image on my lapel here.

805
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,280
Yeah. And what's below that?

806
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:58,860
Oh, well, that's a little rocket that is a badge of the subgenius radio show that we do out, uh, in the hinterlands.

807
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,860
And what's right below that? Oh, that's tomato sauce. I'm sorry.

808
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,320
Either that or lint, I think.

809
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:10,540
How many lints? Well, you know, is it hard to get into a secret society? If I wanted to get into a secret society, how would I do it?

810
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,540
I'd just feel stupid for sending him 30 bucks.

811
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,220
You'd just want to run the right track.

812
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,480
You could go down to Langley and say, I want to join the CIA.

813
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,520
And they would probably...

814
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,600
I don't want to join the CIA. I want to go where I can get a hat.

815
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:24,260
Where you can get some slack, in other words.

816
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:24,840
Yeah, or some slack.

817
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:25,660
Yeah.

818
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,600
Well, you can join, but what you can't do immediately is get up into the upper echelons.

819
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,860
You can get into the winking, towel-snapping, back-slapping, little car-riding part.

820
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:43,540
But you can't get up into the part that is starting to interfere with the politics of nations.

821
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,620
Well, Mark, you're an expert on secret society.

822
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,520
I am not. I wouldn't call myself an expert.

823
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:53,920
You know, but I think that the best thing you can do is start your own secret society.

824
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:54,500
Yeah.

825
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,660
How do you know I haven't already? Huh?

826
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,760
How do you know I haven't already?

827
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,500
Because who would join it, man?

828
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,520
It's very, very secret.

829
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,880
Some people can keep a secret.

830
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,440
Yeah.

831
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,300
I'm the guy.

832
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,020
And you're right, the Freemasons would like me, because I can't keep a secret.

833
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,400
Okay.

834
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,440
One of the things that the Freemasons want is for what is hidden to be revealed.

835
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:11,720
Right.

836
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,820
And to that degree, this show is an agent of Freemasonry.

837
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,180
Yeah.

838
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,600
As well as subgenius, because we're getting...

839
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,960
We're getting all this propaganda out, too.

840
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,600
So you remember whether you like it or not.

841
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,060
All right.

842
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,760
Well, I don't want to be a slack, so I...

843
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,300
No, you do want slack.

844
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,060
I do want slack.

845
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:27,480
Okay.

846
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:27,920
I do.

847
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,200
Not my secret society.

848
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,160
We don't take no slack from nobody.

849
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,700
But we need money, so we're going to take a look at a commercial.

850
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,220
When we come back, we're going to take some questions from our audience.

851
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,060
Okay, friends.

852
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,840
We've talked about Eyelash,

853
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,080
the new book of subgenius...

854
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,400
Well, it's the first subgenius science fiction novel

855
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,460
by Reverend Nikolai Kingsley.

856
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,880
We've published science fiction before,

857
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,180
but it was always short stories and anthologies.

858
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,800
Lonesome Cowboy's Dave's Neighbor World

859
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,480
is a science fiction novel,

860
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,920
but it's not subgenius-centric.

861
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,800
Eyelash is, very much so.

862
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,200
In fact, here's a section where

863
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,020
this...

864
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,320
Okay.

865
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,500
Our two...

866
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:21,380
Our two main characters, Elif and Ty,

867
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,840
have been forced into working for an exist

868
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,700
in outer space,

869
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,940
doing a kind of a job,

870
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,400
and they're getting a bit depressed.

871
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,780
The exist name is Russ,

872
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,080
and this exist happens to

873
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,140
take the physical form of a beautiful Earth woman.

874
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,660
Russ...

875
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,840
To his surprise, Russ came to his aid.

876
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,560
He said,

877
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,620
Would you like me to tell you about Planet X?

878
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,500
Elif managed to conceal his glee

879
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,280
beneath a chintzy drape of low-level hostility

880
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,700
before asking himself

881
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,540
why she wanted to change the subject so readily.

882
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,840
I suppose so, he said,

883
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,620
wondering how much of it would be factual.

884
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,960
Tell me of your home world, asshole.

885
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,460
It's what you would call a gas giant.

886
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,820
No sun, mostly frozen methane.

887
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,860
We live in tunnels carved in the core.

888
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,600
If you could survive at that pressure and temperature,

889
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,140
you wouldn't see anything.

890
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,340
Very little free energy of any wavelength.

891
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,780
We prefer it that way.

892
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,640
It's much safer.

893
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,200
Terrible things happen on planets with too much activity.

894
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,200
Exquikes, storms, and the like.

895
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,560
Somewhere above, perhaps three levels up

896
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,340
near the surface of the eyelash,

897
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:48,260
a chort slammed into the generator wall,

898
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,400
making it shake,

899
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,600
metal shavings raining down

900
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,300
and striking sparks off the exposed cables on the way.

901
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,160
How the hell did life even begin under those conditions?

902
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,240
Elif asked.

903
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,060
Eerily, she says,

904
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,900
Oh, we got our start somewhere else.

905
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,220
It doesn't matter where.

906
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,560
It was destroyed long ago.

907
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,760
Well, sucks to lose your home planet.

908
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,040
I'm sorry, I guess.

909
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:12,800
Don't be.

910
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,240
We destroyed it ourselves.

911
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,440
In fact, we had it carved into slices and sold.

912
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,060
We've always been commercially astute

913
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,940
compared to the lesser races.

914
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,840
The lesser races, friends.

915
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,920
Elif was thinking of cold corridors

916
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,000
carved from methane ice,

917
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,160
completely black and silent,

918
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,700
with awful things dragging themselves

919
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,280
along the polished floors,

920
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,040
sneering soundlessly at each other as they passed,

921
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,900
thousands of miles of darkness above

922
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,860
pressing down endlessly.

923
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,420
Endlessly.

924
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,940
I'm not sure I like the idea of living there,

925
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,460
but we wouldn't be living on Planet X, would we?

926
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,640
Or in it, right?

927
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,380
Of course not.

928
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,720
We don't allow the lesser races anywhere near our homeworld.

929
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,840
And besides, I'm sure you've worked out by now

930
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,580
that the whole tribe going to the promised land thing

931
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,820
is an idea left over from the hundreds of thousands of years

932
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,540
that primates spent as nomads.

933
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,880
There was an uncomfortable pause

934
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,920
while Russ let this sink in.

935
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,540
And Elif tried in vain to put a positive spin on it.

936
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,440
Oh, don't look so worried.

937
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,280
We value the subgenii.

938
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,820
Life won't be so bad on the reservation.

939
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:36,260
There's always a use for a good set of prehensile monkey fingers,

940
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:41,680
even if they did evolve primarily for picking peanuts out of poop.

941
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,860
And that was from eyelashball.

942
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,220
I, Reverend Nikolai Kingsley,

943
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,600
published by Subgenius Foundation,

944
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,460
csubgenius.com or Amazon.

945
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,920
But we prefer...

946
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,080
Well, I signed the copies you buy from us

947
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,480
because I did the foreword.

948
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,080
The music in the background, by the way, is by Cyber Chump.

949
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,400
Their Moment of Perfect Happiness is the name of this double CD.

950
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,860
It's a great rug for reading,

951
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,060
and it's got some reading stuff in the background, don't you think?

952
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:19,520
Yeah.

953
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,560
And now this.

954
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,100
That was an amazing evening,

955
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,900
and also I met my first crazy subgenius.

956
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,220
This was the first person I ran into

957
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:38,200
who took it all the wrong way.

958
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,920
He came up to me after that second show, and he was livid.

959
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,440
The people in Dallas that did this thing!

960
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,000
And Bob!

961
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,360
When they find out you're just making a Sonny and Cher comedy show out of it,

962
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,600
they're gonna kill you!

963
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:51,680
This is terrible!

964
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,840
Look in this book here.

965
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,800
It says, stop what you're doing right now!

966
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,780
This is serious.

967
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,120
This is not a fan club.

968
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,140
This is not a joke.

969
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:01,720
And I said, dude, I wrote all that stuff.

970
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,680
Me and Philo got high one night, and we wrote all this crap.

971
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,460
Give me a break.

972
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,200
It really shook me up.

973
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,980
It was a little bit scary.

974
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,880
We realized some crazy people are attracted to this.

975
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,980
You know, the ones that are like, oh my God.

976
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,420
Where's Bob?

977
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,820
Where's, no, where's the real Bob?

978
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:28,920
I think what starts off like a joke, a few, you know, kind of believers who want their life to have a little more meaning than it does, or they feel it does.

979
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,480
And then they get a little too gung-ho.

980
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,680
They want to adhere a little too much.

981
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,880
They start believing a little too much.

982
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,700
And, you know, and then here we go.

983
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,100
You are playing with fire.

984
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,360
And the idea is,

985
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:52,360
of taking fire and doing what the subgenius did, which is setting off fireworks.

986
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:53,940
It's really beautiful.

987
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,140
It's really fun.

988
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:05,480
And every second of that, just a little bit of gasoline, and it'll tear your face off.

989
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:12,020
There are religions that were originally intended to be jokes.

990
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,560
And then they turned into gangs, you know.

991
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,660
And then they turned into mafias.

992
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:27,400
I'm here to offer you an opportunity to know the truth so that if you can connect with it, then you might survive.

993
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:40,260
It's kind of a horrifying moment when we realized that, you know, we could probably pick up 300 people randomly from anywhere who would pledge their lives to us if we asked them to.

994
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,020
Go, Chris!

995
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,540
I suspect that some of the people who are here today are not the same people.

996
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:45,540


997
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:51,320
I suspect that some of the people who call themselves subgenius were actually replacing their childhood religion with this.

998
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,460
And that wasn't my worldview, but when I saw people do that, it was a little scary.

999
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,560
I guess I was angry at everyone.

1000
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,800
I've been treated pretty shitty my entire life by folks.

1001
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,360
Their message appealed to me.

1002
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:15,520
The traditional exchange is that you take responsibility.

1003
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,500
You have to give them responsibility for it.

1004
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,820
They want you to tell them what to do.

1005
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,420
And this was the kind of power we didn't want.

1006
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:29,020
It was the exact opposite of what we were aiming for, which was to remove people from that kind of a hook.

1007
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:35,940
There are people who really want to join this cult and want it to be everything it says it is.

1008
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:41,140
And then when they find out that it's not anything it says it is, they get really mad.

1009
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,120
No talking laughing now!

1010
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:47,300
You've heard our phrase, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1011
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,640
This is important to us.

1012
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:57,420
Just when you think you might get a handle on, oh, it's a collaborative network of artists all over the country, that's all it is.

1013
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,180
Oh, no, that's not what it is.

1014
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,560
Oh, it's really a secretly sort of a subversive organization.

1015
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,020
No, no, it's not really that.

1016
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:07,620
It's just a bunch of drunk guys in Dallas trying to freak people out.

1017
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:10,020
You either got the joke or you didn't.

1018
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,940
And you got the joke instantly.

1019
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,380
Or you didn't.

1020
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:18,120
Occasionally people will call us out on that whole fuck them if they can't take a joke thing.

1021
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,260
It's like, well, that just excuses everything.

1022
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,960
No, it's just funny.

1023
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,040
When was the last time you gave a straight answer?

1024
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,900
Well, these are all...

1025
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,700
We don't care whether they get the joke or not.

1026
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,100
Half of them can't.

1027
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,900
We're trying to make you laugh, but also maybe shock you a little bit with our irreverence.

1028
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,100
And you may think it's funny, we hope you do.

1029
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,920
But if you don't, you shouldn't pun it.

1030
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,200
Because we are trying to deliver medicine of a sort.

1031
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:49,520
And if you can't take the joke, then please go fuck yourself.

1032
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:58,320
Nick Offerman was the master woodworker there from Sandy K. Boone's documentary,

1033
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,100
J.R. Bob Dobs and the Church of the Subgenius.

1034
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,140
Now streaming on everything except Netflix, apparently.

1035
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:10,420
Voices you heard in that segment include yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stack,

1036
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:15,340
Dr. Philo Drummond, Paul Mavridis, Richard Linklater,

1037
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:23,800
Reverend Penn Gillette, Dr. Hal, Reverend Kelly Cash, Dr. Legume, and Nurse Vicki.

1038
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,640
And others.

1039
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,360
You know, because that's where it's going to be in the future.

1040
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,560
The 420 will be 500.

1041
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,880
You know, I brought a banana, but I can't find it.

1042
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,660
I lost it somewhere, and I'm hungry now.

1043
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,400
The show is just...

1044
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,680
Going on and on, and my hunger is...

1045
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,180
One of the best things to do for your brain.

1046
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,100
Really?

1047
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,420
The show is, yeah. I know.

1048
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,340
If you listen to the show, you are smarter by 23.5%.

1049
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,040
I like to do good things for my brain.

1050
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,120
I like to give my brain a good massage.

1051
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,840
Do you? Are you a break thinker?

1052
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,420
One of those shiatsu massages.

1053
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,000
Just open up my skull.

1054
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,020
Yeah.

1055
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,860
And start kneading the gray matter.

1056
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:07,720
Uh-huh.

1057
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,160
Sort of a self-trepanation.

1058
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,760
Self-trepanator, right?

1059
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:11,960
Yeah.

1060
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,320
So...

1061
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,380
I don't use any fancy cutting tools.

1062
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:19,780
Yeah, none of those sharpened pieces of jade.

1063
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,620
I hear somebody's cell phone making that weird buzz.

1064
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:25,660
Yeah, you know who that is.

1065
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,100
That's my breathing.

1066
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:27,780
Hear it?

1067
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,520
That's my air tube.

1068
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:30,880
Oh, okay.

1069
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,140
That's the government listening to this show.

1070
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,660
And all the other shows on KPJ.

1071
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,980
Are you still in that iron lung?

1072
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,380
I've upgraded to the new brain.

1073
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,640
Plastic lung.

1074
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:42,700
Oh, okay.

1075
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,180
One of those new fangled things.

1076
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,160
Says Reverend Elvis Martini,

1077
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:52,740
a super subgenius would not be a super genius.

1078
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,340
It's the sub part that would be considered super.

1079
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:01,760
And what is super sub if not extraordinarily sub?

1080
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:07,180
Perhaps the term subpar genius would be more appropriate.

1081
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:16,020
Subgenii, it is known, have been far more likely, at least in the past, to suffer attacks

1082
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,080
from other subgeniuses than from pinks.

1083
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:25,040
Other subgenii at least think they know what it means to be a subgenius.

1084
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:30,620
A pink has no clue and therefore no dog in the fight.

1085
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:33,160
Jail Dobbs!

1086
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,740
Because it's only slightly less trendy to hate Bob than it is to love him.

1087
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,360
Bob loves Bob.

1088
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:40,820
He loves Bob.

1089
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:53,560
Bob relax, Bob.

1090
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:53,900
There is room out there for someone who thinks Bob loves Bob but is also

1091
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,360
shut up and is a bitcu foremost of what you did and needs to beん.

1092
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:57,760
B spot on.

1093
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,240
Having a look at Super Data科.

1094
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:58,240


1095
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:05,320
Best או a Так этот?

1096
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,980
that there is no meaning of life probably wants to steal something from you.

1097
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,580
Bob doesn't get clean.

1098
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,460
He accumulates dirt until it starts to sheen.

1099
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:24,960
Bob gets so filthy that the grime takes on the shape of slacks, a shirt, and a tie.

1100
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:32,860
The con, Reverend Elvis Martini says here,

1101
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:37,480
is the part of human nature that suggests you should go along with the ride

1102
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,120
no matter how evil or intellectually dishonest it may be.

1103
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:47,140
It tells everyone that you should go along because, because.

1104
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,580
The exes have been withholding aid to the earth for decades

1105
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:54,940
and have been doing it for years.

1106
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,880
in order to pressure the church into announcing

1107
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,860
that it's investigating a conflict of interest.

1108
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,840
Bob himself sells drilling equipment

1109
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:09,100
and every ex day is just a drill.

1110
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:10,840
No!

1111
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:20,500
And what else is here from Reverend Elvis Martini?

1112
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,560
You can't spell conspiracy

1113
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,980
without piracy.

1114
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,720
Bob do don't, and Bob don't do.

1115
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,140
I think this one's meant sarcastically.

1116
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,960
A true sign of intelligence and independent thinking

1117
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,580
is talking about how mindless and sheep-like everybody else is.

1118
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,580
It's the best way to let everyone know that you're not like anyone.

1119
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,640
Yep, that's right, those independent thinkers

1120
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,540
who all come to the church.

1121
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:56,860
I'm not gonna call everybody else sheeple

1122
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,400
while wearing the same hat.

1123
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:05,900
Thank you Elvis Martini for those random bits and pieces.

1124
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,760
Thank you cyber chump for excellent background music.

1125
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,760
Non distracting but very pleasant and trippy.

1126
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:18,600
And uh, and praise Bob.

info? Yeah, it's in there.

1152
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,800
It's written down.

1153
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,900
The lawyers swarm all over KPFA

1154
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,920
and try to close it down. Although that'll happen

1155
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,360
from inside Pacifica anyway.

1156
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,280
So you must listen to KPFA and find out

1157
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,920
more about all the crazy stuff

1158
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,500
that's going on.

1159
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,460
KPFA's going to need your help soon.

1160
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,760
That will be the last thing we'll worry about

1161
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,940
here. It'll be more like

1162
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,620
giant armed goons

1163
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:43,140
coming in with big

1164
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:45,460
giant

1165
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,160
pictures.

1166
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,260
Hairy cockroaches

1167
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,840
with spider limbs

1168
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,640
and hedge forks

1169
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,580
and big giant pictures.

1170
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,100
And they'll point at the pictures and say,

1171
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,220
see, now if you had a

1172
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,880
cockroach, you could do that too.

1173
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,180
But unfortunately, you're

1174
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,880
on the show

1175
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:06,260
instead.

1176
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:07,600
You are on the show.

1177
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:11,220
And this week, it's easy

1178
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,220
not to listen, right?

1179
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,320
Last week, she couldn't stop listening.

1180
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,020
No, no.

1181
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,040
She couldn't go to sleep.

1182
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,120
You could throw the show away tonight.

1183
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,680
Well, I didn't really want to be on the show.

1184
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,820
I don't blame you.

1185
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:26,060
I wanted to find out

1186
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,200
what that thing was that you were talking about.

1187
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:31,980
They always want

1188
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,680
something, friends.

1189
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,760
And we all

1190
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,520
want more time.

1191
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,840
Time on the show.

1192
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,240
Except she didn't.

1193
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,440
The show

1194
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,660
from KPFA Berkeley.

1195
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,240
The puzzling evidence

1196
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,640
and Dr. Howell. Normally Dr. Howell.

1197
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,100
Dr. Philo Drummond just then.

1198
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:52,400
You know,

1199
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:55,540
that show has been around longer than

1200
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,260
the subgenius radio ministry,

1201
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,660
Hour of Slack, which is what you're

1202
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:00,980
listening to right now.

1203
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,320
And

1204
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,320
friends, let's let this old

1205
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,640
soulful tearjerker song

1206
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,800
about weirdos take us out

1207
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,540
from our biggest

1208
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:14,060
weirdo radio heroes of all.

1209
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,960
The fire

1210
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:16,740
sign theater.

1211
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:19,580
Where's that

1212
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:20,540
Kleenex box?

1213
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,800
Hey, over there in the corner, one of our

1214
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,520
dearest old friends. Nick Danger.

1215
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:29,700
That's right, friends. Nick Danger and Silver

1216
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,860
Beatles with you tonight. Hi, everybody.

1217
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,660
That's right. My little lady.

1218
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:35,300
Girl.

1219
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,440
Danger.

1220
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,440
We have a song here we'd like to sing for you.

1221
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,440
My friends are

1222
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,700
all crazy. They're mad

1223
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:44,360
as loons.

1224
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,660
They talk all at once.

1225
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:49,160
It's a hundred tunes.

1226
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,300
You hear them

1227
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,180
at night as you push

1228
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:55,840
down the highway

1229
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,480
like loons

1230
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,080
landing at some exclusive loon

1231
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,700
flyway. And

1232
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,180
oh

1233
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:04,800
can

1234
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:06,800
it be

1235
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:07,580
true

1236
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:12,520
that there's

1237
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,100
no rest

1238
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,520
for the wicked.

1239
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:20,360
No peace for us

1240
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:20,760
too.

1241
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,300
Amazing what sounds you can get out of a banana.

1242
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,720
Now the

1243
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,920
laughers and screamers,

1244
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:29,920
their cross talk is incredible.

1245
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:31,940
It's all you can

1246
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,600
do to believe

1247
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,980
they're inedible.

1248
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,900
And policemen and doctors

1249
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,860
hover around the

1250
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,860
edges as they drag in

1251
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,780
new converts and make

1252
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:44,980
them sign pledges.

1253
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:45,940
And they're not going to be the same.

1254
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:46,440
Oh,

1255
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,660
can it be true

1256
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:56,300
that there's

1257
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,900
no rest

1258
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,240
for the wicked.

1259
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:01,540
No

1260
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,980
peace for us

1261
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:04,320
too.

1262
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:09,460
Now me

1263
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,120
and my sweetheart

1264
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,080
have tried to escape.

1265
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:15,280
We're secretly

1266
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,180
put down our thoughts on this tape.

1267
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,160
And we're sending it out

1268
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,580
to all we might hear.

1269
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,140
Don't you talk all at once

1270
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,340
so you'll wind up right here.

1271
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:29,980
And oh

1272
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:35,040
can it be true

1273
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,360
that there's no rest

1274
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,660
for the wicked.

1275
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,720
No peace for us too.

1276
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,260
There's no rest for us too.

1277
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,720
There's no peace for us too.

1278
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,180
All right, one more verse.

1279
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,620
A passage of loons to their home in the sky.

1280
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:01,700
Don't tempt me a bit to think I'll pass it right by.

1281
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:07,260
So listen up friends now, you heard my sad tune.

1282
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:12,100
Don't be tempted to talk all at once like a loon.

1283
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,860
And oh,

1284
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:14,340
oh,

1285
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:15,580
oh,

1286
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,660
can it be true

1287
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:26,440
that there's no rest for the wicked.

1288
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,600
There's no peace for us too.

1289
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:38,460
Y'all sound beautiful tonight.
